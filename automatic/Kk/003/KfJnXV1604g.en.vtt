people get confused because they come in

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.019 
people get confused because they come in
to<00:00:19.170> lifting<00:00:19.500> weights<00:00:19.710> thinking<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.699> squats

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
to lifting weights thinking that squats

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.359 
to lifting weights thinking that squats
are<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.539> simple<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.230> then<00:00:22.800> once<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.160> find

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
are really simple and then once I find

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.130 
are really simple and then once I find
out<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> variations<00:00:24.420> they<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:24.960> it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
out all the variations they think it's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.310 
out all the variations they think it's
extremely<00:00:25.560> complex<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.180> reality<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.080> just

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
extremely complex the reality is it just

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.960 
extremely complex the reality is it just
all<00:00:28.529> depends<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.070> your<00:00:29.250> goals<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.910> what

all depends on your goals and what

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.910 
all depends on your goals and what

you're trying to achieve now here you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.360 
you're trying to achieve now here you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
sitting back into the squat going to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.600 
sitting back into the squat going to
parallel<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> weight<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
parallel and going up with the weight I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.119 
parallel and going up with the weight I
do<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.910> suggest<00:00:45.180> using<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.870> heeled<00:00:46.140> shoe<00:00:46.500> doing

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
do not suggest using a heeled shoe doing

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.119 
do not suggest using a heeled shoe doing
this<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.460> suggest<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.120> flat<00:00:48.539> stable<00:00:49.260> shoe<00:00:49.530> also

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
this I suggest a flat stable shoe also

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.340 
this I suggest a flat stable shoe also
make<00:00:50.670> sure<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.149> use<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> power<00:00:51.750> lifting<00:00:52.110> belt

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
make sure you use a power lifting belt

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.380 
make sure you use a power lifting belt
because<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.190> put<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> strain<00:00:54.149> on

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
because this will put a lot of strain on

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
because this will put a lot of strain on
your<00:00:54.570> lower<00:00:54.629> back<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:56.010> need<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
your lower back and you need that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.279 
your lower back and you need that
intra-abdominal<00:00:56.820> pressure<00:00:57.449> from<00:00:57.840> taking<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
intra-abdominal pressure from taking a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
intra-abdominal pressure from taking a
deep<00:00:58.500> breath<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:59.340> get<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> most<00:00:59.879> weight<00:01:00.180> up

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
deep breath to get the most weight up

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.360 
deep breath to get the most weight up
now<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> benefits<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> doing<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> powerlifting

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
now the benefits of doing a powerlifting

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.549 
now the benefits of doing a powerlifting
squad<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> most<00:01:04.229> weight

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
squad is that you get the most weight

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.190 
squad is that you get the most weight
out<00:01:04.739> possible<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> beneficial

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
out possible so this is beneficial

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.890 
out possible so this is beneficial
obviously<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.070> power<00:01:08.340> lifters<00:01:08.790> however<00:01:09.570> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
obviously for power lifters however I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
obviously for power lifters however I
don't<00:01:10.380> think<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> best<00:01:11.790> squat

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
don't think that this is the best squat

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.450 
don't think that this is the best squat
form<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.600> train<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.220> really

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
form to train because this really

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.969 
form to train because this really
doesn't<00:01:14.909> work<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.270> legs<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.900> much<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
doesn't work your legs as much as you

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
doesn't work your legs as much as you
could<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.180> lower<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.960> taking

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
could because your lower back is taking

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.920 
could because your lower back is taking
a<00:01:19.530> majority<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.520> punishment<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
a majority of the punishment now the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.070 
a majority of the punishment now the
second<00:01:22.500> type<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> squat<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:24.090> full<00:01:24.450> Olympic

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
second type of squat is the full Olympic

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.830 
second type of squat is the full Olympic
squad<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.299> low<00:01:27.600> as

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
squad you see here I'm going as low as

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.289 
squad you see here I'm going as low as
possible<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:29.220> don't<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.610> need<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> use<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
possible you don't really need to use a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.390 
possible you don't really need to use a
belt<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.170> your<00:01:31.320> lower<00:01:31.560> back<00:01:31.799> won't<00:01:32.130> be

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
belt because your lower back won't be

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.770 
belt because your lower back won't be
strained<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.970> much<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.720> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
strained that much you really want to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140 
strained that much you really want to
keep<00:01:33.900> an<00:01:34.079> upright<00:01:34.560> position<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:36.000> all

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
keep an upright position so really all

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
keep an upright position so really all
you'll<00:01:36.570> feel<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.470> your<00:01:37.710> legs<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.990 
are in fact an Olympic weightlifter if
you're<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.049> an<00:01:55.229> athlete<00:01:55.680> chances<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:56.759> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you're just an athlete chances are you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.280 
you're just an athlete chances are you
won't<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.329> able<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> hit<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.899> bottom

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
won't be able to hit that bottom

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.830 
won't be able to hit that bottom
position<00:01:58.439> comfortably<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.689> not

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
position comfortably and it's just not

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.289 
position comfortably and it's just not
really<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> necessity<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.729> also<00:02:03.060> will

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
really a necessity because you also will

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.050 
really a necessity because you also will
use<00:02:03.600> less<00:02:03.930> weight<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.829> low<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.850> last

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
use less weight going this low the last

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.670 
use less weight going this low the last
type<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> squat<00:02:06.630> I'll<00:02:06.780> show<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
type of squat I'll show you is the one I

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.339 
type of squat I'll show you is the one I
suggest<00:02:08.300> now<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.660> kind<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.080> hybrid

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
suggest now this is kind of a hybrid

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.020 
suggest now this is kind of a hybrid
between<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.069> two

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
between the two

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.570 
between the two
the<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> high<00:02:13.230> bar<00:02:13.530> squat<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.430> you're

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
the it is a high bar squat but you're

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.540 
the it is a high bar squat but you're
not<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.420> low<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.250> full

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
not going as low as you are in a full

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.330 
not going as low as you are in a full
Olympic<00:02:18.030> squat<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.410> use<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> belt<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
Olympic squat and you can use a belt and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.040 
Olympic squat and you can use a belt and
you're<00:02:20.460> leaning<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.970> little<00:02:21.000> bit<00:02:21.390> more<00:02:21.750> forward

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
you're leaning a little bit more forward

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.980 
you're leaning a little bit more forward
than<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.500> would<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.980> typical<00:02:23.630> 80g<00:02:24.630> squat

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
than you would in a typical 80g squat

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.840 
than you would in a typical 80g squat
now<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.920> will<00:02:26.100> do<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.370> will<00:02:26.640> allow

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
now what this will do is this will allow

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.070 
now what this will do is this will allow
you<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.420> best<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.870> both<00:02:28.050> worlds

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
you to get the best of both worlds

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.500 
you to get the best of both worlds
because<00:02:28.740> you're<00:02:29.490> really<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:29.970> putting<00:02:30.180> an

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
because you're really not putting an

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.690 
because you're really not putting an
extreme<00:02:31.080> amount<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.560> pressure<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.250> your<00:02:32.459> lower

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
extreme amount of pressure on your lower

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.790 
extreme amount of pressure on your lower
back<00:02:32.880> your<00:02:33.630> legs<00:02:33.930> will<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.440> limiting

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
back your legs will be the limiting

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.550 
back your legs will be the limiting
factor<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.209> will<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.690> able<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.990> get<00:02:37.230> more

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
factor but you will be able to get more

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.070 
factor but you will be able to get more
weight<00:02:37.830> than<00:02:38.100> if<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.370> did<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.850> full<00:02:39.330> squat<00:02:39.810> so

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
weight than if you did a full squat so

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.380 
weight than if you did a full squat so
you'll<00:02:40.230> be<00:02:40.350> able<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> overload<00:02:41.700> that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
you'll be able to get that overload that

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.470 
you'll be able to get that overload that
you<00:02:42.540> need<00:02:42.750> with<00:02:43.020> really<00:02:43.500> heavy<00:02:43.740> weights

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
you need with really heavy weights

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.610 
you need with really heavy weights
studies<00:02:45.480> have<00:02:45.630> shown<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.080> get<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.410> same

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
studies have shown that you get the same

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.310 
studies have shown that you get the same
involvement<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.390> hamstrings<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
involvement of the hamstrings and the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.949 
involvement of the hamstrings and the
glutes<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.700> go<00:02:50.820> slightly<00:02:51.180> below<00:02:51.570> parallel

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
glutes if you go slightly below parallel

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.530 
glutes if you go slightly below parallel
as<00:02:52.380> if<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.830> go<00:02:53.010> all<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.670> way<00:02:53.700> down<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
as if you go all the way down to the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.420 
as if you go all the way down to the
ground<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.290> what<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.830> shows<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.400> that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
ground so what this really shows is that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.820 
ground so what this really shows is that
you<00:02:56.700> won't<00:02:56.970> be<00:02:57.120> missing<00:02:57.450> out<00:02:57.750> any<00:02:58.020> benefits<00:02:58.620> of

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
you won't be missing out any benefits of

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.580 
you won't be missing out any benefits of
a<00:02:59.730> full<00:02:59.970> squat<00:03:00.390> by<00:03:00.660> going<00:03:01.020> just<00:03:01.290> slightly

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
a full squat by going just slightly

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.430 
a full squat by going just slightly
below<00:03:02.100> parallel<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:03.540> you're<00:03:03.720> an<00:03:03.810> athlete<00:03:03.959> a

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
below parallel so if you're an athlete a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.080 
below parallel so if you're an athlete a
