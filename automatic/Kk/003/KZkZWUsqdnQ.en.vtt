00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
disguise itself as but well it kind of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.080 
disguise itself as but well it kind of
actually<00:01:17.400> works<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.939> situation

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
actually works out in that situation

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
actually works out in that situation
because<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> kill<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> Torterra<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.409> two<00:01:19.590> hits

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
could have gone in to resist it but I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.440 
could have gone in to resist it but I

like super fast I was like beta 100
than<00:04:27.630> speed<00:04:27.810> but<00:04:28.020> this<00:04:28.380> does<00:04:28.560> look<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.830> be<00:04:28.860> a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
than speed but this does look to be a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.520 
than speed but this does look to be a
defensive<00:04:29.370> one<00:04:29.520> with<00:04:29.670> lefties<00:04:30.090> coil<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:31.410> I'm
