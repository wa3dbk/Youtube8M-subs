00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
clever like this one we had to saw off

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.230 
clever like this one we had to saw off
the<00:02:27.740> right<00:02:28.100> branches<00:02:28.550> at<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.700> right<00:02:28.970> time

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
the right branches at the right time
