00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.189
 Hello guys 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.160
 Welcome to the channel. I am the 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.570
 android 2.0 I'm a raffia and in the video of 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.340
 I told you today a history 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.460
 very simple how to install android 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.050
 lollipop here on the ozone smartphone 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.730
 you first need to perform a 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.019
 backup of all your applications from the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.640
 your personal data so that you do not 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.350
 miss anything when installing the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.699
 update we will make a 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.860
 installation that is not expected to 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.769
 high installation of inflation over the air 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.190
 where you receive the files via wifi 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.570
 where you need to manually download the 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.220
 update and I'm actually going to show 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.080
 You are rohm nights ltda . 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.190
 12 year is his original street 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.229
 however for those who do not know what it is 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.689
 a night long island version sum up 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.850
 as a version just before the release 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.960
 beta is almost the alpha version in 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.239
 truth is a little before 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.840
 alpha version but these usually 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.850
 witches' versions of the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.590
 cyanogenmod which is the system that we 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.360
 we have them in the name here 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.650
 usually the light versions already 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.570
 have a very nice stability yet 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.960
 more here in the wide zone to learn that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.130
 already has by default the cyanogenmod rom 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.350
 then you make a make up of your 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.250
 applications of your personal data in the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.810
 your pc 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.180
 I recommend that you go in the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.730
 settings and there at the end 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.220
 we activate the option here is in that option 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.620
 developer the reboot option 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.120
 when you open the 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.720
 when we go here in the menu 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.270
 switch off the device here from the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.090
 resign it will show great option 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.720
 restart via software and option 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.430

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.479

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.130

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.230

 copying the files is that although your

 directly to it for the twr b which is the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.150
 I recommend that you use 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.220
 because he is more stable is very fast and 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.410
 very simple you use here in 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.449
 huambo los what are you going to do now too 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.799
 it is very simple that it is from the installation 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.630
 of these two files that we copy the 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.479
 ac proposed mars phone 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.729
 Let's wait there for twr and start now. 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.960
 We already started here the wr and do here 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.490
 in the aip option 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.310
 it will remember that the files of your 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.710
 smartphone cash and dalvik test it 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.660
 are it's configuration 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.330
 the smartphone in case they store 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.220
 walked sedated there are suits i observe 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.740
 Mars phone number of things such and 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.450
 so we will play the fly option 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.820
 Would you rather book a little more one? 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.610
 to make it better for you to see 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.580
 that the swype option of the reset factor 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.980
 Let's do it here it will start from there. 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.350
 The reset factor is what will erase 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.570
 all the files on your smartphone that 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.190
 all applications on your smartphone 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.660
 data they have 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.790
 however it will not delete files 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.380
 that you have a smartphone as an example 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.630
 your photos and videos will not be 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.550
 erased but I recommend I recommend 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.320
 that you make a backup so that the 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.720
 Do you have any problems with your smartphone? 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.010
 There is nothing wrong with that. 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.660
 on the device 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.720
 Let's go back here to start the 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:21.040
 option will have here is in the end the 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.270
 option without fear 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:29.140
 let's narrow this file down a bit 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.450
 option 12 will play here and go to 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.700
 black sui with flash 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.340
 It's best to make yourself feel better when you add 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.890
 plus a zip file that is already the file 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.440
 google apps 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:48.250
 now two files up here that are 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:56.680
 oo olé psi and that flash version there 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:06:00.730
 he will start there the Italian of 12 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.950
 take a little while there because it is 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:09.460
 a little bit has almost 300 megabytes 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:11.890

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.080
