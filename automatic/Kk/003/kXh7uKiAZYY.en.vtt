anything against co-chairing they've got

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.940 
anything against co-chairing they've got
it's<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.750> no<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.780> needed<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> support<00:00:37.440> like

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it's just no one needed to support like

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.819 
it's just no one needed to support like
I<00:00:38.300> stepped<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.360> from<00:00:39.420> curse<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.079> no<00:00:40.410> no<00:00:40.620> team

needed<00:00:41.040> support<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.120> mean<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
needed support so I mean this was the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.040 
needed support so I mean this was the
next<00:00:43.649> logical<00:00:43.800> step<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.399> me<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.360> you

because like everyone's really friends
already<00:02:28.560> before<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.099> moved<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> house

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
already before we moved in the house

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.789 
already before we moved in the house
like<00:02:29.790> they've<00:02:30.180> been<00:02:30.299> for<00:02:30.480> being<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.260> team<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:31.769> I

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
like they've been for being a team for I

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.120 
like they've been for being a team for I
think<00:02:31.890> maybe<00:02:32.849> three<00:02:33.239> years<00:02:33.540> already<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
think maybe three years already so you

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
think maybe three years already so you
know<00:02:35.220> coming<00:02:35.459> into<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:35.910> haven't

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
know coming into that and I haven't

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.280 
know coming into that and I haven't
really<00:02:36.299> changed<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> roster<00:02:36.989> except<00:02:37.170> for

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
really changed the roster except for

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.710 
really changed the roster except for
like<00:02:37.349> one<00:02:37.680> or<00:02:38.010> two<00:02:38.310> players<00:02:38.579> you<00:02:38.880> know<00:02:39.000> over

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
like one or two players you know over

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.509 
like one or two players you know over
that<00:02:39.840> whole<00:02:40.049> period<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.920> time<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:41.250> like<00:02:41.340> those

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
that whole period of time so like those

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.280 
that whole period of time so like those
are<00:02:41.670> guys<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:41.790> stuck<00:02:42.209> together<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.140> think

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
are guys like stuck together so I think

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
are guys like stuck together so I think
makes<00:02:43.530> for<00:02:43.709> pretty<00:02:43.950> easy<00:02:44.220> transition<00:02:44.790> to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
makes for pretty easy transition to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.030 
makes for pretty easy transition to
coach<00:02:45.930> those<00:02:46.140> guys<00:02:46.349> because<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.799> oh

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
coach those guys because it's like oh

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.379 
coach those guys because it's like oh
they<00:02:47.400> already<00:02:47.489> have<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> team<00:02:47.910> bonding<00:02:48.209> down

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
they already have the team bonding down

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.910 
they already have the team bonding down
so<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.079> it's<00:02:49.230> just<00:02:49.260> actually<00:02:49.620> like

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
so it's just it's just actually like

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.280 
so it's just it's just actually like
hammering<00:02:50.459> out<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.639> details<00:02:50.880> now<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:52.109> are<00:02:52.230> you

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290

trying<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.560> figure<00:02:52.739> out<00:02:52.859> anything<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.609> you

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
trying to figure out anything that you

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.979 
trying to figure out anything that you
know<00:02:53.940> they've<00:02:54.120> been<00:02:54.150> dizzy<00:02:54.510> they've<00:02:54.840> been

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
know they've been dizzy they've been

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.090 
know they've been dizzy they've been
together<00:02:55.109> doing<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.530> for<00:02:55.709> her<00:02:55.799> for<00:02:55.950> three

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
together doing this for her for three

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.979 
together doing this for her for three
years<00:02:56.280> like<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> said<00:02:56.730> what<00:02:57.329> are<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.569> adding

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
years like you said what are you adding

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.330 
years like you said what are you adding
that<00:02:58.139> that's<00:02:58.500> really<00:02:58.739> helping<00:02:59.040> them<00:02:59.190> move

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
that that's really helping them move

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.289 
that that's really helping them move
forward<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.790> they<00:02:59.850> haven't<00:03:00.000> done<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.239> the

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
forward that they haven't done in the

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.970 
forward that they haven't done in the
last<00:03:00.450> three<00:03:00.630> years<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:01.079> think<00:03:01.530> structure

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
last three years I think structure

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.500 
last three years I think structure
because<00:03:02.639> these<00:03:02.880> guys<00:03:03.060> were<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.480> know
