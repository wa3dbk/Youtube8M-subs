00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 click on the little text here so I 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.949

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.149
 so I click jean ping here I tick 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.430
 uses the editor 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.899
 here and from that moment I 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:57.480
 just have to write my text 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:01.140
 we shouted so clicked zoom photo.fr those 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.610
 no my site so this is once I 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.510
 write them I look at the level 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.960
 dimensions I do what I counted 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.960
 for video and I change the color 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.830
 so I can change the color 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.200
 here you have the color palette 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.060
 predefined so the white the gray white 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.619
 black green finally yellow green and has 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.939
 tried I see the purple red you 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.840
 do what you want after you 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.400
 can you hide a code if you have it 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.689
 identical here you can recover the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.630
 col will put us in if you 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.670
 recognize your code 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.380
 or then you settle here watching yourself 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.250
 the color that suits you best and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.149
 then we will remain validated white here 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.770
 so you saw as soon as I did 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.360
 to validate my text is good 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.219
 color 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.140
 no problem so after that you will have 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.579
 more than moving it so you have 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 chose the right font go if you 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:10.080
 have all the fonts so you take 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.790
 the one you want size you 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.800
 have seen that you can the county and the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.250
 reduce 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.590
 like that the color here justified and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.090
 that's it you use it only if you 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.239
 want to position your text in a 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.959
 well centered place for example 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.769
 the ai in the center of my width if I want 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.810
 that they sort left 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.959
 if I want them to be linked right 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.019
 that's okay and middle and here it's 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.019
 justified so it's not the case me I 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.569
 want to position it at the bottom right of 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:51.659
 my photo so here it is 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.870
 I take I close that I take that 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.459
 moving here is the click on it 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.030
 I'm fine on the case and that 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.760
 text move active layer a check 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.079
 whoever is not here they are well there and 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.480
 I take my text and I want places 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.069
 perfect it's good for me 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.590
 once you have position your 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.150
 text and boulay which is definitive 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.129
 Here you want it like that makes you 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.439
 right click flatten the image and so 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.790
 your text is part of the picture 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:35.129
 you just have to do files 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.480
 saved jump and that's it over 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.519
 so that's how to make a signature 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.530
 for a photo or a simple signature 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.849
