one blender file into another blender
file<00:00:14.059> so<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.450> gonna<00:00:15.570> start<00:00:15.870> off<00:00:16.020> by<00:00:16.080> opening

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
file so we're gonna start off by opening

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.609 
file so we're gonna start off by opening
a<00:00:16.859> new<00:00:17.010> blender<00:00:17.369> file<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.930> adding<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.109> monkey

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
a new blender file and adding a monkey

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.759 
a new blender file and adding a monkey
head<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> scene<00:00:20.930> make<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> few<00:00:22.230> changes<00:00:22.470> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
head to the scene make a few changes to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.910 
head to the scene make a few changes to
Suzanne<00:00:23.519> our<00:00:23.789> monkey<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:25.199> example<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.769> can

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
Suzanne our monkey for example we can

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.790 
Suzanne our monkey for example we can
change<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.400> color<00:00:26.960> maybe<00:00:27.960> adjust<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> eyes<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
monkey head into the new file

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.200 
monkey head into the new file
independently<00:01:13.409> from<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.679> old<00:01:13.950> file<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.610> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
independently from the old file and you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.149 
independently from the old file and you
could<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.539> do<00:01:16.140> whatever<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
could then do whatever you want with it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
could then do whatever you want with it
in<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.880> new<00:01:18.030> file<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:21.179> a<00:01:21.360> lot<00:01:21.539> of<00:01:21.569> cases

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
in your new file so in a lot of cases

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.289 
in your new file so in a lot of cases
you're<00:01:22.380> gonna<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> append<00:01:23.369> files<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.179> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you're gonna want to append files if you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.649 
you're gonna want to append files if you
want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.830> have<00:01:25.830> autonomy<00:01:26.670> over<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
want to have autonomy over it and and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.510 
want to have autonomy over it and and
not<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.619> any<00:01:28.770> link<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.539> original<00:01:30.630> file

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
not have any link to the original file

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.919 
not have any link to the original file
however<00:01:32.520> there's<00:01:32.970> another<00:01:33.030> option<00:01:33.450> which<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
however there's another option which is

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.410 
however there's another option which is
called<00:01:34.140> linking<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.850> important<00:01:36.330> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
called linking and it's important to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
called linking and it's important to
know<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.720> difference<00:01:37.080> between<00:01:37.310> appending

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
know the difference between appending

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.490 
know the difference between appending
and<00:01:38.490> linking<00:01:39.119> because<00:01:39.780> sometimes<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.380> might

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and linking because sometimes you might

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.320 
and linking because sometimes you might
want<00:01:40.709> to<00:01:40.770> link<00:01:41.039> instead<00:01:41.459> of<00:01:41.549> append<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:42.119> vice

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
want to link instead of append or vice

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.520 
want to link instead of append or vice
versa<00:01:42.859> so<00:01:43.859> click<00:01:44.579> file<00:01:44.969> link<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.159> then<00:01:47.329> object

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
versa so click file link and then object

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.399 
versa so click file link and then object
folder<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> select<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.789> monkey<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:52.140> time

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
folder and select the monkey this time

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.639 
folder and select the monkey this time
you<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.740> get<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.039> gizmo<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:55.049> object<00:01:55.469> has

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you don't get a gizmo and the object has

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.580 
you don't get a gizmo and the object has
a<00:01:55.679> blue<00:01:55.950> outline<00:01:56.490> around<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.109> so<00:01:58.109> have<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> look

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
a blue outline around it so have a look

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.429 
a blue outline around it so have a look
in<00:01:58.859> the<00:01:59.189> outline<00:01:59.700> window<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.359> notice<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
in the outline window and notice that

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.459 
in the outline window and notice that
the<00:02:01.619> monkey<00:02:01.979> has<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> different<00:02:02.609> icon<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> we

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the monkey has a different icon so we

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.099 
the monkey has a different icon so we
can't<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.979> very<00:02:05.219> much<00:02:05.340> two<00:02:05.850> linked<00:02:06.240> objects<00:02:06.960> in

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
can't do very much two linked objects in

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.080 
can't do very much two linked objects in
our<00:02:07.920> blender<00:02:08.399> scene<00:02:08.670> file<00:02:09.060> however<00:02:10.019> you<00:02:10.440> can

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
our blender scene file however you can

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.090 
our blender scene file however you can
move<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.390> change<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.900> object<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
move or change the object in the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.190 
move or change the object in the
original<00:02:14.250> scene<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.150> then<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.049> will

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
original scene and then it will

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.370 
original scene and then it will
automatically<00:02:16.769> update<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.060> new<00:02:18.209> one<00:02:18.380> or

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
automatically update in the new one or

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.990 
automatically update in the new one or
you<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:19.950> make<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.549> proxy<00:02:21.299> on<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.780> object<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.790> if

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you can make a proxy on the object so if

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.809 
you can make a proxy on the object so if
you've<00:02:24.150> links<00:02:24.600> an<00:02:25.560> object<00:02:26.040> from<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.459> file<00:02:26.790> to

linked image of the object the benefit

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.300 
linked image of the object the benefit
of<00:03:15.569> this<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.109> it<00:03:16.349> keeps<00:03:16.620> your<00:03:16.829> blender

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
of this is that it keeps your blender

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.780 
of this is that it keeps your blender
file<00:03:17.549> size<00:03:18.049> relatively<00:03:19.049> small<00:03:19.700> compared<00:03:20.700> to

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
file size relatively small compared to

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.209 
file size relatively small compared to
if<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.540> were<00:03:21.659> to<00:03:21.689> append<00:03:22.530> all<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.099> your

if you were to append all of your
objects<00:03:23.959> which<00:03:24.959> would<00:03:25.260> slow<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.530> down

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
objects which would slow it down

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.449 
objects which would slow it down
significantly<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:27.799> also<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.829> change<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.430> made

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
significantly and also a change is made

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.890 
significantly and also a change is made
to<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.849> original<00:03:30.030> file

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900

to the original file
are<00:03:31.409> automatically<00:03:32.129> updated<00:03:32.819> in<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.359> linked

are automatically updated in the linked
file<00:03:35.299> ok<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.359> if<00:03:36.599> we<00:03:36.750> save<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.230> linked<00:03:37.530> file

file ok so if we save the linked file
and<00:03:38.400> then<00:03:39.120> open<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.689> original<00:03:40.109> Monkey<00:03:40.469> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
and then open the original Monkey and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.030 
and then open the original Monkey and
make<00:03:41.189> a<00:03:41.219> few<00:03:41.489> changes<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.650> then<00:03:43.650> save<00:03:44.010> the

make a few changes and then save the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.780 
make a few changes and then save the
original<00:03:44.459> Monkey<00:03:45.169> open<00:03:46.169> the<00:03:46.290> linked<00:03:46.650> file<00:03:47.430> and

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
original Monkey open the linked file and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.699 
original Monkey open the linked file and
we'll<00:03:47.909> see<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.659> has<00:03:48.870> automatically

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
we'll see that it has automatically

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.819 
we'll see that it has automatically
updated<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:50.519> us<00:03:50.930> just<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.079> demonstrate<00:03:52.709> the

updated for us just to demonstrate the

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.149 
updated for us just to demonstrate the
process<00:03:54.049> you<00:03:55.049> must<00:03:55.260> keep<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.739> original

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
process you must keep the original

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.369 
process you must keep the original
monkey<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.699> the<00:03:56.819> same<00:03:57.090> folder<00:03:57.659> as<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.079> linked

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
monkey in the same folder as the linked

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.250 
monkey in the same folder as the linked
one<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.799> order<00:03:59.220> for<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.609> work<00:03:59.989> if<00:04:00.989> you

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
one in order for this to work if you

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.830 
one in order for this to work if you
move<00:04:01.500> or<00:04:01.919> delete<00:04:02.159> it<00:04:02.489> then<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.060> object<00:04:03.540> will

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
move or delete it then the object will

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.649 
move or delete it then the object will
be<00:04:04.680> missing<00:04:05.159> in<00:04:06.409> the<00:04:07.409> second<00:04:08.099> file<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.510> it's

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
be missing in the second file so it's

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.229 
be missing in the second file so it's
very<00:04:09.840> important<00:04:10.409> that<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:10.949> you<00:04:11.639> keep<00:04:12.000> the

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
very important that you you keep the

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.599 
very important that you you keep the
