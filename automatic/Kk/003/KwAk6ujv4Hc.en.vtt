00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
give it a little spray of color and see

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.250 
give it a little spray of color and see
if<00:02:55.210> we<00:02:55.330> can<00:02:55.420> get<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.720> come<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:58.080> it's<00:02:59.080> gonna

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
if we can get it to come out it's gonna

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.680 
if we can get it to come out it's gonna
heat<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.620> back<00:02:59.710> up<00:02:59.920> again<00:03:00.280> then<00:03:01.240> keep<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.600> a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
heat it back up again then keep it a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.260 
heat it back up again then keep it a
little<00:03:01.900> bit<00:03:02.110> farther<00:03:02.620> away<00:03:02.860> from<00:03:03.220> yellow<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
little bit farther away from yellow the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.100 
little bit farther away from yellow the
cran<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.810> already<00:03:05.050> have<00:03:05.410> melted<00:03:06.040> I

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
cran that you already have melted I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:29.360 
cran that you already have melted I
guess<00:03:08.110> I<00:03:08.260> should<00:03:08.440> turn<00:03:08.590> my<00:03:08.830> campus<00:03:09.310> oh<00:03:10.830> okay

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.009

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
all right well now we're going to turn

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.830 
all right well now we're going to turn
it<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.319> opposite<00:03:31.950> side<00:03:32.480> see<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:33.569> we<00:03:33.720> can

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
it to the opposite side see if we can

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:53.300 
it to the opposite side see if we can
get<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.050> same<00:03:34.319> effect<00:03:34.379> come<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.730> down

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.460 

now<00:03:53.880> I'm<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.240> place<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.480> little<00:03:54.959> bit<00:03:55.230> more

more<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.170> red<00:03:58.440> contrast<00:03:59.569> so<00:04:00.569> let's<00:04:00.810> see<00:04:01.230> and

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
more of a red contrast so let's see and

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.300 
more of a red contrast so let's see and
remember<00:04:02.220> once<00:04:02.700> again<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.600> don't<00:04:03.900> want<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.530> get

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
remember once again we don't want to get

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.770 
remember once again we don't want to get
the<00:04:05.430> heat<00:04:05.580> gun<00:04:05.790> close<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.240> this<00:04:06.360> because<00:04:06.630> these

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the heat gun close to this because these

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.930 
the heat gun close to this because these
are<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.140> neat<00:04:07.440> little<00:04:07.590> Dobbs<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.370> we

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
are really neat little Dobbs and we

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.590 
are really neat little Dobbs and we
don't<00:04:09.120> want<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.330> mess<00:04:09.420> them<00:04:09.630> up<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:12.150> we're

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
going to try to get it to where it won't

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.210 
going to try to get it to where it won't
melt<00:04:15.510> anything<00:04:15.959> but<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> cran<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:17.010> I<00:04:17.100> am
