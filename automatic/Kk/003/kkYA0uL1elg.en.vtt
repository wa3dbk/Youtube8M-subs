beginning<00:00:09.719> process<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.530> project<00:00:11.480> first

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
beginning process of a project first

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.879 
beginning process of a project first
I'll<00:00:12.690> meet<00:00:12.900> with<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> guy<00:00:13.290> then<00:00:13.530> we'll<00:00:13.650> sit

I'll meet with the guy then we'll sit
down<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.099> do<00:00:15.000> some<00:00:15.269> concept<00:00:16.170> ideas<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
down and do some concept ideas and

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.519 
down and do some concept ideas and
immediately<00:00:18.359> I'll<00:00:18.570> start<00:00:18.840> scribbling<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
immediately I'll start scribbling and

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.929 
immediately I'll start scribbling and
then<00:00:19.890> from<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.689> did<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.490> big<00:00:23.490> sketch

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
then from here and I did this big sketch

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.140 
then from here and I did this big sketch
and<00:00:24.359> then<00:00:24.869> I'll<00:00:25.320> morph<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.949> into<00:00:26.150> something

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and then I'll morph it into something

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.019 
and then I'll morph it into something
like<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.140> will<00:00:28.380> look<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:29.820> look

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
like this which will look how will look

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.209 
like this which will look how will look
these<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.449> wakeboards<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:32.040> going

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
these are wakeboards so what I was going

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.370 
these are wakeboards so what I was going
for<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.239> design<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.840> went<00:00:33.989> through<00:00:34.170> all

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
for is one design that went through all

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
for is one design that went through all
these<00:00:34.620> wakeboards<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.719> whole

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
these wakeboards and that's the whole

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.840 
these wakeboards and that's the whole
line<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.230> wakeboards<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:38.219> looking<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.489> us

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
line of wakeboards we're looking for us

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.780 
line of wakeboards we're looking for us
and<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.290> want<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
and they want to do this for like the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
and they want to do this for like the
in-store<00:00:42.329> displays<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.110> stuff<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.559> when<00:00:43.710> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
in-store displays and stuff so when you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.170 
in-store displays and stuff so when you
go<00:00:43.920> by<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.129> window<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
go by the window and you see all the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.900 
go by the window and you see all the
boards<00:00:45.480> lined<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.670> really

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
boards lined up and you know it's really

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.540 
boards lined up and you know it's really
just<00:00:48.379> another<00:00:49.379> cool<00:00:49.710> way<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.950> display<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
just another cool way to display the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
just another cool way to display the
board<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.079> kind<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> big<00:00:52.559> project

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
board so this is kind of a big project

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.029 
board so this is kind of a big project
and<00:00:53.960> what<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> did<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.320> here's<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> original

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and what I did is here's the original

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819 
and what I did is here's the original
painting<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> eight<00:00:58.530> foot<00:00:58.800> long

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
painting and this is eight foot long

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
painting and this is eight foot long
painting<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.609> everything<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.149> done<00:01:00.390> off<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
painting so everything was done off the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.729 
painting so everything was done off the
scale<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.270> photograph<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.320> then

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
scale and it is photograph and then

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
scale and it is photograph and then
manipulated<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> computer

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
manipulated a little bit the computer

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.630 
manipulated a little bit the computer
and<00:01:06.510> dropped<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> wakeboard<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.040> in

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and dropped in on the wakeboard and in

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.170 
and dropped in on the wakeboard and in
the<00:01:08.760> end<00:01:08.939> it'll<00:01:09.479> look<00:01:09.720> something<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.140> this

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
the end it'll look something like this

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.950 
the end it'll look something like this
there'll<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.450> bindings<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
there'll be some bindings on here and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.660 
there'll be some bindings on here and
findings<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.110> color<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.830> they're<00:01:17.580> going

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
findings will be color and they're going

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
findings will be color and they're going
to<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.820> some<00:01:18.000> variations<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> color<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
to be some variations of color in the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.679 
to be some variations of color in the
background<00:01:19.790> but<00:01:20.790> i'm<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.090> sure<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:21.509> that's

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
background but i'm not sure what that's

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
background but i'm not sure what that's
going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:23.009> kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.220> gives<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
going to be that kind of gives you the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.760 
going to be that kind of gives you the
idea<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> whole<00:01:24.630> process<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.670> sketch<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
idea of the whole process from sketch to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
idea of the whole process from sketch to
getting<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> product<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.479> doing

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
getting it on to the product to doing

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.590 
getting it on to the product to doing
the<00:01:31.290> actual<00:01:31.619> painting<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.909> actually<00:01:33.390> trying

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the actual painting to actually trying

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.140 
the actual painting to actually trying
to<00:01:33.689> place<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> pain<00:01:34.560> on

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
to place that pain on

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.220 
to place that pain on
to<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.020> actual<00:01:36.290> surface<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.780> much<00:01:38.990> goes

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
to the actual surface and so much goes

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.900 
to the actual surface and so much goes
into<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.800> mean<00:01:39.950> it's<00:01:40.070> not<00:01:40.100> like<00:01:40.220> just<00:01:40.670> I

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
into it I mean it's not like just I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.540 
into it I mean it's not like just I
paint<00:01:41.390> something<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:42.050> while<00:01:42.680> out<00:01:42.860> there<00:01:43.130> a

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
paint something and while out there a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.640 
paint something and while out there a
lot<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.090> thought<00:01:44.420> goes<00:01:44.450> into<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:45.020> stuff<00:01:45.350> and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
lot of thought goes into this stuff and

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.490 
lot of thought goes into this stuff and
every<00:01:46.040> project<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.900> has<00:01:47.900> some<00:01:48.200> kind<00:01:48.350> of

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
every project is a has some kind of

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.730 
every project is a has some kind of
back-end<00:01:50.050> manufacturing<00:01:51.050> kind<00:01:51.230> of<00:01:51.350> process

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
back-end manufacturing kind of process

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.240 
back-end manufacturing kind of process
it<00:01:51.950> has<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.250> go<00:01:52.400> into<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.760> as<00:01:52.850> well<00:01:53.980> it's<00:01:54.980> a<00:01:55.070> lot

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
it has to go into it as well it's a lot

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.190 
it has to go into it as well it's a lot
of<00:01:55.280> work<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.000> anytime<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:56.510> see<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.690> product<00:01:57.110> out

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
of work so anytime you see a product out

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.350 
of work so anytime you see a product out
on<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.470> world<00:01:57.730> somebody<00:01:58.730> work<00:01:58.880> really<00:01:59.120> hard

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
on the world somebody work really hard

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.900 
on the world somebody work really hard
on<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.930> not<00:02:00.530> just<00:02:00.740> hanging<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.190> designing

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
on it and not just hanging it designing

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:11.910 
on it and not just hanging it designing
