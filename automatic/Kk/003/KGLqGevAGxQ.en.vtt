should have pointed that out but my
mentality<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.390> reasoning<00:02:16.720> behind<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.110> is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
mentality and reasoning behind that is

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.410 
mentality and reasoning behind that is
pretty<00:02:17.710> simple<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.640> guys<00:02:18.760> remember<00:02:18.940> back

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
pretty simple if you guys remember back

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.900 
pretty simple if you guys remember back
at<00:02:19.690> call<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.260> community<00:02:20.770> right<00:02:21.040> not<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> one

at call the community right not the one

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.350 
at call the community right not the one
here<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.420> January<00:02:22.960> but<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.380> one<00:02:23.530> last<00:02:23.770> summer

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
here in January but the one last summer

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
here in January but the one last summer
basically<00:02:25.360> there<00:02:25.570> were<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.930> rules<00:02:26.140> I'm

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
basically there were the rules I'm

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.080 
basically there were the rules I'm
pretty<00:02:26.560> sure<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.740> was<00:02:26.860> like<00:02:26.950> MLG<00:02:27.580> rules<00:02:27.850> so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
pretty sure it was like MLG rules so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.850 
pretty sure it was like MLG rules so
they<00:02:28.210> had<00:02:28.390> rapid<00:02:28.750> fire<00:02:28.930> band<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.470> I'm<00:02:29.590> I'm

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
they had rapid fire band and I'm I'm

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.320 
they had rapid fire band and I'm I'm
pretty<00:02:30.190> sure<00:02:30.460> don't<00:02:30.610> quote<00:02:30.850> me<00:02:31.000> on<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.120> I'm

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
pretty sure don't quote me on this I'm

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.780 
pretty sure don't quote me on this I'm
pretty<00:02:31.510> sure<00:02:31.720> MLG<00:02:32.050> does<00:02:32.680> indeed<00:02:33.190> have<00:02:33.400> rapid

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
pretty sure MLG does indeed have rapid

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.730 
pretty sure MLG does indeed have rapid
fire<00:02:33.970> band<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:34.840> they<00:02:34.990> obviously<00:02:35.170> think<00:02:35.590> it's

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
fire band so they obviously think it's

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.110 
fire band so they obviously think it's
overpowered<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.280> I'm<00:02:36.430> not<00:02:36.580> crazy<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:37.000> that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
overpowered so I'm not crazy on that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.449 
overpowered so I'm not crazy on that
aspect<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.990> then<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.500> FAMAS<00:02:38.830> called<00:02:39.340> the

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
aspect and then the FAMAS called the

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.860 
aspect and then the FAMAS called the
community<00:02:39.850> had<00:02:40.030> their<00:02:40.150> own<00:02:40.209> little<00:02:40.360> special

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
community had their own little special

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.540 
community had their own little special
rule<00:02:41.020> last<00:02:41.260> summer<00:02:41.590> where<00:02:41.890> they<00:02:42.190> banned<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
rule last summer where they banned the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.740 
rule last summer where they banned the
FAMAS<00:02:42.790> because<00:02:43.060> they<00:02:43.180> knew<00:02:43.330> everyone<00:02:43.720> was

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
FAMAS because they knew everyone was
