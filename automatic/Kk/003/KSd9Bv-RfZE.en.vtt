 week from by samsung then 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.580

 in the developer options I'm going to 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.220
 activate usb debugging since I'm going to 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:39.430
 use or else to 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.830
 to do this update is a is 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.630
 an official lic can be said because 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.420
 comes from samsung's part are 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:52.449
 disabling this I turn off the equipment 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.449
 and we 're going to move on to the computer 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.240
 although here on the computer this 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.240
 I'm going to give you yet 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.210
 the filtered lic there I will leave you in 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.490
 the description of the video the link to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.870
 that come to this page and we are going to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.660
 download from any of these 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.830
 servers this the lic 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.830
 I chose mega 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.160
 because nothing else the only thing they are going to do 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.670
 is to download and this download the 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.280
 rom 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.890
 I already have it downloaded then 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.360
 this already here we are going him where 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.200
 download and wait for the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.740
 download and in this part of password go 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.920
 they are going to copy this 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.950
 this for this this password because the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.900
 they will need when 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.240
 when you are 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.290
 when they want to extract the file is 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.280
 warner bash is the password then 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.780
 once they have this 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.800
 downloaded into the file are going to go to 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.690
 your to your downloads in your 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.340
 in your downloads folder and they go to 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.650
 look for it 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:19.319
 the folder in this case is this 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:23.989
 what it says apn 7.100 xx web m 16 and you 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.989
 they will give extract extract all 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.190
 and there's the preference they can put it 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.250
 in which it is extracted on the desk 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.770
 I did not do so, they will not 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.410
 will give them a 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.410
 he's going to ask you 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.540
 a question where they have to copy the 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.069
 the password that I mentioned 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.959
 then already once extracted 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.579
 what they are going to do is that in this 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.700
 entries files when at the time that 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:02.829
 they extract comes comes within him the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.819
 film and the odin 3.0 not really then 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.500
 are going to run or with as 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.290
 administrator will give you right click 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.530
 and they run as administrator they say 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.569
 yes 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.569
 and in the team we are going to 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.579
 let's restart it on it 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.060
 two classrooms with the power on key and 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.400
 volume down 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.230
 at the same time 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.400
 once they are here they will give 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.400
 the volume button or up 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.250
 and there I would already be in double mode 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.940
 then in this part we no longer see 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.940
 connect in it 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.720

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.720
 usb 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.670
 and they wait for it to be recognized there as 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.750
 can see is already recognized in the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.990
 blue box 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.930
 that means that already what is already 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.530

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.720
