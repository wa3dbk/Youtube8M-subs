00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.620
 and subscribers today I would have to 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.380
 super interesting idea so to say idea 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.340
 why don't you and me play two 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.990
 guitars let's say the type of karaoke and I 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.960
 developed an interesting idea in this 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.170
 video lesson you see two screens on 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.260
 the screen on the left I play before and or bust 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.439
 on the screen to the right I play for example 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.689
 solo so to speak on the first string in what 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.780
 is my idea you probably know 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.630
 that very often guitarist lovers 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.380
 playing the device for 2 guitar one plays 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.960
 rhythm 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.930
 another solo and it happens that when 3 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.570
 another one plays bass and it turns out 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 mini guitar ensemble it's just 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.650

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.470
