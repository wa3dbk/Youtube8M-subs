 operating windows 7 and company then 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.509
 to increase this capacity 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.700
 increases the capacity 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.030
 sometimes there is a file here that is 20 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.579
 He will not show up because he will not 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.430
 is set pa you see the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.310
 20 giga file just below that then the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.159
 what do you do you go there is no button 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.460

 advanced system settings and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.450
 system protection so on my show 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.220
 backup and the main ones and what I 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.370
 I'll go and I 'll go here our main 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.349
 set up in would set're restores 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.569
 settings are older 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.640
 file which is precisely what I 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.790
 I'm talking there, you leave here it's like this. 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:30.300
 because it's the cei is the main one in mexico and 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.670
 increases here at 79 giga I can 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.190
 to recover a file using the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.989
 previous until 79 giga is until then I can 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.870
 to recover more than that, not if I 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.890
 want to increase just run going 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.830
 increasing 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.500
 understood now that I do applied 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.280
 here in my backup is a little different 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.519
 is to set the itaÃº are from the middle will remain 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.200
 only the previous version because the backup 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.220
 because it is not the operating system then 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.860
 It does not have to be because of settings 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.590
 Then it's just the middle and here I 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.030
 I already got 50 percent of the angels 32 giga 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.640
 I can recover from my backup that 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.129
 It's what's here in XIS here because I 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.379
 way up, there's little else here. 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.750
 I can recover up to 200 so much giga 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.870
 in that one question from above 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.120

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.940

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.580
 I was just working at home. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.340
 problem solved, that 's it 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.640
 show you here how to increase 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.680
 capacity of the restoration without 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.560
 restarting the machine is a very 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.900
 useful not to have to lose everything back 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.319
