00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
there and he goes down the master I just

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.729 
there and he goes down the master I just
might<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.510> that's<00:03:46.659> gonna<00:03:46.780> make<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.409> damage

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
might so that's gonna make the damage

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.250 
might so that's gonna make the damage
the<00:03:48.150> Academy<00:03:49.150> Army<00:03:49.389> is<00:03:49.450> putting<00:03:49.689> out<00:03:49.810> even

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
the Academy Army is putting out even

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.880 

so<00:03:57.000> they<00:03:57.209> take<00:03:57.360> forever<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:58.019> vitrify<00:03:58.170> really

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
so they take forever to vitrify really

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
but in terms of the modeling how many

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.300 
but in terms of the modeling how many
think<00:04:02.940> that's<00:04:03.120> some<00:04:03.360> more

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.430 

and<00:04:07.030> I'll<00:04:07.150> weep<00:04:07.330> on<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.600> mandroid<00:04:07.959> is<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.230> stop

our<00:04:43.640> deficit<00:04:44.180> Kev's<00:04:44.420> we<00:04:44.570> think<00:04:44.750> it's<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:45.110> very

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
our deficit Kev's we think it's a very

our deficit Kev's we think it's a very
powerful<00:04:45.620> television<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.870> it's<00:04:48.020> gonna<00:04:48.170> have

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
powerful television and it's gonna have

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.689 
powerful television and it's gonna have
them<00:04:48.440> now<00:04:48.560> faith<00:04:48.890> will<00:04:49.100> use<00:04:49.280> it<00:04:49.400> up<00:04:51.070> Jacques

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.870 

both<00:04:55.539> of<00:04:55.780> us<00:04:55.960> stand<00:04:56.289> sit

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.850 

devastated<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.539> garment<00:05:02.960> student<00:05:03.560> -

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
devastated of a garment student -

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.900 
devastated of a garment student -
impacts

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.790 

gremlins<00:05:11.910> takes<00:05:12.150> heavy<00:05:12.510> casualties

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.620 

so<00:05:16.310> those<00:05:16.460> Devils<00:05:16.789> got<00:05:16.940> one<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.180> them<00:05:17.330> fast

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
so those Devils got one of them fast

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.090 
so those Devils got one of them fast
this<00:05:20.630> is<00:05:20.810> interesting<00:05:21.140> as<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.650> goes<00:05:21.770> again

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
this is interesting as it goes again

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.000 
this is interesting as it goes again
really<00:05:22.400> uh<00:05:22.510> on<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.660> lower<00:05:23.840> end<00:05:24.050> stat-wise<00:05:24.680> but

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
really uh on the lower end stat-wise but

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.500 
really uh on the lower end stat-wise but
he<00:05:25.100> does<00:05:25.280> have<00:05:25.430> quite<00:05:25.670> a<00:05:25.730> few<00:05:25.820> gave<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.270> truth

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
he does have quite a few gave the truth

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.950 
he does have quite a few gave the truth
so<00:05:27.040> still<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:28.070> fairly<00:05:28.790> close<00:05:29.030> game<00:05:31.630> good<00:05:32.630> sharp

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
so still a fairly close game good sharp

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.860 
so still a fairly close game good sharp
so<00:05:33.140> i<00:05:33.260> can<00:05:33.410> never<00:05:33.530> pronounce<00:05:33.620> their<00:05:34.130> name

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870

and that hope that was succubus right
there<00:06:25.120> and<00:06:25.210> they've<00:06:25.390> yet<00:06:25.960> to<00:06:26.020> take<00:06:26.290> any<00:06:26.470> really

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
there and they've yet to take any really

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.130 
there and they've yet to take any really
meaningful<00:06:26.710> casualties<00:06:27.690> our<00:06:28.690> shovels<00:06:29.050> go

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
meaningful casualties our shovels go

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.070 
meaningful casualties our shovels go
down<00:06:29.380> and<00:06:29.710> this<00:06:30.100> is<00:06:30.280> looking<00:06:30.520> like<00:06:30.640> it's

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
down and this is looking like it's

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.570 
down and this is looking like it's
pretty<00:06:32.080> much<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:32.470> end<00:06:32.500> for<00:06:32.830> acid<00:06:33.130> all<00:06:33.280> he's

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
pretty much the end for acid all he's

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.380 
pretty much the end for acid all he's
got<00:06:33.730> left<00:06:33.760> is<00:06:34.120> really<00:06:35.100> that's<00:06:36.100> back<00:06:36.520> of<00:06:36.730> six

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
got left is really that's back of six

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.870 
got left is really that's back of six
pits<00:06:37.630> bones<00:06:37.900> and<00:06:38.500> I<00:06:38.890> really<00:06:39.280> don't<00:06:39.430> see<00:06:39.520> any<00:06:39.730> we

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
pits bones and I really don't see any we

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.140 
pits bones and I really don't see any we
can<00:06:40.090> overcome<00:06:41.080> these<00:06:42.010> odds<00:06:42.280> here<00:06:42.670> even<00:06:43.000> with

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
can overcome these odds here even with

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.020 
can overcome these odds here even with
van<00:06:43.360> prism<00:06:44.130> save<00:06:45.130> there's<00:06:45.340> how<00:06:45.490> he<00:06:45.550> a<00:06:45.670> shoe<00:06:45.790> so
