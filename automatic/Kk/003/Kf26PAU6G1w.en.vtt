00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
usually expect to get great photographs

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.530 
usually expect to get great photographs
but<00:01:35.950> today<00:01:36.250> a<00:01:36.280> cloud<00:01:36.700> layer<00:01:36.940> had<00:01:37.180> rolled<00:01:37.390> in

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
but today a cloud layer had rolled in

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.610 
but today a cloud layer had rolled in
and<00:01:37.720> kept<00:01:37.960> things<00:01:38.200> interesting<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.500> way

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
and kept things interesting and the way

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.710 
and kept things interesting and the way
these<00:01:41.860> clouds<00:01:42.250> were<00:01:42.520> setting<00:01:42.850> up<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.360> looked

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
these clouds were setting up it looked

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.240 
these clouds were setting up it looked
like<00:01:43.930> we<00:01:44.080> could<00:01:44.229> be<00:01:44.380> in<00:01:44.470> for<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.710> great<00:01:45.010> evening

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
like we could be in for a great evening

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.190 
like we could be in for a great evening
so<00:01:46.000> we<00:01:46.090> started<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.450> make<00:01:46.600> news<00:01:46.870> towards

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
so we started to make news towards

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.840 
so we started to make news towards
possible<00:01:47.710> locations<00:01:48.220> for<00:01:48.430> sunset<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.520> trick

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
possible locations for sunset the trick

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.550 
possible locations for sunset the trick
in<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.060> place<00:01:52.300> like<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.720> is<00:01:53.080> finding<00:01:53.530> good

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
in a place like this is finding good

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.830 
in a place like this is finding good
foregrounds<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.670> al<00:01:54.820> borde<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.210> huge<00:01:55.630> but

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
foregrounds the al borde is huge but

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.090 
foregrounds the al borde is huge but
most<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.320> looks<00:01:56.470> pretty<00:01:56.770> much<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.920> same

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
most of it looks pretty much the same

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.310 
most of it looks pretty much the same
and<00:01:57.729> as<00:01:57.910> photographers<00:01:58.600> we<00:01:58.810> always<00:01:59.110> want

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
and as photographers we always want

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.430 
and as photographers we always want
several<00:01:59.710> options<00:02:00.160> for<00:02:00.220> sunset<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.110> decided

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
several options for sunset so we decided

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.050 
several options for sunset so we decided
that<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.830> distant<00:02:03.190> side<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.520> playa<00:02:03.790> would

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
that the distant side of the playa would

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.640 
that the distant side of the playa would
probably<00:02:04.450> give<00:02:04.600> us<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.870> most<00:02:05.080> bang<00:02:05.350> for<00:02:05.380> our

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
probably give us the most bang for our

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.300 
probably give us the most bang for our
buck<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.900> 84<00:02:08.260> square<00:02:08.590> miles<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.100> desert

buck of the 84 square miles of desert

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.220 
buck of the 84 square miles of desert

that stretched in front of us Matt and I
of<00:02:11.350> course<00:02:11.590> picked<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.040> same<00:02:12.310> spot<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:13.120> our

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
of course picked the same spot for our

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:28.339 
of course picked the same spot for our
first<00:02:13.450> shots

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
every aperture possible like let me try

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.470 
every aperture possible like let me try
f/8<00:03:15.000> let<00:03:15.209> me<00:03:15.270> try<00:03:15.450> f<00:03:15.569> 11<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.230> 16<00:03:16.470> F<00:03:16.980> 13<00:03:17.459> F<00:03:17.670> 1.8<00:03:18.300> at

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
200 photos of the same exact thing maybe

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.650 
200 photos of the same exact thing maybe
the<00:03:29.220> lights<00:03:29.400> changing<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.849> little<00:03:30.090> bit<00:03:30.209> mm-hmm

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
the lights changing a little bit mm-hmm

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.449 
the lights changing a little bit mm-hmm
but<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.930> come<00:03:31.080> back<00:03:31.230> with<00:03:31.440> 200<00:03:31.830> photos<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
but you come back with 200 photos of the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.100 
but you come back with 200 photos of the
same<00:03:32.790> exactly<00:03:33.299> well<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.660> clouds<00:03:33.900> have

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
same exactly well the clouds have

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.930 
same exactly well the clouds have
changed<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.530> little<00:03:34.650> bit<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:35.130> better<00:03:35.489> hit<00:03:35.640> every

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
changed a little bit I better hit every

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.080 
changed a little bit I better hit every
aperture<00:03:36.299> one<00:03:36.450> more<00:03:36.569> time<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.310> think<00:03:38.580> you

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
aperture one more time so I think you

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.210 
aperture one more time so I think you
know<00:03:39.180> one<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.110> things<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.410> we<00:03:40.500> did<00:03:40.739> here

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
know one of the things that we did here

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.610 
know one of the things that we did here

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
and we kind of almost had a plan so the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.710 
and we kind of almost had a plan so the
the<00:03:53.489> plan<00:03:53.700> was<00:03:53.970> there's<00:03:54.269> these<00:03:54.450> nice

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
the plan was there's these nice

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.440 
the plan was there's these nice
mountains<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.890> are<00:03:55.950> off<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.940> west<00:03:57.150> west

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
mountains that are off to the west west

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.740 
mountains that are off to the west west
and<00:03:57.920> we<00:03:58.920> knew<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.880> Sun<00:04:00.030> always<00:04:00.239> rises<00:04:00.360> in

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
and we knew that the Sun always rises in

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.479 
and we knew that the Sun always rises in
these<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.260> Sun<00:04:01.440> rises<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.920> east<00:04:02.160> yeah<00:04:02.400> I

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
these the Sun rises in the east yeah I

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.270 
these the Sun rises in the east yeah I
learned<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.849> on<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:03.150> trip<00:04:03.950> but<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.100> knew

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
learned that on this trip but we knew

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.490 
learned that on this trip but we knew
that<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.209> know<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.750> first<00:04:07.170> lights

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that the you know that first lights

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.410 
that the you know that first lights
gonna<00:04:07.680> hit<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.070> tip<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.760> they're<00:04:08.880> very<00:04:09.060> peaks

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
gonna hit the tip and they're very peaks

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
gonna hit the tip and they're very peaks
of<00:04:09.540> these<00:04:09.660> mountains<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.140> could<00:04:10.320> be<00:04:10.410> a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
of these mountains and that could be a

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
of these mountains and that could be a
nice<00:04:10.650> shot

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.670 

and<00:04:26.460> then<00:04:26.730> after<00:04:27.030> that's<00:04:27.240> done<00:04:27.570> now<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.380> can

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
and then after that's done now you can

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.230 
and then after that's done now you can
turn<00:04:28.860> around<00:04:28.920> now<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.400> can<00:04:29.580> get<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.760> different

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
turn around now you can get a different

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.240 
turn around now you can get a different
shot<00:04:30.450> back<00:04:30.690> there<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.200> Sun<00:04:31.470> just<00:04:31.800> peeking

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
shot back there of the Sun just peeking

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.520

when that first happens shoot it for a
minute<00:04:53.460> maybe<00:04:53.970> two<00:04:54.090> minutes<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.690> then<00:04:54.810> it's

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
minute maybe two minutes and then it's

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
throw in an e-book as a illustration of

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.970 
throw in an e-book as a illustration of
where<00:05:12.180> we<00:05:12.300> are<00:05:12.330> in<00:05:12.450> coffee<00:05:12.720> yeah<00:05:13.320> which<00:05:13.770> by<00:05:13.920> the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
where we are in coffee yeah which by the

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.920 
where we are in coffee yeah which by the
way<00:05:14.100> this<00:05:14.220> cup<00:05:14.880> doesn't<00:05:15.180> have<00:05:15.270> any<00:05:15.420> coffee<00:05:15.660> and

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
way this cup doesn't have any coffee and

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
way this cup doesn't have any coffee and
it's<00:05:16.050> it's<00:05:16.290> a<00:05:16.380> prop

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
it's it's a prop

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.310 
it's it's a prop
much<00:05:17.310> like<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.640> fire<00:05:17.850> not<00:05:18.690> needs<00:05:18.960> something

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
much like the fire not needs something

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.780 
much like the fire not needs something
to<00:05:19.350> hold<00:05:19.530> just<00:05:19.950> had<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.250> have<00:05:20.400> something<00:05:20.610> to

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
to hold just had to have something to

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.440 
to hold just had to have something to
hold<00:05:20.910> on<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.270> but<00:05:21.420> it's<00:05:21.570> empty<00:05:22.730> and<00:05:23.730> so<00:05:24.030> and

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
hold on to but it's empty and so and

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.390 
hold on to but it's empty and so and
then<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:24.900> think<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.470> biggest<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:25.980> the<00:05:26.100> biggest

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
then I think the biggest so the biggest

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.920 
then I think the biggest so the biggest
hurdle<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:26.820> is<00:05:26.970> you<00:05:27.090> get<00:05:27.240> back<00:05:27.420> and<00:05:27.690> you<00:05:27.720> have

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
hurdle is is you get back and you have

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.620 
hurdle is is you get back and you have
200<00:05:28.440> photos<00:05:28.650> um<00:05:29.430> we<00:05:30.000> know<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.180> lot<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.390> people

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.750 
Lightroom
on<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.140> front<00:05:34.410> end<00:05:34.560> it's<00:05:34.770> not<00:05:34.830> so<00:05:35.160> fast<00:05:35.430> for

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
on the front end it's not so fast for

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.880 
on the front end it's not so fast for
looking<00:05:36.120> at<00:05:36.240> those<00:05:36.390> 200<00:05:36.900> photos<00:05:37.080> so<00:05:37.440> that's

looking at those 200 photos so that's

looking at those 200 photos so that's
where<00:05:38.100> I<00:05:38.130> would<00:05:38.220> jump<00:05:38.580> into<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.870> fast<00:05:40.170> the

where I would jump into the the fast the
