00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
over to someone here here just point

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.200 
over to someone here here just point
this<00:01:05.019> at<00:01:05.229> me<00:01:05.379> for<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.619> second<00:01:05.950> all<00:01:06.130> right

this at me for a second all right

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.950 
this at me for a second all right
so<00:01:07.830> basically<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.880> battles<00:01:10.420> over<00:01:10.570> here

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
so basically these battles over here

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.880 
so basically these battles over here
hold<00:01:11.950> about<00:01:12.490> 400<00:01:13.119> balls<00:01:13.330> apiece<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.680> big

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
hold about 400 balls apiece and the big

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.410 
hold about 400 balls apiece and the big
ones<00:01:15.130> here<00:01:15.369> if<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.640> can<00:01:15.759> get<00:01:15.909> up<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.210> get<00:01:16.360> a

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
ones here if you can get up and get a

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.010 
ones here if you can get up and get a
shot<00:01:16.720> down<00:01:17.020> into<00:01:17.619> them<00:01:17.770> these<00:01:18.670> hold<00:01:19.030> about<00:01:19.240> 600
