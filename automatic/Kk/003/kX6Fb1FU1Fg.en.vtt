00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
people becoming famous and stuff and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.929 
people becoming famous and stuff and
they<00:01:32.780> just<00:01:32.899> turn<00:01:33.079> into<00:01:33.229> these<00:01:33.409> monsters<00:01:34.340> and

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
they just turn into these monsters and

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.779 
they just turn into these monsters and
like<00:01:35.780> no<00:01:36.469> one<00:01:36.649> really<00:01:36.679> has<00:01:37.100> out<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.549> cast

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
like no one really has out of the cast

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.480 
like no one really has out of the cast
at<00:01:38.060> all<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.749> I<00:01:38.990> think<00:01:39.049> it's<00:01:39.319> it's<00:01:40.249> weird

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
at all and I think it's it's weird

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.039 
at all and I think it's it's weird
everyone's<00:01:40.999> still<00:01:41.329> stayed<00:01:41.630> relatively

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
everyone's still stayed relatively

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.510 
everyone's still stayed relatively
grounded<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:42.920> stuff<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:46.100> know<00:01:46.189> this<00:01:46.369> is<00:01:46.490> a

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
grounded and stuff you know this is a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.849 
grounded and stuff you know this is a
huge<00:01:46.759> fan<00:01:46.999> base<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.659> know<00:01:47.780> as<00:01:48.289> we<00:01:48.439> never<00:01:48.619> ate

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
huge fan base you know as we never ate

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.379 
huge fan base you know as we never ate
so<00:01:49.039> you're<00:01:49.459> all<00:01:49.579> in<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.789> trenches<00:01:50.179> together

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
so you're all in the trenches together

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:54.099 
so you're all in the trenches together
and<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.810> think<00:01:51.429> yeah<00:01:52.429> I<00:01:52.490> think<00:01:52.579> people<00:01:53.109> because

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
and I think yeah I think people because

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.870 
and I think yeah I think people because
you<00:01:54.380> are<00:01:54.529> quite<00:01:54.709> vulnerable<00:01:55.009> with<00:01:55.639> when

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
you are quite vulnerable with when

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.249 
you are quite vulnerable with when
things<00:01:56.149> become<00:01:56.420> really<00:01:56.689> big<00:01:56.719> and<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:57.139> I<00:01:57.200> think

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
things become really big and so I think

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.139 
things become really big and so I think
everyone's<00:01:57.740> sort<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.100> instinctively<00:01:59.029> just

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
everyone's sort of instinctively just

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.449 
everyone's sort of instinctively just
stuck<00:01:59.990> together<00:02:00.200> this<00:02:00.560> kind<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:00.889> support<00:02:01.100> each

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
stuck together this kind of support each

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.389 
stuck together this kind of support each
other<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:03.350> have<00:02:03.529> like<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:03.770> little<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.189> little

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
other so you have like a little a little

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.370 
other so you have like a little a little
team<00:02:04.819> so<00:02:05.179> whenever<00:02:05.359> anything<00:02:05.779> bad<00:02:05.959> happens

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
team so whenever anything bad happens

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.040 
team so whenever anything bad happens
like<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.909> kind<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.270> know<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.720> rest<00:02:08.929> of

like you kind of know that the rest of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.300 
like you kind of know that the rest of
the<00:02:09.140> cast<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.679> there<00:02:10.220> if<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.459> have<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> cheesy<00:02:11.200> I
