00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.710
 but manufacturers installed in toilets and invest in the market walks well being 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.059
 now these products are increasingly used to combat the extraction of being 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:09.889
 stuck 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.980
 I am sad scenario also discovered how to make money with the market must 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.679

 Jose de Morais was a good man in Misrata, he started with 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.060
 12 thousand reais to eight years bought welding machine 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.890
 of machines for cutting and folding Saturday the 19th 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.809
 in the first year the businessman sold 40 sallas 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.200
 demand grew from today it makes more than 100 thousand units per month 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 today when you can 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.830
 demand 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.960
 it's quality of life in the circus I'm looking for well being 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.040
 and it's a niche 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.000
 Let's work. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.740
 those people 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.500
 one of the secrets of success is that the company has become competitive 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.660
 in the last three years the entrepreneur has fought a battle to reduce costs 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.480
 who beat the competition 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.990
 steel sheets in production. 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.420
 at first everything was thrown away 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.450
 now you have learned how to use this material and reduced the cost of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.700
 product 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.100
 we managed to make a saving of more than two thousand and five hundred reais per 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.810
 month 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.590
 and making better use of the material 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 for example part of the cap 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.920
 another example is in the electronic components of the classes the company 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.110
 commissioned the parts but three years the contract of the technician who started 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.520
 produce the components right here 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.070
 the cost reduction 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.300
 after we went to manufacture the very floor 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.240
 is a saying to dc cost an average 70 reais 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.490
 but you have to spend a lot on the soft with the technology to develop the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.570
 problem 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.830
 today the company manufactures nine models of mobile phones customers are divided 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.199
 halfway between companies evidence like this 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:16.389
 the printed is lively in the last two years sales grew 40% 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.830
 one of the reasons is the heated market of well being customers as engineers in the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.880
 malaysia meeting in the room the refuge against gestation the stress of the day 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.049
 There are moments we need not just to act. 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.019
 and action is an option or therapy where we can 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.079
