00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
too is that it could be considered a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.850 
too is that it could be considered a
tactical<00:02:00.030> jacket<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.349> it<00:02:01.560> because<00:02:01.649> it

but it also has a little bit of stretch

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.670 
but it also has a little bit of stretch
here<00:02:35.400> too<00:02:35.669> which<00:02:36.150> i<00:02:36.329> think<00:02:36.359> is<00:02:36.660> perfect<00:02:36.930> rather

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
here too which i think is perfect rather

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.110 
here too which i think is perfect rather
than<00:02:37.859> just<00:02:38.040> having<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.519> or<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.760> other<00:02:38.910> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
than just having one or the other you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.430 
than just having one or the other you
have<00:02:39.150> options<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.130> little<00:02:41.250> variable

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
have options and it's a little variable

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.990 
have options and it's a little variable
so<00:02:43.440> what<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.769> actually<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.519> depending<00:02:44.940> on

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
so what I do actually is depending on
