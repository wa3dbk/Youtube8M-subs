 use of stem cells in regenerative medicine 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.129
 regenerative medicine is responsible for making different technical processes for 

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:20.089
 the recovery of functions 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.239
 that the cell the different organs of our body 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.239
 one of the fundamental pillars of regenerative medicine 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.810
 in the stem cells have 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.320
 in its function basically is the repair of all tissues 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.600
 damaged and that's why she represents 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.950
 a fundamental pillar when we want to recover the function of any 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.870
 organism will undertake master 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.520
 the use of stem cells in 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.630
 we have a wide range of pathologies 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.740
 0 where the most fought in the ariake authorized so much type 1 comfortable 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.180
 the complications of diabetes such as retinopathy 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.490
 kidney failure

 gazka de patti 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 the next fifty acts 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 this environment antidiabetics to recover circulation in limbs 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.810
 lower 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.270
 they were childish are common and current results in most 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.420
 the patients 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.210
 It is also used in arthritic patology bakeries everything that does not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.880
 is titular rossi percent if you do not sneak or to semen so that we can recover 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.450
 those patients who have been left with some kind of functional limitation 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.330
 how much closer this moment actually happened than the event of 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.490
 azerbaijan 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 now we have to recover 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.510
 the technique that we carry eleven 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.690
 the extraction of bone marrow from the same patient 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.680
 that's why an operation took place in this tournament 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.340
 I particularly took it 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.210
 with the trevi sternum local anesthesia 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.119
 be processed in a team is willing to take the process from 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:57.960
 small 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 it is placed again in the same patient 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 the benefits are appreciated almost immediately 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.320
 there is no case patients with Parkinson's and supply 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.320
 decrease in tremor, significant decrease in larry yÃ¡Ã±ez, increase in 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.239
 the speed in 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.540
 intention of depressive pictures that are frequent very easy to be compact 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.759
 in the case of diabetes I have mixed 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.759
 most of our patients to a significant decline 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.749
 more or less between a 60 to a 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:36.469
 50 or 60 percent that the amount of insulin that we insert we have seen 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.469
 Improvement in the mission of patients with diabetic retinopathy 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.029
 in 2009 the levels of criminal violence 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.680
 ordinary people who already have their rules 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.229
 or that are about to start 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.879
 a picture that will involve the use of dialysis need a transplant 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.489
