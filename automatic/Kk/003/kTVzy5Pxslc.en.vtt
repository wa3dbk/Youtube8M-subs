00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 where they sell games to my surprise 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.500
 It was closed as my house was very 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.039
 I decide to wait until they open 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.899
 like an hour and nothing anymore when I decided 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.480
 return a man tells me that the store 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.550
 It was closed for what happened yesterday 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 I asked him what he had 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.510
 happened yesterday in the store he tells me 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.640
 that a child with a weapon of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.600
 fire and he had shot all the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.030
 who were there and who later committed suicide 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.340

 that was at the end of the street there 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.759
 would find a video store and that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.009
 there could buy games and I in that 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.840
 I say thank you very much I imagined 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.850
 that what the man had told me was 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.220
 sheer lie that was a trap for 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.470
 steal my money I decide to return to my 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.350
 house to see if the next day they opened 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.479
 the store came to my house and I turn on the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.670
 television to my surprise was in the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.830
 news right there they said about the child 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.039

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.409
 innocent in that I told myself that tomorrow 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.509
 they would not go to open so the best 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.789
 will be looking elsewhere searched by 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.860

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.220
 It was a game when I was already missing a 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.470
 This person tells me that I was a 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.230
 psychopathic monster that this was not a 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.930

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.330
 I had already done it the phone rings 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.340

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.280
 from my mother and my father and my brothers 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.050
 I run to embrace them and 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.820
 I wonder what the fuck was going on 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.860

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.440
