00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.890 

so<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:20.130> would<00:00:20.250> your<00:00:20.430> top<00:00:20.580> three

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
so what would your top three

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.310 
so what would your top three
observations<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:24.240> suppose<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.720> had<00:00:24.990> like

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
observations and I suppose you had like

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.689 
observations and I suppose you had like
loads<00:00:25.560> freedom<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.980> movement<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.460> thought<00:00:26.610> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
loads freedom of movement I thought it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.069 
loads freedom of movement I thought it
would<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:26.880> more<00:00:27.000> restrictive<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.930> were

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
would be more restrictive for you were

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.290 
would be more restrictive for you were
and<00:00:28.410> zip<00:00:28.650> dentist<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.640> hardly<00:00:29.849> notice<00:00:30.060> you

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
and zip dentist you hardly notice you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.939 
and zip dentist you hardly notice you
really<00:00:30.509> isn't<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.500> would<00:00:31.650> see<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
really isn't in like I would see if you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.460 
really isn't in like I would see if you
let<00:00:32.129> your<00:00:32.250> left<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.390> push<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.960> don't

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
let your left just push you don't

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.020 
let your left just push you don't
actually<00:00:34.710> you're<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.309> restricted<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.910> all

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
actually you're not restricted at all

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
actually you're not restricted at all
you<00:00:36.150> can<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.480> use<00:00:36.660> your<00:00:36.840> normal<00:00:37.500> next<00:00:38.010> day

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you can just use your normal next day

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.650 
you can just use your normal next day
the<00:00:39.030> other<00:00:39.150> thing<00:00:39.330> I<00:00:39.420> noticed<00:00:39.720> was<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.400> it

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
the other thing I noticed was that it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.619 
the other thing I noticed was that it
does<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.620> focus<00:00:43.769> on<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.160> study

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
does and make you focus on your study

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
does and make you focus on your study
because<00:00:45.629> you're<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.010> move<00:00:47.190> from

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
because you're you know if you move from

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
because you're you know if you move from
side<00:00:47.519> to<00:00:47.670> side<00:00:47.699> or<00:00:48.089> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.650> finish

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
side to side or you can get the finish

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.649 
side to side or you can get the finish
you<00:00:50.400> can<00:00:50.550> feel<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.699> you're<00:00:50.879> moving<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
you can feel that you're moving this

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.180 
you can feel that you're moving this
wasn't<00:00:51.869> a<00:00:51.989> marathon<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.040> obviously

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
wasn't a marathon like you obviously

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
wasn't a marathon like you obviously
want<00:00:53.549> to<00:00:53.610> run<00:00:53.729> the<00:00:53.790> technology<00:00:54.299> as<00:00:54.360> possible

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
want to run the technology as possible

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.899 
want to run the technology as possible
so<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.739> were<00:00:55.890> already<00:00:56.159> going<00:00:56.309> forward<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
so if you were already going forward and

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.009 
so if you were already going forward and
you're<00:00:57.030> constantly<00:00:57.390> making<00:00:57.659> if<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.869> come

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
you're constantly making if I come

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.329 
you're constantly making if I come
forward<00:00:58.350> they<00:00:58.500> could<00:00:58.650> be<00:00:58.710> good<00:00:58.830> for<00:00:58.979> your<00:00:59.100> stay

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
forward they could be good for your stay

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.930 
forward they could be good for your stay
and<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.860> other<00:01:02.010> thing<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.519> as<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> go

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and the other thing is just as you go

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.329 
and the other thing is just as you go
faster<00:01:03.229> it<00:01:04.229> cannot<00:01:04.439> watch<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.769> he<00:01:04.949> makes<00:01:05.129> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
faster it cannot watch much he makes you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.030 
faster it cannot watch much he makes you
do<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.930> changes<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.350> stride<00:01:07.650> as<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
do your changes your stride as if you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.380 
do your changes your stride as if you
were<00:01:08.159> sprinting<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.760> zero<00:01:08.970> open<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.270> toes

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
were sprinting like zero open your toes

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
were sprinting like zero open your toes
new<00:01:09.689> Belfast<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> you're<00:01:10.409> done<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.770> heel

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
new Belfast and you're done in your heel

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.410 
new Belfast and you're done in your heel
in<00:01:11.159> years<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.790> which<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> way<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> would

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
in years also which is the way I would

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.510 
in years also which is the way I would
normally<00:01:12.659> run<00:01:13.070> anyway<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> actually

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
normally run anyway so I actually

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.550 
normally run anyway so I actually
thought<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.900> might<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.260> open<00:01:16.470> your

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
thought that you might just be open your

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.749 
thought that you might just be open your
toes<00:01:16.650> old<00:01:16.890> timer<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> might<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.430> different<00:01:17.580> but

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
toes old timer it might be different but

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.070 
toes old timer it might be different but
it's<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.030> very<00:01:18.240> similar<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> way

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
it's actually very similar to the way

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
it's actually very similar to the way
you<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.350> run<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> were<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:20.970> running

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you would run if you were just running

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.910 
you would run if you were just running
at<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> normal<00:01:21.600> treadmill<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.409> terms<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.770> your

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
at a normal treadmill in terms of your

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.550 
at a normal treadmill in terms of your
style<00:01:23.190> ok<00:01:23.970> Joseph's<00:01:24.600> page<00:01:24.870> what<00:01:25.170> did<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.380> find

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
style ok Joseph's page what did you find

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.300 
style ok Joseph's page what did you find
I<00:01:25.830> thought<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.430> much<00:01:26.640> easier<00:01:26.790> methods<00:01:27.780> robust

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
I thought so much easier methods robust

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
I thought so much easier methods robust
yeah<00:01:29.310> particularly<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.900> know

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
yeah particularly when as the you know

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
yeah particularly when as the you know
as<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.140> decrease<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:32.040> might<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.400> weights

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
as you decrease they might have weights

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.630 
as you decrease they might have weights
of<00:01:32.910> alienation<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
of alienation and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.800 
of alienation and
easier<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.630> faster<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:38.180> then<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> removal

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
easier to go faster and then the removal

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.860 
easier to go faster and then the removal
of<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:39.990> weight<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.500> joint<00:01:40.710> 7f<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.870> perfect

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
of the weight the joint 7f a perfect

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.590 
of the weight the joint 7f a perfect
year<00:01:43.050> like<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.190> was<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.790> said<00:01:45.450> we

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
year like it's really it was I said we

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.340 
year like it's really it was I said we
quite<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.580> I'm<00:01:47.580> not<00:01:48.360> comparing<00:01:48.690> us<00:01:48.990> against

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
quite what I'm not comparing us against

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.750 
quite what I'm not comparing us against
anything<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.680> moment<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.340> did<00:01:50.520> mean

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
anything a moment but like I did mean

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.550 
anything a moment but like I did mean
let<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:51.690> have<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.290> had<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
let you know you would have if you had a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
let you know you would have if you had a
thorny<00:01:53.190> year<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.600> would<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:54.900> just

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
thorny year and I'm it would really just

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.410 
thorny year and I'm it would really just
take<00:01:55.740> any<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> pressure<00:01:56.490> off<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.330> know

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
take any of the pressure off you know

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.230 
take any of the pressure off you know
that<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> would<00:01:57.720> have<00:01:57.900> washed<00:01:58.500> joint
