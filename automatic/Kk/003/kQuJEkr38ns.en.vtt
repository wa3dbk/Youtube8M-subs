00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 When we are children, we all have dreams of becoming superheroes. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 We want to have the ability to fly, for example, or to control things with ideas. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Thanks to new technologies like Emotiv EPOC, 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 It will not take long for some of our fantasies to become a reality. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 This wireless helmet 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Brain computer interface technology 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 It can interpret brain waves through detectors. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 The helmet can detect three levels of emotions. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Just think about the action you want to take. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 The wearer can control the progress of the game. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 In the end, we realized the use of thinking 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 To move objects and control computers. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 This technology has unlimited possibilities. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Take a look at it yourself. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 I warn you, 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 You are entering a huge mistake. 17 0:00:45 --&gt; 0:00;47 I will take you to the game network. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 My name is David Freidman. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I am the December issue of Inc. magazine. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Wrote a cover story about Emotiv. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Emotiv has created a brain thinking reading helmet worth $300. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Now, when you hear the brain thinking reading the helmet, you will feel very stupid. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 At least when I first heard this, I think so. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 As a result, this helmet is no different from an ordinary helmet. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 It is only finer than a normal headset. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 It looks more like a bicycle helmet. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 When I tried to wear this helmet, 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 I feel like I am in a science fiction movie. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 In fact, one of the founders of this company 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Tan Le told me that when she was a child 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 The movie "Star Wars" left a deep impression on her. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 She is excited to try to use her super powers everywhere. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 To move around objects. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Luke! Use energy! 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Now, when we look back at those science fiction movies and books, 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Even we imagine the future of hundreds or even thousands of years, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Many stories don't believe that we have brain thinking reading instruments. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 I mean, if you think about Star Trek, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 They do have mind reading, 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 But apart from the dissolution of the vulcan family, 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 They don't have brain thinking reading technology 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Emotiv through the principle of interaction between humans 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 This set of detection principles was developed. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 We have three different categories of detection, 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 We turn this into a detection principle. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 They are: expressing emotions, feelings and emotions and cognitive emotions. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Expressing emotions refers to facial expressions. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Emotional feelings are the understanding of your emotional experience. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Cognitive emotions are the oldest and oldest fantasy of human beings. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 This is just thinking through 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 To control objects. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 I tried to use it, 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 When you try to concentrate, then see something on the screen 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 It is indeed a very strange thing. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 You can see the stone moving into the air, 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 With my concentration, I will strengthen 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 You can see that the screen gradually turns orange. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Let your thinking 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Become a real mind 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Not a natural skill. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Neo, you have to learn to let go of everything. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Fear, doubt 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 And distrust. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Unleash your thinking. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 But, obviously, now 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 This thing still does not allow you to control too much. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Now it can only control what's inside the game, 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 But this is also its original design purpose. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 However, for the future, this device can control the hole 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 I am very excited. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Have you tried this? 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Yes, I tried it! 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Thank you, it's really great! 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Obviously, this tool is for those with disabilities, 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Or someone who is awkward 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 There are huge possibilities, 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Now they can control things by thinking. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Its grip is really strong. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 It has 400 pounds, 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 You can crush every bone in your hand. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Ok, connect it to his shoulder. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 We connected it to our electric wheelchair. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Then I used my eyes and smile to control the wheelchair. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Blink to the right and the wheelchair goes to the right. 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Now, this has been used in market research. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 You don't have to ask the discussion group or the respondent 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 What do they think or feel like, 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Instead, you only have to record their emotions. 89 0:04:28 --&gt; 0:03:31 In fact, record the emotions 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 It is what is lacking in high technology now. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 We can communicate anything, 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 But emotions are often overlooked by most high-tech products. 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Even when we are on the Internet, 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 If you want others to know what you think, 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 At the same time you need to play it out. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 We often need to give machines 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 One or a series of instructions 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Let it do something for us, 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 But if we look at the communication between humans, 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 It is actually more interesting. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Because we will pay more attention to things that are not specifically expressed. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 We will pay attention to facial expressions, 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Will interpret body language, 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.800
 We will also infuse our emotions between conversations. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 So, Emotiv is our vision for the next generation of human-machine interaction interfaces. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 It will transcend the existing conscious interface 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 At the same time, non-conscious input will also occupy a large part. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Since 1985, UCLA 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 The brain-computer interaction interface research began. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 40 years later, 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Scientists are using this technology for vision or hearing 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 People with disabilities develop neurological organs. 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Apply here, 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Software engineers are designing with a brain-computer interface 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 You can control the game with your brain. 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 In the near future, we can be like our favorite science fiction movies. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Living in our fantasy.
