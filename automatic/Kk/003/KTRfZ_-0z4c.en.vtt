00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.400
 I think me and I do see quite 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.110
 many eggs around we have here 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.420

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.609
 Magical brought by the company cross 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.100
 we make ourselves now only times the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.740
 wear gloves of the same quality , yes 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.960
 In this set of the company there are 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.550
 the bucket with perfect in the same 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.189
 we have filled water and now 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.109
 we have to dribble right now 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.680
 unlikely many 30 timetables 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.950
 in total including nine metallic colors 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.899
 and two glitter perfect yes, of course 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 never more than four colors and structures 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.670
 his materials work and testify 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.260
 never more than four drops per color 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.559
 what texture do the eggs need 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.440
 have dust-free wish good straight 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.770
 I can styrofoam eggs I take can 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.539
 goose eggs ladina on others if you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.329
 now no aha thought but heart 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.770
 you can take in the glass 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.270
 plastic by the way the very smooth 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.379
 surfaces it is important that you do it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.439
 perhaps again with a simple 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.210
 silk mats guarantee easy 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.220
 but the color sticks better villa and and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 always keep our work clean 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.320
 What now you do not have to take off swiftly 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.369
 but only the solvent fast 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 it evaporates and then cools it dry 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.170
 now we take the color the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.490
 color that comes last free is the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.650
 dominating which color should 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.580
 dominate orange to let the koran 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.920
 we'll take you to the page 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.780
 you can be careful now 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.070
 shake or the money money is there 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.689
 Everyone wants to drink small balls 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.689
 Documents must be shaken up again 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.689
 has become nice to my sound 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:51.720
 drop talk to kebab and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.990
 Now the whole mulling musician 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.840
 would laugh little quickly we work 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.430
 then the solvent becomes hard 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.159
 vaporized is evaporated 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.840
 I'll take a small plastic one now 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:13.099
 Team spits firmly slowly dipping 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.099
 stay in it and then post 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.690
 After three hours is dry 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.549
 then it is also smudge-proof if 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.200
 it is completely dried and quiet 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.780
 on the spit to dry exactly 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.190
 put aside with it is now 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.440
 important to become really nice 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.000
 the work that is still in there now 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.709
 the man with the paper carefully 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.810
 If not, it will be great 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.299
 well, just what works 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.890
 I now have several eggs in this case 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.030
 Of course, we'll do 23 again 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.019
 this will go back though 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.760
 Of course it will not be so nice anymore 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.920
 intense colors and the same is already clear 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.819
 that, of course, a bit more 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.349
 and especially because of that 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.790
 is fizzles solvent's it 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.370
 hertha they prefer to steal again 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.780
 rausnehmen new colors can so before 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.549
 we'll do the next egg again 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.430
 we can easily change the color here 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.500
 top with a paper edge one 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.090
 injured 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.250
 and there are lots of colors there 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.220
 even the houses effects like a blitzer 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.750
 shades of new metallic shades insanity 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.519
 and then of course you can really 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.769
 also work on every material that is 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.709
 really an apple I really have to 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.299
 So you have a lot of fun with it 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.880
 Now that's really great 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.230
 results of the easter eggs the heating 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.819
 no one else and we'll say it for now 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.200
 Happy Easter and see you next 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.200
