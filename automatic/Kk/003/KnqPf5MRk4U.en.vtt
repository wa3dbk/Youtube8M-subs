00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 pokémon a saga of videogames 

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.330
 supposedly childish where like all 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.970
 the existing things of this planet 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.010
 It has a dark side that is covered in 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.090
 This saga will take care of revealing the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.190
 everyone 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 this is the saga of urban legends of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.490
 pokemon hello everyone I'm videogame 3 and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.189
 I bring you the second part of this saga 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 let's start with a theory of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.500
 the most interesting legend of receiving 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 amis a chrome the truth resolved a lot 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.309
 people do not know the true story of 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.050
 the Teselia region that's why today I've 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.390
 decided to express the two versions 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 existing ones of which only one can be 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 true you must believe in a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.399
 because as similar as they are they have 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.350
 a contrary sense first legend 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.530
 resides in the past were the same 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.480
 pokemon that unique dragon pokemon created a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.570
 new world next to two twin heroes 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.210
 in that world pokemon and humans coexisted 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.539
 in peace and harmony but then it happened 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.010
 of the twin brothers the older one was looking for 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.860
 the truth while the minor 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.810
 It is pursuing the ideals and was as well as 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.600
 started a fight to decide which 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.399
 2 was right that type pokemon 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 dragon that had accompanied them 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.979
 turned into two and each one got the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.049
 side of one of the twins the pokemon of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.329
 white dragon type would be the guide towards 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.210
 the new world of truth its name 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.460
 was residing and his counterpart the pokemon of 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.100
 black dragon type would bring a new world 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.100
 forged in the ideals his name was 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.439
 zekrom despite having emerged from the same 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.259
 body the fight between the two was fierce 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.299
 they only managed to weaken the one 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.759
 to the other without there being a clear winner 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.220
 and none of the twin heroes could 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.670
 impose his will because none possessed 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.640
 the absolute reason and the fight ceased but 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.770
 but 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.229
 the descendants of those heroes 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.420
 they continued with the struggles it is said that 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.060
 reside and zekrom swept all teselia 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.310
 in an instant with flames and lightning and 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.229
 then they disappeared but the people 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.850
 he amended his mistake and learned to treat 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.640
 well to the pokemon so no 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.380
 they swept the whole world then they reside 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.260
 and zekrom helped humans to 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.600
 build a new second region 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.550
 legend many years ago in 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.560
 immemorial times in an area of 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.450
 planet lived two twins who had 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.459
 a strong friendship with a powerful 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.380
 pokemon thanks to this friendship 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.480
 They decided to create a new corner of the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.510
 world where to live and formed the current 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.910
 Teselia region everything was peace and harmony 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.860
 but one day one of these twins decided 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.320
 look for the truth in the world the other 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.360
 I looked for the ideals this caused such 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.459
 conflict that they decided that it was 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.320
 time to go by separate directions the 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.390
 creature or pokemon that was friends with 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.190
 these twins was divided into two reside 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.709
 and zekrom which one of its parts 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.350
 would seek the truth reside more the other 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.390
 the ideals of crohn by dividing this 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.340
 Pokemon caused a more serious problem 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.569
 the twins had a battle to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.670
 see if the new place 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.859
 to live should be forged or by 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.749
 the truth or by the ideals with the step 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.609
 of the years his descendants followed 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.769
 this absurd battle since so much 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.689
 reside as zekrom they looked matched 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.730
 in combat between battles and the 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.739
 destruction caused the region of 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.510
 teselia was destroyed and left in 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.750
 ashes by the flames and thunder of 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.760
 these titans after this event the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.859
 Teselia inhabitants decided to leave 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.200
 free to these creatures and thus be able 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.700
 rebuild the teselia region but not 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.549
 if the mission were not the only 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.500
 result of this division of this 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.840
 division of the so-called ying yang pokemon 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.090
 Tao the perfect pokemon referring to 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.040
 balance had let's say a waste a 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.169
 corpse or a rest of your body 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.849
 this pokemon is called cure in this 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.919
 third dragon is one more version 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.319
 primitive of the original pokemon since it does not 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:47.040
 it's basically just a crude pokemon 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.150
 and foolish a pokemon of pure instinct 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.829
 extremely aggressive and without much 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.139
 logic the opposite to its version 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.849
 original and that not only stands out in its 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.680
 behavior but also in your 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.810
 physiology since apparently it's a 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.699
 pokémon that has given great battles what 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.930
 which would complete the concept of jim 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.810
 reside 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.459
 and healthy rivalry between n 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.590
 and the protagonist in pokémon edition 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.659
 black and pokémon white edition if 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.730
 set well just like those twins in 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.040
 look for the truth of whether it is good or not 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.959
 pokemon live with humans the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.880
 protagonist seeks the ideals in a 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.789
 world in which pokemon and trainers 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.949
 they coexist in peace and harmony in the episode 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.289
 2 of black and white pokémon in which 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.110
 appears zekrom by stealing the powers to 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.910
 pikachu and then return them not be 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.490
 does chrome testing ace to know if 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.560
 he is the one who will defend the ideals since 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.150
 it's more than obvious it will appear late or 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.280
 early to follow the plot of the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.620
 history and remember that cyclone decided 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.289
 defend the ideals and let's say it clearly 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.449
 you make a person extremely 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.240
 idealistic and dreamy two stories 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.910
 different from which you can only believe 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.910
 a whole will be resolved when pokémon 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.400
 gray edition come to light the next 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.680
 legend is just like chats one 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.190
 military is the history of the islands 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 fault island fault speaking clearly was 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.289
 the worst thing that could happen to you doing a 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.300
 series of instructions in the safari area 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.490
 When you left there, they told you about 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.979
 steps and then the ding dong sounded 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.229
 immediately appeared at the reception 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.509
 from the safari area and when you left you 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.460
 encontrabas in failure islands 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.529
 after this you had to fire 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.509
 of all your progress since when 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.839
 I turned off the console the game was 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.360
 erase then I have a friend many of 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:33.249
 we will have heard something like the 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.199
 brother of a friend of mine has a pikachu 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.089
 silver with flying ability the 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.099
 truth is that most of the legends 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:41.469
 that ran on pokemon were a farce 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.479
 as for example that of in the 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.490
 yellow pokemon if you put pikachu in 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.559
 the box and you hunt another pokemon and you put him 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.209
 by name pikachu the one that follows is that 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.759
 another pokemon that's why many of us 

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:53.830
 when we tried to try some trick 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.869
 that they had explained to us the only thing 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.689
 we got was that we will erase the 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:01.419
 heading last another little legend 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:04.449
 listened to this is the legend of mack 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:07.059
 pikachu this legend begins in a 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.309
 city ​​of usa where a child and his friend 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:12.399
 they spent playing pokemon stadium in 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:14.409
 dreams 64 then some time was made and the 

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:16.719
 The boy's friend had to leave 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:18.699
 the next morning the boy called his 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:20.739
 friend to see if I wanted to play pokemon 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.989
 stadium and he said not that he wanted 

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:25.089
 play something else point then the friend of the 

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:27.610
 child took the game adapter 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:29.709
 gameboy in 64 and the cartridge of 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.809
 yellow pokemon also called pokemon 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:33.879
 pikachu special edition to the house of the 

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:36.009
 child and the child proposed a challenge to his 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.869
 friend that gets that 6 peaks and that 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.869
 the game will end with them the friend 

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:42.969
 he later accepted later the boy observed 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:46.479
 astounded as his friend had caught 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:48.489
 the 6 peaks after a certain time was made 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.139
 again and the boy's friend said no 

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:52.059
 there was a problem that if I wanted it to 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.129
 will be playing and then went home 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:56.079
 the boy kept playing with the cartridge 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.419
 of his friend then saw as the peaks 

00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:00.879
 they evolved to laugh their 1 by 1 point 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.499
 the 6 peaks left the television and 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.329
 they took the most horrible form that 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:06.429
 could the child tried to flee but the 

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:08.319
 the peaks cornered him and proceeded to 

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:11.259
 Remove all parts of your body 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:13.419
 leaving only the brain in the morning 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.879
 next the child's parents observed 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.499
 as his son was not already in 64 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:19.659
 it was on and the TV 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:20.889
 it worked badly the parents hit a 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.719
 cry of the host 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:25.060
 how blood was dripping from the TV 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:26.800
 forming on the floor of the sea floor 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.009
 parents called the child's friend and 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.810
 then proceeded to sue nintendo 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:33.699
 Nintendo said no child could 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.379
 disappear in that way and then when 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.659
 the boy's friend said he had 

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:40.509
 trapped 6 peaks all stayed 

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:42.490
 with his mouth open nintendo made him a 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:44.439
 tribute to the child in the creator pokemon 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.800
 a character called because fan for his
