00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
am getting a little older and I want

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.670 
am getting a little older and I want
some<00:03:37.549> kind<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.090> anti<00:03:38.390> aging<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.380> was<00:03:39.530> like

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
some kind of anti aging so this was like

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.949 
some kind of anti aging so this was like
five<00:03:40.070> bucks<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:40.760> any<00:03:41.000> vitamin<00:03:41.420> e<00:03:41.450> oil<00:03:41.600> is

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
five bucks so any vitamin e oil is

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.140 
five bucks so any vitamin e oil is
really<00:03:42.260> good<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.560> says<00:03:42.769> for<00:03:43.280> softer<00:03:43.640> smoother

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
really good it says for softer smoother

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.660 
really good it says for softer smoother
skin<00:03:44.600> so<00:03:45.019> this<00:03:45.260> does<00:03:45.590> say<00:03:45.739> body<00:03:45.980> oil<00:03:46.250> but<00:03:46.549> it

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
skin so this does say body oil but it

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.009 
skin so this does say body oil but it
wasn't<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.000> skincare<00:03:47.269> house<00:03:47.570> so<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:47.840> would
