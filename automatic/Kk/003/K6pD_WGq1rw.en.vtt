what we have here on our replica

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.150 
what we have here on our replica
Mayfield<00:00:50.030> car<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.410> know<00:00:51.500> they<00:00:51.620> they<00:00:51.949> made

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
Mayfield car and you know they they made

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.529 
Mayfield car and you know they they made
a<00:00:52.190> couple<00:00:52.429> changes<00:00:52.730> from<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.089> point<00:00:53.359> one

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
a couple changes from the point one

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.329 
a couple changes from the point one
vehicle<00:00:53.839> so<00:00:54.499> we<00:00:54.679> needed<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.070> make<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.519> chassis

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
vehicle so we needed to make the chassis

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.439 
vehicle so we needed to make the chassis
you<00:00:58.339> know<00:00:58.429> fit<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.760> body<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:59.120> little<00:00:59.329> bit

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
you know fit the body a little bit

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.020 
you know fit the body a little bit
differently<00:00:59.899> here<00:01:00.230> we<00:01:01.159> made<00:01:01.670> some<00:01:01.699> changes

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
differently here we made some changes

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.660 
differently here we made some changes
because<00:01:02.929> they<00:01:03.350> actually<00:01:03.679> change<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.370> front

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
because they actually change the front

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.830 
because they actually change the front
of<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.820> chassis<00:01:05.030> that's<00:01:05.510> what<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:05.659> was<00:01:05.780> trying

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
of the chassis that's what I was trying

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.290 
of the chassis that's what I was trying
to<00:01:06.020> say<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.440> that<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.490> difference<00:01:07.850> here<00:01:07.940> is

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
to say and that the difference here is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.220 
to say and that the difference here is
just<00:01:09.080> slight<00:01:09.409> in<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.860> front<00:01:10.159> we<00:01:10.850> overall<00:01:11.420> we

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
just slight in the front we overall we

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.760 
just slight in the front we overall we
changed<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.740> length<00:01:12.979> just<00:01:13.640> slightly<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.770> we

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
changed the length just slightly and we

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.490 
changed the length just slightly and we
change<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.220> sidepods<00:01:16.670> slightly<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.810> you

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
change the sidepods slightly and you

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.860 
change the sidepods slightly and you
know<00:01:18.710> overall<00:01:18.860> just<00:01:19.310> kind<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.580> touched<00:01:20.480> up<00:01:20.750> a

something<00:02:02.000> out<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.390> aluminum<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:03.680> took<00:02:03.830> the

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
something out of aluminum we took the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.950 
something out of aluminum we took the
opportunity<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.640> slim<00:02:05.240> up<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.570> design

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
opportunity to slim up the design

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.369 
opportunity to slim up the design
slightly<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:07.280> we<00:02:07.520> added<00:02:07.730> another<00:02:08.599> intercept

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
slightly so we added another intercept

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.790 
slightly so we added another intercept
of<00:02:10.009> canberra<00:02:10.640> link<00:02:10.670> location<00:02:11.330> holes<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.080> what

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
suspension mounts where you can run a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.009 
suspension mounts where you can run a
narrower<00:02:19.069> pivot<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.760> then<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.629> standard

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
wide pivot rear end so we have here is

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.270 
wide pivot rear end so we have here is
both<00:02:24.260> sets<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.769> Camera<00:02:25.129> Link<00:02:25.159> holes

the<00:02:26.640> driver<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.420> determine<00:02:27.900> what's<00:02:28.080> best<00:02:28.140> for

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the driver can determine what's best for

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.480 
the driver can determine what's best for
them<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.459> particular<00:02:29.640> time<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:32.040> this

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
them at that particular time so so this

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.640 
them at that particular time so so this
is<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> matching<00:02:32.880> set<00:02:33.090> our<00:02:33.510> new<00:02:33.720> bulkhead<00:02:34.200> our

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
is a matching set our new bulkhead our

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.250 
is a matching set our new bulkhead our
shock<00:02:34.980> tower<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:36.030> then<00:02:36.330> we've<00:02:36.540> created<00:02:36.990> an

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
shock tower and then we've created an

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.220 
shock tower and then we've created an
aluminum<00:02:37.800> wing<00:02:37.980> mount<00:02:38.250> here<00:02:38.550> which<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.990> wanted

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
aluminum wing mount here which we wanted

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.050 
aluminum wing mount here which we wanted
to<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.470> because<00:02:40.860> we<00:02:41.100> wanted<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> set<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.790> wing

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to do because we wanted to set this wing

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.809 
to do because we wanted to set this wing
off<00:02:42.270> at<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.110> at<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.470> right<00:02:43.739> angle<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
off at the at the right angle and the

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.140 
off at the at the right angle and the
right<00:02:45.030> height<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.989> were<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.110> little<00:02:47.150> unhappy

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
right height we were a little unhappy

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.550 
right height we were a little unhappy
with<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> height<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.080> standard<00:02:49.410> wing

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
with the height of the standard wing

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.960 
with the height of the standard wing
mouse<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.980> wanted<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.190> lower<00:02:50.370> them<00:02:50.580> down<00:02:50.610> look

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
mouse and wanted to lower them down look

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.210 
mouse and wanted to lower them down look
a<00:02:51.060> little<00:02:51.180> more<00:02:51.300> like<00:02:51.569> our<00:02:51.750> other<00:02:51.780> cars<00:02:52.230> you

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
a little more like our other cars you

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.220 
a little more like our other cars you
know<00:02:53.310> my<00:02:53.520> personal<00:02:54.000> preference<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.989> think

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
know my personal preference and I think

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.530 
know my personal preference and I think
it<00:02:55.319> works<00:02:55.500> pretty<00:02:55.709> well<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.060> created<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
it works pretty well so we created the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.199 
it works pretty well so we created the
aluminum<00:02:57.930> wing<00:02:58.140> mounts<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:59.100> go<00:02:59.280> right<00:02:59.850> in<00:03:00.000> line

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
aluminum wing mounts to go right in line

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.780 
aluminum wing mounts to go right in line
with<00:03:00.440> with<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.470> new<00:03:01.680> suspension<00:03:02.070> component

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
with with the new suspension component

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.150 
with with the new suspension component
so<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.660> got<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> rear<00:03:04.110> bulkhead<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.920> shock

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
so we got the rear bulkhead the shock

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.979 
so we got the rear bulkhead the shock
tower<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.760> rear<00:03:06.209> wing<00:03:06.390> mounts<00:03:06.720> for<00:03:06.870> this

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
tower and the rear wing mounts for this

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.660 
tower and the rear wing mounts for this
vehicle<00:03:07.700> we<00:03:08.700> also<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:09.239> here<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:11.610> a
