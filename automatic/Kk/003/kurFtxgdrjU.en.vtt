you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.410> really<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.160> same<00:00:29.429> process<00:00:29.789> as

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you know it's really the same process as

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.780 
you know it's really the same process as
cutting<00:00:30.710> when<00:00:31.710> you're<00:00:31.830> cutting<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.610> don't

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
cutting when you're cutting you don't

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that's something that science proved and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990 
that's something that science proved and
something<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.219> I'm<00:00:38.309> living<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.820> right

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
something that I'm living by it right

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060 
something that I'm living by it right
now<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.200> not<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> worry<00:00:40.920> about

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
eating just meats you know a lot of

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.900 
eating just meats you know a lot of
vegetarians<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.469> Scooby<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.610> know<00:00:44.730> they

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
vegetarians like Scooby you know they

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.549 
vegetarians like Scooby you know they
build<00:00:45.210> their<00:00:45.390> foundation<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.170> muscle

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
build their foundation and muscle

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.220 
build their foundation and muscle
through<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:47.489> finding<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.809> protein

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
through just finding you know protein

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.130 
through just finding you know protein
from<00:00:49.440> protein<00:00:49.680> shakes<00:00:50.190> from<00:00:51.090> beans<00:00:51.449> rice

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
from protein shakes from beans rice

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.670 
from protein shakes from beans rice
whatever<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.430> that's<00:00:54.390> basically<00:00:54.989> whole

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
whatever they can that's basically whole

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.610 
whatever they can that's basically whole
grain<00:00:55.920> foods<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.750> know<00:00:57.780> find

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
grain foods so if you just you know find

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.540 
grain foods so if you just you know find
proteins<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.160> there

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
proteins from there

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
proteins from there
that's<00:00:59.760> fine<00:01:00.149> some<00:01:00.719> protein<00:01:01.079> shakes<00:01:01.289> that's

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
that's fine some protein shakes that's

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130 
that's fine some protein shakes that's
fine<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:02.489> long<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.090> hit<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.570> least<00:01:03.870> your

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
fine as long as you hit at least your

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.710 
fine as long as you hit at least your
body<00:01:04.350> weight<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.860> protein<00:01:05.729> every<00:01:05.970> single<00:01:06.510> day

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
body weight of protein every single day

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.590 
body weight of protein every single day
you<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.799> build<00:01:08.250> new<00:01:08.310> muscle<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.479> you're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
you will build new muscle and if you're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
you will build new muscle and if you're
cutting<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.409> maintain<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:11.070> muscle

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
cutting you will maintain your muscle

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.690 
cutting you will maintain your muscle
and<00:01:12.049> when<00:01:13.049> cutting<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and when cutting all you really have to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
it's really that simple just figure out

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830 
it's really that simple just figure out
how<00:01:22.680> many<00:01:22.740> calories<00:01:23.250> does<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:24.390> for<00:01:24.600> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

to maintain your body weight just figure

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.810 
to maintain your body weight just figure
that<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.990> could<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.650> app<00:01:28.920> lose<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that out you could use the app lose it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.569 
that out you could use the app lose it
or<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> go<00:01:30.270> online<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> calculator

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
or you go online and use a calculator

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.160 
or you go online and use a calculator
you<00:01:32.579> put<00:01:32.850> your<00:01:32.970> age<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.479> put<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.990> know

you put your age you put your you know
your<00:01:34.380> height<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:36.960> estimate<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
your height and it will estimate that

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.179 
your height and it will estimate that
you<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.759> require<00:01:39.119> maybe<00:01:39.650> 2200<00:01:40.650> calories<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you will require maybe 2200 calories to

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.010 
you will require maybe 2200 calories to
maintain<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.729> weight<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.869> you're<00:01:42.990> eating

that mout to lose weight all you really

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
that mout to lose weight all you really
have<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:47.009> either<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
have to do is either do a little bit of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
have to do is either do a little bit of
cardio<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:49.770> yourself<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> caloric

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
cardio to put yourself in a caloric

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.050 
cardio to put yourself in a caloric
deficit<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.720> means<00:01:52.159> your<00:01:53.159> body<00:01:53.189> doesn't

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
deficit which means your body doesn't

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.020 
deficit which means your body doesn't
have<00:01:54.329> sufficient<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.920> calories<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
have sufficient you know calories to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
have sufficient you know calories to
support<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.600> weights<00:01:57.810> maintain<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.409> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
support the weights maintain that way so

to<00:02:03.899> compensate<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.780> simple

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
to compensate it's really that simple

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.100 
to compensate it's really that simple
you<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.849> eat<00:02:09.000> less
