00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
okay yeah so this is the movi m10 it's a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.120 
okay yeah so this is the movi m10 it's a
digital<00:00:12.330> three<00:00:12.840> access<00:00:13.200> handheld<00:00:13.650> stabilized

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
digital three access handheld stabilized

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.330 
digital three access handheld stabilized
gimbal<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.730> we've<00:00:14.849> developed<00:00:16.039> just<00:00:17.039> kind<00:00:17.250> of

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
gimbal that we've developed just kind of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.269 
gimbal that we've developed just kind of
with<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> idea<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.949> empowering<00:00:19.949> more

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
with the idea of empowering more

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.040 
with the idea of empowering more
movement<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.850> camera<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.420> nice<00:00:21.810> stable

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
movement with the camera was nice stable

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.980 
movement with the camera was nice stable
footage<00:00:22.939> more<00:00:23.939> flexibility<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.689> camera

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
footage more flexibility and camera

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.140 
footage more flexibility and camera
movement<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.130> one's<00:00:26.279> targeted<00:00:26.730> at<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.939> ten

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
movement so this one's targeted at a ten

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.540 
movement so this one's targeted at a ten
pound<00:00:27.300> payload<00:00:27.599> which<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.680> way<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:29.010> build<00:00:29.340> out

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
pound payload which the way we build out

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.220 
pound payload which the way we build out
the<00:00:29.699> rigs<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> equates<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.539> about<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.019> red

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the rigs that equates to about a red

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.430 
the rigs that equates to about a red
epic<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.510> cannon<00:00:33.510> 24<00:00:33.989> millimeters

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
epic with like a cannon 24 millimeters

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.490 
epic with like a cannon 24 millimeters
cine<00:00:34.739> prime<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.309> we've<00:00:35.430> got<00:00:35.579> over<00:00:35.700> there

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
cine prime like we've got over there

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.840 
cine prime like we've got over there
that's<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:37.710> that's<00:00:38.129> about<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> limit<00:00:38.550> for

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that's about that's about the limit for

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
that's about that's about the limit for
this<00:00:38.910> particular<00:00:39.300> model<00:00:39.480> yeah<00:00:40.200> i<00:00:40.469> did<00:00:41.129> with

skimming<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> ground<00:00:50.100> low<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.090> being

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
skimming the ground low and then being

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
skimming the ground low and then being
able<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> come<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.110> high<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.980> fun<00:00:53.219> just

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
placed its strength so going through

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.619

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.849 
tight places being able to run with it
and<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> other<00:01:01.289> thing<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.500> we've<00:01:01.680> really

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
and the other thing that we've really

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.130 
and the other thing that we've really
enjoyed<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.359> because<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:03.809> using<00:01:03.930> two

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
enjoyed is because we're using two

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.899 
enjoyed is because we're using two
operators<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.739> some<00:01:04.920> shots<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.460> person<00:01:05.790> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
operators for some shots the person is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
operators for some shots the person is
moving<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> camera<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.350> focus<00:01:07.470> on

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
moving the camera can really focus on

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
moving the camera can really focus on
not<00:01:08.040> falling<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.729> i<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.240> focus

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
not falling you know i can really focus

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
not falling you know i can really focus
on<00:01:09.659> sprinting<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.500> fast<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.770> i<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:10.950> not

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
on sprinting going as fast as i can not

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
on sprinting going as fast as i can not
tripping<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> cat<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.659> kind<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> thing

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
tripping on the cat that kind of thing

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.800 
tripping on the cat that kind of thing
and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.000> person<00:01:15.000> running<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> controls

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and then the person running the controls

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
and then the person running the controls
sitting<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> monitor<00:01:17.040> completely

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sitting at the monitor completely

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.070 
sitting at the monitor completely
focused<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> framing<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.049> can

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
focused on framing you know so they can

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
focused on framing you know so they can
completely<00:01:19.530> dedicate<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.850> it's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
completely dedicate because it's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
completely dedicate because it's
difficult<00:01:21.150> sometimes<00:01:21.390> when<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:21.869> high

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
difficult sometimes when you're high

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
difficult sometimes when you're high
action<00:01:22.200> scenes<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.799> running<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> camera<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
action scenes and running the camera you

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.340 
action scenes and running the camera you
can't<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.720> you're<00:01:24.869> dividing<00:01:25.259> your

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
can't you know you're dividing your

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.920 
can't you know you're dividing your
attention<00:01:25.409> between<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:26.130> dying<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.930> trying

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
attention between not dying and trying

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
attention between not dying and trying
to<00:01:28.049> make<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> nice<00:01:28.409> frame<00:01:28.650> there<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.729> what

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to make a nice frame there it's in what

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.550 
to make a nice frame there it's in what
we<00:01:30.329> call<00:01:30.509> majestic<00:01:30.900> mode<00:01:31.049> right<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.259> where

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we call majestic mode right now where

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
we call majestic mode right now where
it's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> single<00:01:32.009> operator<00:01:32.280> setup<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.420> pan

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
it's a single operator setup so as I pan

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's a single operator setup so as I pan
the<00:01:34.650> unit<00:01:34.890> pans<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.310> me<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.610> smooths<00:01:35.939> out

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the unit pans with me but smooths out

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.940 
the unit pans with me but smooths out
the<00:01:36.210> pan<00:01:36.570> makes<00:01:36.930> nice<00:01:37.110> smooth<00:01:37.470> starts<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the pan makes nice smooth starts and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.990 
the pan makes nice smooth starts and
stops<00:01:38.100> oh<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> question<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> lot<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.909> people

stops oh it's a question a lot of people
had<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> use<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> single<00:01:40.409> operator

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
had is can I use it as a single operator

interesting<00:01:52.740> creative<00:01:52.950> shots<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.490> think

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
interesting creative shots with I think

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700 
interesting creative shots with I think
it<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:54.020> definitely<00:01:55.020> work<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> work<00:01:55.470> nicely

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
it can definitely work and work nicely

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.780 
it can definitely work and work nicely
with<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:55.979> Steadicam<00:01:56.369> we've<00:01:56.520> had<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> on

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
with the Steadicam we've had it on

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.880 
with the Steadicam we've had it on
Steadicam<00:01:57.210> arm<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:58.229> gimbal<00:01:58.530> mounted<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.860> the

Steadicam arm they gimbal mounted to the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.620 
Steadicam arm they gimbal mounted to the
arm<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.880> works<00:02:00.030> well<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
arm and it works well I don't think it's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.799 
arm and it works well I don't think it's
a<00:02:00.659> replacement<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> study<00:02:01.439> camel
