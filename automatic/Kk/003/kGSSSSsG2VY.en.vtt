today we're checking out the pro 271
would<00:00:06.000> back<00:00:06.210> from<00:00:06.930> Easton<00:00:08.179> first<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.300> look<00:00:09.420> at

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
would back from Easton first we look at

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.810 
would back from Easton first we look at
that's<00:00:09.660> design<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.500> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> 271

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
that's design this is going to be a 271

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.270 
that's design this is going to be a 271
turn<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.929> send<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> one-turn<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.860> going<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.099> have

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
turn to send a one-turn is going to have

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.939 
turn to send a one-turn is going to have
kind<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.700> medium<00:00:15.120> handle<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.750> bigger<00:00:16.650> knob

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
kind of a medium handle a bigger knob

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.160 
kind of a medium handle a bigger knob
and<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> long<00:00:18.510> taper<00:00:18.900> into

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and it's going to have a long taper into

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.529 
and it's going to have a long taper into
a<00:00:19.320> medium<00:00:19.770> barrel<00:00:20.100> 270<00:00:20.939> ones<00:00:21.150> are<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> know

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
a medium barrel 270 ones are you know

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.820 
a medium barrel 270 ones are you know
notorious<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.199> being<00:00:22.320> some<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> more

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
notorious for being some of the more

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.210 
notorious for being some of the more
balanced<00:00:23.220> bat<00:00:23.900> transitioning<00:00:24.900> from<00:00:25.220> aluminum

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
balanced bat transitioning from aluminum

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.250 
balanced bat transitioning from aluminum
or<00:00:26.400> non<00:00:26.760> wood<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.269> wood<00:00:27.300> sometimes<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.109> tough

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
or non wood to wood sometimes it's tough

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.519 
or non wood to wood sometimes it's tough
so<00:00:28.650> 271<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.580> great<00:00:30.029> great<00:00:30.779> bad<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.349> somebody

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
so 271 is a great great bad for somebody

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.930 
so 271 is a great great bad for somebody
that's<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.949> used<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> swing<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.669> would<00:00:32.759> bet

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that's not used to swing and would bet

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479 
that's not used to swing and would bet
so<00:00:33.480> we're<00:00:34.350> looking<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> design

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so we're looking at the kind of design

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.860 
so we're looking at the kind of design
on<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> coolest<00:00:36.450> things<00:00:36.750> at

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
on this one of the coolest things at

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
on this one of the coolest things at
easton<00:00:37.140> did<00:00:37.290> right<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.920> they<00:00:38.100> invest<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
easton did right now is they invest a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.490 
easton did right now is they invest a
lot<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.030> maintenance<00:00:39.149> new<00:00:39.420> laser<00:00:39.629> engraver<00:00:40.079> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
lot of maintenance new laser engraver so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.840 
lot of maintenance new laser engraver so
every<00:00:41.010> bad<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.640> laser

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
every bad it's going to be laser

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.340

out here is the inc dot you see this a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
out here is the inc dot you see this a
lot<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.710> times<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> pros<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:15.210> while<00:01:15.689> back

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
lot of times in the pros a while back

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
lot of times in the pros a while back
they<00:01:16.110> had<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.409> problems<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.770> maple<00:01:17.220> bats

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
they had some problems with maple bats

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
they had some problems with maple bats
breaking<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> lot<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.240> they<00:01:18.900> did<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.259> whole

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
breaking a lot and they did this whole

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
breaking a lot and they did this whole
research<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
research and that is you know the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
research and that is you know the
determined<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.290> had<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.369> hit

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
determined that you had to you know hit

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
determined that you had to you know hit
on<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> certain<00:01:24.119> spot<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> maple<00:01:24.659> bad<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
on a certain spot of a maple bad to to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260 
on a certain spot of a maple bad to to
decrease<00:01:26.100> breakage<00:01:26.580> well<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.880> ink<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
decrease breakage well this ink that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.569 
decrease breakage well this ink that
allows<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:29.009> way<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> grain

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
allows them to see which way the grain

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.800 
allows them to see which way the grain
is<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.479> something<00:01:30.600> that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
is going and this is something that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.190
