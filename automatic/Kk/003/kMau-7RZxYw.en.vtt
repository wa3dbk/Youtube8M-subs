00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.950
 But it is 2 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.360
 If you don't have anything, the numbers that I think fall apart are the highest for the aces Yes 11 for the shopkeeper Heavy Mie 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.840
 Last O similar stand 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.819
 Even outside of the most back in as long as 2 to have the ace 2 medium in the state 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.650
 It's a stop thing and this 1 pair is next in the place with a monster card 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:35.040
 The same amount as a fair school can do 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.590
 Next to this flash card is three romance spades and challenges in the hall 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.660
 It is the same mark 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.730
 I'm going to take it straight and this is the number lock 78 or 9011 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.040
 I mean, for example 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.030
 Even though you distress even in the very rough straight 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.109
 I said that the face is the strongest, for example , I happened to think that the same flash 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.920
 It is a dealer 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:03:01.170
 If you say which one is stronger If you have a card yes 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.410
 A tree of three with the same number in addition to the same thing 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.410
 Red India 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:16.319
 The same deer horn pattern is the same as it is the strongest that the numbers are continuous and it is different from that flash 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.830
 For example, the same entertain am here the amount obtained by multiplying here when I thought myself with the hand is be nice 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.450
 Yup 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:26.520
 When you thought it was bad even by the inverse when the game is 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.970
 This chip is the dealer's and issues here face down the card to say that General get off 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.220
 Will be taken 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:38.000
 It is said that there is one rule to bridge the same amount further when going on the game 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.110
 The effect of fishing is to identify your own card first attached 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.110
 Decide what to do 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.590
 If you are a fireman , put the card face down on the side of the Met post 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:56.140
 In this case , the chip put on the ante is recruited 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:00.700
 Conversely, if you look at the card and decide that you can win it 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.330
 Like this, put the card face down and place it on the pet post and add the same amount of chips as Ante 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.090
 It is soon 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:09.129
 I'm not talking to myself 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:13.660
 In this case, the player has one pair leader in the chapter of the players in the Nopea 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:19.769
 It is a mechanism that bet and the same amount of chips can be obtained if you win the leader 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.769
 It's important to say that you can draw to ante before the cards are dealt
