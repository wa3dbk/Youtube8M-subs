00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is the suspension bridge is going up

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.229 
is the suspension bridge is going up
between<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:33.989> take<00:00:34.199> that<00:00:34.379> slack<00:00:35.059> wrap<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
between you will take that slack wrap it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.799 
between you will take that slack wrap it
once<00:00:36.739> twice<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.940> three<00:00:39.300> times<00:00:39.570> around

your<00:00:40.050> hand<00:00:40.699> so<00:00:41.699> you<00:00:41.820> should<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.949> three<00:00:43.949> loops

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
your hand so you should have three loops

your hand so you should have three loops
in<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.519> hand<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:46.190> well<00:00:47.190> you'll<00:00:47.339> do<00:00:47.460> from

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
in your hand like so well you'll do from

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.450 
in your hand like so well you'll do from
here<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> you'll<00:00:48.359> take<00:00:48.569> the<00:00:48.719> middle<00:00:48.989> rope

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
here is you'll take the middle rope

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.989 
here is you'll take the middle rope
using<00:00:50.460> your<00:00:50.699> thumb<00:00:52.039> place<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.069> makeup<00:00:53.760> make<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
using your thumb place a makeup make a

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.290 
using your thumb place a makeup make a
loop<00:00:54.239> above<00:00:54.569> the<00:00:55.199> top<00:00:55.440> rope

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
loop above the top rope

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.840 
loop above the top rope
you'll<00:00:57.300> down<00:00:57.479> take<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.780> new<00:00:57.899> middle<00:00:58.170> rope

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
you'll down take the new middle rope

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
you'll down take the new middle rope
pull<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.999> so<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.389> goes<00:01:00.710> makes<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.829> loop<00:01:01.949> below

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
pull it so it goes makes a loop below

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.800 
pull it so it goes makes a loop below
the<00:01:02.639> bottom<00:01:02.969> rope<00:01:03.619> take<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.739> middle<00:01:04.979> rope

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
the bottom rope take this middle rope

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.740 
the bottom rope take this middle rope
pull<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.899> above<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> top<00:01:07.439> rope<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.180> now<00:01:09.180> this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
pull it above the top rope and now this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.940 
pull it above the top rope and now this
will<00:01:09.899> be<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.079> fourth<00:01:10.350> time<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.740> pulling

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
will be the fourth time you're pulling

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
will be the fourth time you're pulling
the<00:01:11.040> middle<00:01:11.250> rope<00:01:11.430> it'll<00:01:12.240> grab<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> middle

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the middle rope it'll grab the middle

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.980 
the middle rope it'll grab the middle
rope<00:01:13.610> grab<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:15.030> loose<00:01:15.299> ends<00:01:15.570> right<00:01:15.930> here

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
rope grab the two loose ends right here

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
rope grab the two loose ends right here
and<00:01:16.530> you'll<00:01:17.430> pull<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> y

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and you'll pull and this will be the y

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
and you'll pull and this will be the y
Ehrman's<00:01:20.700> knot<00:01:21.140> once<00:01:22.140> you've<00:01:22.320> reached<00:01:22.500> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
Ehrman's knot once you've reached this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
Ehrman's knot once you've reached this
point<00:01:24.049> will<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.229> hook<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> carabiner<00:01:26.329> up<00:01:27.329> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
point will then hook the carabiner up to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.819 
point will then hook the carabiner up to
the<00:01:27.719> rope<00:01:27.899> bridge<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> extended<00:01:31.619> loop

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the rope bridge and to the extended loop

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.359 
the rope bridge and to the extended loop
on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.549> wire<00:01:32.729> moons<00:01:33.799> then<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> make<00:01:35.070> sure<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
on the wire moons then to make sure that

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.539 
on the wire moons then to make sure that
the<00:01:35.490> knot<00:01:35.640> doesn't<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.180> too<00:01:36.359> tight<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
the knot doesn't get too tight to

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.660 
the knot doesn't get too tight to
unravel

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
unravel

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.990 
unravel
when<00:01:38.880> you're<00:01:39.000> taking<00:01:39.270> down<00:01:39.359> the<00:01:39.479> bridge<00:01:41.000> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
when you're taking down the bridge you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.410 
when you're taking down the bridge you
will<00:01:42.090> take<00:01:42.359> two<00:01:42.719> carabiners<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.240> insert<00:01:45.240> them

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
will take two carabiners and insert them

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.410 
will take two carabiners and insert them
into<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.729> there's<00:01:47.729> there's<00:01:47.969> two<00:01:48.030> little

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
into the there's there's two little

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.660 
into the there's there's two little
bites<00:01:48.719> right<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.219> the<00:01:50.340> left<00:01:50.520> side

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
bites right here one on the left side

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
bites right here one on the left side
one<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.390> side<00:01:51.679> you'll<00:01:52.679> insert<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
one on the right side you'll insert a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.480 
one on the right side you'll insert a
carabiner<00:01:53.719> into<00:01:54.719> each<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.020> these<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> one

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
carabiner into each of these so that one

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
carabiner into each of these so that one
the<00:01:56.579> rope<00:01:56.789> when<00:01:56.999> that<00:01:57.179> when<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.359> Lyman's<00:01:57.689> knot

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
the rope when that when the Lyman's knot

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.889 
the rope when that when the Lyman's knot
gets<00:01:57.960> tight<00:01:58.259> enough<00:01:59.390> they'll<00:02:00.390> still<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.659> some

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
gets tight enough they'll still be some

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.889 
gets tight enough they'll still be some
slack<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.439> these<00:02:01.829> carabiners<00:02:02.399> will<00:02:03.179> be

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
slack because these carabiners will be

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.359 
slack because these carabiners will be
hold<00:02:04.109> be<00:02:04.259> holding<00:02:04.530> holding<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.920> together

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
hold be holding holding this together

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.050 
hold be holding holding this together
so

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
so

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.250 
so
that<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.830> wire<00:02:10.830> Miz<00:02:11.069> not
