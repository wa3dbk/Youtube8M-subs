is have these nice straight units before
we<00:01:43.409> begin<00:01:43.799> putting<00:01:44.040> things<00:01:44.310> together<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.360> what

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
we begin putting things together so what

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.429 
we begin putting things together so what
we're<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.890> come<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:48.439> line

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
we're going to do is come in here line

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.889 
we're going to do is come in here line
up<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.009> line<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:50.939> ruler<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.780> of

up the line on your ruler with one of
your<00:01:51.990> seams<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.130> make<00:01:53.310> straight

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
your seams so that we can make straight

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.959 
your seams so that we can make straight
clean<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.960> cut<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> end<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:58.380> goes<00:01:58.680> away

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
clean the cut at the end this goes away

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.370 
clean the cut at the end this goes away
now<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.149> we've<00:02:00.270> got<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> nice<00:02:00.780> straight<00:02:01.350> edge

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
now that we've got a nice straight edge

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.139 
now that we've got a nice straight edge
will<00:02:02.219> turn<00:02:02.490> our<00:02:02.700> strip<00:02:03.540> set<00:02:03.780> around<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.149> for

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
will turn our strip set around and for

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.789 
will turn our strip set around and for
this<00:02:06.420> project<00:02:06.930> we're<00:02:07.110> cutting<00:02:07.409> four<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.770> a

allowance here that way you know you
have<00:02:26.910> perfect<00:02:27.420> right<00:02:27.630> angle<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:29.520> you'll<00:02:29.790> go

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
have perfect right angle and you'll go

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.550 
have perfect right angle and you'll go
along<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.480> you'll<00:02:30.690> cut<00:02:30.959> four<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> half

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.280 
along and you'll cut four and a half
inch<00:02:32.780> segments<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:35.640> will<00:02:35.850> need<00:02:36.060> eight<00:02:36.990> of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
inch segments and you will need eight of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.780 
inch segments and you will need eight of
them<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:37.980> project<00:02:40.190> okay<00:02:41.190> now<00:02:41.490> that<00:02:41.700> we

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
them for this project okay now that we

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.090 
them for this project okay now that we
have<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:44.570> segment<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.950> we're

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
have the segment like this what we're

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.830 
have the segment like this what we're
going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> do<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.580> look<00:02:47.790> at<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.360> block<00:02:48.660> these

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
going to do is look at this block these

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.260 
going to do is look at this block these
blocks<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.380> say<00:02:49.530> hmm<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.550> center's<00:02:50.940> are<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
blocks and say hmm the center's are the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.080 
blocks and say hmm the center's are the
same<00:02:51.510> as<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.620> see<00:02:52.800> here<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.910> there<00:02:54.060> are

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
same as you see here but there are

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.590 
same as you see here but there are
additional<00:02:54.390> pieces<00:02:54.870> put<00:02:55.320> onto<00:02:55.470> each<00:02:55.820> so<00:02:56.820> for

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
additional pieces put onto each so for

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.170 
additional pieces put onto each so for
this<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.080> we<00:02:58.290> have<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.650> light<00:02:58.980> turquoise<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.970> a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
this one we have a light turquoise and a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.500 
this one we have a light turquoise and a
small<00:03:00.510> square<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:02.070> long<00:03:02.400> bar<00:03:02.910> shape<00:03:03.270> there

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
small square and a long bar shape there

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.750 
small square and a long bar shape there
that's<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.810> dark<00:03:04.020> turquoise<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.580> we're

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
that's a dark turquoise so and we're

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.520 
that's a dark turquoise so and we're
beginning<00:03:06.239> especially<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.870> lot<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.170> times<00:03:07.380> what

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
beginning especially a lot of times what

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.949 
beginning especially a lot of times what
we'll<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:08.010> actually<00:03:08.820> orient<00:03:09.540> our<00:03:09.690> blocks

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
we'll do is actually orient our blocks

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.840 
we'll do is actually orient our blocks
to<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.440> diagrams<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.100> are<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
to the diagrams that are in the in the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.030 
to the diagrams that are in the in the
patterns<00:03:12.239> make<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.080> look<00:03:13.260> exactly<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.920> same

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
patterns make it look exactly the same

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.070 
patterns make it look exactly the same
so<00:03:15.290> we've<00:03:16.290> got<00:03:17.209> two<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.420> half<00:03:18.570> inch<00:03:18.750> square

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
so we've got two and a half inch square

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.350 
so we've got two and a half inch square
six<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.739> half<00:03:19.769> inches<00:03:20.100> rectangle<00:03:21.000> an<00:03:21.120> eight

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
six and a half inches rectangle an eight

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.479 
six and a half inches rectangle an eight
and<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> half<00:03:21.570> inch<00:03:21.840> rectangle<00:03:22.350> here<00:03:22.500> simple

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
and a half inch rectangle here simple

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.660 
and a half inch rectangle here simple
seaming<00:03:23.880> again<00:03:24.180> you're<00:03:25.080> going<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.410> join<00:03:26.310> this

seaming again you're going to join this

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.420 
seaming again you're going to join this
piece<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.239> seam<00:03:27.510> here<00:03:28.010> press<00:03:29.010> your<00:03:29.220> seam

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
piece of the seam here press your seam

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.509 
piece of the seam here press your seam
allowance<00:03:29.880> outward<00:03:30.540> add<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:31.650> block<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.340> the

end stitch here press open and you'll
have<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.180> block<00:03:36.360> then<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.200> also<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.560> you

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
have that block then you also if you

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.100 
have that block then you also if you
need<00:03:37.950> for<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.790> look<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.269> for<00:03:39.930> that
