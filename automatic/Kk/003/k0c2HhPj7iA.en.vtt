00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello and welcome to the great 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.250
 role in this video is back in 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.500
 around a fundamental topic and indeed around 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.360
 the decrease of stitches is actually 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.860
 very easy and show in this video 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.219
 I like you short and sweet as the whole 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.889
 going 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.410
 I have ten stitches here 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.210
 that's just easier 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.060
 I crocheted 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.680
 simple tight stitches and the whole 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.510
 works with all other states 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.289
 so also announce chopsticks or 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.550
 whole chopsticks or even bigger ones 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.369
 female chopsticks works that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.649
 whole as well as I said ten 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.890
 I recorded and I'm doing one now 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.620
 Turn mesh and then blow around and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.870
 Crochet the back and then I show 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.579
 you how to take the whole thing off so how 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.649
 one then after a round still the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.120
 half of stitches or if they are in 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.000
 the instructions are of course different 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 how to decrease mesh 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.329
 So if you are in the guide 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 is a mesh from no nee so the mesh 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 Remove or purchasers is going on her 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.700
 take it in and pick up the thread 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.010
 the crochet hook and does not do it now 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 the whole thing is going to be abnormal 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.220
 Get it now and I'll go through it all together 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.590
 pull through sleep 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.470
 that does not make it to her in this case 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.509
 go in the next stitch probably the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.540
 Thread through there and have now 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.939
 three envelopes on the needle and makes 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.750
 now all had in common from the time 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.990
 lose weight 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.890
 you now have these two stitches 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.330
 one made 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.229
 I'll do the same for the next one 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.860
 both also through the colors 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.390
 pick up 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.990
 on the needle in the next stitch too 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.890
 Get the thread through it ready to get on it 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.890
 and here, too, all human beings pass through 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.050
 The three decrease you go through 3 by 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.960
 has a total of four errors on the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.840
 needle and takes all likes makes all 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:10.509
 together from here again by 1 through 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:12.910
 have through the second through and remove 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.280
 I have a total of three stitches and me 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.620
 I have already finished six stitches 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.390
 shows up now are 31 23 for the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.030
 next round into the next one in 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.650
 the next round can and have below 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.750
 I already worked 123456 people 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.790
 you I will continue it with seven and 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:41.430
 Get through eight again here, too 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.870
 pick it up and knit it all off 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.730
 the whole is then runs as a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.700
 There is a little bit in the bow together 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.700
 same and here also nine and ten 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.700
 pull through 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:06.930
 here the last three is it 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.980
 and by a bottle now I have 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.650
 12345 mesh above 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.769
 I 'll take the walls again 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.470
 Dreas all and crochet here now 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.769
 above 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.769
 through each stitch once and have 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:30.420
 then how the same looks a mesh one 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:43.379
 firm mesh the second solid mesh the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:46.200
 third solid mesh here the fourth and 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.260
 here the fifth so you see I have 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.510
 all meshes have been removed now 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.319
 the half as at the beginning of the bottom 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.780
 I would have 10 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.370
 then I took off here and got 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.540
 now here in the third row only 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.550
 five solid stitches 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.200
 So it will decrease as I said at 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.250
 half sticks to the whole one too 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.280
 then it works but so 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.520
 her the bottom half of it 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.620
 makes normal and then the the 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.570
 The last point does not make so 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.880
 but wash the envelopes on the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.980
 needle-leave and then everything together from 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.450
 mesh 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.860
 whoever wants to see the other one is driving 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.120
 I just comment on it myself 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.290
 I also like to do it all over again 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.650
 show a video if you are interested 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.210
 you and you else you just watch channel 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.530
 Maybe realist has minako over 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.810
 I'm happy about that, of course 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.680
 always on until the next one 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.680
 stop all wool
