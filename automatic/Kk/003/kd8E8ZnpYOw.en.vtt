00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
before batch two came out I got quite a

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.470 
before batch two came out I got quite a
lot<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.290> brawlers<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:47.459> I've<00:02:47.610> patched<00:02:47.910> after

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
lot of brawlers but I've patched after

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.539 
lot of brawlers but I've patched after
batch<00:02:48.630> 2<00:02:48.840> i've<00:02:48.959> only<00:02:49.110> gotten<00:02:49.380> three<00:02:50.010> pairs<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.729 
batch 2 i've only gotten three pairs and
i<00:02:50.640> think<00:02:50.849> 50<00:02:51.239> ml<00:02:51.360> XP<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.349> think<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.650> was

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
i think 50 ml XP and I think that was

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.680 
i think 50 ml XP and I think that was
guilty<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.190> then<00:02:53.370> two<00:02:53.549> hunters<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.390> although

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
guilty and then two hunters so although

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.509 
guilty and then two hunters so although
