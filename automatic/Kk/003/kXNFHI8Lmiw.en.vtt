 I wanted to ask the other admiral 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.009
 what is his relationship with swimming but 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.140
 look at swimming then 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.240

 a complete sport of moves all 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.479

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.829
 a center but the doctor tells us side 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.689
 marinaro marinaro he made a 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.729
 nude portrait of that short procession 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.070
 our environment that this is the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.290
 photomodel and this is a great lady 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.700
 here I want 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.520
 these two beautiful women are not a council 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.720
 beautiful ladies and if you want caps 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.270
 for the ears then I can do them 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.280
 and this tells us about the street 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.830
 he's right you're right 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.850
 our attention is not nice 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.130
 see is not a used admiral sorry 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.840
 come back together they complain about a flag 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.060
 white because today we can bathe 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.480
 we are attacking the white flag la 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.000
 above here is therefore removed the prohibition of 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.260
 bathing and tgtg also olino is that it is 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.260
 surrounded by beautiful women 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.530
 olindo and I don't understand why you got it 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.390
 very good professional but I don't understand 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.770
 now dinners like nobody said 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.960
 what they call you the pleasant are said 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.100
 no one swears inter the prosecution that 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.020
 who doesn't go for a walk in 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.640
 tangential now through we have 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.560
 interrupted, however, neat filippi who was 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.810
 saying today before you talk about it 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.060
 want moment the inter agrees with 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.040
 admiral the fate of the admiral 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.310
 here and then the whole good use I wanted 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.750
 just to say that I have the two armrests almost 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.489
 therefore still unforgettable Giolica does 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.380
 thefts I would like to understand why so much 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.510
 people smile here maybe it escaped 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.970
 something yes because there is pippo that affects 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.810
 nurturing and beneficial and the framed 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:37.070
 as famous and directed and it is pablo 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.140
 always yours but pablo lives to seize 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.470
 none of us three in anyway chestnut 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.860
 but someone wants pippo put on 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.600
 hand in front of percent everywhere 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.350
 here when I was training it I didn't have the 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.209
 belly but I do not tell you I do not say 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.459
 because I'm here, I'm 40 alone 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.459
 gallican dinar boys 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:07.030
 after being a pupil of olindo 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.799
 filippi went to the community I wanted 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.719
 also compliment pio colli because 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.709
 finally out of the nocino tunnel 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:17.919
 admiral did it but for me I have 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.880
 had the considerations that I aim for 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.280
 I had seen before 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.840
 it is not the chievo we know is not the 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.610
 I need to make a match for 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.930
 to win 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.820
 let's keep them free I didn't see 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.680
 dangerous conclusions I have not seen 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.770
 goalkeeper saves 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.180
 they are steadfast therefore they play by heart 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.250
 and rest assured 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.259
 and we who play badly do not have a 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.410
 support in midfield we do not have 1 pt 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.410
 median long ball, beat and retort 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.030
 the other results are beautiful 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.009
 they are the same gigi is a chievo that stands 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.650
 suffering the second at this time 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.449
 wood always caught by cerci in turin 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.160
 rome free kick 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.470
 also in this case churchill abbot 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.240
 masterfully stekelenburg with the tip 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.849
 of the fingers of the hands it deviates to it 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.919
 cross and then carom out I will make a 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.229
 you are really looking for a state of grace 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.960
 holding on the turin together with rolando 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:14.800
 white and of course also in the photo 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.870
 our admiral according to the apple stands 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.449
 at the edge of the penalty area leaves 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.849
 starting a round trip that goes to 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.250
 finish the crossing of the poles and can not 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:31.780
 nothing the beautiful Turin goalkeeper 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:35.080
 this with torino 1 before giving the 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.570
 line to the true authentic the original 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.590
 Admiral, I wanted to ask Isabella 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.690
 what is your relationship with football 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.770
 as we know no changes in this 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.770
 great passion for the world 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.050
 but we want everything you turn to 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.690
 to know I am also that you are a one 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:06.490
 you are still a former arena dancer 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:09.000
 this passion was able to see today the 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.000
 its quality 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:21.480
 a real today washes that the other my part 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.480
 there is someone who 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.300
 when part of the official uniform i 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.750
 white gloves themselves and for driving 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.060
 better to have more and maneuverability of the 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.610
 rudder as did professionalism 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.710
 they are then in national events 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.230
 you see the admiral with the gloves 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.470
 White is in fact a white voice 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.780
 divided when there are fashion shows you see 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:54.580
 the and the admiral who looks like a fly 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.900
 white everyone is black gray 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.670
 white bacteria charm that make the 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.640
 divided but what difference does it pass through 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.260
 example among your grades that they would be 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.600
 admiral and the other admiral fall 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:10.030

 he and vessel lieutenants see that not 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.110
 in grades so he is your subject 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:21.850
 it's like no he must be careful in the 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.310
 they are really students 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.860

 I understood why he left off 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.210
