00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.480
 how does it work? 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.960
 shutter in the room 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.960
 and they actually decide 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.369
 8 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.379
 but then behind the mirror 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.810
 and for 6 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.160
 not that most people don't know that and if the chance is that themselves 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.920
 ref 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.940
 a few opponents on the internet, but that's good 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.299
 looks like and how that actually works 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 That 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.180
 not a typical woman 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.790
 I want to show how the practice works 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.960
 stated here 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.100
 this is possible up to a thousandth of a second 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 voc with some free time two seconds 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 with a second in ten seconds only active member 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.980
 so come 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 and there is a piece 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 but what i show a club in brussels 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.990
 is that a German one coming from us 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 By the way, so fast is good 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.880
 a disgrace 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.900
 so fast 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.180
 goes 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 you have seen that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.470
 don't go have the motion 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.310
 currently viewing in the images per second 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.220
 this movie has been recorded 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.530
 in 2010 wants the issue 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.110
 and you see next 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.040
 Press on the button 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.070
 South is going to open the poem but that happens even more things that relationship 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.540
 is time span 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 afterwards a roll continues on the right 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.910
 here you see south opens 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.920
 the bike is going to take off and that stumbled on the street and then it closes 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.260
 and then frames 50 again 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.700
 together for a long time during a wild best could 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.370
 here at the front 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.370
 fact not press the button first the mirror goes up 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 that question needs to be adjusted at the same time then only goes open flash and time 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.389
 stopped 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.969
 and palm is back in position six hours 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.509
 that you can look through the lens again 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.209
 that's what happened 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.809
 the decision
