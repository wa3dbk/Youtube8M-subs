unraveled<00:02:49.299> see<00:02:50.299> like<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:51.579> so<00:02:52.579> next<00:02:53.230> we're

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
unraveled see like that so next we're

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.580 
unraveled see like that so next we're
going<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.650> use<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.609> acetone<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.600> nail<00:02:57.170> polish

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
convos which pop you a little a little

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.059 
convos which pop you a little a little
more<00:03:03.019> convenient<00:03:03.350> but<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:04.989> have<00:03:05.989> q-tips

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.459 

it's<00:03:10.000> all<00:03:10.120> weird<00:03:10.209> use<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.689> dip<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.079> little<00:03:11.110> bit

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:11.469 
it's all weird use this dip a little bit

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.670 
it's all weird use this dip a little bit
it<00:03:12.219> will<00:03:12.310> actually<00:03:12.489> quite<00:03:12.819> a<00:03:12.849> bit<00:03:13.680> pretty

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
it will actually quite a bit pretty

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.780 
it will actually quite a bit pretty
generous<00:03:15.219> amount<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.930> then<00:03:17.500> on<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.609> other

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
generous amount and then on the other

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.630 
generous amount and then on the other
side<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.180> Jersey<00:03:19.719> so<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:21.310> know<00:03:21.430> just

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
side of the Jersey so you know just

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.520 
side of the Jersey so you know just
inside<00:03:22.030> out

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
inside out

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.619 
inside out
just<00:03:23.530> rub<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.219> little<00:03:24.370> bit<00:03:24.519> along<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.590> edge<00:03:26.590> of

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
just rub a little bit along the edge of

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.819 
just rub a little bit along the edge of
the<00:03:28.629> patch<00:03:31.230> you're<00:03:32.230> saying<00:03:32.439> a<00:03:32.500> little<00:03:32.709> bit

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
the patch you're saying a little bit

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.800 
the patch you're saying a little bit
actually<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.280> mean<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.489> lot<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:36.450> what<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.569> does

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
actually I mean a lot and what this does

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.670 
actually I mean a lot and what this does
it<00:03:38.200> melts<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.920> he<00:03:39.250> says<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:40.569> glue<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.470> makes

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
it melts that he says the glue it makes

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.369 
it melts that he says the glue it makes
it<00:03:41.799> easier<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.129> come<00:03:42.340> off<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.049> should<00:03:44.230> be

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
it easier to come off so you should be

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:55.530 
it easier to come off so you should be
able<00:03:44.439> to<00:03:44.530> just<00:03:44.680> peel<00:03:45.129> it<00:03:45.159> off<00:03:45.519> like<00:03:46.919> so

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.300 

and<00:03:56.049> once<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.290> get<00:03:56.379> a<00:03:56.439> good<00:03:56.590> start<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.159> you

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
and once you get a good start to it you

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.440 
and once you get a good start to it you
can<00:03:57.430> actually<00:03:57.519> just<00:03:57.819> peel<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.299> off<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:01.090> if<00:04:01.269> it

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
can actually just peel it off but if it

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.929 
can actually just peel it off but if it
starts<00:04:01.840> getting<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.200> little<00:04:02.319> too<00:04:02.950> hard<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.760> talk

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
starts getting a little too hard to talk

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.289 
starts getting a little too hard to talk
off<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.450> would<00:04:05.170> just<00:04:05.319> apply<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.709> little<00:04:05.829> more

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
off I would just apply a little more

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.759 
off I would just apply a little more
that<00:04:07.299> we<00:04:07.420> don't<00:04:07.629> Jam<00:04:07.810> it's<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.230> material<00:04:08.379> the

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
that we don't Jam it's the material the

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.789 
that we don't Jam it's the material the
Jersey<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:10.989> this<00:04:11.140> actually<00:04:11.470> coming<00:04:11.709> off

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
Jersey but is this actually coming off

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.630 
Jersey but is this actually coming off
pretty<00:04:12.280> easy<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.890> our<00:04:14.890> seats<00:04:15.190> come<00:04:15.459> off

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
pretty easy so our seats come off

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.740 
pretty easy so our seats come off
completely<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.910> if<00:04:18.910> make<00:04:19.239> sure<00:04:19.389> you<00:04:19.510> got<00:04:19.720> all

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
completely and if make sure you got all

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.409 
completely and if make sure you got all
the<00:04:20.109> stitching<00:04:20.729> if<00:04:21.729> you<00:04:21.970> missed<00:04:22.150> anything

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
the stitching if you missed anything

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.740 
the stitching if you missed anything
just<00:04:23.699> go<00:04:24.699> back<00:04:24.910> with<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.210> seam<00:04:25.389> ripper<00:04:25.780> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
just go back with the seam ripper and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.270 
just go back with the seam ripper and
cut<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:29.470> don't<00:04:29.620> want<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.800> force<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.130> off

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
cut it you don't want to force it off

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.400 
cut it you don't want to force it off
because<00:04:30.520> then<00:04:30.729> you<00:04:30.850> might<00:04:31.060> ruin<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.449> material

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
because then you might ruin the material

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:41.270 
because then you might ruin the material
in<00:04:32.530> Jersey<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:34.060> would<00:04:34.270> be<00:04:34.389> bad

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.610
