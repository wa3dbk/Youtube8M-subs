00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and I don't think it's international

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.469 
and I don't think it's international
although<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> don't<00:01:15.119> use<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> for

unlimited data

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.899 
unlimited data
I<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> stipulation<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.130> $40<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> month

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
I think the stipulation for $40 a month

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
I think the stipulation for $40 a month
is<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.900> get<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> certain<00:01:22.470> data<00:01:22.650> speed<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
is that you get a certain data speed I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.039 
is that you get a certain data speed I
think<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.520> 3G<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> certain

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
think it's like 3G for up to a certain

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
think it's like 3G for up to a certain
amount<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.470> space<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.729> goes<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> like

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
amount of space and then it goes to like

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.819 
amount of space and then it goes to like
a<00:01:27.240> little<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> slower<00:01:27.930> internet<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.770> an

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
a little bit of a slower internet for an

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
a little bit of a slower internet for an
extra<00:01:29.009> 10<00:01:29.159> bucks<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:29.490> $50<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> month<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.329> could

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
extra 10 bucks or $50 a month you could

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.020 
extra 10 bucks or $50 a month you could
just<00:01:30.689> get<00:01:30.840> unlimited<00:01:31.110> fast<00:01:31.650> internet<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.850> um
