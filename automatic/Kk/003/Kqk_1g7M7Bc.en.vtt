00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.429 
as a groveler I think it's up it's one
of<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.640> better<00:01:43.759> growlers<00:01:44.240> out<00:01:44.450> there<00:01:44.689> I<00:01:44.869> have

of the better growlers out there I have
a<00:01:45.649> couple<00:01:45.829> things<00:01:46.039> about<00:01:46.159> it<00:01:46.369> that<00:01:46.399> I<00:01:46.520> didn't

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
a couple things about it that I didn't

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.700 
a couple things about it that I didn't
enjoy<00:01:46.880> as<00:01:47.119> much<00:01:47.299> though<00:01:47.509> going<00:01:48.229> back<00:01:48.469> and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
enjoy as much though going back and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.120 
enjoy as much though going back and
showing<00:01:49.009> you<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.280> tail<00:01:49.600> this<00:01:50.600> tail<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.320> so

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
showing you this tail this tail is so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.569 
showing you this tail this tail is so
wide<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.149> thick<00:01:53.509> that<00:01:53.859> it<00:01:54.859> is<00:01:55.130> really

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
wide and so thick that it is really

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.840 
wide and so thick that it is really
really<00:01:55.939> challenging<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:56.630> turn<00:01:57.369> again<00:01:58.369> great

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
really challenging to turn again great

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.429 
really challenging to turn again great
this<00:01:59.240> board<00:01:59.479> is<00:01:59.539> great<00:01:59.719> at<00:01:59.869> catching<00:01:59.990> at

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
this board is great at catching at

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.050 
this board is great at catching at
getting<00:02:00.770> waves<00:02:01.009> great<00:02:01.429> at<00:02:01.549> generating<00:02:01.850> speed

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
getting waves great at generating speed

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.779 
getting waves great at generating speed
but<00:02:02.390> once<00:02:02.509> I<00:02:02.659> want<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.899> do<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.049> turn<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:04.130> often

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
but once I want to do a turn I often

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.489 
but once I want to do a turn I often
just<00:02:05.060> couldn't<00:02:05.570> get<00:02:05.689> this<00:02:05.810> thing<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.170> stick<00:02:06.380> in

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
just couldn't get this thing to stick in

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.919 
just couldn't get this thing to stick in
the<00:02:06.560> water<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.979> is<00:02:07.159> just<00:02:07.399> enormous<00:02:07.909> ly<00:02:08.179> bulky

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
the water it is just enormous ly bulky

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.180 
the water it is just enormous ly bulky
and<00:02:09.080> huge

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
and huge

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.369 
and huge
similarly<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.390> nose<00:02:11.960> is<00:02:12.320> also<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.010> wide<00:02:13.640> that

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
similarly the nose is also so wide that

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.259 
similarly the nose is also so wide that

whenever I was in conditions where the

whenever I was in conditions where the
wave<00:02:17.450> face<00:02:17.690> was<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> little<00:02:18.230> bit<00:02:18.319> steeper<00:02:18.739> I

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
wave face was a little bit steeper I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.200 
wave face was a little bit steeper I
literally<00:02:19.610> couldn't<00:02:19.909> get<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
literally couldn't get the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.030 
literally couldn't get the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
to stick in the face now this board I

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.010 
to stick in the face now this board I
was<00:02:22.190> able<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.610> surf<00:02:22.880> up<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.450> larger<00:02:23.810> surf

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
was able to surf up in larger surf

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.540 
was able to surf up in larger surf
slightly<00:02:24.440> larger<00:02:24.770> even<00:02:25.010> up<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.250> overhead

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
slightly larger even up to overhead

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.300 
slightly larger even up to overhead
maybe<00:02:25.850> even<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.210> touch<00:02:26.450> over<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:27.680> couple<00:02:28.070> feet

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
maybe even a touch over a couple feet

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.790 
maybe even a touch over a couple feet
overhead<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:29.390> only<00:02:29.720> if<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.140> was<00:02:30.290> quite<00:02:30.500> flat

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
if it was steep again I just couldn't

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.210 
if it was steep again I just couldn't
get<00:02:32.720> into<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.110> with<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.410> nose<00:02:33.620> being<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:34.040> wide

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
get into it with this nose being as wide

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.100 
get into it with this nose being as wide
