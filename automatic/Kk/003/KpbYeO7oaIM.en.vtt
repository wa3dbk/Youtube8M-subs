the hill may not fit your definition of
king<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> hill<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.509> definitely<00:01:54.750> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
king of the hill but it's definitely you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.109 
king of the hill but it's definitely you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
you captions like I don't think that

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.920 
you captions like I don't think that

really fits into the battlefield kind of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
really fits into the battlefield kind of
ethos<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.439> how<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> works<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.399> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
ethos of how it works but you know that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.359 
ethos of how it works but you know that
might<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> evolution<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.960> things<00:02:07.369> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
might be in the evolution of things that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.190 
might be in the evolution of things that
could<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.520> something<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.910> modders<00:02:09.330> do<00:02:09.569> or

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
could be something that modders do or

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.720 
could be something that modders do or
something<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.860> if<00:02:11.160> they<00:02:11.280> open<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
something like that if they open the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.220 
something like that if they open the
game<00:02:11.879> back<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.450> modders<00:02:12.810> which<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.110> would

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
game back up to modders which I would

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.260 
game back up to modders which I would
love<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.379> see

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
love to see

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.360 
love to see
double-sided<00:02:15.270> rush<00:02:15.540> fantastic<00:02:16.500> idea<00:02:16.830> love

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
double-sided rush fantastic idea love

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.790 
double-sided rush fantastic idea love
double-sided<00:02:17.910> rush<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.260> balance<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
double-sided rush as a balance to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.200 
double-sided rush as a balance to
defensive<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.700> offensive<00:02:20.820> things<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:23.400> for

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
defensive and offensive things as for

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.520 
defensive and offensive things as for
the<00:02:24.300> support<00:02:24.570> class<00:02:24.690> having<00:02:24.990> more<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.350> role

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the support class having more of a role

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.170 
the support class having more of a role
especially<00:02:25.890> with<00:02:26.250> secondary<00:02:26.550> grenades<00:02:26.910> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
especially with secondary grenades I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.810 
especially with secondary grenades I
think<00:02:28.170> support<00:02:28.590> class<00:02:28.740> has<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> role<00:02:29.430> already

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
think support class has a role already

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.160 
think support class has a role already
and<00:02:29.970> that's<00:02:30.060> giving<00:02:30.390> people<00:02:30.660> ammo<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.080> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
and that's giving people ammo and you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.620 
and that's giving people ammo and you
talked<00:02:31.440> about<00:02:31.710> how<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.460> know<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.060> don't<00:02:33.330> do

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
talked about how you know you don't do

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.120 
talked about how you know you don't do
that<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.990> run<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.350> ammo<00:02:34.680> all<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.920> time

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
that I run out of ammo all the time

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.670 
that I run out of ammo all the time
that's<00:02:36.030> not<00:02:36.240> because<00:02:36.390> I'm<00:02:36.630> inaccurate<00:02:37.200> but

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
that's not because I'm inaccurate but

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.710 
that's not because I'm inaccurate but
that's<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.520> know<00:02:38.640> i<00:02:38.850> shooted<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.600> lot

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that's because you know i shooted a lot

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.700 
that's because you know i shooted a lot
of<00:02:39.840> things<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.470> don't<00:02:41.040> know<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.690> think<00:02:42.710> people

of things I don't know I think people

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.560 
of things I don't know I think people

that's winning a spawn protection that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.660 
that's winning a spawn protection that
 needs<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.740> go<00:03:19.890> that's<00:03:20.280> all<00:03:20.430> I'll<00:03:20.550> say

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
 needs to go that's all I'll say

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.460 
 needs to go that's all I'll say
about<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.780> stories<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.350> have

about that you have the stories you have
the<00:03:22.650> experience<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.880> needs<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.270> go<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the experience that needs to go and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.250 
the experience that needs to go and
you're<00:03:26.459> talking<00:03:26.790> about<00:03:27.000> further<00:03:27.750> along<00:03:28.020> here

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
you're talking about further along here

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.230 
you're talking about further along here
a<00:03:28.290> point<00:03:28.650> system<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.250> further<00:03:29.820> customization

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
a point system and further customization

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.710 
a point system and further customization
for<00:03:30.660> guns<00:03:30.870> um<00:03:31.880> how<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:32.910> feel<00:03:33.209> about<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:33.540> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
for guns um how I feel about that is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.690 
for guns um how I feel about that is
that<00:03:35.630> customizations<00:03:36.630> are<00:03:36.840> really<00:03:37.110> kind<00:03:37.320> of

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
that customizations are really kind of

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.670 
that customizations are really kind of
breaking<00:03:38.700> down<00:03:39.000> battlefield<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:40.020> think<00:03:40.410> you

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
breaking down battlefield I think you

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.340 
breaking down battlefield I think you
know<00:03:40.770> it's<00:03:41.040> making<00:03:41.820> it<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.660> hard<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:43.080> balance

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
know it's making it so hard to balance

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.110 
know it's making it so hard to balance
and<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:43.980> making<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.490> such<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:45.000> know

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
and it's making it such that you know

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.600 
and it's making it such that you know
you<00:03:45.570> have<00:03:45.840> guns<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.920> are<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.160> best<00:03:47.370> with

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
you have guns that are the best with

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.699 
you have guns that are the best with
this<00:03:47.850> attached<00:03:48.290> remittance<00:03:49.290> stuff<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.680> that

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
this attached remittance stuff like that

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.650 
this attached remittance stuff like that
and<00:03:50.070> guns<00:03:50.550> they<00:03:50.730> don't<00:03:50.940> really<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.330> place

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
and guns they don't really have a place

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.630 
and guns they don't really have a place
and<00:03:51.990> don't<00:03:52.080> get<00:03:52.290> used<00:03:52.500> much<00:03:52.709> like<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.580> know

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
and don't get used much like you know

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.370 
and don't get used much like you know
the<00:03:53.760> cage<00:03:53.970> 2002<00:03:54.780> which<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.990> know<00:03:55.050> some<00:03:55.350> people

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
the cage 2002 which I know some people

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.860 
the cage 2002 which I know some people
fit<00:03:55.770> like<00:03:56.190> each<00:03:56.430> gun<00:03:56.820> has<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.090> loyal<00:03:57.390> following

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
fit like each gun has a loyal following

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.030 
fit like each gun has a loyal following
but<00:03:58.440> m16<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.340> AEK<00:04:00.020> maybe<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.170> g3<00:04:01.560> sometimes

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
but m16 the AEK maybe the g3 sometimes

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.870 
but m16 the AEK maybe the g3 sometimes
I'm<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> personal<00:04:03.180> fan<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.480> g3<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.840> love<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.880> but

I'm a personal fan of g3 I love that but

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.460 
I'm a personal fan of g3 I love that but
you<00:04:06.060> know<00:04:06.090> those<00:04:06.390> are<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.750> good<00:04:07.080> guns

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
especially for the assault class you

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.690 
especially for the assault class you
know<00:04:09.060> engineer<00:04:09.930> has<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.260> m4<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.860> scar-h<00:04:11.160> and

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
know engineer has the m4 the scar-h and

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
the g36 support has the pkp and the m249

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.360 
the g36 support has the pkp and the m249
Wow<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:18.690> Recon<00:04:18.989> class<00:04:19.290> well<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:19.890> mean<00:04:20.100> that

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
Wow and the Recon class well I mean that

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.920 
Wow and the Recon class well I mean that
that's<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.910> one<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.120> actually<00:04:21.239> takes<00:04:21.570> skill

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
that's the one that actually takes skill

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.500 
that's the one that actually takes skill
learning<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.830> guns<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.400> think<00:04:24.150> with

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
learning the guns I think with

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.000 
learning the guns I think with
customization<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.350> problem<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:25.950> that

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
customization the problem is is that

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.440 
customization the problem is is that
nobody

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
nobody

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.950 
nobody
really<00:04:27.840> learns<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.350> guns<00:04:28.560> how<00:04:28.740> they<00:04:28.890> are<00:04:29.010> and

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
really learns the guns how they are and

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.240 
really learns the guns how they are and
such<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:31.290> have<00:04:31.470> different<00:04:31.800> guns<00:04:31.950> meant

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
such that you have different guns meant

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.060 
such that you have different guns meant
for<00:04:32.430> different<00:04:32.670> things<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:34.560> previous

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
for different things in previous

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.350 
for different things in previous
battlefields<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.700> was<00:04:35.790> such<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.240> know

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
battlefields it was such that you know

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.570 
battlefields it was such that you know
you<00:04:36.420> would<00:04:36.600> have<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:37.080> high<00:04:37.530> fire<00:04:37.800> rate<00:04:38.070> very

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
you would have a high fire rate very

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.940 
you would have a high fire rate very
inaccurate<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.270> long<00:04:39.360> distance<00:04:39.600> one<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.740> one
