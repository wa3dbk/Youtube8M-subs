00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
but wait what about fat loss this is the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.900 
but wait what about fat loss this is the
section<00:00:04.620> we've<00:00:04.890> all<00:00:05.160> been<00:00:05.370> waiting<00:00:05.520> for<00:00:05.700> right

if<00:00:06.569> you're<00:00:06.779> like<00:00:06.930> most<00:00:07.109> people<00:00:07.500> I'm<00:00:07.680> sure<00:00:08.160> you

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
if you're like most people I'm sure you

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.820 
if you're like most people I'm sure you
have<00:00:08.429> questions<00:00:08.929> how<00:00:09.929> do<00:00:09.990> i<00:00:10.110> optimize<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
have questions how do i optimize the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.620 
have questions how do i optimize the
amount<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.219> fat<00:00:11.429> I'd<00:00:11.639> burn<00:00:11.820> during<00:00:12.030> exercise

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630

how<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.530> train<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.070> fat<00:00:14.340> burning<00:00:14.759> zone

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
how do I train in my fat burning zone

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.060 
how do I train in my fat burning zone
working<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> low<00:00:16.289> intensity<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.890> really

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
working in a low intensity it really

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.179 
working in a low intensity it really
burns<00:00:17.190> more<00:00:17.460> fat<00:00:17.760> right<00:00:18.529> well<00:00:19.529> yes<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.980> does

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
burns more fat right well yes it does

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.980 
burns more fat right well yes it does
and<00:00:20.220> no<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.939> doesn't<00:00:21.270> depends<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.840> how<00:00:21.960> you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and no it doesn't depends on how you

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109 
and no it doesn't depends on how you

it's<00:01:19.259> all<00:01:19.380> relative<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.189> fat<00:01:20.400> loss<00:01:20.430> it's

for<00:02:03.270> fat<00:02:03.420> loss<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.990> hope<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:04.860> know<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.549> is

for fat loss I hope we all know this is

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.510 
for fat loss I hope we all know this is
not<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.090> true<00:02:06.530> sure<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.740> low<00:02:07.950> intensities

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
not to be true sure at low intensities

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.130 
not to be true sure at low intensities
you'll<00:02:08.700> burn<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> higher<00:02:09.149> percentage<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.929> fat

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you'll burn a higher percentage of fat

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.110 
you'll burn a higher percentage of fat
but<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.099> also<00:02:11.310> burn<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.879> lower<00:02:12.120> volley

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
into the idea that the machines could

energy<00:04:58.159> also<00:04:58.789> comes<00:04:59.030> from<00:04:59.120> burning<00:04:59.509> more<00:04:59.630> fat

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
energy also comes from burning more fat

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.290 
energy also comes from burning more fat
bringing<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.800> total<00:05:01.039> calories<00:05:01.699> of<00:05:01.849> fat<00:05:02.060> burn

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
bringing the total calories of fat burn

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.550 
bringing the total calories of fat burn
from<00:05:02.569> your<00:05:02.690> 60<00:05:03.020> minute<00:05:03.259> run<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.919> well<00:05:04.280> over<00:05:04.310> 250

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
from your 60 minute run to well over 250

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.170 
from your 60 minute run to well over 250
so<00:05:06.560> you're<00:05:06.710> looking<00:05:06.830> at<00:05:07.069> 200<00:05:07.550> calories<00:05:07.880> of<00:05:08.000> fat

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
so you're looking at 200 calories of fat

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.059 
so you're looking at 200 calories of fat
burn<00:05:08.389> during<00:05:08.599> a<00:05:08.780> walk<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.319> in<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.590> same<00:05:09.800> time

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
burn during a walk and in the same time

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.010 
burn during a walk and in the same time
over<00:05:10.909> 250<00:05:11.690> calories<00:05:11.870> burn<00:05:12.319> during<00:05:12.889> a<00:05:13.039> run<00:05:13.220> and

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
over 250 calories burn during a run and

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.240 
over 250 calories burn during a run and
because<00:05:15.020> you're<00:05:15.169> replenishing<00:05:15.770> your<00:05:15.800> energy

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
because you're replenishing your energy

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.309 
because you're replenishing your energy
stores<00:05:16.550> during<00:05:16.789> your<00:05:17.060> recovery<00:05:17.210> period<00:05:17.960> which

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
stores during your recovery period which

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.070 
stores during your recovery period which
occurs<00:05:18.650> of<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:18.919> lower<00:05:19.250> intensity<00:05:19.909> you're<00:05:20.630> doing

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
occurs of a lower intensity you're doing

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.260 
occurs of a lower intensity you're doing
so<00:05:21.289> by<00:05:21.500> utilizing<00:05:22.099> a<00:05:22.220> higher<00:05:22.490> percentage<00:05:22.849> of

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
so by utilizing a higher percentage of

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.469 
so by utilizing a higher percentage of
fat<00:05:24.190> additionally<00:05:25.190> during<00:05:25.370> recovery<00:05:25.759> you're

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
fat additionally during recovery you're

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.360 
fat additionally during recovery you're
working<00:05:26.840> at<00:05:26.930> a<00:05:27.020> lower<00:05:27.199> intensity<00:05:27.800> with<00:05:28.340> a

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
working at a lower intensity with a

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.490 
working at a lower intensity with a
higher<00:05:28.699> metabolism<00:05:29.050> because<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.169> just

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
higher metabolism because you just

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.899 
higher metabolism because you just
completed<00:05:31.070> an<00:05:31.219> interval<00:05:31.639> of<00:05:31.729> higher

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
completed an interval of higher

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.209 
completed an interval of higher
intensity<00:05:32.530> therefore<00:05:33.530> you're<00:05:33.949> also

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
intensity therefore you're also

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.249

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
workload but at a lower intensity which

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.890
