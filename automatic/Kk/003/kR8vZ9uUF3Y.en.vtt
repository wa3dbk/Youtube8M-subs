coverage foundation

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.289 
coverage foundation
at<00:04:14.900> least<00:04:15.080> in<00:04:15.290> my<00:04:15.769> opinion<00:04:15.980> because<00:04:16.669> I<00:04:16.850> have

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
at least in my opinion because I have

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.060 
at least in my opinion because I have
tried<00:04:18.109> on<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.290> lot<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.620> full<00:04:18.889> coverage

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
tried on a lot of full coverage

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.699 
tried on a lot of full coverage
foundations<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.449> doesn't<00:04:20.810> feel<00:04:21.139> as<00:04:21.470> light

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
foundations and it doesn't feel as light

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.640 
foundations and it doesn't feel as light
as<00:04:21.889> this<00:04:22.160> does<00:04:22.490> now<00:04:22.940> I'm<00:04:23.360> not<00:04:23.570> saying<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:24.080> it

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
as this does now I'm not saying that it

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.100 
as this does now I'm not saying that it
feels<00:04:25.310> really<00:04:25.760> light<00:04:26.060> but<00:04:26.419> if<00:04:26.570> you're<00:04:26.780> used<00:04:26.990> to

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
feels really light but if you're used to

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.960 
feels really light but if you're used to
wearing<00:04:27.290> foundation<00:04:27.979> it's<00:04:28.220> not<00:04:28.460> going<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.729> be

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
wearing foundation it's not going to be

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.230 
wearing foundation it's not going to be
as<00:04:29.270> heavy<00:04:29.990> as<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:30.290> would<00:04:31.250> think<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:31.699> is<00:04:31.910> at

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
as heavy as you would think it is at

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.900 
as heavy as you would think it is at
least<00:04:32.540> that<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.770> me<00:04:33.919> that<00:04:33.949> is<00:04:34.280> my<00:04:34.490> opinion

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
least that is to me that is my opinion

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.200

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.570 

all<00:04:49.850> right<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.470> end<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.340> night

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
all right so it is the end of the night

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.200 
all right so it is the end of the night
and<00:04:52.940> right<00:04:53.780> now<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.260> is<00:04:54.530> about<00:04:54.800> 1<00:04:55.580> o'clock<00:04:55.610> in

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
and right now it is about 1 o'clock in

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.900 
and right now it is about 1 o'clock in
the<00:04:56.300> morning<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.640> right<00:04:58.640> now<00:04:59.560> my<00:05:00.910> foundation

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
the morning and right now my foundation

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.430 
the morning and right now my foundation
still<00:05:02.420> looks<00:05:02.840> pretty<00:05:03.350> good<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:05.170> think<00:05:06.170> that<00:05:06.350> I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
still looks pretty good I think that I

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.610 
still looks pretty good I think that I
could<00:05:06.800> have<00:05:06.950> touched<00:05:07.580> up<00:05:07.970> on<00:05:08.210> my<00:05:08.540> t-zone<00:05:08.900> areas

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
could have touched up on my t-zone areas

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.650 
could have touched up on my t-zone areas
so<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:09.920> would<00:05:10.190> be<00:05:11.170> oily<00:05:12.170> but<00:05:12.860> I'm<00:05:13.190> not<00:05:13.400> as<00:05:13.700> oily

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
so I would be oily but I'm not as oily

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.850 
so I would be oily but I'm not as oily
and<00:05:15.910> my<00:05:16.910> blush<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:17.810> bronzer<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.530> my
