00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
about being smart but at this point the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.020 
about being smart but at this point the
six<00:02:23.500> races<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.950> go<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.099> lot<00:02:24.370> can<00:02:24.549> happen<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.000> I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
six races to go a lot can happen and I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.610 
six races to go a lot can happen and I
think<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.420> we're<00:02:25.569> on<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> I'm<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.319> attack

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
think that we're on the I'm the attack

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.820 
think that we're on the I'm the attack
not<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.890> defense<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.349> throw<00:02:29.349> away<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.650> moose

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
not the defense so throw away the moose

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.440 
not the defense so throw away the moose
drop<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.610> pressure<00:02:30.760> back<00:02:31.060> down<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.420> normal

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
drop the pressure back down to normal

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.809 
drop the pressure back down to normal
and<00:02:31.959> let's<00:02:32.500> get<00:02:32.620> after<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.190> felt<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.670> lot

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
and let's get after it and I felt a lot

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.539 
and let's get after it and I felt a lot
better<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.239> last<00:02:34.360> one<00:02:34.629> so<00:02:35.280> from<00:02:36.280> then<00:02:36.430> on

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
better in the last one so from then on

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.160 
better in the last one so from then on
and<00:02:36.790> luckily<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.299> know<00:02:37.330> we<00:02:37.569> didn't<00:02:37.930> get<00:02:38.019> any

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
and luckily you know we didn't get any

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.740 
and luckily you know we didn't get any
flat<00:02:38.379> tires<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:39.090> don't<00:02:40.090> even<00:02:40.180> know<00:02:40.329> if<00:02:40.390> anyone

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
flat tires I don't even know if anyone

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.680 
flat tires I don't even know if anyone
did<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.200> was<00:02:41.890> my<00:02:42.040> call<00:02:42.579> my<00:02:42.819> judgment<00:02:43.269> calls<00:02:43.450> so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
did so was my call my judgment calls so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.900 
did so was my call my judgment calls so
if<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.170> had<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> hat<00:02:44.470> got<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.739> flat<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.220> would<00:02:45.819> have

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
if I had a hat got a flat I would have

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.979 
if I had a hat got a flat I would have
had<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.180> live<00:02:46.329> with<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.810> would<00:02:46.870> have

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
had to live with it and I would have

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.720 
had to live with it and I would have
been<00:02:47.079> okay<00:02:47.319> with<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:47.799> I<00:02:48.250> had<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
been okay with that but I had a

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.039 
been okay with that but I had a
struggled<00:02:49.180> all<00:02:49.269> night<00:02:49.299> long<00:02:49.629> with<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.900> moose

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
struggled all night long with the moose

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.390 
struggled all night long with the moose
in<00:02:50.079> there<00:02:50.319> i<00:02:50.349> think<00:02:50.590> i<00:02:50.680> would<00:02:50.799> have<00:02:50.920> been

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
in there i think i would have been

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.650 
in there i think i would have been
pretty<00:02:51.519> frustrated

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.720 

you
