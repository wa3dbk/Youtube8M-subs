biggest<00:00:28.000> problem<00:00:28.509> of<00:00:28.599> this<00:00:28.810> set<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:29.350> that<00:00:29.680> it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
biggest problem of this set is that it's

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.159 
biggest problem of this set is that it's
too<00:00:30.070> good<00:00:30.279> you<00:00:30.610> can<00:00:30.820> point<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.510> camera<00:00:31.960> any

too good you can point the camera any

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.560 
too good you can point the camera any
direction<00:00:32.949> and<00:00:33.309> it's<00:00:33.520> nothing<00:00:34.030> but<00:00:34.059> layers

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
direction and it's nothing but layers

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.470 
direction and it's nothing but layers
layers<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.559> texture<00:00:35.949> it's<00:00:36.430> just<00:00:36.699> like<00:00:36.940> living

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
layers and texture it's just like living

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.000 
and made it look like an Egyptian Street
and<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.360> looks<00:00:56.570> profit<00:00:57.440> looking<00:00:57.860> their

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
and it looks profit looking their

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.099 
and it looks profit looking their
descriptor<00:00:58.730> but<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.210> first<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.780> to

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
descriptor but the first is to

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.259 
descriptor but the first is to
understand<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.739> mood<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.399> place<00:01:01.609> and

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
understand the mood of the place and

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.100 
understand the mood of the place and
then<00:01:02.690> we<00:01:02.719> improve<00:01:03.620> drawing<00:01:04.369> a<00:01:04.399> new<00:01:05.110> furniture

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
then we improve drawing a new furniture

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.700 
then we improve drawing a new furniture
for<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.250> set<00:01:07.490> when<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.210> office<00:01:08.450> gated<00:01:08.750> be<00:01:08.930> you

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
for the set when you office gated be you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.899 
for the set when you office gated be you
know<00:01:09.799> quite<00:01:09.950> an<00:01:10.100> important<00:01:10.520> set<00:01:10.729> in<00:01:10.850> the

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
know quite an important set in the

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.300 
know quite an important set in the
series<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.570> they<00:01:12.289> actually<00:01:12.500> built<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.100> quite

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
series and they actually built it quite

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.859 
series and they actually built it quite
quickly<00:01:13.460> they<00:01:13.789> built<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.180> about<00:01:14.539> almost

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
quickly they built it about almost

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.660 
quickly they built it about almost
several<00:01:15.200> weeks<00:01:15.350> I<00:01:15.590> think<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.070> painters

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
several weeks I think and the painters

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.130 
several weeks I think and the painters
painted<00:01:17.060> it<00:01:17.180> very<00:01:17.360> quick<00:01:17.539> with<00:01:17.659> very<00:01:17.899> short

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
painted it very quick with very short

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.030 
painted it very quick with very short
time

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040

colorful I think that the job that our

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.900 
colorful I think that the job that our
designers<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:43.950> done<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.490> set<00:01:44.729> is

designers have done on this set is

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.510 
designers have done on this set is
astonishing<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.290> an<00:01:46.380> actor<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.220> that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
astonishing for an actor it's not that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.219 
astonishing for an actor it's not that
much<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.030> leap<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.360> imagination<00:01:48.420> because

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
much of a leap of imagination because

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.770 
much of a leap of imagination because
you've<00:01:49.680> literally<00:01:50.190> got<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> plate<00:01:51.330> here
