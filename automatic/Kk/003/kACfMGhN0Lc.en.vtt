take<00:06:16.570> off<00:06:16.690> the<00:06:16.840> shader<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:19.320> see<00:06:20.320> what<00:06:20.440> they

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
take off the shader and see what they

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.050 
take off the shader and see what they
look<00:06:20.560> like<00:06:20.740> without<00:06:20.949> the<00:06:21.190> shader<00:06:21.430> on<00:06:21.639> I<00:06:21.820> bet

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
look like without the shader on I bet

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.480

they<00:06:22.180> look<00:06:22.330> pretty<00:06:22.720> similar<00:06:23.020> though<00:06:23.490> that's

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
they look pretty similar though that's

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.580 
they look pretty similar though that's
not<00:06:24.789> bad<00:06:25.090> looking<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:25.750> like<00:06:25.990> the<00:06:26.169> look<00:06:26.320> of<00:06:26.440> those
