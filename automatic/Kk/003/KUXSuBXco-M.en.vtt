the corner mount positions in the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.469 
the corner mount positions in the
plastic<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.460> simply<00:01:54.820> drill<00:01:55.060> through<00:01:55.299> those

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
plastic you simply drill through those

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.569 
plastic you simply drill through those
we're<00:01:56.200> going<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.409> use<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.950> then<00:01:57.130> mark<00:01:57.399> the

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
we're going to use that to then mark the

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.359 
we're going to use that to then mark the
wall<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:58.140> drill<00:01:59.140> our<00:01:59.259> holes<00:01:59.469> for<00:01:59.799> our<00:01:59.979> anchors

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
wall and drill our holes for our anchors

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.389 
wall and drill our holes for our anchors
and<00:02:00.579> our<00:02:00.670> screws<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.670> 5800<00:02:04.509> pir-res<00:02:05.100> has<00:02:06.100> a

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
and our screws so the 5800 pir-res has a

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.120 
and our screws so the 5800 pir-res has a
motion<00:02:06.969> mask<00:02:07.360> here<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.049> also<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> look<00:02:08.860> down

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
motion mask here and also a look down

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.339 
motion mask here and also a look down
Zone<00:02:09.489> on<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.060> bottom<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:11.080> it's<00:02:11.260> very

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
Zone on the bottom so it's very

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.050 
Zone on the bottom so it's very
important<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.220> orient<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.849> in<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
important that you orient it in the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.180 
important that you orient it in the
right<00:02:13.209> position<00:02:13.390> you'll<00:02:14.349> notice<00:02:14.680> also<00:02:14.890> that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
right position you'll notice also that

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.990 
right position you'll notice also that
the<00:02:15.340> tab<00:02:15.580> is

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
the tab is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.030 
the tab is
on<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.150> bottom<00:02:16.440> along<00:02:17.440> with<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.650> look<00:02:17.860> down

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
on the bottom along with the look down

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.620 
on the bottom along with the look down
so<00:02:18.370> make<00:02:18.520> sure<00:02:18.550> when<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:18.970> mount<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.390> you're

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
so make sure when you mount it you're

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.510 
so make sure when you mount it you're
using<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.260> position<00:02:23.220> backplate<00:02:24.220> has

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
using it in that position backplate has

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.030 
using it in that position backplate has
the<00:02:24.850> hole<00:02:25.300> for<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> tap<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.590> we<00:02:26.740> know<00:02:26.890> we

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the hole for the tap and so we know we

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.610 
the hole for the tap and so we know we
go<00:02:27.190> at<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.000> bottom<00:02:28.270> for<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:29.410> actually

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
go at the bottom for that it actually

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.920 
go at the bottom for that it actually
also<00:02:30.070> says<00:02:30.310> top<00:02:30.670> right<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.210> plastic<00:02:31.420> to
