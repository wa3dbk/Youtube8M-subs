00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
for decades you were decades younger

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.200 
for decades you were decades younger
then<00:00:29.270> all<00:00:30.080> right<00:00:30.670> let's<00:00:31.670> probably<00:00:31.970> help<00:00:32.119> us

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
then all right let's probably help us

stay<00:00:32.360> younger<00:00:32.629> I<00:00:32.989> still<00:00:33.680> know<00:00:33.800> how<00:00:33.949> it's<00:00:34.129> done

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.770 

that<00:00:38.180> was<00:00:38.449> a<00:00:38.480> washing<00:00:38.900> machine<00:00:40.780> belt-driven

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
that was a washing machine belt-driven

that was a washing machine belt-driven
yeah<00:00:42.290> cast<00:00:42.739> iron<00:00:42.980> transmission<00:00:43.879> yeah<00:00:44.180> the

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
yeah cast iron transmission yeah the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.780 
yeah cast iron transmission yeah the
water<00:00:44.769> place<00:00:45.769> better<00:00:46.010> be<00:00:46.100> ten<00:00:46.430> years

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
water place better be ten years

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.460 
water place better be ten years
eventually<00:00:48.070> that's<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.549> spin<00:00:50.360> tube<00:00:50.809> bushing

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
eventually that's the spin tube bushing

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.750 
eventually that's the spin tube bushing
would<00:00:51.589> wear<00:00:51.769> out<00:00:51.949> they<00:00:52.070> go<00:00:52.220> clock<00:00:52.430> a<00:00:52.460> clock<00:00:52.580> a

clunker little keep them long enough and
the<00:00:56.089> drum<00:00:56.299> will<00:00:56.449> eventually<00:00:56.809> rust<00:00:57.049> out<00:00:57.229> in

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
the drum will eventually rust out in

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
some more then spend half a turn and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.300 
some more then spend half a turn and
thing<00:02:51.209> all<00:02:52.139> in<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.560> name<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.739> saving<00:02:52.980> energy

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
thing all in the name of saving energy

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.990 
thing all in the name of saving energy
and<00:02:53.519> saving<00:02:53.909> water<00:02:54.090> what<00:02:54.540> about<00:02:54.629> saving<00:02:54.959> time

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
and saving water what about saving time

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.949 
and saving water what about saving time
well<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.030> don't<00:02:57.120> think<00:02:57.209> those<00:02:57.389> old<00:02:57.599> maytag's

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
well I don't think those old maytag's

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.690 
well I don't think those old maytag's
use<00:02:58.139> that<00:02:58.290> much<00:02:58.439> energy<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:59.129> they're<00:02:59.549> very

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
use that much energy really they're very

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.909 
use that much energy really they're very
efficient<00:03:00.269> well<00:03:00.569> they'll<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> love<00:03:01.590> start

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
efficient well they'll do a love start

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.670 
efficient well they'll do a love start
to<00:03:02.040> stop<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.459> 30<00:03:02.669> minutes<00:03:02.909> so<00:03:03.500> basically<00:03:04.500> he's

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
to stop in 30 minutes so basically he's

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.800 
to stop in 30 minutes so basically he's
