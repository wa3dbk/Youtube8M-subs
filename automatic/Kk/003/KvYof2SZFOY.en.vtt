00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
will be a genius so I'm saying wireless

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.539 
will be a genius so I'm saying wireless
charging<00:01:39.570> although<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:41.100> probably<00:01:41.250> not

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
charging although it's probably not

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.710 
charging although it's probably not
going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> happen<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.540> we're<00:01:42.630> going

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
going to happen I think what we're going

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
going to happen I think what we're going
to<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.259> force<00:01:43.530> touch<00:01:43.710> improved<00:01:44.340> camera

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
to see is force touch improved camera

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.969 
to see is force touch improved camera
probably<00:01:45.270> being<00:01:45.420> able<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> record<00:01:45.979> 4k

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
probably being able to record 4k

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.340 
probably being able to record 4k
increased<00:01:47.880> storage<00:01:48.060> size<00:01:48.450> getting<00:01:49.140> rid<00:01:49.229> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
increased storage size getting rid of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
increased storage size getting rid of

that horrible 16 gig version i live in

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.120 
that horrible 16 gig version i live in
rumors<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> stick<00:01:51.810> around<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.590> got

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
rumors going to stick around but I got

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.080 
rumors going to stick around but I got
faith<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.369> Apple<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
faith that Apple is going to do the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.030 
faith that Apple is going to do the
right<00:01:54.299> thing<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.810> knock<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.380> sucker<00:01:55.890> out

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
right thing and knock that sucker out

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.300 
right thing and knock that sucker out
make<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.250> 32<00:01:56.759> gig<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.750> entry-level<00:01:58.310> model

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
make the 32 gig the entry-level model

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.679 
make the 32 gig the entry-level model
others<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.969> don't<00:02:00.149> think<00:02:00.270> ready<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.570> much

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
others I don't think ready to see much

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.209 
others I don't think ready to see much
of<00:02:00.719> difference<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.380> improved<00:02:01.799> rigidity

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
of difference would be improved rigidity

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.469 
of difference would be improved rigidity
in<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> outside<00:02:02.880> shell<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.270> gonna<00:02:03.360> look

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
in the outside shell it's gonna look

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.240 
in the outside shell it's gonna look
almost<00:02:03.659> identical<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:04.439> already<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.710> iOS<00:02:05.070> 9

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
almost identical we already know iOS 9

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.740 
almost identical we already know iOS 9
so<00:02:05.549> all<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> stuff<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.000> wanted<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.570> is

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
so all the stuff I wanted for that is

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.790 
so all the stuff I wanted for that is
just<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.340> was<00:02:08.340> 10<00:02:08.840> hopefully<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.020> think

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
just I was 10 hopefully I think

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.170 
just I was 10 hopefully I think
definitely<00:02:11.009> looking<00:02:11.340> at<00:02:11.459> an<00:02:11.520> evolutionary

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
definitely looking at an evolutionary

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.520 
definitely looking at an evolutionary
staff<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.810> think

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
staff but I do think

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.290 
staff but I do think
that<00:02:13.770> force<00:02:14.100> touch<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> really

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
that force touch is going to be a really

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.820 
that force touch is going to be a really
nice<00:02:15.420> addition<00:02:15.840> it's<00:02:16.260> almost<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.560> adding

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
nice addition it's almost like adding

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.199 
nice addition it's almost like adding
another<00:02:17.040> button<00:02:17.310> without<00:02:17.459> having<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.970> add<00:02:18.060> an

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
another button without having to add an

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.680 
another button without having to add an

you<00:02:27.840> think<00:02:27.990> vendor<00:02:28.290> skins<00:02:28.590> improve<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
you think vendor skins improve the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650 
you think vendor skins improve the
experience<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:29.940> add<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.209> fragmentation

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
experience to just add to fragmentation

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.360 
experience to just add to fragmentation
a<00:02:31.200> little<00:02:31.590> bit<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.739> both<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.010> definitely<00:02:32.220> think

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
a little bit of both I definitely think

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.770 
a little bit of both I definitely think
it<00:02:32.489> adds<00:02:32.610> fragmentation<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.360> fact<00:02:33.630> it

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
it adds fragmentation in fact it

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.350 
it adds fragmentation in fact it
certainly<00:02:34.170> does<00:02:34.560> I'm<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.700> school<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.330> I
