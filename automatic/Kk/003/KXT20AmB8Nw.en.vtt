another cane

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.670 
another cane
well<00:01:53.189> another<00:01:53.490> cane<00:01:53.759> another<00:01:54.240> strike<00:01:54.680> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
well another cane another strike it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
well another cane another strike it
helps<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.579> use<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> sharp<00:01:57.240> edge

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
helps if you actually use a sharp edge

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.690 
helps if you actually use a sharp edge
of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> blade<00:01:57.810> yeah<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.549> don't

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
of the blade yeah because if you don't

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.940 
of the blade yeah because if you don't
this<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.180> happens<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:01.079> smudges<00:02:01.439> although

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
this is what happens it smudges although

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.350 
this is what happens it smudges although
if<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.280> wanted<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> sort<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.820> Pewter<00:02:03.060> effect

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
if you wanted to sort of Pewter effect

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.319 
if you wanted to sort of Pewter effect
that'd<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.930> quite<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.140> good<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.329> it's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that'd be quite a good way to do it it's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.249 
that'd be quite a good way to do it it's
great<00:02:06.540> isn't<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:06.930> watch<00:02:07.079> these
