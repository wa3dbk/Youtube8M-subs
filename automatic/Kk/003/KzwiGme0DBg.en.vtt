00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
can find and some of the emerging and

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.580 
can find and some of the emerging and
frontier<00:02:34.640> economies<00:02:35.450> which<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.319> going<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.500> be

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
frontier economies which is going to be

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.740 
frontier economies which is going to be
the<00:02:36.769> next<00:02:36.980> great<00:02:37.670> frontier<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.239> guess<00:02:38.540> for

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
the next great frontier I guess for

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.559 
the next great frontier I guess for
Apple<00:02:39.560> they'll<00:02:40.069> always<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.519> good<00:02:41.330> sales

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
Apple they'll always have good sales

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.530 
Apple they'll always have good sales
here<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.019> US<00:02:42.260> because<00:02:42.650> they<00:02:42.769> have<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> loyal

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
here in the US because they have a loyal

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.610 
here in the US because they have a loyal
client<00:02:44.540> base<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.930> will<00:02:45.019> buy<00:02:45.140> anything<00:02:45.440> that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
client base that will buy anything that

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.800 
client base that will buy anything that
they<00:02:45.860> produce<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.489> analysts<00:02:47.299> are<00:02:47.480> not<00:02:47.630> too

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
they produce so analysts are not too

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.839 
they produce so analysts are not too
worried<00:02:48.019> about<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.230> but<00:02:48.650> where<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.310> next

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
worried about that but where is the next

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.729 
worried about that but where is the next
great<00:02:50.060> bump<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.720> top-line<00:02:51.110> revenue<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:51.680> to

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
great bump in top-line revenue going to

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
the economic calendar for this week we

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.000 
the economic calendar for this week we
are<00:04:10.730> getting<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.450> FOMC<00:04:12.079> meeting<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.650> it

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
seems as though the whole taper scenario

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.900 
seems as though the whole taper scenario
is<00:04:15.230> much<00:04:15.500> likely<00:04:15.859> off<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.160> table<00:04:16.430> because<00:04:16.549> of

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
is much likely off the table because of

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.120 
is much likely off the table because of
the<00:04:17.030> government<00:04:17.419> shutdown<00:04:17.950> what<00:04:18.950> should<00:04:19.099> we

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
the government shutdown what should we

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.349 
the government shutdown what should we
really<00:04:19.400> look<00:04:19.609> for<00:04:19.909> towards<00:04:20.599> them

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
really look for towards them

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.439 
really look for towards them
well<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.560> taper<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.580> taper<00:04:23.789> conversation<00:04:24.389> is

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
well the taper the taper conversation is

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:25.339 
well the taper the taper conversation is
off<00:04:24.569> the<00:04:24.659> table<00:04:24.780> not<00:04:24.990> only<00:04:25.139> for<00:04:25.259> the

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
off the table not only for the

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.689 
off the table not only for the
government<00:04:25.650> shutdown<00:04:25.949> but<00:04:26.129> the<00:04:26.219> economy<00:04:26.610> is

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
government shutdown but the economy is

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.580 
government shutdown but the economy is

another<00:04:58.529> reason<00:04:58.830> I<00:04:59.099> think<00:04:59.159> it<00:04:59.370> has<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.580> do<00:04:59.789> with

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
another reason I think it has to do with

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.279 
another reason I think it has to do with
people's<00:05:00.240> confidence<00:05:00.569> has<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:00.900> do<00:05:01.110> with

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
people's confidence has to do with

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.649 
people's confidence has to do with
overall<00:05:02.039> economic<00:05:02.219> outlook<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:03.060> back<00:05:03.389> to<00:05:03.539> the

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
overall economic outlook so back to the

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.749 
overall economic outlook so back to the
Fed<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:04.199> think<00:05:04.770> what<00:05:04.889> we<00:05:04.979> hear<00:05:05.159> from<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.550> Fed<00:05:05.729> is

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
Fed I think what we hear from the Fed is

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.029 
Fed I think what we hear from the Fed is
that<00:05:06.090> they're<00:05:06.270> going<00:05:06.419> to<00:05:06.479> stay<00:05:06.960> steady<00:05:07.830> as<00:05:08.009> she

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
that they're going to stay steady as she

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.679 
that they're going to stay steady as she
goes<00:05:08.189> I'm<00:05:08.580> sure<00:05:08.729> Chairman<00:05:09.090> Bernanke<00:05:09.360> would
