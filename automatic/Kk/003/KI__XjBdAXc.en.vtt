I<00:03:23.450> set<00:03:24.450> myself<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.870> small<00:03:25.139> Lego<00:03:25.530> challenge<00:03:25.980> to

I set myself a small Lego challenge to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.490 
I set myself a small Lego challenge to
collect<00:03:26.430> all<00:03:26.609> series<00:03:27.150> for<00:03:27.359> minifigures<00:03:27.630> where

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
collect all series for minifigures where

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.629 
collect all series for minifigures where
I<00:03:28.530> live<00:03:28.769> they've<00:03:28.950> only<00:03:29.100> just<00:03:29.190> become

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
I live they've only just become

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.490 
I live they've only just become
available<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> good<00:03:31.109> chance<00:03:31.350> to

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
available and this is a good chance to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.620 
available and this is a good chance to
test<00:03:31.950> my<00:03:32.100> collecting<00:03:32.609> process<00:03:32.819> using<00:03:33.299> scales

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
test my collecting process using scales

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.690 
test my collecting process using scales
I<00:03:33.959> also<00:03:34.319> needed<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.920> look<00:03:35.130> carefully<00:03:35.340> at<00:03:35.579> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
I also needed to look carefully at the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.610 
I also needed to look carefully at the
hidden<00:03:35.880> code<00:03:36.239> as<00:03:36.450> well<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:37.170> collecting

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
hidden code as well this collecting

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.559

hour of careful scrutiny and revealed to

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.470 
hour of careful scrutiny and revealed to
me<00:04:03.950> some<00:04:04.190> minifigures<00:04:04.790> were<00:04:05.150> far<00:04:05.450> more

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
me some minifigures were far more

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.479 
me some minifigures were far more
frequent<00:04:06.110> than<00:04:06.200> others<00:04:06.530> there<00:04:07.220> was<00:04:07.310> one

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
frequent than others there was one

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.250 
frequent than others there was one
minifigure<00:04:07.940> causing<00:04:08.360> problems<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:08.870> my<00:04:08.989> search

minifigure causing problems in my search

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.920 
minifigure causing problems in my search
I<00:04:09.590> could<00:04:10.069> see<00:04:10.250> was<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.519> same<00:04:10.760> code<00:04:11.120> pulling<00:04:11.840> a

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
I could see was the same code pulling a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.320 
I could see was the same code pulling a
sizeable<00:04:12.440> weight<00:04:12.620> difference<00:04:13.099> but<00:04:13.640> why<00:04:13.970> I

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
sizeable weight difference but why I

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.210 
sizeable weight difference but why I
purchased<00:04:14.750> these<00:04:15.200> under<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.739> find<00:04:15.950> out<00:04:16.040> it's

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
purchased these under the find out it's

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.740 
purchased these under the find out it's
that<00:04:16.400> pesky<00:04:16.549> artist<00:04:17.180> weighing<00:04:17.600> the

that pesky artist weighing the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.140 
that pesky artist weighing the
minifigure<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:18.500> info<00:04:18.889> she'd<00:04:19.190> showed<00:04:19.669> me<00:04:19.880> near

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
minifigure and info she'd showed me near

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.060 
minifigure and info she'd showed me near
identical<00:04:20.329> weights<00:04:20.870> but<00:04:21.500> when<00:04:21.650> weighing<00:04:21.859> the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
identical weights but when weighing the

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.490 
identical weights but when weighing the
bag<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.850> difference<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.389> revealed<00:04:23.900> the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
bit by surprise was there some bags that

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.230 
bit by surprise was there some bags that
I<00:04:45.500> came<00:04:45.830> across<00:04:45.889> which<00:04:46.250> had<00:04:46.370> no<00:04:46.550> code<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.090> at<00:04:47.210> a

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
I came across which had no code and at a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.270 
I came across which had no code and at a
curiosity<00:04:47.510> of<00:04:47.840> course<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.320> bought<00:04:48.860> one<00:04:49.070> because

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
curiosity of course I bought one because

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.860 
curiosity of course I bought one because
one<00:04:49.460> of<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.610> find<00:04:49.820> out<00:04:49.940> what<00:04:50.060> was<00:04:50.180> inside<00:04:50.510> and

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
one of the find out what was inside and

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.930 
one of the find out what was inside and
this<00:04:51.229> series<00:04:51.500> also<00:04:51.800> has<00:04:51.979> some<00:04:52.430> minifigures

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
this series also has some minifigures

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.420 
this series also has some minifigures
which<00:04:53.450> are<00:04:53.660> very<00:04:53.930> similar<00:04:54.260> in<00:04:54.380> weight<00:04:54.710> so<00:04:55.190> then

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
which are very similar in weight so then

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.159 
which are very similar in weight so then
you<00:04:55.550> have<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.820> look<00:04:55.940> at<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.150> code<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.840> work<00:04:56.960> out

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
you have to look at the code to work out

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.230 
you have to look at the code to work out
which<00:04:57.320> ones<00:04:57.530> which<00:04:57.770> but<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.400> do<00:04:58.520> sort<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.060> stuff

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
which ones which but I do sort the stuff

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.270 
which ones which but I do sort the stuff
out<00:04:59.419> by<00:04:59.600> weight<00:04:59.930> first<00:05:00.229> and<00:05:00.470> then<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.830> use<00:05:01.130> them

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
out by weight first and then I use them

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.070 
out by weight first and then I use them
in<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.490> code<00:05:01.700> that's<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.450> way<00:05:02.539> I<00:05:02.570> work<00:05:02.870> of

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
in the code that's the way I work of

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.990 
in the code that's the way I work of
course<00:05:03.979> you're<00:05:04.130> never<00:05:04.220> sure<00:05:04.460> exactly<00:05:04.850> what's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
course you're never sure exactly what's

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.060 
course you're never sure exactly what's
inside<00:05:05.210> until<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.140> open<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.590> bag
