three<00:03:10.349> day<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:11.160> definitely<00:03:11.670> need<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.849> keep

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
three day we definitely need to keep

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.750 
three day we definitely need to keep
that<00:03:12.540> away<00:03:12.810> off<00:03:13.010> what<00:03:14.010> teams<00:03:14.340> do<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.519> think<00:03:14.670> we

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
that away off what teams do you think we

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.520 
that away off what teams do you think we

we<00:03:16.650> look<00:03:16.769> out<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:16.980> get<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.370> don't<00:03:17.639> think<00:03:17.880> it's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
we look out to get I don't think it's

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.300 
we look out to get I don't think it's
you<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.840> don't<00:03:19.139> think<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.739> sort<00:03:20.160> of

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
you know I don't think you can sort of

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.530 
you know I don't think you can sort of
go<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.609> look<00:03:20.700> down<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.120> road<00:03:21.329> I<00:03:21.359> think

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
go and look down that road I think

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.539 
go and look down that road I think
basically<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.349> gotta<00:03:22.530> say<00:03:22.769> whoever<00:03:23.069> we<00:03:23.340> get

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
basically you gotta say whoever we get

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.640 
basically you gotta say whoever we get
it's<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:24.090> good<00:03:24.269> draw<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.349> can<00:03:25.530> you're

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
it's a good draw because you can you're

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.460 
it's a good draw because you can you're
not<00:03:25.769> gonna<00:03:25.889> change<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.440> we're<00:03:28.440> in

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
not gonna change it and I think we're in

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.770 
not gonna change it and I think we're in
a<00:03:28.709> position<00:03:29.010> where<00:03:29.370> we<00:03:30.030> should<00:03:30.269> be<00:03:30.419> able<00:03:30.540> to

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
a position where we should be able to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.470 
a position where we should be able to
achieve<00:03:31.650> anything<00:03:32.040> yeah<00:03:32.549> really<00:03:32.970> i<00:03:33.299> think

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
achieve anything yeah really i think

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.620 
achieve anything yeah really i think
we've<00:03:34.109> obviously<00:03:34.680> we've<00:03:35.340> got<00:03:35.489> some<00:03:36.180> time<00:03:36.389> any

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
we've obviously we've got some time any

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.250 
we've obviously we've got some time any
of<00:03:36.690> us<00:03:36.780> really<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.260> prepare<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.340> i<00:03:38.780> always<00:03:39.780> I
