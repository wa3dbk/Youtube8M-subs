00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
I would probably just get about a pound

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.160 
I would probably just get about a pound
of<00:03:53.799> meat<00:03:53.980> for<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.489> breast<00:03:54.730> after<00:03:55.049> growing<00:03:56.049> it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
of meat for the breast after growing it

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.520 
of meat for the breast after growing it
for<00:03:56.459> 1213<00:03:57.459> weeks<00:03:57.600> also<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.840> quality<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.410> the

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
for 1213 weeks also the quality of the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.520 
for 1213 weeks also the quality of the
meat<00:03:59.739> was<00:04:00.420> fantastic<00:04:01.420> good<00:04:01.780> taste<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.290> very

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
meat was fantastic good taste and very

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.660 
meat was fantastic good taste and very
lean<00:04:02.799> zero<00:04:03.549> fat<00:04:04.560> what's<00:04:05.560> one<00:04:05.799> of<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:06.100> big<00:04:06.310> big

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
lean zero fat what's one of the big big

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.180 
lean zero fat what's one of the big big
negatives<00:04:07.269> about<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:07.810> bird<00:04:08.079> they<00:04:08.530> are<00:04:08.620> very

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
negatives about this bird they are very

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.599 
negatives about this bird they are very
very<00:04:09.609> messy<00:04:09.989> so<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.049> have<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.680> be<00:04:11.829> prepared<00:04:12.280> to

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
very messy so you have to be prepared to

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.660 
very messy so you have to be prepared to
put<00:04:13.030> woodchips<00:04:13.600> in<00:04:13.810> every<00:04:14.530> day<00:04:14.739> because<00:04:15.400> they

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
put woodchips in every day because they

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.080 
put woodchips in every day because they
are<00:04:15.940> constantly<00:04:16.930> pooping<00:04:17.470> they<00:04:17.890> get<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:18.549> messy

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
are constantly pooping they get so messy

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.050 
are constantly pooping they get so messy
and<00:04:19.269> then<00:04:20.019> when<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:20.650> are<00:04:20.859> getting<00:04:21.609> ready<00:04:21.970> to

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
and then when you are getting ready to

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.510 
and then when you are getting ready to
butcher<00:04:22.510> them<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:22.960> will<00:04:23.200> have<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.500> bird<00:04:23.950> that

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
butcher them you will have a bird that

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.620 
butcher them you will have a bird that
is<00:04:24.580> quite<00:04:25.120> dirty

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
is quite dirty

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.110 
is quite dirty
so<00:04:25.930> the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
so the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.030 
so the
on<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.330> side<00:04:26.600> will<00:04:26.900> be<00:04:27.080> there<00:04:27.530> will<00:04:27.680> be<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.830> lot

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
on the side will be there will be a lot

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.040 
on the side will be there will be a lot
of<00:04:28.070> fecal<00:04:28.370> matter<00:04:28.550> on<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.210> when<00:04:29.660> butchering

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
of fecal matter on it when butchering

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.780 
of fecal matter on it when butchering
you're<00:04:30.199> trying<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.560> be<00:04:30.740> as<00:04:30.860> hygienic<00:04:31.130> as

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
you're trying to be as hygienic as

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.820 
you're trying to be as hygienic as
possible<00:04:32.360> as<00:04:32.510> germ-free<00:04:32.810> as<00:04:33.169> possible<00:04:33.680> and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
possible as germ-free as possible and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.590 
possible as germ-free as possible and
with<00:04:34.400> these<00:04:34.550> birds<00:04:34.910> when<00:04:35.270> they<00:04:35.300> are<00:04:35.479> this

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
with these birds when they are this

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.650 
with these birds when they are this
messy<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.800> underside<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.550> breast<00:04:37.880> most

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
messy and the underside the breast most

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.990 
messy and the underside the breast most
of<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.020> feathers<00:04:39.500> are<00:04:39.740> sort<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.040> rubbed<00:04:40.639> off

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
of the feathers are sort of rubbed off

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.420 
of the feathers are sort of rubbed off
because<00:04:41.750> they<00:04:42.020> are<00:04:42.229> constantly<00:04:42.740> sitting<00:04:43.010> and

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
because they are constantly sitting and

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.040 
because they are constantly sitting and
if<00:04:43.790> they're<00:04:43.970> sitting<00:04:44.270> in<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.510> fecal<00:04:44.810> matter

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
if they're sitting in the fecal matter

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.980 
if they're sitting in the fecal matter
with<00:04:45.320> all<00:04:45.470> that<00:04:45.620> acid<00:04:46.100> it's<00:04:46.520> quite<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:46.880> lot<00:04:47.150> but

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
with all that acid it's quite a lot but

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.830 
with all that acid it's quite a lot but
once<00:04:48.229> you<00:04:48.440> pass<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:49.100> stage<00:04:49.490> once<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.360> clean

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
once you pass that stage once you clean

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.050 
once you pass that stage once you clean
them<00:04:51.050> up<00:04:51.260> and<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:52.190> made<00:04:52.370> sure<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.820> they're

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
them up and you made sure that they're

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.840 
them up and you made sure that they're
hygienic<00:04:53.630> ly<00:04:53.750> clean<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.290> scolding<00:04:55.220> them<00:04:55.430> maybe

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
hygienic ly clean so scolding them maybe

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.300 
hygienic ly clean so scolding them maybe
at<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.120> higher<00:04:56.360> temperature<00:04:56.389> more<00:04:57.229> towards<00:04:57.620> 160

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
at a higher temperature more towards 160

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.460 
at a higher temperature more towards 160
degrees<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.940> really<00:04:59.660> cleaning<00:05:00.020> them<00:05:00.169> really

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
degrees and really cleaning them really

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.840 
degrees and really cleaning them really
well<00:05:00.680> before<00:05:00.919> you<00:05:01.130> are<00:05:01.370> starting<00:05:01.699> the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
well before you are starting the

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.700 
well before you are starting the
butchering<00:05:02.150> process<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.900> then<00:05:03.380> you'll<00:05:03.650> be

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
butchering process and then you'll be

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.200 
butchering process and then you'll be
fine<00:05:04.070> okay<00:05:04.400> so<00:05:05.210> in<00:05:05.780> conclusion<00:05:06.100> would<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.160> do<00:05:08.060> it

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
fine okay so in conclusion would I do it

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.900 
fine okay so in conclusion would I do it
again<00:05:08.360> would<00:05:09.110> I<00:05:09.139> breed<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:10.130> Cornish<00:05:10.669> cross

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
again would I breed the Cornish cross

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.620 
again would I breed the Cornish cross
again<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:12.110> my<00:05:12.740> answer<00:05:13.160> would<00:05:13.340> be<00:05:13.630> probably

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
again and my answer would be probably

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.610 
again and my answer would be probably
yes<00:05:15.260> it's<00:05:15.949> much<00:05:16.310> easier<00:05:16.820> I<00:05:17.169> feel<00:05:18.169> like<00:05:18.440> that

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
yes it's much easier I feel like that

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.279 
yes it's much easier I feel like that
the<00:05:18.800> quality<00:05:18.979> of<00:05:19.400> meat<00:05:19.729> is<00:05:20.000> better<00:05:20.270> I<00:05:20.660> raise

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
the quality of meat is better I raise

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.040 
the quality of meat is better I raise
them<00:05:21.590> still<00:05:21.889> organically<00:05:22.789> so<00:05:23.030> they<00:05:23.180> get<00:05:23.330> only

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
them still organically so they get only

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.240 
them still organically so they get only
the<00:05:24.260> best<00:05:24.470> food<00:05:24.800> no<00:05:25.400> GMO<00:05:25.940> no<00:05:26.860> pesticides<00:05:27.860> in

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
the best food no GMO no pesticides in

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.300 
the best food no GMO no pesticides in
the<00:05:28.669> food<00:05:28.940> it<00:05:29.870> doesn't<00:05:30.169> take<00:05:30.349> us<00:05:30.500> long<00:05:30.530> I<00:05:30.830> think

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
the food it doesn't take us long I think

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.430 
the food it doesn't take us long I think
it's<00:05:31.490> actually<00:05:31.639> cheaper<00:05:32.270> because<00:05:32.900> it's<00:05:33.289> only

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
it's actually cheaper because it's only

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.500 
it's actually cheaper because it's only
six<00:05:33.740> weeks<00:05:33.889> as<00:05:34.130> opposed<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.550> 12<00:05:34.940> weeks<00:05:35.270> the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
six weeks as opposed to 12 weeks the

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.510 
six weeks as opposed to 12 weeks the
feed<00:05:35.930> costs<00:05:36.260> are<00:05:36.410> much<00:05:36.680> lower<00:05:37.010> even<00:05:37.280> though

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
feed costs are much lower even though

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.460 
feed costs are much lower even though
they're<00:05:37.700> eating<00:05:37.970> more<00:05:38.150> in<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.450> time<00:05:38.690> I<00:05:38.960> think

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
they're eating more in that time I think

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.159 
they're eating more in that time I think
the<00:05:39.620> me<00:05:40.160> to<00:05:40.430> feet<00:05:40.700> ratio<00:05:41.150> must<00:05:41.450> be<00:05:41.690> much<00:05:41.930> higher

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
the me to feet ratio must be much higher

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.560 
the me to feet ratio must be much higher
and<00:05:42.500> again<00:05:43.190> the<00:05:43.370> quality<00:05:43.639> of<00:05:43.970> meat<00:05:44.240> is<00:05:44.510> very

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
and again the quality of meat is very

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.010 
and again the quality of meat is very
nice<00:05:45.380> so<00:05:46.160> if<00:05:46.460> you're<00:05:46.669> really<00:05:46.940> looking<00:05:47.090> for<00:05:47.780> the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
nice so if you're really looking for the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.730
