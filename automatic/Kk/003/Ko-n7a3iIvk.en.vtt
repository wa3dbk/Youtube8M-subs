00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
know exactly how much we're going to use

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.400 
know exactly how much we're going to use
I<00:00:21.520> think<00:00:21.880> maybe<00:00:22.060> three<00:00:22.390> or<00:00:22.420> four<00:00:22.689> cloves<00:00:22.960> let's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
I think maybe three or four cloves let's

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:32.610 
I think maybe three or four cloves let's
let's<00:00:23.830> check<00:00:24.010> it<00:00:24.130> out

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:32.620 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.120 

the<00:00:33.620> original<00:00:34.010> recipe<00:00:34.400> calls<00:00:35.180> for<00:00:35.330> bacon<00:00:36.200> to

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
the original recipe calls for bacon to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.440 
the original recipe calls for bacon to
be<00:00:37.250> put<00:00:37.430> in<00:00:37.520> here<00:00:37.700> with<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.970> onions<00:00:38.240> but<00:00:38.420> i

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
be put in here with the onions but i

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.330 
be put in here with the onions but i
think<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.870> minimal<00:00:39.530> amount<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:39.920> turkey<00:00:40.190> fat

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
think the minimal amount of turkey fat

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:56.560 
think the minimal amount of turkey fat
will<00:00:40.490> be<00:00:40.520> okay<00:00:54.550> okay<00:00:55.550> i<00:00:55.760> stopped<00:00:56.210> at<00:00:56.330> about

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
will be okay okay i stopped at about

will be okay okay i stopped at about
five<00:00:56.930> cloves<00:00:57.380> five<00:00:57.830> or<00:00:57.980> six<00:00:58.160> cloves<00:00:58.400> of<00:00:58.610> garlic

you don't have if you just have like
regular<00:02:16.160> cubes<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.720> add<00:02:17.959> 1<00:02:18.680> q<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.220> mean<00:02:19.370> 05

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
regular cubes and just add 1 q I mean 05

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.980 
regular cubes and just add 1 q I mean 05
cubes<00:02:20.209> 5<00:02:20.450> times<00:02:20.720> 1<00:02:21.200> cube<00:02:21.500> because<00:02:21.890> 1<00:02:22.190> teaspoon

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
cubes 5 times 1 cube because 1 teaspoon

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.480 
cubes 5 times 1 cube because 1 teaspoon
equals<00:02:23.990> 1<00:02:24.140> cube<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:26.680> okay<00:02:27.680> here's<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.980> last<00:02:28.250> of

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
equals 1 cube so okay here's the last of

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.330 
equals 1 cube so okay here's the last of
the<00:02:28.640> water

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.430 

you're<00:02:32.030> all<00:02:32.150> over<00:02:32.300> all<00:02:32.629> mixture<00:02:33.050> probably

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
you're all over all mixture probably

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.650 
you're all over all mixture probably
shouldn't<00:02:34.220> achieve<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.670> look<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.360> engines

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
shouldn't achieve this look the engines

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.020 
shouldn't achieve this look the engines
kind<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.900> got<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.019> little<00:02:36.080> singed<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.800> there

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
kind of got a little singed in there

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.559 
kind of got a little singed in there
it'll<00:02:38.030> be<00:02:38.120> okay<00:02:39.970> we're<00:02:40.970> going<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.150> now<00:02:41.300> turn<00:02:41.360> it

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
it'll be okay we're going to now turn it

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.100 
it'll be okay we're going to now turn it
to<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> boil<00:02:43.030> all<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.180> way<00:02:44.269> up<00:02:44.420> until<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.870> starts

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
to a boil all the way up until it starts

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.610 
to a boil all the way up until it starts
boiling<00:02:45.910> then<00:02:46.910> we'll<00:02:47.319> then<00:02:48.319> we'll<00:02:48.440> add<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
boiling then we'll then we'll add the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.839 
boiling then we'll then we'll add the
potatoes<00:02:49.010> but<00:02:49.220> first<00:02:49.430> we're<00:02:49.549> going<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.790> add

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
potatoes but first we're going to add

00:02:49.849 --> 00:03:04.960 
potatoes but first we're going to add
the<00:02:49.940> chicken<00:02:50.150> bullion<00:02:50.450> mix<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.610> tough<00:03:04.940> to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
the chicken bullion mix it is tough to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.280 
the chicken bullion mix it is tough to
do<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:07.180> here's<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.390> fifth<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:12.140> could

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
do and here's the fifth you could

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.420 
do and here's the fifth you could
probably<00:03:12.470> add<00:03:12.650> more<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.010> like<00:03:13.190> just

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
probably add more of you like just

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.800 
probably add more of you like just
depending<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:13.760> how<00:03:13.880> salty<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.420> want<00:03:14.599> it<00:03:14.690> but

that is boiling we're going to put in
the<00:03:27.019> potatoes<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.799> already<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.459> them<00:03:28.579> sliced

the potatoes I already have them sliced

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.670 
the potatoes I already have them sliced
up<00:03:29.120> as<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:29.390> saw<00:03:29.599> we're<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.290> going<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.530> put

up as you saw we're just going to put
them<00:03:30.799> all<00:03:30.890> in<00:03:31.010> there<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.459> we're<00:03:32.090> going<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.239> let

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
them all in there and we're going to let

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.920 
them all in there and we're going to let
the<00:03:32.480> potatoes<00:03:32.920> boil<00:03:34.209> be<00:03:35.209> really<00:03:35.450> careful<00:03:35.660> when

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
the potatoes boil be really careful when

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.390 
the potatoes boil be really careful when
putting<00:03:36.079> in<00:03:36.290> potatoes<00:03:36.680> because<00:03:36.889> often<00:03:37.310> they

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
putting in potatoes because often they

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.220 
putting in potatoes because often they
splash<00:03:37.730> back<00:03:38.030> up<00:03:38.239> and<00:03:38.450> that's<00:03:38.569> boiling<00:03:38.870> water

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
splash back up and that's boiling water

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.559 
splash back up and that's boiling water
that<00:03:39.500> can<00:03:39.620> really<00:03:39.950> burn<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:40.700> I'm<00:03:41.389> going<00:03:41.540> to

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
that can really burn you so I'm going to

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:55.080 
that can really burn you so I'm going to
be<00:03:41.660> as<00:03:41.750> careful<00:03:42.109> as<00:03:42.319> I<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:50.829> hate<00:03:51.829> this<00:03:51.980> part

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.809 

there<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:56.180> go<00:03:56.329> also<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:56.870> tasted<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:58.549> bra

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
there we go also I tasted the the bra

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.909 
there we go also I tasted the the bra
and<00:03:59.299> I<00:03:59.810> think<00:03:59.959> it<00:04:00.019> needs<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.260> be<00:04:00.319> a<00:04:00.349> little<00:04:00.650> bit

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
and I think it needs to be a little bit

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.979 
and I think it needs to be a little bit
more<00:04:01.250> flavorful<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.269> salty<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:02.780> I'm<00:04:02.840> going<00:04:02.959> to

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
more flavorful and salty so I'm going to

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.690 
more flavorful and salty so I'm going to
put<00:04:03.079> one<00:04:03.169> more<00:04:03.650> teaspoon<00:04:04.190> of<00:04:04.340> better<00:04:04.549> than

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
put one more teaspoon of better than

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.809 
put one more teaspoon of better than
bullion<00:04:07.450> bringing<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.660> six<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.669> think<00:04:10.669> it'll

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
bullion bringing it to six I think it'll

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.990 
bullion bringing it to six I think it'll
be<00:04:10.880> okay<00:04:12.099> okay<00:04:13.099> now<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.459> potatoes<00:04:13.849> are

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
be okay okay now that the potatoes are

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.970 
be okay okay now that the potatoes are
boiling<00:04:14.150> all<00:04:14.569> we<00:04:14.840> need<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:14.989> do<00:04:15.200> is<00:04:15.560> wait<00:04:15.950> for

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
boiling all we need to do is wait for

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.620 
boiling all we need to do is wait for
them<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.250> get<00:04:16.400> soft<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:17.150> then<00:04:17.269> we<00:04:17.359> add<00:04:17.510> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
them to get soft and then we add the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.740 
them to get soft and then we add the
turkey<00:04:17.989> back<00:04:18.139> in<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.070> KO<00:04:19.450> so<00:04:20.450> that<00:04:20.570> means

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
turkey back in and the KO so that means

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.270 
turkey back in and the KO so that means
we<00:04:20.840> have<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.019> prepare<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.440> kale<00:04:21.620> which<00:04:21.919> just

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
we have to prepare the kale which just

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.129 
we have to prepare the kale which just
consists<00:04:22.639> of<00:04:22.760> washing<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.419> removing<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.960> big

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
consists of washing it removing the big

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.589 
consists of washing it removing the big
stems<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.820> making<00:04:25.820> sure<00:04:25.940> it's<00:04:26.120> cut<00:04:26.330> up<00:04:26.419> into
