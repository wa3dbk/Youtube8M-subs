00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.029
 and the meat we are going to make a mixture 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.410
 with the following onion ingredients 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.150

 one and a half tablespoons of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.679
 English sauce and then for the bread in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.510
 will bread cheese and tomato will 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.070
 start making the mix we're going to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.470
 start making the mix the first thing that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.720
 let's throw is the onion 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.650
 a whole chopped onion 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.570
 and now the tablespoon and a half of mustard 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.570
 dijon whole 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.070
 the pepper a spoonful equivalent to 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 a spoonful of pepper 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.820
 spoonful and a half of English sauce 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.820
 we remove whole 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.140
 a teaspoon of salt but we're 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.149
 all without fear the two egg yolks 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.920
 that one has broken, nothing happens because 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.870
 as now we are going to mix everything with 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 very clean hands 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.720
 and we need to incorporate a good stream of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.600
 ketchup 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.840
 because as two large spoonfuls of that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840
 I've done 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.939
 well let's start making the mix 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.369
 we mix everything with our hands 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.369
 that a uniform mass 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.040
 all well mixed 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.399
 once the mixture is well uniform 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.270
 with we have to leave in the refrigerator 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.880
 like half an hour so that 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.909
 all flavors are integrated 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.229
 and then we 'll put it to 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.330
 take them out 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.730
 we will pass the hamburgers to the size that 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.010
 we want 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.540
 we leave them at room temperature and 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.200
 heat the pan well and we 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.930
 we will do them 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.930
 let's finish making the dough well 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.959
 everything would be mixed let's leave it 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.770
 rest 30 minutes we have made a 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.140
 shows 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.230
 and we will continue doing the rest 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.950
 we take 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.670
 a ball 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.670
 we give it shape 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.670
 if we were to make meatballs 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.160
 and now for the cha we're going a little 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.160
 in the form of something hamburger 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.540
 and so at least with half a kilo 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.880
 Well, four hamburgers will come out 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.890
 so big 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.170
 depends on how you want it more or less 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.690
 fat 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.360
 ok yes it's enough we put it here 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.360
 on the plate and we keep doing more 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.090
 they look good 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.510
 with the smell very well with this mixture of 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.819
 ingredients that it carries 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.980
 if they leave 4 italy of 5 does not happen 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.650
 nothing 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.659
 we want to make a shampoo 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.019
 and then in the middle they are not going to do 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.510
 well come now we continue and so it is not 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.220
 is five hamburgers 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.010
 Now what we are going to do is with a 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.819
 brush let's bathe a tad in 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.470
 oil and especially warm the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.299
 pan that's the trick so that 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.459
 are toasted above and below 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.549
 then the juicy medium then that's already 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.930
 question of taste is a recommendation 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.260
 we put a little oil with him 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.260
 Brush 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.760
 and we put it already in the pan 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.989
 a little oil above but very 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.989
 little bit 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.950
 and we are placing our 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.800
 and this is the final result 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.490
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.490
 how good 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.690
 It is in sandwich version 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.690
 I hope you like it
