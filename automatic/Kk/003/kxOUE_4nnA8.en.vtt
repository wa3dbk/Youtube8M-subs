00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.600
 let's see some other modifiers with 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.000
 accents and find us life stage 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.360
 of the action which means we can 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.670
 accomplish this goal this form 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.660
 without these aids but certainly yes 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.519
 speed up the task of our box 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.150
 children with height in fiction 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 we give 100 times higher 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:37.710
 8 all sides I convert Naples into this one 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.090
 point let's go see some 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.600
 modifiers that we say transforms the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.440
 shape by rotating it or by pulling it into one 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.500
 certain direction 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:57.140
 look for before you're for 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.140
 tackle basically project draft 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.910
 on the upper base and or on the base 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.070
 lower 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.189
 later we can also decide 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.970
 re-inflating wealthy and the remaining areas 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.020
 in the many sides to get an effect 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.420
 of forming and even crowning at 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 system 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.240
 we could have done it with the smooth but 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.290
 this way with two commands we have 100 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.840
 a form among other parametric then 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.840
 very quickly manageable 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.080
 we have other other items that are the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.350
 spillway directions but by default e 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.450
 we always use the one that imposes us 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.870
 edimax than that of the management more 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.870
 logic 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:04.360
 ok at this point often momentarily 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:09.369
 tea for and let's go to the band band that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.320
 it would be the folding band allows us to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.230
 bending control parameters 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.110
 then he wants to hear effects in 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.650
 particular but allows us to fold 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:27.520
 the object in the sense of changing the axis 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:33.640
 in the other sense or in the other it is known 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:36.250
 again if we then add the command of 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.420
 for we have our curved object and 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:48.940
 simultaneously folded were the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:53.730
 fold that the team have as an effect 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.730
 final a curved and bent object 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.660
 we switch off temporarily to go 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.650
 to see another command there is no 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:15.600
 twist the bottom tris allows you to twist 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:22.600
 subject of lesson with the others even though 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.989
 they are true me one way or another 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.989
 yet 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:36.600
 but twist section which can then be 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:42.810
 activated to my other mag 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:53.520
 in this way we have a rounded object 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:53.520
 have been rotated indeed explained and distorted 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.060
 I still hope everyone to see the last one 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:12.490
 the heads remain the control legs 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:16.780
 the last one at risk allows us 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.170
 substantially not translating the face 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.890
 higher than the lower one 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:27.370
 of our object rather than that 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.820
 back with further rather than 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.820
 the side ones 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:43.300
 in this way we were able to create 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:48.580
 bent objects distorted and distorted 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:52.900
 simply translated with three 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:57.490
 the mini is actually four parametric controls 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:01.690
 fick able in real time risk this 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:06.370
 that's how much we want to squeeze 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:09.720
 twist our band object as much as 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.750
 we want to explain in what sense 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:18.220
 the tape and how much we want to form or 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:21.930
 bombara result that will say little to 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:26.110
 aesthetic level but who knows if four 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:30.480
 absolutely useful commands when 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.480
 we must draw twisted shapes
