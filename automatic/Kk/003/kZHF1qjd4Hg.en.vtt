00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.890
 a very big connection that I have with the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.930
 people with this city although not though 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.650

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.650
 me those very well 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.540
 my family like me keep a 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.540
 very nice memory 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.370
 and we love it but Europe has been a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.059
 very important part in my life 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 football has let me be part of 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.649
 of the selection of my country play 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.460
 worldwide we were a team there was no 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.970
 individualities 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.220
 a team that worked 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.940
 always in an even shape always pulling 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.910
 to continue looking for new objectives 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 and trying to achieve them I will have 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.900
 been for the work that one has done 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.540
 and that he left a good impression or that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.250
 people realize that really 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.640
 I wanted to do things well and I've 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.490
 worked for her was what made 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.520
 I really knew myself in another way 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.110
 in europe and well what I told you opened 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.760
 the doors of the selection 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.860
 at that time we had a team that 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.200
 it really has adapted very well 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.680
 how to play opposite teams 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.630
 the formula that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.850
 we adopt us gave us 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.060
 results in each match I came with 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.670
 hope and the idea of ​​not coming back for 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 a lot of time argentina wanted to stay 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.220
 here I wanted to do things right here and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.840
 try to succeed for what what 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.110
 We expected us what we wanted 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.670
 we the truth that was 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.790
 it was wonderful we missed the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.400
 the cherry the poster as they say 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.970
 that was the final but I think the way 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.530
 that was covered was fantastic is an end 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.120
 week a month that way through 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.070
 friends and 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.910
 and enjoying that sport very much 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.630
 you also never know what happens that the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.630
 fact of coming 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.870
 and tour the club where some played 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.720
 they go through the stadium 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.540
 it's difficult because I do not want to return the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.700
 long ago and continue playing and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.709
 be able to be I have all the love that 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.410
 I received in the club people 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.740
 everyone 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.310
 it's complicated but you can not can not 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.310
 something that is not
