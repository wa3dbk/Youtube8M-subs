00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
having school for a long time so I think

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.600 
having school for a long time so I think
I'm<00:03:03.480> right<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:04.050> anyway<00:03:04.350> we<00:03:04.830> then<00:03:05.010> move<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.400> to

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
I'm right but anyway we then move on to

I'm right but anyway we then move on to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
Alchemist one at one point and that this

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.430 
Alchemist one at one point and that this

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
believe there's any mastery points like

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.930 
believe there's any mastery points like
this<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:15.090> last<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:16.560> one<00:03:16.920> season<00:03:17.250> free<00:03:17.670> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
this in the last in one season free and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.320 
this in the last in one season free and
beyond<00:03:18.930> before<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.940> think<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.180> is

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
beyond before that so I think this is

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.600 
beyond before that so I think this is
quite<00:03:21.570> nice<00:03:21.750> item<00:03:22.350> because<00:03:22.710> as<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.040> support<00:03:23.490> you

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
quite nice item because as a support you

I<00:05:36.750> guess<00:05:36.900> trying<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.140> get<00:05:37.230> the<00:05:37.320> supports<00:05:37.770> to<00:05:37.830> be

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
I guess trying to get the supports to be

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.450 
I guess trying to get the supports to be
more<00:05:38.160> useful<00:05:38.430> in<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:39.210> season<00:05:40.170> for<00:05:40.350> now<00:05:40.620> we

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
more useful in the season for now we

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.950 
more useful in the season for now we
even<00:05:41.700> down<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:42.090> tree<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.390> then<00:05:42.690> take<00:05:42.930> a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
even down the tree I then take a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.830 
even down the tree I then take a
one-hour<00:05:43.530> one<00:05:43.800> points<00:05:44.130> in<00:05:44.280> bandit<00:05:44.910> basically

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
one-hour one points in bandit basically

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.380 
one-hour one points in bandit basically
for<00:05:46.110> a<00:05:46.140> ranged<00:05:46.700> champion<00:05:47.700> it<00:05:47.790> grants<00:05:48.120> free

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
for a ranged champion it grants free

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.330 
for a ranged champion it grants free
gold<00:05:48.780> each<00:05:49.050> time<00:05:49.320> an<00:05:49.500> enemy<00:05:49.800> champion<00:05:49.830> is

gold each time an enemy champion is

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.370 
gold each time an enemy champion is
attacked<00:05:50.730> this<00:05:51.390> cannot<00:05:51.720> trigger<00:05:51.990> on<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.170> same

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
attacked this cannot trigger on the same

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.200 
attacked this cannot trigger on the same
champion<00:05:52.980> more<00:05:53.220> than<00:05:53.400> once<00:05:53.610> every<00:05:53.880> five

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
champion more than once every five

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.360 
champion more than once every five
seconds<00:05:54.630> so<00:05:54.930> for<00:05:55.500> example<00:05:55.560> if<00:05:56.160> I<00:05:58.190> guess<00:05:59.190> it

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
seconds so for example if I guess it

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.400 
seconds so for example if I guess it
counts<00:05:59.700> on<00:05:59.820> me<00:05:59.970> as<00:06:00.090> well<00:06:00.120> so<00:06:00.600> say<00:06:00.780> if<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:01.020> attack

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
counts on me as well so say if I attack

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.520 
counts on me as well so say if I attack

can<00:07:13.719> ward<00:07:13.960> quicker<00:07:14.199> and<00:07:14.379> so<00:07:14.560> forth<00:07:14.830> so<00:07:15.159> these

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 
can ward quicker and so forth so these

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.219 
can ward quicker and so forth so these
mastery<00:07:16.240> changes<00:07:16.599> are<00:07:16.690> quite<00:07:16.840> nice<00:07:17.020> because

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
mastery changes are quite nice because

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:18.659 
mastery changes are quite nice because
it<00:07:17.440> brings<00:07:17.620> the<00:07:17.770> support<00:07:18.159> bit<00:07:18.310> more<00:07:18.430> into<00:07:18.580> the

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
it brings the support bit more into the

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.790 
it brings the support bit more into the
game<00:07:18.849> from<00:07:19.120> what<00:07:19.300> I<00:07:19.330> can<00:07:19.449> see<00:07:19.569> through<00:07:20.469> some<00:07:20.680> of

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
game from what I can see through some of

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.409 
game from what I can see through some of
them<00:07:20.919> and<00:07:21.099> obviously<00:07:21.159> with<00:07:21.759> the<00:07:21.909> new<00:07:22.060> items

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
them and obviously with the new items

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.469 
them and obviously with the new items
will<00:07:22.539> probably<00:07:22.900> do<00:07:22.990> a<00:07:23.020> video<00:07:23.229> on<00:07:23.349> tomorrow<00:07:24.479> it

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 
will probably do a video on tomorrow it

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:26.969 
will probably do a video on tomorrow it
all<00:07:25.629> kind<00:07:25.810> of<00:07:25.900> mounts<00:07:26.259> up<00:07:26.379> and<00:07:26.650> try<00:07:26.800> to<00:07:26.860> make

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:26.979 
all kind of mounts up and try to make

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.680 
all kind of mounts up and try to make
the<00:07:27.129> support<00:07:27.550> a<00:07:27.610> bit<00:07:27.789> more<00:07:27.969> of<00:07:28.090> a<00:07:28.180> champion

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690 
the support a bit more of a champion

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.149 
the support a bit more of a champion
that<00:07:28.870> can<00:07:29.050> be<00:07:29.139> useful<00:07:29.440> in<00:07:29.529> the<00:07:29.620> game<00:07:29.800> even

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:30.159 
that can be useful in the game even

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:32.249 
that can be useful in the game even
though<00:07:30.370> you<00:07:30.430> know<00:07:30.639> support<00:07:31.029> can<00:07:31.240> be<00:07:31.270> but<00:07:31.810> they

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:32.259 
though you know support can be but they

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:34.409 
though you know support can be but they
kind<00:07:32.500> of<00:07:32.529> died<00:07:32.740> out<00:07:32.770> at<00:07:33.039> some<00:07:33.279> point<00:07:33.310> so<00:07:33.969> it

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:34.419 
kind of died out at some point so it

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:35.429 
kind of died out at some point so it
should<00:07:34.629> make<00:07:34.750> it<00:07:34.779> a<00:07:34.900> lot<00:07:35.020> more<00:07:35.050> fun<00:07:35.379> than

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:35.439 
should make it a lot more fun than

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:37.290 
should make it a lot more fun than
people<00:07:35.830> won't<00:07:35.979> mind<00:07:36.189> as<00:07:36.490> playing<00:07:36.819> support<00:07:37.210> as

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
people won't mind as playing support as

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.029 
people won't mind as playing support as
much<00:07:37.479> and<00:07:37.719> if<00:07:37.779> you<00:07:37.900> put<00:07:38.050> out<00:07:38.169> my<00:07:38.349> plan<00:07:38.620> support

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
much and if you put out my plan support

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.589 
much and if you put out my plan support
they<00:07:39.159> play<00:07:39.370> a<00:07:39.400> better<00:07:39.699> support<00:07:40.150> than<00:07:40.210> someone

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 
they play a better support than someone

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.540 
they play a better support than someone
who's<00:07:40.779> been<00:07:41.379> forced<00:07:41.800> into<00:07:41.860> planned<00:07:42.190> support

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.550

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:45.629 
and they don't want to play it and you
know<00:07:44.199> it<00:07:44.259> never<00:07:44.440> goes<00:07:44.949> well<00:07:45.009> especially<00:07:45.400> for

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:45.639 
know it never goes well especially for

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:47.640
