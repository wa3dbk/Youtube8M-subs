00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
told you guys this but I thought I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
told you guys this but I thought I
thought<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.320> first<00:01:10.470> bezel<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> ordered<00:01:11.189> was

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
thought the first bezel I ordered was

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.590 
thought the first bezel I ordered was
the<00:01:11.430> wrong<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.000> ordered<00:01:12.270> another<00:01:12.510> one

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the wrong one so I ordered another one

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.730 
the wrong one so I ordered another one
and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> figured<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.439> they<00:01:13.590> were<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and then I figured out they were the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.480 
and then I figured out they were the
exact<00:01:14.189> same<00:01:14.369> thing<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.470> anyway<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.920> put<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
exact same thing so anyway I put the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
exact same thing so anyway I put the
first<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.299> old<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.630> cover<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
first one on the old back cover and it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.980 
first one on the old back cover and it
didn't<00:01:19.619> sit<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
didn't sit right and you know on this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
didn't sit right and you know on this
side<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.799> would<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> large<00:01:23.490> gap<00:01:23.939> over

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
side there would be a large gap over
