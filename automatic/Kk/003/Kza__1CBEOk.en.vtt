00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
don't know the name for I'm slow when it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.199 
don't know the name for I'm slow when it
comes<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.720> names<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:22.040> um<00:02:22.250> at<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.700> time<00:02:22.910> they

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
comes to names but um at the time they

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.900 
comes to names but um at the time they
were<00:02:23.239> like<00:02:23.800> 999<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:25.040> think<00:02:25.340> for<00:02:25.459> both<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.819> them

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
were like 999 I think for both of them

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.670 
were like 999 I think for both of them
so<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.780> know<00:02:26.900> what<00:02:26.989> equaled<00:02:27.260> up<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.410> twenty

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
so you know what equaled up to twenty

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.070 
so you know what equaled up to twenty
dollars<00:02:27.980> pretty<00:02:28.280> much<00:02:28.599> but<00:02:29.599> I<00:02:29.630> think<00:02:29.989> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
dollars pretty much but I think the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.540 
dollars pretty much but I think the
price<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.530> gone<00:02:30.709> up<00:02:30.950> because<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.340> wonder

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
price have gone up because I wonder

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.520 
price have gone up because I wonder
there<00:02:31.730> recently<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.510> think<00:02:32.989> these<00:02:33.290> items

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
there recently and I think these items

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.100 
there recently and I think these items
like<00:02:33.860> twenty<00:02:34.340> dollars<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.510> maybe<00:02:35.660> they're

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
like twenty dollars now so maybe they're

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.010 
like twenty dollars now so maybe they're
popular<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.650> lot<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.890> people<00:02:37.010> ordering<00:02:37.489> them
