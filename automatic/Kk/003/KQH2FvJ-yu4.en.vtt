strengths we are assuming that the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.350 
strengths we are assuming that the
strength<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.920> offense<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> tight

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
strength of the offense is to the tight

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
strength of the offense is to the tight
inside<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:58.170> how<00:00:58.320> most<00:00:58.559> people<00:00:58.649> set<00:00:59.100> their

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
inside that's how most people set their

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
inside that's how most people set their
strengths<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.789> their<00:01:00.449> offense<00:01:00.930> because

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
strengths of their offense because

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.049 
strengths of their offense because
there's<00:01:01.440> three<00:01:01.890> offensive<00:01:02.399> linemen<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.879> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
there's three offensive linemen on this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
there's three offensive linemen on this
side<00:01:03.270> versus<00:01:04.170> two<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.890> side<00:01:05.159> we're<00:01:05.820> not

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
side versus two on this side we're not

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.490 
side versus two on this side we're not
counting<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.450> center<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> center

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
counting the center because the center

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
counting the center because the center
is<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> center<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.180> defense<00:01:09.570> would

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is the center and so the defense would

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.940 
is the center and so the defense would
come<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.229> huddle<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.590> would<00:01:10.740> call<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
come out of the huddle they would call a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.670 
come out of the huddle they would call a
right<00:01:11.280> right<00:01:11.520> call<00:01:11.900> your<00:01:12.900> five<00:01:13.200> technique

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
right right call your five technique

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
right right call your five technique
would<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.979> away<00:01:14.070> from<00:01:14.460> strength<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:15.450> three

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
would go away from strength your three

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.679 
would go away from strength your three
technique<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:19.700> your<00:01:20.700> nine<00:01:20.939> technique<00:01:21.479> would

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
technique and your nine technique would

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.350 
technique and your nine technique would
go<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> strength<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.790> your

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
go to strength so there you have your

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
go to strength so there you have your
four<00:01:25.110> defensive<00:01:25.710> linemen

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189

pause for one second and this is why I

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.390 
pause for one second and this is why I
will<00:03:50.200> go<00:03:50.349> ahead<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.620> draw<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.040> strong

side one technique this is the

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.380 
side one technique this is the

over<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:15.940> guard<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:16.900> is<00:04:17.079> where<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.350> get

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
over that guard that is where you get

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.180 
over that guard that is where you get
the<00:04:17.650> terminology<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.519> 4-3<00:04:19.180> over<00:04:19.750> front<00:04:20.190> okay

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
the terminology of a 4-3 over front okay

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.700 
the terminology of a 4-3 over front okay
when<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.150> go<00:04:22.300> down<00:04:22.510> here<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:22.990> this<00:04:23.139> diagram

when you go down here to this diagram
because<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:25.120> start<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.139> strong<00:04:26.440> guard<00:04:26.860> has

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
because the start the strong guard has

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.310 
because the start the strong guard has
not<00:04:27.250> changed<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.150> there<00:04:28.660> is<00:04:28.780> no<00:04:28.960> three

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
not changed and there is no three

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.810 
not changed and there is no three
technique<00:04:29.800> matter<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.220> fact<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.610> one

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
technique matter of fact the one

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.180 
technique matter of fact the one
technique<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.389> playing<00:04:31.750> underneath<00:04:32.190> that

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
technique is playing underneath that

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.400 
technique is playing underneath that
strong<00:04:33.550> guard<00:04:33.850> that's<00:04:34.660> where<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.080> get<00:04:35.229> the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
strong guard that's where you get the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.460 
strong guard that's where you get the
terminology<00:04:36.039> of<00:04:36.190> an<00:04:36.490> under<00:04:36.970> front<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.539> so<00:04:38.020> up

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
terminology of an under front and so up

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.370 
terminology of an under front and so up
top<00:04:38.889> we<00:04:39.220> are<00:04:39.340> over<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.940> strong<00:04:40.389> guard<00:04:40.720> down

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
top we are over the strong guard down

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.800 
top we are over the strong guard down
below<00:04:41.680> we<00:04:41.860> are<00:04:42.010> under<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.580> strong<00:04:43.000> guard<00:04:43.300> so

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
below we are under the strong guard so

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.170 
below we are under the strong guard so
you<00:04:43.870> have<00:04:44.139> a<00:04:44.169> over<00:04:44.830> front<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:45.310> an<00:04:45.550> under<00:04:45.880> front

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
you have a over front and an under front

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.350 
you have a over front and an under front
that<00:04:46.960> is<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.350> difference<00:04:50.820> moving<00:04:51.820> on<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.240> the

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
that is the difference moving on to the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.240 
that is the difference moving on to the
other<00:04:52.389> players<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.320> nine<00:04:53.530> technique<00:04:54.099> is

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
other players the nine technique is

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.370 
other players the nine technique is
going<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.520> slide<00:04:54.789> down<00:04:55.090> into<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:55.960> five

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
going to slide down into a five

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.710 
going to slide down into a five
technique<00:04:56.919> yes<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.700> five<00:04:57.970> technique<00:04:58.510> I

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.170 
technique yes that is a five technique I
am<00:04:59.080> keeping<00:04:59.500> 9:00<00:04:59.770> on<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.039> screen<00:05:00.430> to

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
am keeping 9:00 on the screen to

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.790 
am keeping 9:00 on the screen to
designate<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.900> difference<00:05:02.289> between<00:05:02.620> the

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
designate the difference between the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.800 
designate the difference between the
weak<00:05:03.460> defense<00:05:03.910> event<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.510> strong

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
weak defense event and the strong

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.470 
weak defense event and the strong
defense<00:05:05.740> event

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
defense event

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.270 
defense event
the<00:05:08.480> D<00:05:08.690> gap<00:05:08.930> is<00:05:09.110> now<00:05:09.290> open<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:12.050> coached<00:05:13.010> it

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
the D gap is now open and I coached it

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.060 
the D gap is now open and I coached it
to<00:05:13.490> have<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.940> Sam<00:05:14.300> backer<00:05:14.660> walk<00:05:15.620> up<00:05:15.860> on<00:05:16.040> the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
to have the Sam backer walk up on the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.909 
to have the Sam backer walk up on the
line<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.870> so<00:05:17.870> now<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.139> can<00:05:18.560> see<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:18.889> have

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
line and so now you can see you have

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.200 
line and so now you can see you have
five<00:05:20.530> defensive<00:05:21.530> players<00:05:21.889> who<00:05:22.400> are<00:05:22.580> on<00:05:22.790> first

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
five defensive players who are on first

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.330 
five defensive players who are on first
level<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:23.870> there<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.229> have<00:05:24.260> your<00:05:24.440> first<00:05:24.979> part

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
level so there you have your first part

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.510 
level so there you have your first part
of<00:05:25.460> your<00:05:25.610> 50<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:27.410> Sam<00:05:27.680> linebacker<00:05:27.949> is<00:05:28.370> now

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
of your 50 to the Sam linebacker is now

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.810 
of your 50 to the Sam linebacker is now
acting<00:05:29.000> more<00:05:29.180> like<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.419> defensive<00:05:30.110> lineman

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
acting more like a defensive lineman

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.230 
acting more like a defensive lineman
your<00:05:31.820> will<00:05:32.090> linebacker<00:05:32.389> will<00:05:32.990> slide<00:05:33.320> into<00:05:33.680> a

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
your will linebacker will slide into a

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
your will linebacker will slide into a
33<00:05:35.260> which<00:05:36.260> is<00:05:36.290> a<00:05:36.560> three<00:05:36.889> technique<00:05:37.900> or<00:05:38.900> excuse

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
33 which is a three technique or excuse

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.480 
33 which is a three technique or excuse
me<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.410> said<00:05:39.560> 33<00:05:39.979> it<00:05:40.280> will<00:05:40.400> be<00:05:40.490> a<00:05:40.520> 35<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:42.490> three

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
me I said 33 it will be a 35 a three

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.460 
me I said 33 it will be a 35 a three
technique<00:05:43.700> five<00:05:44.330> yards<00:05:44.690> off<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:44.990> ball<00:05:45.169> and

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
technique five yards off the ball and

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.350 
technique five yards off the ball and
your<00:05:45.889> mic<00:05:46.160> would<00:05:46.370> also<00:05:46.610> be<00:05:47.000> in<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.750> 35<00:05:49.360> 3

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
your mic would also be in a 35 3

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.640 
your mic would also be in a 35 3
technique<00:05:51.070> five<00:05:52.070> yards<00:05:52.400> off<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.580> ball<00:05:52.880> now

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
technique five yards off the ball now

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.900

will<00:05:54.650> is<00:05:55.090> responsible<00:05:56.090> for<00:05:56.200> weakside<00:05:57.260> a<00:05:57.910> gap

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
will is responsible for weakside a gap

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.379 
will is responsible for weakside a gap
and<00:05:59.150> Mike<00:05:59.870> is<00:06:01.870> responsible<00:06:02.870> for<00:06:02.900> strong<00:06:03.620> side

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.330 
and Mike is responsible for strong side
B<00:06:05.389> gap<00:06:05.630> so<00:06:05.870> their<00:06:06.050> responsibilities<00:06:06.889> change<00:06:06.949> a

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
B gap so their responsibilities change a

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.040 
B gap so their responsibilities change a
little<00:06:07.550> bit<00:06:07.699> and<00:06:07.880> so<00:06:08.389> that<00:06:08.570> would<00:06:08.720> have<00:06:08.900> to<00:06:08.930> be

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
little bit and so that would have to be

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.170 
little bit and so that would have to be
worked<00:06:09.470> in<00:06:09.740> practice<00:06:10.010> so<00:06:10.699> that<00:06:10.910> they<00:06:11.030> get

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
worked in practice so that they get

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.600 
worked in practice so that they get
comfortable<00:06:11.419> with<00:06:11.810> that<00:06:12.400> again<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:13.550> would

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
comfortable with that again you would

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.980 
comfortable with that again you would
have<00:06:13.669> your<00:06:14.380> corners<00:06:15.380> and<00:06:15.590> your<00:06:16.010> safeties

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
have your corners and your safeties

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.500 
have your corners and your safeties
somewhere<00:06:17.990> in<00:06:18.169> those<00:06:18.590> areas<00:06:19.240> why<00:06:20.240> is<00:06:20.300> it

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
somewhere in those areas why is it

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.620 
somewhere in those areas why is it
beneficial<00:06:20.960> to<00:06:21.169> have<00:06:21.560> a<00:06:21.590> 4-3<00:06:22.330> over<00:06:23.330> front

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
beneficial to have a 4-3 over front

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.060 
beneficial to have a 4-3 over front

are three open gaps pre-snap in a 5-2

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.550 
are three open gaps pre-snap in a 5-2

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
front of any kind in this case it's a

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.219 
front of any kind in this case it's a
under<00:07:06.830> front<00:07:07.130> there<00:07:07.580> are<00:07:07.610> only<00:07:07.910> two<00:07:08.300> gaps<00:07:08.539> open

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.629 
under front there are only two gaps open
pre-snap<00:07:09.530> and<00:07:10.039> so<00:07:11.169> 52<00:07:12.169> fronts<00:07:13.220> tend<00:07:13.400> to<00:07:13.460> be<00:07:13.550> a

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
most people are trying to stop the run

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.529
