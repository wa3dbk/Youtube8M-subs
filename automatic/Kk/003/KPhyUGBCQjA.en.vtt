market has found the base station I've
reset<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.230> we'll<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.650> go<00:00:31.769> through<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
reset it so we'll just go through a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.180 
reset it so we'll just go through a
setup<00:00:32.279> again<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.750> way<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.469> found<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> though

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
setup again the way they found it though

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.370 
setup again the way they found it though

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
see the the base station wirelessly and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.930 
see the the base station wirelessly and
it<00:00:46.649> wasn't<00:00:46.770> able<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.920> on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.219> bottom<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it wasn't able to so on the bottom of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.889 
it wasn't able to so on the bottom of
the<00:00:51.480> pot<00:00:52.399> base<00:00:53.399> station<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.940> gray<00:00:54.300> cable

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the pot base station the gray cable

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.860 
the pot base station the gray cable
there<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:56.340> left-hand<00:00:56.789> side<00:00:57.059> sorry<00:00:57.360> right<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
there the left-hand side sorry right and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.750 
there the left-hand side sorry right and
so<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.289> look<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> network

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so as we look at it that's a network

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.969 
so as we look at it that's a network
cable<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.449> comes<00:01:00.690> over<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.180> router

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
cable what comes over here to the router

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.910 
cable what comes over here to the router
so<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.519> computer<00:01:06.350> sorry<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> airport

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
so that the computer sorry the airport

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
so that the computer sorry the airport
utility<00:01:08.430> should<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.670> say<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.090> computer

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
utility should I say on this computer

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.830 
utility should I say on this computer
can<00:01:10.290> communicate<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.610> air<00:01:12.510> part

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
can communicate with the air part

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.249 
can communicate with the air part
through<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> router<00:01:14.659> effectively<00:01:15.659> being<00:01:16.049> on

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
through the router effectively being on

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.670 
through the router effectively being on
the<00:01:16.380> same<00:01:16.560> network<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.670> both<00:01:18.000> from<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.680> we

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the same network so both from here we

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.390 
the same network so both from here we
just<00:01:19.830> need<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.280> choose<00:01:20.720> continue<00:01:22.250> reading<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
just need to choose continue reading the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.340 
just need to choose continue reading the
information<00:01:24.060> now<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.080> there's<00:01:25.290> been

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
information now you can see there's been

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770 
information now you can see there's been
reset<00:01:25.860> before<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.490> don't<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.450> want<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> do

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
reset before I don't really want to do

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.590 
reset before I don't really want to do
anything<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.290> resetting<00:01:28.799> our<00:01:28.860> restoring

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
anything with resetting our restoring

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.149 
anything with resetting our restoring
information<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.720> will<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.840> previously<00:01:31.770> used

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
information that will be previously used

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.090 
information that will be previously used
so<00:01:33.090> from<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.350> pretty<00:01:34.590> much<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> same

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so from here it's pretty much the same

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.450 
so from here it's pretty much the same
steps<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.930> what<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.860> already<00:01:39.860> put<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.070> from<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
steps as what we already put in from the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.210 
steps as what we already put in from the
Mac

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.960 

now<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.710> information<00:01:57.920> I've<00:01:58.220> put<00:01:58.400> in<00:01:58.520> there<00:01:58.700> is

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
now the information I've put in there is

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.540 
now the information I've put in there is
a<00:01:59.330> Airport<00:01:59.990> Express<00:02:00.200> password<00:02:00.920> as<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.400> can

a Airport Express password as you can

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.350 
a Airport Express password as you can
see<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.700> we've<00:02:04.850> given<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.740> continue

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
see that so we've given it that continue

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.669 
see that so we've given it that continue
okay<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.420> we<00:02:08.750> don't<00:02:08.869> want<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.170> create<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.500> new

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
okay so we don't want to create a new

from a different computer windows
computer<00:02:31.130> should<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.310> say<00:02:31.550> achieves<00:02:32.510> exactly

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
computer should I say achieves exactly

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.670 
computer should I say achieves exactly
the<00:02:33.110> same<00:02:33.320> thing<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:33.950> wireless<00:02:34.370> password<00:02:35.680> for

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the same thing so wireless password for

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.070 
the same thing so wireless password for
the<00:02:37.160> wireless<00:02:37.730> network<00:02:38.300> I'm<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:38.690> putting

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
the wireless network I'm just putting

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.789 
the wireless network I'm just putting
that<00:02:39.410> in

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.099 

just<00:02:46.799> go<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.250> update<00:02:47.969> to<00:02:48.659> update<00:02:48.689> the

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
just go for update to update the

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:55.640 
just go for update to update the
settings<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:52.730> continue<00:02:53.730> okay<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.439> it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
settings and continue okay so as it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.179 
settings and continue okay so as it
writes<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.459> information<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.140> pub<00:02:59.040> a

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
writes the information to the pub a

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:05.800 
writes the information to the pub a
station<00:03:00.379> just<00:03:01.379> gives<00:03:01.650> us<00:03:01.859> this

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.790 

progress<00:03:06.590> bar<00:03:07.209> now<00:03:08.209> we<00:03:08.330> can<00:03:08.450> see<00:03:08.630> their<00:03:08.870> solid

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
progress bar now we can see their solid

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.150 
progress bar now we can see their solid
amber<00:03:10.240> LED<00:03:11.240> on<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.560> base<00:03:12.560> station<00:03:12.980> in<00:03:13.069> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
amber LED on the base station in the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.360 
amber LED on the base station in the
moment<00:03:14.410> flashy<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.770> so<00:03:15.860> what<00:03:16.010> he's<00:03:16.100> trying<00:03:16.310> to

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
moment flashy and so what he's trying to

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.090 
moment flashy and so what he's trying to
do<00:03:16.520> now<00:03:17.290> it's<00:03:18.290> connected<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.920> wireless

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
do now it's connected to the wireless

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.090 
do now it's connected to the wireless
network<00:03:19.990> okay<00:03:20.990> so<00:03:21.050> now<00:03:21.319> it's<00:03:21.470> gone<00:03:21.590> green<00:03:21.920> you

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
network okay so now it's gone green you

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.960 
network okay so now it's gone green you
can<00:03:22.250> see<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.670> that's<00:03:22.819> connected<00:03:23.300> okay<00:03:23.720> I

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
can see that that's connected okay I

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.280 
can see that that's connected okay I
will<00:03:25.970> come<00:03:26.060> back<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.420> here<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:28.569> am<00:03:29.569> expecting<00:03:30.170> an

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
will come back to here I am expecting an

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.190 
will come back to here I am expecting an
error

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.830 

and<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.709> reason<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.790> because<00:03:36.060> now

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
and the reason for that is because now

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.750 
and the reason for that is because now
is<00:03:37.020> connected<00:03:37.500> wirelessly<00:03:37.709> as<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.459> can<00:03:38.580> see

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
is connected wirelessly as you can see

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.250 
is connected wirelessly as you can see
with<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:38.970> green<00:03:39.180> LED<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.810> also<00:03:42.810> connected

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
with the green LED it is also connected

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.390 
with the green LED it is also connected
with<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.830> wire<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:46.410> missile<00:03:46.709> function<00:03:47.280> is

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
with the wire the missile function is

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.800 
with the wire the missile function is
going<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.640> take<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> little<00:03:48.300> bit<00:03:48.450> longer<00:03:48.599> than

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
going to take a little bit longer than

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.590 
going to take a little bit longer than
usual<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:50.580> we'll<00:03:50.700> come<00:03:50.850> back<00:03:50.880> in<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.209> second

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
usual so we'll come back in a second

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.640 
usual so we'll come back in a second
when<00:03:51.810> everything<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.620> done<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.250> connected
