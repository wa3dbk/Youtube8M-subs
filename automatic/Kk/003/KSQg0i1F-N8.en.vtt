00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.470
 but all that already says 66 in this 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.760
 I'm going to teach you how to change the 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.500
 737 boeing textures of pm leave the 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.320
 rest of airplanes that you have of pm of je 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.360
 t'aime pm let the textures are not 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.490
 simply textures change what is the 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.780
 You can change the inside of the plane 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.119
 embedded systems 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.440
 etcetera then we will have to go to the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.560
 page of pm I left 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.560
 the shadows we go to don the gray 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.580
 now that we would look for the plane above 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.630
 from which we are going to look for the textures 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.300
 I'm looking for the 737 next-generation 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.240
 800 900 who see us in the different 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.470
 versions of the plane the 800 normal 800 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.020
 winglets 900 thousand 900 thousand is then 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.450
 look for and aix the reversal that he wanted and 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.010
 if I did not have the companies and what 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.460
 download and aysÃ©n this side you click 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.030
 and we're going to start the download 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.790
 once you have downloaded 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.240
 all the files that you want you have 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.409
 to decompress those of each one 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.060
 have 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.400
 a file inside you have to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.460
 decompress 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.040
 we will go to the programs we will look for pm 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.870
 leave 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.440
 where 737 were discarded 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.920
 and we opened the library manager program 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.020
 from the air and manager we will select 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.010
 the version of the plane what we want 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.270
 look for the package to install in this 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.280
 case it would be this one here 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.409
 and we direct him to make him cloth and wand 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.789
 instant of our america 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.179
 klm the normal fantasy riner then 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.579
 we would give up the driver and glass 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.579
 we would look to put everything desktop 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.870
 we want the file we would give to 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.369
 open then the installation begins 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.720
 once you have them installed 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 You can check inside the game that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.670
 they are different and if you take the lip 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.160
 normal because with all the extras for 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.770
 so to speak if not for example the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.520
 ryanair then they do not have the screen 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.500
 digital 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.850
 which is normally used at take-off in 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.570
 the landing then then is to have 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.490
 that when you go to look good when 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.160
 you are going to program the number of people 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.170
 that are on board, then the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.140
 number of seats that have ryanair in 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.700
 their planes if they have them divided into 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.640
 several kinds and so on 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.720
 everything comes and in case you want 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.750
 uninstall it is very easy 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.230
 select is one for example here then 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.030
 Ryanair would you say to soak this is very 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.840
 simple you can load the tables that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.840
 you want are free
