00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 most important to prevent complications in acute myocardial infarction 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.640
 myocardium is 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.280
 go to a health center soon where you can apply all the 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.280
 treatment resources currently available 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.669
 even so we always have to attend 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.380
 to several possibilities that may occur 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.860
 among them having an arrhythmic problem of the heart can take you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710
 to a sudden death 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.890
 especially in the phases 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.869
 more early 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.410
 look out 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.060
 also the appearance of other rhythm disorders as they may be 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.420
 blockages oo tachycardias 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.860
 i also the appearance of heart failure 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.030
 in the most complicated cases 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.350
 long term once this acute phase is overcome 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.450
 with the treatments that exist today is rare 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.740
 find serious complications 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.030
 in any of the cases our recommendation for patients who 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.430
 have suffered a heart attack is to follow the recommendations that gives 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.040
 your doctor your cardiologist 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.920
 Do not forget to take the treatment that is indicated 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.870
 that maintain control weights 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.330
 life habits 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.020
 that is to say that they practice the regular exercise eat healthy 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.410
 and do not smoke 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.340
 And of course keep a check on your blood pressure numbers. 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.270
 cholesterol figures and their glucose figures 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.780
 with all this we can say 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.500
 that today Spain has the evolution of acute myocardial infarction can be 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.310
 good 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.969
 therefore the message is positive to go as soon as possible and once 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.680
 The heart attack has already evolved. Following the recommendation is that he is a cardiologist.
