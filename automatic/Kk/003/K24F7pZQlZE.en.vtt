00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.670
 to the next player here on the channel 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.320
 there was no longer one and today 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.080
 we have a goalkeeper ri yes something completely 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.789
 special and indeed to guilherme 86 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.199
 real the monthly flex 80 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.119
 Positioning game are with him the crate 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.470
 is currently in the team of the week costs 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.539
 36 1997 so big it's really close 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 everything for a goalkeeper and yes why 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.320
 I have then for the donating 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.969
 games just like the player rating 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.160
 table in the end because that 's just yes 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.420
 is keeper and you are also very short 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.520
 just always see the clips because you 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.840
 Parades are because goalkeeper reviews are 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.860
 hard but I thought come on 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.379
 had to do that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 at herma that's important because how come 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.620
 it to the fact that I like doing I found 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 his new form earlier until the beginning 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.239
 of 4 11 13 really crass overboard and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.410
 so I thought that in the form of 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.329
 try slim 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.039
 in my new team that for reviews 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.690
 is responsible and I just have 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.210
 ice cold and I am 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.330
 surprised how good he is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.500
 incredible reflexes are his pike 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.700
 above all his reflexes 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.260
 and his real ones are what he is 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.970
 make up what naturally goalkeeper important 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.320
 Here is a example 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.520
 scene where he still has the ball off 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.430
 Scratching is a mix of real 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.680
 and reflect his size with 1 97 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 Nevertheless, the acrobatic goalie style 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.740
 for example casillas does not stop 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.720
 the classic as far as I am concerned 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.100
 So it can be really new 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.750
 incredible reflexes that skin out 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 can keep everyone in every ball 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.780
 situation even if he's in front of him 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.400
 he has been decapitated right at the end 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840
 very small normal clip with suarez 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.060
 he still has his positional game 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.250
 is terrific he directs shots the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.259
 Going perfectly into the gate were to the corner 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630
 everything wonderful he actually has a lot 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.490
 he also costs a few negative points 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.960
 really almost nothing because he is in the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.250
 Russian league plays the only one 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.899
 both negative as well as that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.220
 you can see the seven of them here 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.899
 weak point is that a conclusion 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.340
 the ugly animation has that 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.229
 you can not so far ahead of 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.520
 head sponsor is not so far forward 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.380
 bring that is a pity 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 and that he sometimes heads up 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.770
 but the bad guy does 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.719
 that makes every kipa that lies one 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.130
 engine from fifa 13 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.680
 All in all, we will come once now 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.209
 positive and negative positive predominates 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.489
 here he clearly is very tall despite 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.890
 size very agile and fast 68 tempo 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.420
 Always good for the goalkeeper 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.010
 and if he still a 97 big thing 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.720
 Do you want more with the acrobatic 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.000
 style is all that wonderful he is 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.580
 not your short moment only 32 km 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.610
 on the xbox number 27 km on the up 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.110
 the ps3 and on the pc costs about 200 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.280
 kb open pc are always in funds 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.230
 more expensive first to link easily 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.610
 brazilian is also interesting for 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.390
 stop if you then stop with somehow 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.500
 the Russian league and the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.300
 wants to do brazilian 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.890
 well, in one-on-one situations 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.570
 from every situation somehow capital 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.250
 hit the ball with a poor or something 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.870
 away fresh actually as well as an octopus 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.190
 everything gets away because he stated 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.750
 FernschÃ¼ssen strongly not particularly 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.610
 uncertain at corners so most 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.459
 opponents are at corners really stupid 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.440
 like pre-school children or primary school children 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.940
 with us but I would say he is 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.310
 because a bit more solid so at least 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.780
 it seemed to me that a good drop is 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.100
 another strength from him, too 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.019
 brings the balls very precise and can 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.110
 very far throw even if he only 74 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.570
 dropping or graduating or 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.160
 Completion Repudiation or Shedding has three 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.540
 star saver foot also a positive 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.070
 point was the gate was that shit if 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.850
 he just with a foot somehow the balls 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.590
 can beat away 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.870
 with heat that is reasonably in 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.160
 Order of the pulpit so both feet with 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.660
 the left of this right foot is the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.040
 strength room with the left goes off 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.630
 and sometimes he can do something 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.890
 make and for me is the best 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.870
 Brazilian keeper simply because he 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.239
 is great because he is agile and still 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.750
 not much costs so what do you want 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.760
 more 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.019
 negative as I said the disgusting tee 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.310
 and sometimes I do it with head balls 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.930
 have four in one game now 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.459
 header from benzema cashed on 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.650
 won the end because he has other things 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.660
 held great but with head balls 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.100
 it's kinda weird 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.260
 further by the fact but as I said also 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.829
 on the engine are in the final rating 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.780
 we come up with a 9.7 out of 10 for me 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.100
 so far the best goalkeeper I 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.560
 I've played quite honestly 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.989
 now 80 rating but still he is 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.430
 in my opinion absolutely report 73 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.829
 Security is one of the worst 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.500
 start and even apart from the speed 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.209
 Such goalkeeping skills are concerned and that 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.880
 I absolutely do not realize for me he is 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.650
 much safer on the line and that 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.180
 are so what if he comes in at 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.590
 Canada also hold on well that's what 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.840
 she wanted to express it 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.600
 So therefore really great and it costs 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.459
 not much he plays the league the well 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.320
 not so great but still easy 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.070
 link because of his nation stop and 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.560
 what do you want more 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.849
 almost every team can fit it in the 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.300
 whole user with santana and dede im 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.250
 the final result 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.090
 I 'm just saying thumbs up again 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.470
 would have to be like that, I think so 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.990
 is justified he is cheap i 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.669
 say it again he is unbelievable 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.530
 He is incredibly strong on the line 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.270
 and also in one-on-one situations 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.440
 therefore definitely one for me 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.599
 recommendation and I hope that he 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.220
 this slightly more difficult goalkeeper like 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.690
 we slightly shorter goalkeeper review 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.430
 liked was a bit two clips 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.300
 together but to comment the whole thing 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.620
 I hope that I'm fine 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.000
 get it off and that he really liked it 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.680
 we are the next player 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.680
 review again then bite pure
