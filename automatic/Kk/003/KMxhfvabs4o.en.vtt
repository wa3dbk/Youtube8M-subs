00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 what kind of people are we facing 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.609
 all right 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.660
 to some criminals with some skills 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.660
 very unusual 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.320
 and another one I need a theory 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.590
 because they did not open a parachute on the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.149
 jungle and escape as a normal person 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.719
 because I think they are not normal people 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.719
 Sir 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.610
 I think the authors of those robberies are 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.440
 risky athletes like me 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.250

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.250
 international 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.469
 and they do not care who dies in the process 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.270
 they call me mobile 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.820
 there are billions of dollars in gold 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.500
 down there and you're going to steal them 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.500
 we are not going to release them 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.430
 you consider yourselves brothers show me 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.430
 which side are you 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.320
 'criminal minds' 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.990
 they are guys who always live to the fullest 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.470
 we can fuck those guys I just need 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.470
 more time 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.569
 body you have idea of ​​how many people have 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.249
 down from how many laws have violated 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.579
 the only law that matters is that of 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.579
 gravity
