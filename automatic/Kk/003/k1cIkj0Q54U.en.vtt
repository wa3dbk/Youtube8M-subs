with a capsule and then here is the

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.429 
with a capsule and then here is the
print<00:02:57.239> symbol<00:02:57.959> here<00:02:58.109> it's<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.290> really

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
print symbol here it's not really

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.960 
print symbol here it's not really
symbols<00:02:58.829> this<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.069> screamer<00:02:59.489> there<00:02:59.730> for

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
symbols this is a screamer there for

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.250 
symbols this is a screamer there for
race<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.389> there's<00:03:00.599> not<00:03:00.720> really<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.959> symbol

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
race so there's not really a symbol

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.410 
race so there's not really a symbol
there<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.739> him<00:03:01.859> but<00:03:02.609> it's<00:03:02.819> just<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:03.090> simple

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
there for him but it's just a simple

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.179 
there for him but it's just a simple
little<00:03:03.480> build<00:03:03.810> each<00:03:04.049> build<00:03:04.379> of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> flyer<00:03:04.920> is

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
little build each build of the flyer is

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.240 
little build each build of the flyer is
a<00:03:05.220> basically<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> same<00:03:06.450> maybe<00:03:07.379> tiny<00:03:07.829> not

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
a basically the same maybe tiny not

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.679 
a basically the same maybe tiny not
really<00:03:08.519> anything<00:03:08.790> different<00:03:09.269> when<00:03:09.389> you<00:03:09.480> build

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
really anything different when you build

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.899 
really anything different when you build
them<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.439> of<00:03:10.560> course<00:03:10.769> like<00:03:11.010> colors<00:03:11.639> and<00:03:11.849> the

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
them but of course like colors and the

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.339 
them but of course like colors and the
pieces<00:03:12.120> are<00:03:12.329> different<00:03:12.689> and<00:03:12.930> then<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.109> get

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
pieces are different and then you get

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.050 
pieces are different and then you get
the<00:03:13.500> whole<00:03:13.620> system<00:03:14.400> here<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:14.849> then<00:03:16.730> with<00:03:17.730> this

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the whole system here and then with this

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.069 
the whole system here and then with this
you<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:23.030> put<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.120> figure<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:24.540> know<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
you do get to put the figure in know the

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:34.189 
you do get to put the figure in know the
way<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.410> figure<00:03:25.590> goes<00:03:25.859> in<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:29.329> take<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:33.199> the

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
way the figure goes in is you take a the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.759 
way the figure goes in is you take a the
capsule<00:03:34.650> off<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.519> then<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:37.049> set<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.440> figure

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
capsule off and then you set the figure

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.330 
capsule off and then you set the figure
in<00:03:39.319> you<00:03:40.319> doesn't<00:03:40.620> really<00:03:40.739> stick<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.220> there

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
in you doesn't really stick in there

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.420 
in you doesn't really stick in there
like<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.669> Spinjitzu<00:03:42.560> spinners<00:03:43.560> they<00:03:44.220> didn't

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
like the Spinjitzu spinners they didn't
