00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello everyone good today we're going to 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.520
 show a little 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.710
 what would be my place of work 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.680
 during the weekend explains month 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.380
 to understand a little more about what 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.860
 treats this citroën is said of the noble 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.860
 2013 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.040
 well now we are inside the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.100
 we are going to start it, so 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.859
 is 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.890
 the control panel control control 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.920
 main of the car that has some 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.520
 basic things but good obviously 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.250
 basically it's 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.110
 of the mainstream the core of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.060
 current that is said we have the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.510
 injection to activate and be able to start 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.900
 the car we have a control for to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.600
 turn on the rain lights and also 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.510
 control the strength that makes you 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.750
 what would he be 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.310
 the hydraulic direction 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.229
 we also have a defroster for 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.929
 rain case 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.670
 and we have what we call the regulator 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.069
 brake that we can pass the ball is 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.030
 braked further or further back 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.909
 normally that for him what more 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.819
 handles a pilot while inside a 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.189
 circuit and it's very important to 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.200
 us then good this is the 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.689
 external hand lever 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.830
 was used only for the start is not 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.840
 a 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.650
 to prevent the car from moving one 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.850
 It has pull this lever so that it is 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.610
 stopped 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.250
 and put it 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.850
 make a long and good lever 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.930
 changes then we move on to what is the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.620
 steering wheel that has a 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.010
 a safety lock to remove it 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.440
 the steering wheel has 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.220
 a couple of controls for basics to 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.410
 to be able to handle them we have 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.680
 of what we can go has several 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.680
 positions 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.180
 this is basically only used for 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.430
 activate the turbo and to select the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.049
 start mode that one wants if one 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.840
 wants a more aggressive load and it depends 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.939
 a bit like how you felt the track or 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.489
 is to vary from a position one to which 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.769
 one who does not want this that is the 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.459
 button of the pages of what is the 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.840
 screen of the car we can go by 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.650
 different screens that we have 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.500
 screens 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.610
 for the brake balance for the long 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.769
 race so we change after 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.260
 we have this button that only for 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.420
 wiper the blue button that is 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.160
 to cool the seat and the air that 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.740
 it comes in the helmet 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.110
 the green button that is a driver for 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.069
 torque that is also used for 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.859
 started 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.540
 the radio to enter to communicate 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.989
 with the boxes 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.989
 this is the mix that is the knob for 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.999
 regular let's say what is the mixture of 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.189
 engine this is not normally the equipment you 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:20.980
 says what to put and one goes regulating 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.200
 also different positions the multi 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.909
 it is a loss that can be used to 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.670
 many multiple functions let's say 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.190
 can you handle him 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.040
 in the strength of the steering wheel 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.040
 the sensitivity of the steering wheel and also 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.470
 you can handle pit engine maps is the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.240
 pit limiter control 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.040
 we have a red button that is a kind 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.540
 of alarm that when one goes spinning in 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.820
 track and have some problem squeeze that 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.770
 button to warn the team that in that 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.160
 just time for later when one 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.350
 analyze the data may have the point 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.180
 we have the wink that is used only 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.630
 to classify if one has traffic 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.160
 or some car and this is good in theory 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.500
 for you really have to be where you 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.500
 it's a kind of horn no but no no 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.240
 we are using it after here we have a 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.510
 map always on the track with the number 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.640
 of the number of curves we have and 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.640
 the red button that is to turn it on 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.130
 well we talked about what the panel was 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.680
 main after we went up 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.690
 we talk about what is the steering wheel we have 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.540
 the screen to see all the information 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.529
 of the car and well now what's left is 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.169
 especially the security issue 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.470
 we have the armchair that as good I do not know 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.270
 if anything to appreciate 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.560
 we are sitting on top of the 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:47.130
 carbon and we have a whole polyurethane 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.660
 expanded that is made molded to the body 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.330
 be the uta that one has is sitting 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.580
 about a fixed thing and tree to tree 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.129
 mold of the body and we have very little 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.229
 mobility not 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.830
 good belts of course 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.349
 are six points as the formula have 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.729
 two sideways for the waist good in 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.069
 this moment they are not put inside 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.899
 the chair we have two that come here 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.729
 between the legs and the two from above 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.480
 that of course it is not to have 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.070
 greater security 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.470
 then when with regard to that 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.600
 we have a pipe and air that comes for 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.850
 here and one behind to cool as 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.070
 we activate and deactivate it from 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.280
 the flyer as discretion we have the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.740
 network of say containment before 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.840
 a side hit one if it comes off the 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.110
 steering wheel or something this helps one to 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.000
 keep inside what is the box of 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.970
 security is said to be all of 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.410
 what about the cage not good this 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.150
 course to get off because also 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:47.010
 to get off that is the insurance has 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.770
 a tail a yellow piola and good as well 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:53.010
 you leave the car faster after good 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.430
 of course the pipes on the side of the 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.190
 pilot are all covered with a 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.370
 special fiber foam that makes 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.360
 that good before the blows 11 have greater 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.350
 protection and the sides of the car 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.210
 they are all made of carbon fiber 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.060
 also so good in this regard 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.889
 the cars of doubly is that are are 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.219
 very safe 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.780
 the driver is very careful and the truth is that 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:22.409
 good one also feels safer 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.110
 no more than having very good tracks 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.240
 the car complies with a regulation 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.419
 very strict in terms of security 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.900
 as good as the good fia demands 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.939
 I hope I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.999
 this little video that we made for 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:42.539
 show him what the passenger compartment of the 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:45.120
 w3c of this citroën it is said so that we 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.919
 we see soon in argentina and we wait 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.919
 be able to be in the best way
