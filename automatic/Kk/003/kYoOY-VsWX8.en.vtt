 Of course, I would not like to be deprived 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.480
 I want to start with you before I start 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.220
 to say something for a moment and that only once 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.900
 Thanks a lot to the Swiss that me 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.090

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.730
 to introduce yourself 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 that really means to me personally 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.000
 very much because you have to be natural 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 Imagine that he trusted me 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 gives a video to produce which 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.670
 Good enough you have to be on his channel 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.469
 of course that is also for 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.910
 I really care about a great responsibility 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.289
 That's the reason I'll be quite happy today 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.120
 make a lot of effort 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.770
 a professional as possible again 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 make whether I at the end succeeds 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.910
 of course in europe but know about now 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.100
 not too long to coach I start 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.359
 now with my set we already in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.579
 background can recognize that my 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.500
 favorite co-op ganga which in the text 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 the number 94 has and the types 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 combination mind possesses at one 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.070
 look at his values ​​immediately stands out 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.659
 that it is due to the high level of initiative and in 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.850
 worth even higher special attack 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.409
 quite the potential has been satisfied 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.930
 if you look at the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.130
 Defensive scores from the barge sees falls 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.110
 on it both in defense 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.700
 as well as in the special defense 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070
 not very convincing 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.080
 At least that's what you'd think, in spite of that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.000
 lack of defensive castle predecessors 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.439
 You can quite some attacks off 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.390
 which fall is because that Ghana 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.330
 only three weaken and relatively many 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.440
 Resistance are 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.120
 by the ability to float and the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.700
 typus spirit no common attacks of 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.830
 Types came normally and ground completely 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.050
 negate and is therefore always for a ci 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.970
 slot the quadruple resistances against 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.290
 Beetle and poison and the 24 resistances 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.270
 plant them and we take care of that 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.830
 that opponent still longer in the field 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.200
 Remains as one of a great 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.229
 actually rested but now to the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 ancient beings and the being is in 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.800
 this museum as soon as possible 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.600
 to be on the road and still a lot 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.990
 shame even more special level 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.580
 can 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.429
 For this reason, one then distributes it 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.130
 twice 52 ev on the special attack where 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.230
 the initiative the remaining four thesis 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.300
 6 f of course you can then coffee 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.030
 or the defense lay because that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.590
 not worth the item is yes 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.570
 the toxic sludge which and allows 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.470
 a 16 of our cup in every round 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.510
 fill 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.830
 the reason for the poisoners not yet 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.870
 It has become very clear that should now 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.160
 It is best to take good care of it when I am 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.930
 show you the attacks in this 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.209
 set to be used it is natural 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.980
 clear that also a poison mud on one 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.239
 fragile pokémon of course not very 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.030
 it makes sense, but I will show you 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.650
 that it is quite his pleasure first 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.030
 this is used for light and free 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.130
 to the potential of political opponents 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.600
 to restrict and also to permanently on 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.820
 to cause a bit of damage 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.650
 so that these days almost none on one 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.810
 this is almost the last 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.459
 Guarantee for a hit because the opponent 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.810
 now only very little harm 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.519
 it can cause dennis gang 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.870
 allows the lost coffee with 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.330
 poison snakes slowly heal again 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.739
 if the opponent now intends to change 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.320
 You can be a delicate at this time 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.390
 which use 25 percent of our 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.130
 captain our at least one 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.930
 attack by the opponent was allowed to drain 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.760
 already can be very helpful to the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.950
 ligatus so our second call and order 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.780
 this no more than and around this more 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.760
 to be able to use four times as I do 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.870
 sorry is the old in the toxic mud again 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.269
 of great importance 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.590
 But even direct damage 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.239
 we are able to serve as 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.130
 third and fourth notebook ball 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.900
 which with the step bonus very much 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.670
 causing damage and focus 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.980
 Which of the coverage titles with a 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.450
 world stronger of 120 at every opponent 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.890
 causes a lot of damage 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.840
 with these two attacks you have the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.319
 possibility of every pokémon at least 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.120
 to be neutral if you are always sure 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.190
 plays in brutal situations the 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.750
 danger detects and substitutes for any gang 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.370
 that stay in the field for a very long time 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.500
 permanently defeating the whole team 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.090
 what you should be careful though 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.069
 they are in pursuit of the pursuit of this 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.390
 to do very effective damage if you 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.319
 can not change out without much 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.180
 to take harm 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.250
 or maybe even defeated 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.440
 which also represent a problem 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.930
 could have priority were the lot 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.170
 from eg a choice at the che rocksänger 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.819
 This can not stand so that 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.660
 But for now it was my music 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.700
 definitely 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.049
 I hope you have this video and that 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.150
 accompanying book looks in any case 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.440
 very much liked and who that if so 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.760
 I would be very much in any case 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.190
 look forward to watching this video with one 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.570
 comment or a thumb rating and 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.889
 that was me in any case 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.870
 I wish you much fun with the

 remaining advent calendar and we see 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.360

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.100
 stop just before the video 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.380
 I still have something for everyone 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.150

 advent calendar has gotten out of this 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.889
