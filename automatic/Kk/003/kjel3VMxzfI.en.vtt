if I ever had a burger place i would

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
if I ever had a burger place i would
definitely<00:01:39.000> offer<00:01:39.210> something<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.690> that<00:01:39.869> and

definitely offer something like that and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.779 
definitely offer something like that and
we<00:01:40.830> didn't<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.190> those<00:01:41.310> were<00:01:41.429> going<00:01:41.550> to<00:01:41.610> sell
