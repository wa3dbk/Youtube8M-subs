00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.620
 hi everyone I'm rock and give them the 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.870
 welcome this new destination video 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.150
 as you know today is friday friday 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.799
 say very well in surfing and let's see what 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.839
 he brought us then to be able 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.280
 find we have to go towards the hand 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.250
 right as if we were going to the 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.349
 factions of dead orbit or the sect of 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.429
 future war let's see what brought us 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.369
 this week I hope all of you 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.170
 have used the video of how 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.910
 get or show off strange coins for 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.980
 that this week and all that come 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.380
 obviously you can buy everything 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.340
 what you need then if you can 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.650
 obviously improve their characters 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.630
 then we go to the song 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.020
 and we go to the post this week well what 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.190
 first that he brought us is an armor of 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.910
 chest for the titan who has light 21 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.340
 and the intellect of 108 we're going to see that 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.930
 what are your best and your improvements is 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.020
 that increases the amount of ammunition that 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.700
 can carry for special weapons and 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.440
 you will receive your colleagues in less 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.570
 time and they attitude super too 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.950
 generate additional orbs for your 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.270
 companions 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.950
 well yes we say that is not 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.810
 nothing bad though I think I've seen 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.960
 some shipowners from principal to pitan 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.870
 that brings improvements still much better by 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.470
 say it somehow in some way 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:23.720
 but what follows is this helmet for the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.940
 hunter and says he has interest 203 ok 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.450
 the improvements are that it increases the speed 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.670
 of melee attacks and the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.680
 Bow leaf attacks use less 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.690
 super good energy and helmet me 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.140
 It seems that it is much better to play the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.760
 crucible and I will not buy it I have a 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.810
 100 extra coins in if the fence I think 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.900
 that this week has not bought 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.260
 absolutely nothing but good here this 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.180
 this helmet has these two improvements and 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.820
 it's pretty good but still I do not 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.470
 like it improves them that more than anything for 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.590
 the crucible do not say that it would serve us 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.990
 a stop for the ryder would serve very 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.060
 little really good the following is 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.550
 some gloves glasses for the third one 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.810
 they are pretty good are in the intellect 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.640
 of 79 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.130
 and let's see what are your improvements 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.080
 then your first improvement is that at 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.390
 cause melee damage is reduced the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.190
 recovery time of the grenades and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.780
 that increases the duration of grenade ' 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.910
 solar is pretty good to more than 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.380
 seen many sorcerers with these 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.380
 gauntlet you want them true is that 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.880
 they are pretty cool, good guys, what 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.459
 sorry for the interruption as I explained 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.709
 in yesterday 's banfield video come back 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.239
 here for a few days to my mother's house 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.920
 and they are always asking and 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.099
 interrupting a bit but good we go 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.000
 to continue then the weapon of this 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:44.400
 week is the truth and in principle 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.590
 they will be rocket launchers I already have it 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.260
 they gave at the root as pÃ©rez by 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.760
 complete some parts of the raid and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.440
 let's see their improvements then the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.090
 this weapon detonated rockets before 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.849
 time depending on the proximity of 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.160
 the targets and also that the ammunition 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.760
 fired with this weapon will look for your 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.040
 targets so aggressively then 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.080
 basically what it does is that it shoots 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.910
 at the time of firing he will search 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.799
 to the objective, I already have it here 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.600
 visitors improving the little by little 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.750
 I use a lot really 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.940
 but let's say it's not a bad weapon 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.670
 if they have nothing else to buy then 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.010
 It is a good opportunity to buy 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.560
 this weapon I would not really buy it 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.860
 because as I always said a 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.880
 rocket launcher for example for the crucible 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.490
 exotic is not worth any 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.110
 rocket launcher so be it legend as it goes 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.330
 to kill the enemies in one 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.730
 Shooting 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.010
 to more of this then it is in grams 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.290
 meaning to this week's this 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.570
 helmet and then they could also 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.300
 try to try your luck in case 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.260
 have the 23 light notes in addition to this 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.540
 obviously all are 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.590
 consumables that he brings every week and 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.400
 is in these this synthetic recharge of 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.840
 of heavy weapon that this one the best is 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.090
 buy what you really spend the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.650
 coins of stable currencies sorry 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.510
 so basically that's what 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.280
 brings south that week I like I told you 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.190
 I have 100 coins that I will not use 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.830
 this week I prefer to spend more on in in 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.900
 some other weapon or suddenly something in 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.790
 something better next week then 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.260
 obviously it is your decision 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.609
 If they want to buy something there, it's 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.530
 everything that brings south this week 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.150
 then because they liked the video 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.020
 If it was like that, it's ok to leave your likes 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.190
 favorites 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.870
 comments that this is to say that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.160
 I work surf this week and of course 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.960
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel if 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.060
 still have not done it then I hope 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.860
 that they can achieve their characters with 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.460
 these armor and weapons and see you 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.460
 until next time
