so delicious they've done a lot of

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.370 
so delicious they've done a lot of
coconut<00:00:20.430> milk<00:00:20.460> type<00:00:20.760> things<00:00:21.080> I'm<00:00:22.080> not<00:00:22.260> too

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
coconut milk type things I'm not too

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.290

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.730 
sure if they've done any soy or if
that's<00:00:24.449> where<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.660> started<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.380> sure

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that's where they started I'm not sure

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.700 
that's where they started I'm not sure
exactly<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.910> essentially<00:00:27.660> here's<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.529> mean

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
exactly but essentially here's I mean

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.250 
exactly but essentially here's I mean
really<00:00:29.580> you're<00:00:29.880> sort<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.090> boils<00:00:30.359> down<00:00:30.390> okay<00:00:30.900> if

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
really you're sort of boils down okay if

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.150 
really you're sort of boils down okay if
it's<00:00:31.740> coming<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.489> box<00:00:32.969> or<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> package<00:00:34.160> right

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
it's coming in a box or a package right

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.790 
it's coming in a box or a package right
it's<00:00:35.399> maybe<00:00:36.180> better<00:00:36.600> than<00:00:36.750> some<00:00:37.079> alternatives

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it's maybe better than some alternatives

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.490 
it's maybe better than some alternatives
but<00:00:38.070> still<00:00:38.370> cashew<00:00:39.030> milk<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.750> easy<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.350> make

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
but still cashew milk is so easy to make

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.720 
but still cashew milk is so easy to make
from<00:00:40.620> scratch<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.300> almond<00:00:42.690> milk<00:00:42.870> so

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
from scratch just as is almond milk so

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.920 
from scratch just as is almond milk so
in<00:00:44.730> cashew<00:00:45.149> milk<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.420> actually<00:00:45.510> paper<00:00:45.840> but

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
in cashew milk is actually paper but

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.330 
in cashew milk is actually paper but
liberties<00:00:46.410> are<00:00:46.530> than<00:00:46.680> almond<00:00:47.010> milk<00:00:47.129> because

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
liberties are than almond milk because

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.770 
liberties are than almond milk because
you<00:00:47.430> don't<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> soak<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.120> cashews<00:00:48.300> for

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you don't have to soak the cashews for

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.529 
you don't have to soak the cashews for
as<00:00:48.899> long<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.469> even<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.160> all<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.969> cashew<00:00:51.390> milk

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
as long or even at all so cashew milk

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.729 
as long or even at all so cashew milk
essentially<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.670> cashews<00:00:53.670> water

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
essentially is is this cashews water

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.060 
essentially is is this cashews water
blender<00:00:55.739> blend<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.870> do<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.140> need<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.320> do

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
blender blend it do we really need it do

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
blender blend it do we really need it do
we<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> go<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> store<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> buy<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> box

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
we have to go to the store and buy a box

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
we have to go to the store and buy a box
or<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> carton<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.129> cashew<00:01:02.640> milk<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.000> is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
or a carton of cashew milk that is

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.350 
or a carton of cashew milk that is
loaded<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:04.489> carrageenan<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.060> some<00:01:06.240> other

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
loaded with carrageenan and some other

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.550 
loaded with carrageenan and some other
additives<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.500> don't

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
additives in there that we don't

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
additives in there that we don't
necessarily<00:01:07.740> need<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.400> added<00:01:08.610> sugars

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
necessarily need and added sugars

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
necessarily need and added sugars
I<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.290> another<00:01:10.650> thing<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.100> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
I don't think so another thing that I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.609 
I don't think so another thing that I
was<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.490> even<00:01:11.520> aware<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> until<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:13.350> couple

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
was not even aware of until a couple

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.969 
was not even aware of until a couple
months<00:01:13.770> ago<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:15.619> occasionally<00:01:16.619> we'll<00:01:16.799> buy

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
months ago is occasionally we'll buy

milk<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.299> wasn't<00:01:27.570> even<00:01:27.689> aware<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.290> until<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
milk I wasn't even aware of this until I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.340 
milk I wasn't even aware of this until I
looked<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.610> food<00:01:29.880> label<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.270> day<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
looked at the food label one day as I

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.649 
looked at the food label one day as I
think<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.070> was<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.250> five<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.939> ten<00:01:33.210> grams<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
think it was about five to ten grams of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.539 
think it was about five to ten grams of
sugar<00:01:33.900> somewhere<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> area<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> was

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
sugar somewhere in that area and I was

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.359 
sugar somewhere in that area and I was
thinking<00:01:35.990> why<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.380> sugar<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
thinking why is there sugar in the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.640 
thinking why is there sugar in the
almond<00:01:38.790> milk<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.840> when<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.200> make<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.439> at

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
almond milk because when I make it at

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.010 
almond milk because when I make it at
home<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.189> don't<00:01:41.640> remember<00:01:42.000> putting<00:01:42.270> sugar<00:01:42.659> into

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
home I don't remember putting sugar into

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.069 
home I don't remember putting sugar into
the<00:01:43.049> milk<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> realized<00:01:45.060> down<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the milk and then I realized down the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.800 
the milk and then I realized down the
aisle<00:01:46.320> was<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> unsweetened<00:01:47.579> version<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
aisle was the unsweetened version of the
