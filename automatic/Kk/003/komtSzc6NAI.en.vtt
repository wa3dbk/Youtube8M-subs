00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
is an all matte look we really have to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.140 
is an all matte look we really have to
focus<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.989> blending

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.670 

with<00:01:07.150> a<00:01:07.240> lid<00:01:07.420> I'm<00:01:07.630> using<00:01:07.660> a<00:01:08.020> Swiss<00:01:08.410> chocolate

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
with a lid I'm using a Swiss chocolate

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.370 
with a lid I'm using a Swiss chocolate
also<00:01:09.280> by<00:01:09.460> Mac<00:01:09.670> this<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.420> really<00:01:10.690> dry<00:01:10.930> shadow

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
also by Mac this is a really dry shadow

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.440 
also by Mac this is a really dry shadow
and<00:01:11.710> it's<00:01:11.830> kind<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.190> hard<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.490> build<00:01:12.730> up<00:01:12.910> so<00:01:13.390> you

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
and it's kind of hard to build up so you

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.880 
and it's kind of hard to build up so you
want<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.780> take<00:01:13.870> your<00:01:14.050> time<00:01:14.260> don't<00:01:14.740> get

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
want to take your time don't get

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.620 
want to take your time don't get
frustrated<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.610> just<00:01:15.760> keep<00:01:15.940> building<00:01:15.970> up<00:01:16.450> the

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
frustrated and just keep building up the

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.300 
frustrated and just keep building up the
lid<00:01:16.810> color<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:17.410> you<00:01:17.500> get<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.800> intensity

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
lid color and so you get the intensity

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.140 
lid color and so you get the intensity
that<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.640> want

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
that you want

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.520 
that you want
since<00:01:19.480> matte<00:01:19.690> shadows<00:01:20.080> are<00:01:20.230> a<00:01:20.260> little<00:01:20.440> bit

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
since matte shadows are a little bit

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.590 
since matte shadows are a little bit
stiffer<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.130> can<00:01:21.280> be<00:01:21.400> harder<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.729> blend<00:01:22.090> you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
stiffer and can be harder to blend you

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.410 
stiffer and can be harder to blend you
want<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.870> focus<00:01:23.020> on<00:01:23.350> blend<00:01:23.830> blend<00:01:24.370> blend<00:01:24.640> into

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
want to focus on blend blend blend into

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.969 
want to focus on blend blend blend into
your<00:01:25.570> arms<00:01:25.810> fall<00:01:26.020> off<00:01:26.050> just<00:01:26.440> so<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.890> don't

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
your arms fall off just so you don't

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.430 
your arms fall off just so you don't
have<00:01:27.160> any<00:01:27.490> harsh<00:01:27.760> lines<00:01:28.060> I'm<00:01:28.420> going<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.229> with<00:01:29.260> a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
help the blending process a little bit

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.540 
help the blending process a little bit
more<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.080> also<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.740> provide<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.160> little<00:01:36.430> bit

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
more and also to provide a little bit

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.160 
more and also to provide a little bit
more<00:01:36.700> depth<00:01:36.910> in<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.150> crease<00:01:37.360> even<00:01:37.600> though

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
more depth in the crease even though

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.930 
more depth in the crease even though
it's<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.380> same<00:01:38.410> color<00:01:38.830> as<00:01:38.950> on<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.430> lid<00:01:39.610> it'll

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
it's the same color as on the lid it'll

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.400 
it's the same color as on the lid it'll
still<00:01:40.270> make<00:01:40.479> that<00:01:40.630> outer<00:01:40.869> crease<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.380> little

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
still make that outer crease a little

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:52.050 
still make that outer crease a little
bit<00:01:41.800> darker

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.670
