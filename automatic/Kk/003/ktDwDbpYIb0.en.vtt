this<00:02:33.880> slowly<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.990> know<00:02:35.110> again<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.710> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
this slowly you know again I like the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.490 
this slowly you know again I like the
idea<00:02:36.040> but<00:02:36.640> without<00:02:37.390> double<00:02:37.780> team<00:02:37.930> blocking<00:02:38.380> in

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
idea but without double team blocking in

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.830 
idea but without double team blocking in
this<00:02:38.620> game<00:02:38.860> without<00:02:39.430> physics<00:02:40.060> pace<00:02:40.270> blocking

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
this game without physics pace blocking

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.930 
this game without physics pace blocking
this<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.800> going<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> continue<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.430> be<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.610> mess

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
this is going to continue to be a mess

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.450 
this is going to continue to be a mess
and<00:02:43.210> hinder<00:02:43.780> realistic<00:02:44.290> gameplay<00:02:44.530> because<00:02:45.340> it

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
and hinder realistic gameplay because it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.940 
and hinder realistic gameplay because it
doesn't<00:02:45.760> matter<00:02:46.030> who<00:02:46.750> my<00:02:46.780> halfback<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.680> right

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
doesn't matter who my halfback is right

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.180 
doesn't matter who my halfback is right
now<00:02:48.160> because<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.500> isn't<00:02:50.500> double-team

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
now because this isn't double-team

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.030 
now because this isn't double-team
blocking<00:02:51.670> any<00:02:52.240> person<00:02:52.990> can<00:02:53.200> go<00:02:53.380> up<00:02:53.560> here<00:02:53.920> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
blocking any person can go up here and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.700 
blocking any person can go up here and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
end why i think this can be fixed but i

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.220 
end why i think this can be fixed but i
just<00:03:36.850> want<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.150> take<00:03:37.300> a<00:03:37.330> look<00:03:37.420> here<00:03:37.840> at<00:03:37.960> a

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
just want you to take a look here at a

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.230 
just want you to take a look here at a
very<00:03:38.440> similar<00:03:38.770> situation<00:03:39.370> with<00:03:39.400> Roger<00:03:39.760> Craig

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
very similar situation with Roger Craig

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.110 
very similar situation with Roger Craig
you<00:03:40.690> can<00:03:40.870> see<00:03:41.080> up<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:41.320> front<00:03:41.650> number<00:03:41.980> 79<00:03:42.580> Martin

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
you can see up in front number 79 Martin

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.520 
you can see up in front number 79 Martin
in<00:03:43.270> Kelly<00:03:43.570> get<00:03:43.840> in<00:03:43.959> almost<00:03:44.260> an<00:03:44.440> identical

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
in Kelly get in almost an identical

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.310 
in Kelly get in almost an identical
position<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.760> all<00:03:45.880> we<00:03:46.000> saw<00:03:46.209> Dunlop<00:03:47.080> and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
position to all we saw Dunlop and

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.500 
position to all we saw Dunlop and
Matthews<00:03:47.830> where<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.670> tackle<00:03:49.090> has<00:03:49.209> lost

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
Matthews where the tackle has lost

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.990 
Matthews where the tackle has lost
outside<00:03:50.260> containment<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.250> rusher<00:03:51.790> and

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
outside containment of the rusher and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.120 
outside containment of the rusher and
now<00:03:52.450> it's<00:03:52.690> up<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.930> my<00:03:53.050> half<00:03:53.260> back<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.560> help<00:03:53.860> get

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
now it's up to my half back to help get

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.670 
now it's up to my half back to help get
that<00:03:54.280> containment<00:03:54.700> back<00:03:55.120> here<00:03:56.020> you<00:03:56.260> can<00:03:56.440> see

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
that containment back here you can see

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.070 
that containment back here you can see
with<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.490> double-team<00:03:57.940> blocking<00:03:58.450> animations

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
with the double-team blocking animations

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.120 
with the double-team blocking animations
Craig<00:03:59.440> comes<00:03:59.740> up<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.280> pushes<00:04:01.350> number<00:04:02.350> 79<00:04:02.860> back

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
Craig comes up and pushes number 79 back

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.120 
Craig comes up and pushes number 79 back
which<00:04:03.490> allows<00:04:03.910> Kelly<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:05.050> get<00:04:05.290> position<00:04:05.890> and

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
which allows Kelly to get position and

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.400 
which allows Kelly to get position and
now<00:04:06.520> you<00:04:06.580> can<00:04:06.880> see<00:04:07.090> some<00:04:07.510> physics<00:04:07.930> come<00:04:08.200> into

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
now you can see some physics come into

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.190 
now you can see some physics come into
play<00:04:08.650> because<00:04:09.160> they're<00:04:09.670> both<00:04:10.120> making<00:04:10.390> contact

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
play because they're both making contact

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.350 
play because they're both making contact
with<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:12.010> defender<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:12.730> they're<00:04:13.209> both

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
with this defender and they're both

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.240 
with this defender and they're both
pushing<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.020> you<00:04:14.110> can<00:04:14.260> see<00:04:14.470> there<00:04:14.709> you<00:04:15.130> know

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
pushing and you can see there you know

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.610 
pushing and you can see there you know

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
progress for my quarterback that's gonna

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.130 
progress for my quarterback that's gonna
look<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.910> little<00:04:22.000> weird<00:04:22.300> here<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.690> plays<00:04:22.930> over

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
look a little weird here the plays over

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.690 
look a little weird here the plays over
and<00:04:23.350> they<00:04:23.470> kind<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.770> all<00:04:23.979> let<00:04:24.250> up<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.640> that

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
and they kind of all let up and that

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.780 
and they kind of all let up and that
happens<00:04:25.600> but<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.650> me<00:04:26.830> this<00:04:27.100> is<00:04:27.160> what<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.460> want<00:04:27.729> to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
this game is the positives and getting

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.930 
this game is the positives and getting
them<00:04:50.330> implemented<00:04:50.870> into<00:04:51.230> madden<00:04:51.890> 14<00:04:52.340> if<00:04:52.580> it

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
them implemented into madden 14 if it

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.270 
them implemented into madden 14 if it
can<00:04:53.120> get<00:04:53.270> better<00:04:53.570> gameplay<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.920> do<00:04:54.980> just

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
out it's that over-committing I talked

about with madmen I think leads to a lot
of<00:05:39.860> problems<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.520> certainly<00:05:41.120> if<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.450> half

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
of problems and certainly if that half

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.600 
of problems and certainly if that half
back<00:05:41.900> at<00:05:42.110> stay<00:05:42.320> in<00:05:42.380> position<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:43.010> little<00:05:43.370> bit

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
longer we might see more realistic
