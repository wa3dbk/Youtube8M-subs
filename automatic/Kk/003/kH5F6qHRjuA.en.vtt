 Wanted the song is conditionally channel 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.450
 which became 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.460
 and shredded slows down good 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:40.739
 she went to these free courses here 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.570
 same police school 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.770
 wicklow tape gave you delivery to the rear 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.379

 would there be local items with visible all 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.439
 individually there is a different direction 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.469
 there is 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.780
 cosmetic techniques then even what is 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.030
 there are boys like that but in one word 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.740
 today to understand the direction when we 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:25.049
 were all together there were about 30 to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.020
 sorry for the cough please let's 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.640
 without the details about dude before this 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.579
 everyone likes means 1 orange 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.590
 came and said dried speak 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.899
 students in polish they study us 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.509
 a week before talking like that 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.649
 load on the bridge will offer the first 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.599
 lesson these were english in polish 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.439
 Kristina have a brain music 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:55.099
 Batu Khan, that is, foreign to her 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.319
 polish, too, on a strange messed up single 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.569
 the benefits I have already got used to select Polish 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.130
 words and when I was asked on 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.979
 English speak to me all the time 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.849
 Polish words define and then when 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.560
 to English teacher translated to 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.329
 Polish I needed from Polish 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.600
 In Russian translate in general this three 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.980
 hours was such an explosion just the same 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.620
 recommend to pull up 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.139
 Polish get a certificate of some kind 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.760
 Polish that in any case it is good at 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:31.160
 tom is a real profession and 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.160
 but I will carry you in pink 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.800
 it means that we have before our training 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.610
 school times always says so here 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:51.230
 remember this will be on the exam us 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:53.450
 already teach too teach and when 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.420
 the teacher said so here it is for you 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.450
 better to remember that it is useful to you 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.610
 need to remember and in context it turned out 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.200
 that it is not useful not in the exam but in 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.510
 real life in real work with 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.470
 real khalid patients 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.299
 not appropriately kristinka probably 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.620
 Remember do not let Nizovtsev passing forgetting 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.730
 learn the shop it's left but 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.750
 for a long time there is interesting our heads 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.840
 new well, except I still have two people 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.280
 were recorded this is our friends but 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.940
 they didn't come yet there was one guy 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.269
 shitty but he was on the other as well so 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.780
 poles so everything fall but in general u 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.269
 a mood purely because there 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.380
 mostly young guys maybe not 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.069
 I know years to eighteen nineteen 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.010
 such 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.310
 and 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.379
 here with me there were with me two 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.090
 however 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.720
 victories and young 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.720
 they are already working on this specialty and 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.659
 yasche but since it would not questioned directly 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.379
 but apparently they need confirmation 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:15.280
 paper documentary that they can 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.620
 anything yes i'm very sorry i promised 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.829
 make this kind of review about 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.389
 how to find those schools how to choose 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.820
 specialty free in principle 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:28.180
 nothing complicated but soon i'm this 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.910
 video will simply just did 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.740
 nearest hope for the next 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:38.350
 weeks i did it so what else such 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.320
 some domestic moments surprised me 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.370
 I don't know, maybe due to 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:49.240
 that so not quite mature there the basics 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.410
 the guys were young lecture goes you can 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.620
 get up get out you can take things at all 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.349
 look for david people go out for her and 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:05.470
 ok how would teachers on this 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:08.530
 reacts on change but can also 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.410
 being so simple at school that is how you are 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.580
 got used here at recess all went out 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.340
 and 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.150
 someone in the corridor of the statute on the street but 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.800
 all went out there only left 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.539
 come up all the higher I only stayed 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.610
 I think probably also need to go out but maybe 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:33.909
 be it just like that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.830
 I do what I would like well, that's when 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:38.409
 I drove home I was alone in my head 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.550
 Polish words are just just 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.160
 Polish and it's such a cool feeling 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.280
 interest rate 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.530
 Yes, that is, I would certainly have this very 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:54.710
 hard hard that's when the brain gets tired and in 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.810
 some moments I have such a bridge and not 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.880
 I can all you, I do not understand anything 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.130
 all i understand i need to write 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.190
 rewriting us well was such a screen 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.980
 these words rewrote one thing when you 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.680
 you know the language you read the word write 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:15.980
 him and I should have been like this 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:18.530
 looked like a blind letter was all 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.120
 inspected stole it ceased as if well 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.800
 like not taking your eyes off the screen and 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.540
 forced yourself do not disconnect because 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:32.150
 that all this and the exam we were told 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.990

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.960

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.860
 there will be an oral exam 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:57.650

00:06:51.860 --> 00:07:01.569
