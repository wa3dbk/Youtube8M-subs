it and if you look to the bottom right

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.979 
it and if you look to the bottom right
of<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.820> mountain<00:00:54.149> side<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.600> whatever<00:00:54.840> you're

of the mountain side or whatever you're

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
of the mountain side or whatever you're
looking<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.680> Bigfoot<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.270> now

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
looking at a Bigfoot is right there now

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.900 
looking at a Bigfoot is right there now
he's<00:00:57.960> only<00:00:58.079> there<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.620> two<00:00:59.309> seconds<00:00:59.789> at

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
he's only there for like two seconds at

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.069 
he's only there for like two seconds at
the<00:01:00.059> most<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:00.570> before<00:01:00.719> he<00:01:00.899> just

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the most I think before he just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
the most I think before he just
disappears<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.190> even<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> shoot

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
disappears you don't even have to shoot

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.160 
disappears you don't even have to shoot
him<00:01:02.910> he<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.149> disappears<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.049> just

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
him he just disappears but you can just

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380 
him he just disappears but you can just
see<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> silhouette<00:01:04.890> standing<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.880> I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
see the silhouette standing there and I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
see the silhouette standing there and I
think<00:01:06.689> that's<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.500> cool<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
think that's just really cool that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
think that's just really cool that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.780 
Rockstar still acknowledges this because

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.520 
that was one of the biggest mysteries of
all<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.700> story<00:01:17.939> goes<00:01:18.180> that

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
all time and I think the story goes that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.660 
all time and I think the story goes that
Bigfoot<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:20.009> supposed<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
Bigfoot was actually supposed to be in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
Bigfoot was actually supposed to be in
the<00:01:20.759> game<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> developers<00:01:21.869> put

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the game or one of the developers put

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690 
the game or one of the developers put
him<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.439> there<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.890> Rockstar<00:01:23.340> told<00:01:23.549> him<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
him in there but Rockstar told him to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.130 
him in there but Rockstar told him to
take<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.939> out<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.390> too<00:01:24.570> scary<00:01:24.930> or

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
take it out because it was too scary or

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.390 
take it out because it was too scary or
whatever<00:01:25.409> they<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.770> wanted<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.070> keep<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
whatever they just wanted to keep it a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
whatever they just wanted to keep it a
mystery<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:27.930> cool<00:01:28.110> what

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
mystery so that's really cool what

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.859 
mystery so that's really cool what
Rockstar<00:01:28.619> did<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.670> over<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.240> Red

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
Rockstar did there and then over in Red

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.929 
Rockstar did there and then over in Red
Dead<00:01:31.020> Redemption<00:01:31.200> there<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.790> an

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
Dead Redemption there was a there was an

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.149 
Dead Redemption there was a there was an
achievement<00:01:33.030> called<00:01:33.799> six<00:01:34.799> years<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
achievement called six years in the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.219 
achievement called six years in the
making<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.850> was<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.329> since<00:01:36.720> Bigfoot

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
making I think it was and since Bigfoot

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.109 
making I think it was and since Bigfoot
or<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> sasquatch<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.520> Red<00:01:38.939> Dead

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
or a sasquatch was in Red Dead

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.609 
or a sasquatch was in Red Dead
Redemption<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.720> they<00:01:40.140> were<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.590> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
Redemption and they were just kind of

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.990 
Redemption and they were just kind of
paying<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.950> homage<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.430> little<00:01:41.700> Easter

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
paying a homage to that little Easter

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.340 
paying a homage to that little Easter
Egg<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:42.960> they're<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
Egg there and then they're kind of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.859 
Egg there and then they're kind of
topping<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:43.950> off<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.549> him<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.659> game

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
topping it all off with him in this game

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.270 
topping it all off with him in this game
because<00:01:46.229> people<00:01:46.560> were<00:01:46.649> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.979> highly

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
because people were kind of highly

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.410 
because people were kind of highly
anticipating<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:48.329> were

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
anticipating that you know they were

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.789 
anticipating that you know they were
just<00:01:48.450> wondering<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.079> big<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.350> gonna<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.680> in

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
just wondering it's big for gonna be in

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.039 
just wondering it's big for gonna be in
this<00:01:49.920> game<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.880> rock<00:01:51.090> star<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.479> put<00:01:51.750> him<00:01:51.930> in

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.450 
this game and a rock star has put him in
there<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.430> just

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
