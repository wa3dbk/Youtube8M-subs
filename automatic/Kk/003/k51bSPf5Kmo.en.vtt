00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.750
 before the game 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.390

 roles this mafia maniac confused doctor 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.250
 sheriff and civilian 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.880
 of which three roles are negative this 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.170
 maniac 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.540
 Mafia confused their task is 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.640
 hide your roles as much as possible without causing 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.520
 suspicion among civilians 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.680
 victory over civilians is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 killing negative roles that is these 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.200
 three actors 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.850
 Now consider all the roles separately 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.149
 negative is to deny her role 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.880
 this mafia is the main of all three negatives 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.610
 at night when everyone else is sleeping mafia 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.369
 goes on the hunt and attempts on one 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.729
 from other roles if the mafia 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.360
 more than 1 the leader first comes to light 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.970
 magicians and only he wakes up at night 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.570
 maniac this lonely mania wakes up 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.480
 every even night kills either of 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.090
 from one players with this they can 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.430
 kill and mafia confused as well as maniac 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.670
 acts not in collusion with others negative 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.600
 Komi and at night can come to someone 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.590
 home and give the player some drink to someone at night 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.310
 come confused 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.519
 the next day has the right to vote 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.769
 positives 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.620
 that is, the positive roles are doctor 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.290
 the doctor wakes up after all the negatives 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.200
 and chooses who to cure while the doctor 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.840
 sheriff can treat herself 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.600
 wakes up after doc points to that 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.560
 whom he wants to check and lead 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.870
 inform them in this morning morning 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.680
 the conversation the sheriff can only hint a 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.540
 do not speak openly whom he will check 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.260
 civilians are major players who 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.900
 just sleeping at night can beat the mafia 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.069
 if the morning discussion is deductive 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.390
 figure out who the mafias are and decide to execute him 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.520
 these were all rules regarding roles 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.860
 Now we will show you the table for which 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.209
 number of people to take which roles for 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.459
 maximum balance 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.160
 but this is play real life 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.280
 now many edge through the internet 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.780
 the wright call program is much easier there 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.240
 the presenter uses personally and from but 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.060
 messages to transfer roles and then 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.520
 gets a response from their players this 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.730
 much more comfortable of course emotions less 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 than in real life but anyway 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.880
 time is running out if you want something with interesting 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.239
 using spend time then play 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.489
 Mafia even in real life 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.560
 programs rarely will we meet for a game 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.560
