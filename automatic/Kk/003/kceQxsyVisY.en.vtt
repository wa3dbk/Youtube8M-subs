00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
kitchen again where a lot of good

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.950 
kitchen again where a lot of good
experiments<00:00:21.600> not<00:00:22.140> only<00:00:22.410> mine<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:23.310> come<00:00:23.609> from

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
experiments not only mine have come from

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.939 
experiments not only mine have come from
so<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.289> couple<00:00:25.500> things<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:27.949> first

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
so a couple things going on here first

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.639 
so a couple things going on here first
one<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:30.140> we<00:00:31.140> took<00:00:31.349> some<00:00:31.710> craft<00:00:32.489> sticks<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.649> we

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
one we we took some craft sticks and we

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.400 
one we we took some craft sticks and we
poured<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.190> little<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.910> coffee<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
poured a little bit of coffee in the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.900 
poured a little bit of coffee in the
bottom<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> pie<00:00:38.489> tin

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
bottom of a pie tin

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.709 
bottom of a pie tin
and<00:00:39.410> then<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:41.010> let<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.430> set<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.180> what

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and then we just let it set and what

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.200 
and then we just let it set and what
happens<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.340> coffee<00:00:45.079> evaporates<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
happens is the coffee evaporates the

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.510 
happens is the coffee evaporates the
coffee<00:00:49.039> minutely<00:00:50.180> fibers<00:00:51.469> microscopically

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
coffee minutely fibers microscopically

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
coffee minutely fibers microscopically
whatever<00:00:53.520> those<00:00:53.789> terms<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:54.649> absorb<00:00:55.649> into<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
whatever those terms are absorb into the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.750 
whatever those terms are absorb into the
stick<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.899> as<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.410> they've<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
stick and as you can see they've kind of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.470 
stick and as you can see they've kind of
created<00:01:00.359> their<00:01:00.539> own<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.960> texture<00:01:02.480> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
created their own little texture and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.469 
created their own little texture and
that's<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.769> coffee<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.790> wikked<00:01:06.119> into

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's because the coffee is wikked into

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.830 
that's because the coffee is wikked into
the<00:01:06.600> stick<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.560> dried<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.460> stick<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> now

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the stick it's dried the stick and now

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.700 
the stick it's dried the stick and now
you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.590> create<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.369> wood<00:01:12.330> texture<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.260> wood

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you can create like wood texture on wood

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.980 
you can create like wood texture on wood
and<00:01:14.450> they<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:16.970> they<00:01:17.970> smell<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.810> bit

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and they don't they smell a little bit

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.850 
and they don't they smell a little bit
like<00:01:19.680> coffee<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:21.060> much<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> backs<00:01:22.560> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
like coffee but not much the backs of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.850 
like coffee but not much the backs of
the<00:01:23.040> sticks<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.850> also<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.990> stain<00:01:25.439> from

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the sticks are also a little stain from

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.910 
the sticks are also a little stain from
their<00:01:26.040> original<00:01:26.130> color<00:01:26.759> also<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.680> much

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
their original color also not that much

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.469 
their original color also not that much
but<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:31.259> create<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
but that's one way you can create a

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.710 
but that's one way you can create a
texture<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:34.229> craft<00:01:34.890> sticks<00:01:35.570> make<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
texture on your craft sticks make it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.600 
texture on your craft sticks make it
like<00:01:36.869> look<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.380> wood<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.280> an

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
like look like wood this was an

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
like look like wood this was an
experiment<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> previous<00:01:43.490> video<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.229> what

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
experiment on a previous video and what

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
experiment on a previous video and what
we<00:01:46.380> did<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.070> didn't<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.549> any<00:01:48.090> paper

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
we did is we didn't have any paper

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.469 
we did is we didn't have any paper
towels<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.320> tissues<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.790> used<00:01:51.000> eight<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
towels or tissues so we used eight and a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.590 
towels or tissues so we used eight and a
half<00:01:51.509> by<00:01:51.780> eleven<00:01:52.170> paper<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:53.700> put<00:01:53.939> water<00:01:54.180> at<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
half by eleven paper we put water at the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.499 
half by eleven paper we put water at the
bottom<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.530> tray<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> paper<00:01:57.329> down

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
bottom of the tray put the paper down

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.459 
bottom of the tray put the paper down
and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.579> these<00:01:59.820> large<00:02:00.240> craft<00:02:01.020> sticks

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and then we put these large craft sticks

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.270 
and then we put these large craft sticks
on<00:02:01.770> top<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.840> our<00:02:03.840> hope<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
on top of that and our hope is and I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.169 
on top of that and our hope is and I
will<00:02:05.460> show<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.700> even<00:02:06.450> clearer<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.439> next<00:02:07.920> shot

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
will show it even clearer this next shot

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.839 
will show it even clearer this next shot
our<00:02:09.179> hope<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.500> would<00:02:11.039> create<00:02:11.340> some

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
our hope is that we would create some

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.360 
our hope is that we would create some
unique

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
unique

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.660 
unique
blending<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.090> colors<00:02:14.530> much<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.799> this<00:02:16.250> or

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
blending of colors much like this or

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.500 
blending of colors much like this or
this<00:02:17.530> but<00:02:18.530> for<00:02:18.980> whatever<00:02:19.190> reason<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:20.120> think<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
this but for whatever reason I think it

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.070 
this but for whatever reason I think it
was<00:02:20.659> because<00:02:20.870> we<00:02:21.170> didn't<00:02:21.379> have<00:02:21.409> the<00:02:21.560> tissues

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
was because we didn't have the tissues

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.860 
was because we didn't have the tissues
it<00:02:24.080> really<00:02:24.440> didn't<00:02:24.769> make<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.510> dramatic<00:02:26.510> change

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
it really didn't make a dramatic change

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.860 
it really didn't make a dramatic change
of<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.409> color<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.730> see<00:02:28.760> some<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
of the color you can see some of the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.280 
of the color you can see some of the
color<00:02:30.700> transferred<00:02:31.700> here<00:02:32.450> from<00:02:32.569> one<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
color transferred here from one to the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.369 
color transferred here from one to the
other<00:02:34.780> but<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.959> was<00:02:36.170> more<00:02:36.560> obvious<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.459> the

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
other but it was more obvious in the

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.030 
other but it was more obvious in the
real<00:02:39.379> size<00:02:39.890> popsicle<00:02:40.819> sticks<00:02:41.799> but<00:02:42.799> you<00:02:42.890> have

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
real size popsicle sticks but you have

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.089 
real size popsicle sticks but you have
to<00:02:43.190> be<00:02:43.340> patient<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:44.329> know<00:02:44.480> poor<00:02:44.810> set<00:02:45.410> these<00:02:45.650> in

allow them to dry you know might the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.250 
allow them to dry you know might the
more<00:02:49.489> water<00:02:49.790> obviously<00:02:50.090> put<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:50.810> there<00:02:51.079> the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
more water obviously put in there the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.490 
more water obviously put in there the
longer<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.709> takes<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.280> dry<00:02:52.549> these<00:02:53.480> took<00:02:53.900> two

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
longer it takes to dry these took two

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.349 
longer it takes to dry these took two
days<00:02:54.680> completely<00:02:58.720> here<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.930> another<00:03:00.409> example

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
days completely here is another example

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.210 
days completely here is another example
these<00:03:02.359> we<00:03:03.049> used<00:03:03.379> food<00:03:03.950> coloring<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.690> we<00:03:05.930> took

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
these we used food coloring so we took

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.509 
these we used food coloring so we took
regular<00:03:07.329> popsicle<00:03:08.329> sticks<00:03:08.629> craft<00:03:09.079> sticks<00:03:09.519> we

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
regular popsicle sticks craft sticks we

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.059 
regular popsicle sticks craft sticks we
put<00:03:11.180> like<00:03:11.390> an<00:03:11.659> eighth<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:11.959> an<00:03:12.379> inch<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.799> water

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
put like an eighth of an inch of water

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.589 
put like an eighth of an inch of water
on<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.849> bottom<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.629> tin<00:03:16.239> dumped<00:03:17.239> some

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
on the bottom of the tin dumped some

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.770 
on the bottom of the tin dumped some
food<00:03:18.200> coloring<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.859> there<00:03:19.480> actually<00:03:20.480> what<00:03:20.660> we

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
food coloring in there actually what we

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.680 
food coloring in there actually what we
did<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.049> we<00:03:21.079> stirred<00:03:21.530> up<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.829> food<00:03:22.250> coloring

before<00:03:23.690> we<00:03:23.989> put<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.099> sticks<00:03:25.549> in<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.060> then<00:03:26.780> let

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
before we put the sticks in and then let

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.729 
before we put the sticks in and then let
it<00:03:27.109> all<00:03:27.500> evaporate<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:29.389> get<00:03:29.690> colored<00:03:30.260> you

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
this funny pattern design because of the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.830 
this funny pattern design because of the
dye<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.829> water<00:03:40.160> absorbed<00:03:41.150> and<00:03:41.359> wycked

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
dye and the water absorbed and wycked

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.860 
dye and the water absorbed and wycked
into<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.500> stick<00:03:43.599> you<00:03:44.599> get<00:03:44.840> these<00:03:45.169> funny

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
into the stick you get these funny

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.900 
into the stick you get these funny
designs<00:03:50.859> so<00:03:51.859> that's<00:03:51.980> how<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.190> color<00:03:52.489> your<00:03:52.760> own

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.909 
designs so that's how to color your own
sticks<00:03:53.889> this<00:03:54.889> is<00:03:55.129> a<00:03:55.160> little<00:03:55.430> better<00:03:55.579> example

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
sticks this is a little better example

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.680 
sticks this is a little better example
we<00:03:57.919> took<00:03:58.250> tissues<00:03:59.530> put<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.650> on<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.949> tin<00:04:01.690> cookie

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
we took tissues put it on the tin cookie

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.839 
we took tissues put it on the tin cookie
sheet<00:04:04.900> then<00:04:05.900> we<00:04:06.379> poured<00:04:06.889> a<00:04:06.980> little<00:04:07.099> water<00:04:07.519> on

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
sheet then we poured a little water on

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.430 
sheet then we poured a little water on
the<00:04:08.650> tissues<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:10.269> then<00:04:11.269> we<00:04:11.480> carefully<00:04:12.109> put

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
the tissues and then we carefully put

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.789 
the tissues and then we carefully put
the<00:04:12.709> craft<00:04:13.040> sticks<00:04:13.459> on<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:14.720> tissue<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.319> the

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
the craft sticks on the tissue and the

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.580 
the craft sticks on the tissue and the
key<00:04:16.310> on<00:04:16.489> all<00:04:16.639> these<00:04:16.880> others<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.870> ones<00:04:18.049> use<00:04:18.349> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
key on all these others the ones use the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.839 
key on all these others the ones use the
tissues<00:04:18.979> on<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.780> make<00:04:20.780> sure<00:04:20.959> they<00:04:21.139> touch

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
tissues on is make sure they touch

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.149 
tissues on is make sure they touch

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
because when they touch their absorb

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.980 
because when they touch their absorb
they're<00:04:25.640> able<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.450> wick

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
they're able to wick
