00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
gonna have a jar maker and a client and

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.240 
gonna have a jar maker and a client and
if<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:12.990> not<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.469> any<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.769> these<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.099> can

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and four over here for the output jar

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
and four over here for the output jar
file<00:00:34.050> you're<00:00:34.290> going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> put<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> name<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
file you're going to put the name of

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.360 
file you're going to put the name of
your<00:00:35.969> client<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:37.649> sure<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.950> type<00:00:38.219> in

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
your client and make sure you type in

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
your client and make sure you type in
jar<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> end<00:00:39.360> input<00:00:40.230> directory<00:00:40.620> you're

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
jar at the end input directory you're

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.840 
jar at the end input directory you're
going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.370> go<00:00:41.520> inside<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.059> client<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
going to go inside of your client and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.340 
going to go inside of your client and
then<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.149> stop<00:00:45.420> when<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.780> says<00:00:45.989> sign<00:00:46.200> right

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
then just stop when it says sign right

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
then just stop when it says sign right
there<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> manifest<00:00:47.640> template

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
there and then for the manifest template

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.220 
there and then for the manifest template
are<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> gonna<00:00:48.420> type<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
are you gonna type in and there is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
are you gonna type in and there is
client<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.600> create<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.690> jar<00:00:51.899> yes<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
client and create your jar yes so this

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.060 
client and create your jar yes so this
is<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.510> actual<00:00:54.960> jar<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
is the actual jar that you're going to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.720 
is the actual jar that you're going to
have<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.640> run<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> client<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
have to run the client and then when it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.389 
have to run the client and then when it
should<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.420> smoothly<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:01.949> let's<00:01:02.250> go

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
should go all smoothly so then let's go

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880 
should go all smoothly so then let's go
into<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> jar<00:01:02.910> signer<00:01:03.239> tab<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.739> you're

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
into the jar signer tab and then you're

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
into the jar signer tab and then you're
going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.220> find<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:06.000> jars<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.570> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
going to find your jars and which is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.910 
going to find your jars and which is
going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:08.240> local<00:01:09.240> disk<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.020> if

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
going to get in your local disk and if

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.039 
going to get in your local disk and if
it's<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.369> look<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.360> find

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it's in your look at this you find

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.380 
it's in your look at this you find
Program<00:01:13.590> Files<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.490> x<00:01:14.880> 86<00:01:15.119> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
Program Files and if you have x 86 it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.020 
Program Files and if you have x 86 it
will<00:01:15.479> say<00:01:15.630> x<00:01:15.900> 86<00:01:16.320> over<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.680> sink<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.189> open

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
will say x 86 over your sink just open

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.760 
will say x 86 over your sink just open
that<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.180> go<00:01:18.509> into<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.780> java<00:01:19.140> then<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that up go into your java then going to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
that up go into your java then going to
your<00:01:19.950> jdk<00:01:20.549> inside<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.659> bin<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> then

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
your jdk inside of your bin and then

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
your jdk inside of your bin and then
look<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> jar<00:01:23.759> sign<00:01:24.030> root<00:01:24.299> should<00:01:24.570> be

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
look for the jar sign root should be

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.910 
look for the jar sign root should be
over<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:27.240> lose<00:01:27.509> jar<00:01:28.080> sign<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.710> then

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
over here the lose jar sign and then

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.910 
over here the lose jar sign and then
we're<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.750> generate<00:01:30.750> our<00:01:31.049> two<00:01:31.560> our<00:01:31.650> key

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
we're going to generate our two our key

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
we're going to generate our two our key
story<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.189> already

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
story so and if this is not already

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.149 
story so and if this is not already
completed<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
completed all you're going to do all you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
completed all you're going to do all you
need<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.939> into<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.509> local<00:01:39.689> disk<00:01:40.020> go

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
need to do is go into the local disk go

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.710 
need to do is go into the local disk go
into<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.409> Program<00:01:40.770> Files<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.329> just<00:01:42.329> copy

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
into your Program Files and just copy

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.420 
into your Program Files and just copy
the<00:01:43.560> whole<00:01:43.649> entire<00:01:43.860> thing<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.280> did

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the whole entire thing that we did

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.149 
the whole entire thing that we did
before<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.720> once<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:47.009> bed

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
before and then once you go to your bed

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.850 
before and then once you go to your bed
and<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.759> find<00:01:48.030> key<00:01:48.270> tool<00:01:48.649> which<00:01:49.649> is

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and it's going to find key tool which is
