frosting around the edges just to smooth
it<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.930> we'll<00:01:55.380> add<00:01:55.560> another<00:01:55.680> layer<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.399> a

we<00:02:09.810> want<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> frosting<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.830> warm<00:02:11.160> enough

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
we want the frosting to be warm enough

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.520 
we want the frosting to be warm enough
to<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.790> liquid<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:12.660> hot<00:02:13.140> or<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.470> just

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to be liquid but not hot or it's just

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.890 
to be liquid but not hot or it's just
going<00:02:13.770> to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
going to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.750 
going to
melt<00:02:14.110> our<00:02:14.319> first<00:02:14.620> layer<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:15.010> frosting<00:02:15.430> off<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.600 
melt our first layer of frosting off the
cake<00:02:16.079> pour<00:02:17.079> it<00:02:17.260> over<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.590> top<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:18.220> like<00:02:18.310> we

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
cake pour it over the top just like we

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.429 
cake pour it over the top just like we
did<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.909> first<00:02:18.939> time<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.870> second<00:02:20.319> layer

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
did the first time and this second layer

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.380 
did the first time and this second layer
just<00:02:20.680> helps<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.220> get<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.489> frosting<00:02:21.909> really

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
just helps to get the frosting really

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
just helps to get the frosting really
smooth<00:02:22.720> now<00:02:23.079> it's<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.439> as<00:02:23.620> smooth<00:02:23.950> as<00:02:24.129> if<00:02:24.280> you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
smooth now it's not as smooth as if you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.759 
smooth now it's not as smooth as if you
used<00:02:24.670> cold<00:02:25.360> whipped<00:02:25.720> frosting<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.590> you

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
used cold whipped frosting and you

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.890 
used cold whipped frosting and you
spread<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.370> out<00:02:27.489> using<00:02:27.909> your<00:02:28.060> spatula<00:02:28.299> and

spread it out using your spatula and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.630 
spread it out using your spatula and
leveled<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.319> all<00:02:29.470> out<00:02:29.680> but<00:02:29.920> because<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.370> cake

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
leveled it all out but because this cake

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.580 
leveled it all out but because this cake
is<00:02:30.790> quite<00:02:31.060> small<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.689> it<00:02:32.140> has<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.470> many
