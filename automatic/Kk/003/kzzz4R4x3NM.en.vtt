minutes<00:00:44.070> most<00:00:44.430> definitely<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.970> defense<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.720> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
minutes most definitely a defense is the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.299 
minutes most definitely a defense is the
most<00:00:45.960> boring<00:00:46.140> bar<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.559> game<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> defense

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
most boring bar the game the defense

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.820 
most boring bar the game the defense
wins<00:00:47.610> games<00:00:47.729> and<00:00:48.210> without<00:00:48.420> defense<00:00:48.839> can't<00:00:49.710> do

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
wins games and without defense can't do

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.100 
wins games and without defense can't do
much<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:51.089> get<00:00:51.269> out<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.479> running<00:00:52.049> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
much so we get out there running the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.359 
much so we get out there running the

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:53.369 
floor stopping the ball as much as

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
possible stop in as many shots and

culture<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.500> many<00:00:55.769> shots<00:00:55.949> something<00:00:56.339> in

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
culture that's many shots something in

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.859 
culture that's many shots something in
his<00:00:56.519> helplessness<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.089> helped<00:00:57.570> me<00:00:57.690> feel

more<00:00:57.900> time<00:00:58.229> you<00:00:59.129> seem<00:00:59.339> very<00:00:59.369> active<00:01:00.030> even<00:01:00.449> when

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
more time you seem very active even when

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
more time you seem very active even when
you<00:01:02.010> probably<00:01:02.309> didn't<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.610> a<00:01:02.640> shot<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:02.970> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
you probably didn't have a shot at the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.070 
you probably didn't have a shot at the
block<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.540> you<00:01:03.600> were<00:01:03.720> still<00:01:03.930> going

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
block you know you were still going

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
block you know you were still going
after<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.250> had<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> nice<00:01:06.090> block<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.600> was

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
after it you had a nice block that was

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.120 
after it you had a nice block that was
called<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.200> foul<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> think<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.040> probably

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
called a foul but I think was probably

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.720 
called a foul but I think was probably
clean<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.260> something<00:01:10.620> that

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
clean you know is that something that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.460 
clean you know is that something that
you<00:01:11.730> know<00:01:11.850> even<00:01:12.030> against<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.690> shorter<00:01:13.140> smaller

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.140 
you know even against a shorter smaller
