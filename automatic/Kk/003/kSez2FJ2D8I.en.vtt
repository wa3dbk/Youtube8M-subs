00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.990
 good afternoon guests 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:11.940
 visitors current buyers 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.390
 hope the future of the online store 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.530
 electrons today we will tell about such 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.090
 interesting is important and useful and even 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.360
 operations like checking with 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.529
 multimeter battery voltage 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:37.380
 batteries for what it should be done well 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.220
 let's say so if the user 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.950
 rechargeable battery occurs 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.950
 doubts he can go and buy new ones 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.399
 but still it is better to spend some 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.200
 minutes 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.380
 play it safe and find out 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.690
 is it really necessary to change or not 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.190
 for any battery there 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.050
 which let's say here provided 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.570
 things on the phone we'll see there 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.040
 certain level of worker voltage 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.340
 which is somewhere around four 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.540
 volt well here's the phone for the battery 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.490
 which we now gently pull it out 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.170
 mean words like nokia here 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.780
 holographic sticker please 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.380
 attention is very important with a view 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.940
 quality assurance model confirmation 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.290
 bl-5c 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.310
 means here indicated may not be visible 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.880
 but I will tell you 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.430
 3.7 volts and what does it mean it means 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.320
 that a fully charged battery is not 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.400
 inserted into the phone ie without 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.090
 load must have such a voltage 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.310
 under load 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.500
 this voltage will drop a little on 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.100
 a few tenths volts 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.520
 Well, in principle, the errors are valid plus 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.710
 minus there are a few tenths but if you 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.770
 let's follow the instructions charge the battery 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.360
 as written three hours and measure and 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.759
 tester and place 3 and 7 will be two volts 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.799
 assume that the battery is not charging 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.150
 takes she developed her resource and 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.600
 of course to be replaced 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.100
 this battery was purchased 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.530
 in January of this year that is basically with 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.120
 read operated according to 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.690
 instructions are normal let's 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.330
 check what voltage she holds 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.670
 let's say idle without load 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 phone we take for this purpose itself 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.490
 let's say so simple 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.430
 the device is by the way in our online store 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.280
 the choice of devices let's say this trade 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.010
 marks at the meeting is very large wide 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.560
 why is this done because for every 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.850
 goals you can pick up an oparah let's say for 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.130
 Here are the goals of all these things to measure 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.990
 the function of this small is enough 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.540
 in my opinion a compact device 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.480
 by the way on which even after feeling after 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.060
 and such very nice comfortable caps 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.890
 protective sharp edges of the test leads for us 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.950
 it is important why because contact 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.580
 sites here are not so great well let's 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:18.560
 try to make our measurement i 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:21.890
 I will touch means conductors and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.740
 see what we get on the screen 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.620
 By the way , what is more good than a multimeter so that 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.680
 no big deal if we suddenly mean 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.980
 we will have the wrong polarity 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.980
 let's try to measure now 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.720
 contact pick up contact 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.720
 so look what we have on the screen 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:53.329
 we have a little screen 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:57.349
 3 and 89 or 39 download now do not need to 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:01.129
 we will generally consider 39 ulta what it 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:05.209
 means it means as I said that 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:09.319
 under load when we insert back 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:13.480
 battery in the phone turn it on 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.349
 electrical circuits internal to 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.549
 chips starts to move 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.639
 stress load 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.949
 naturally a little stress and strain 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.510
 place 3 and 9 which we have now received 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:30.560
 we have just our standard 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.060
 the value of our 3.7 volts and what it 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.240
 He speaks 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:40.210
 Battery life is far from generating it 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:44.419
 so let's say well practically new therefore 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.050
 even without other signs you can say 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.280
 well , at least she will still serve 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.180
 long enough 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.860
 so if you want to spend such 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.580
 operation thought you see nothing complicated 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.910
 no pull out the battery take 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.639
 Multimeter measure and since 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.610
 and voiced the order of numbers here 3 7 tenths 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:11.710
 volts it is absolutely safe for you 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:16.250
 and for the multimeter the only thing of course 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.650
 it is advisable to be careful and try 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.669
 but to tell you that's not short-circuited 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.590
 the site that's because the battery at 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.330
 short circuit can lose 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.900
 some part of the tank so be 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.949
 neat 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.500
 but once again I stress that what is good 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.920
 let's say multimeters of this brand 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.000
 what is very here 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.180
 thin here thin probes here here 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.050
 let's see again but this is the same 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.970
 the most indicator is good for us 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.070
 provided 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:55.200
 let's say so smoothly a few hours 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.960
 internet talk therefore 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:03.520
 if we helped 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:06.400
 We will be glad to use only 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.790
 Use quality batteries for 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.670
 measuring devices not necessarily 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.680
 the most expensive as you can see even this 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.650
 device brand other bridges quite 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.380
 enough thank you for your attention 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.380
 call come to us good luck
