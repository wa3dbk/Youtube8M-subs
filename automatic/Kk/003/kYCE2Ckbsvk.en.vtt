00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.870
 once upon a time relatively long ago we already 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.370
 went to the Mazda rx8 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.030
 got great pleasure from 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.500
 drive 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 but that was the rx-8 of the Japanese market with the right 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.380
 driving respectively with wheels with 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.600
 non-standard you there with great 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.680
 here is europe here is left hand drive and wheels 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.000
 standard so we will continue 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.410
 our acquaintance with this is extremely 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 uncommon in 2 miles we recall in brief in 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.670
 What is his outstanding first of all? 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.950
 this engine is a rotary piston motor 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.590
 born of the gloomy German genius in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 the face of walter front and felix vankel in 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.579
 far already fifty-seventh year on not 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 entrance only mazda having mass 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.930
 congenital deficiencies he possesses one 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.090
 undeniable dignity of emergency 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.980
 compactness of compactness imply 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 unique layout capabilities 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.039
 designer hands 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.590
 cars and among other things 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.390
 the wankel engine has a very modest 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.370
 so-called translated worker 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.979
 the volume of which is extremely positive effect 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.510
 on the calculations of our customs, and we note 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.580
 one advantage of such a motor 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.380
 it is relatively inexpensive when 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 sold as a spare in 3 completeness 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.280
 water on this car the engine was 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.439
 replaced by a new one not repeat 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.439
 contract she is brand new 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.470
 this car is impossible to drive 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.510
 quietly at first sound with nothing 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.580
 comparable sound of the engine is not burdened 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.560
 reciprocating and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.020
 moments of inertia of the second order 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.340
 a bit like a motorcycle but all 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.170
 not the same highway 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.850
 lightweight and compact motor take a look 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.320
 closer to the center of mass that gives 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.670
 substantial reduction in inertia moment 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.680
 around the vertical axis 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.750
 translated into primitive modern language 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.460
 although we will not operate more 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.050
 available terms see 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.360
 program take a look at some 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.040
 google or yandex but also over this highway 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.520
 very carefully worked in the plan 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.650
 settings 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.570
 all the same many decade of cooperation with 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.220
 Ford extremely positive impact on 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.930
 abilities of Moscow engineers 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.270
 properly configure the handling and 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.970
 getting what the Japanese are more confident 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.979
 call darling wing less authentic 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.390
 option sounds like driving only yes 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.970
 excuse me my english or 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.860
 in Russian driver's to the pleasure of at least 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.700
 this and rear-wheel drive which is enough 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.990
 capriciously 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.750
 skillful hands 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.240
 This rear-wheel drive is easy enough 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.240
 amenable to training and taming 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.140
 still mazda have been practicing for a long time 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.300
 some kind of close european 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.370
 manageability settings 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.550
 I almost immediately turned off the system 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.010
 stabilization because in japanese 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.820
 traditions she rather rude 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.770
 nips any attempt 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.950
 portray some kind of extreme 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.950
 drive 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.090
 wanted to 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.430
 the Japanese tried to tune it in here on 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.460
 slightly later triggers but they have 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.170
 it didnâ€™t happen as usual 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.180
 they drive allows very impressive 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.270
 drift well if not drift then 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.460
 least try the truth of course i 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.040
 while stabilization is quite dramatic and 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.840
 but I think I still just lack 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.840
 his contribution is not in this car 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.460
 need to 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.740
 Do a little bit glad that overlapping 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.000
 action to do and a little bit earlier 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.000
 finish them 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.900
 clean like a baby's tear nothing 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.900
 blurred driver 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.790
 few did not dare to final not look 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.790
 on another car outside the track 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.819
 when driving on similar cars 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.569
 absolutely do not want to talk about 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:15.580
 ride smoothness about the convenience of landing want 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.580
 landing here no complaints off 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.289
 because it's clean drive clean 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.289
 adrenalin 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.659
 Of course you know how to fly and even a little 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.550
 mazda rx-8 this gourmet food can be 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.099
 anyone especially our homegrown 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.080
 Street and other racers scornfully 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.659
 smirk pier what else drive 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.369
 if under the hood in the region of 200 horses but 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.289
 let's remember what enzo answered 

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:48.349
 ferrari to the question and what's in his garage 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.209
 does a little bug rover mini cooper so here 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.550
 legendary race driver and creator 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:53.599
 iconic car named himself answered 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.969
 I ride on it 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.309
 for cheering up that huge 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:02.050
 thanks to the happy owner of this 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:05.330
 car for one more such moments 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.809
 the real driver's who kicks because 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.389
 that mazda rx-8 is probably one of 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:15.369
 major tools in the world by 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.369
 getting this one likes you
