front<00:00:58.100> or<00:00:58.250> rear<00:00:58.309> it<00:00:58.910> can<00:00:59.239> also<00:00:59.329> move<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.809> left

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
front or rear it can also move it left

front or rear it can also move it left
or<00:01:00.200> right<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:00.829> if<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.040> go<00:01:01.250> left<00:01:01.790> rear<00:01:02.329> guess

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719

check<00:01:14.750> out<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:14.960> hybrid<00:01:15.549> ok<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.820> x6<00:01:17.180> hybrid

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
check out a hybrid ok so the x6 hybrid

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.359 
check out a hybrid ok so the x6 hybrid
is<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.659> concept<00:01:18.350> right<00:01:18.590> here<00:01:18.740> behind<00:01:18.890> me<00:01:19.159> but

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
is a concept right here behind me but

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.300 
is a concept right here behind me but
what<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> concept<00:01:20.080> gas-electric<00:01:21.080> hybrid<00:01:21.799> but

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
what a concept gas-electric hybrid but

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.100 
what a concept gas-electric hybrid but
the<00:01:22.400> hybrid<00:01:22.820> motors<00:01:23.210> on<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.540> vehicle<00:01:23.780> are

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
the hybrid motors on this vehicle are

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.870 
the hybrid motors on this vehicle are
actually<00:01:24.560> integral<00:01:25.100> inside<00:01:25.729> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
actually integral inside the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.210 
actually integral inside the
transmission<00:01:26.510> casing<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.220> sometimes

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
transmission casing and sometimes

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.620 
transmission casing and sometimes
they'll<00:01:28.460> do<00:01:28.580> different<00:01:28.909> things<00:01:28.939> you<00:01:29.510> might

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
they'll do different things you might

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.359 
they'll do different things you might
have<00:01:29.840> both<00:01:30.080> giving<00:01:30.409> power<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:31.040> might<00:01:31.220> have

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
have both giving power you might have

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.160 
have both giving power you might have
both<00:01:31.640> regenerating<00:01:32.450> power<00:01:32.479> or<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.020> might

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
both regenerating power or you might

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.890 
both regenerating power or you might
have<00:01:33.380> one<00:01:33.619> regenerating<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.490> one<00:01:35.090> creating

have one regenerating and one creating

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.510 
have one regenerating and one creating
power<00:01:36.080> they<00:01:36.530> can<00:01:36.710> split<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.009> up<00:01:37.159> with<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.340> very

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
power they can split it up with a very

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.850 
power they can split it up with a very
complex<00:01:38.000> logic<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.630> they<00:01:38.990> say<00:01:39.229> as<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.409> result

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860
