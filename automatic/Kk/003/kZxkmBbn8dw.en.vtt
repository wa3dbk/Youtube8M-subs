00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
to find the center of spawn so the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.740 
to find the center of spawn so the
center<00:00:19.890> spawn<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.660> of

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
center spawn is going to be in one of

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.990 
center spawn is going to be in one of
these<00:00:21.810> four<00:00:22.170> corners<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> spawner<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.519> to

these four corners of the spawner and to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.179 
these four corners of the spawner and to
figure<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.330> which<00:00:24.510> corner<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:26.010> want

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189

going to be annoying but in which
direction<00:00:32.149> your<00:00:33.149> x<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.410> z<00:00:34.800> coordinates<00:00:35.070> both

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
direction your x and z coordinates both

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.270 
direction your x and z coordinates both
go<00:00:35.820> down<00:00:36.530> that's<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> center

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
go down that's going to be the center

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940 
go down that's going to be the center
spawn<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.730> if<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.210> way<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:40.320> ex<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.770> going

annoying<00:02:55.260> eventually<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.350> spawn<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.710> going

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
annoying eventually the spawn is going

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.860 
annoying eventually the spawn is going
to<00:02:56.950> stop<00:02:57.220> though<00:02:57.460> so<00:02:57.820> I'll<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:58.600> fun<00:02:59.130> alright<00:03:00.130> so

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.240 

once<00:03:04.870> we<00:03:05.020> have<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.170> 8<00:03:05.350> by<00:03:05.500> 8<00:03:05.530> square<00:03:05.770> we're

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
once we have that 8 by 8 square we're

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.530 
once we have that 8 by 8 square we're
gonna<00:03:06.340> add<00:03:06.670> another<00:03:07.000> layer<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:09.330> I'm<00:03:10.330> gonna

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
gonna add another layer to it I'm gonna

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.390 
gonna add another layer to it I'm gonna
fill<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:10.960> another<00:03:11.230> layer<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.770> this<00:03:11.920> will<00:03:12.160> stop

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
fill in another layer and this will stop

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.850 
fill in another layer and this will stop
the<00:03:12.580> spawning<00:03:13.050> once<00:03:14.050> everything<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.590> filled

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
the spawning once everything is filled

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.830 
the spawning once everything is filled
in<00:03:15.900> I'm<00:03:16.900> gonna<00:03:17.080> run<00:03:17.320> out<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.470> blocks<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.600> let<00:03:19.750> me

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
in I'm gonna run out of blocks so let me

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.410 
in I'm gonna run out of blocks so let me
just<00:03:20.020> use<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.350> for<00:03:20.590> now<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.850> once<00:03:25.030> we<00:03:25.150> stop

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
just use this for now so once we stop

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.020 
just use this for now so once we stop
the<00:03:25.600> spawning<00:03:26.340> it'll<00:03:27.340> be<00:03:27.430> much<00:03:27.610> easier<00:03:27.640> to

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the spawning it'll be much easier to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.560 
the spawning it'll be much easier to
work<00:03:28.150> with<00:03:28.300> oh<00:03:29.700> boy<00:03:30.760> alright<00:03:31.120> let's<00:03:31.300> get<00:03:31.450> some
