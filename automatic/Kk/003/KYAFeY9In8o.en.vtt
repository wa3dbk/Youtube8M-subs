00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.040
 to come with me, although again with 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.470
 because today it's about it we should 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.490
 carbohydrates and fats or fat 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.590
 separate 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.449
 in the meals is often said 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.640
 that the worst meals are the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.010
 Green hills and fat occur together 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.420
 look at the whole or 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.780
 We find out Mondays is always 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 Let's read why we do that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.210
 wins ul would want to become one 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.420
 send carbohydrates insuline house 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.030
 insulin is a memory, so to speak 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.610
 combo that means one says so target groups 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
 colleague pour out insulin and is fat 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.930
 it is invited directly directly 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.239
 that is not really the case 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.570
 our carbohydrates as well as ours 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.020
 Fats lie in the martin 's first 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.149
 means that the whole means to do 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.040
 linger each food has 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.630
 He has his own man, so to speak 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.729
 tries to examine the whole thing 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.640
 I wish you this video now here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.650
 purely on the phone please in the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 I can look at the description 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.890
 mobile still show nothing 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.369
 youtube is actually there I believe 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.909
 not yet so far at least now 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.619
 2014 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.630
 For one thing, there are the brands 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.720
 Administrator that means in the stomach comes everything 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 together and in the gut no later than that 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.479
 searched 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.009
 that means when we first go away ourselves 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.280
 So if we could do that 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.159
 the carbohydrates and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.470
 do not meet in the stomach then meet 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.200
 you are ready in things so in the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.700
 digestive tract because there is a lot there 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.759
 not only many hours but 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.159
 partly also for days honoring that 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.560
 For one, this separation is already 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.140
 actually not possible 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.350
 and for another look us now or 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.270
 he me again the insulin discharge 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.009
 by carbohydrates are the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.930
 Carbohydrates are the only ones 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.490
 or is it the only nutrient there is 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.380
 the only nutrient of insulin 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.119
 appears or pour out no 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.759
 in fact I do not left you here 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.550
 again a mobile phone down again 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.390
 third the video my video about the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.860
 Insulin index is also available 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.680
 protein-rich things and also rich in fat 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.800
 say insulin pour out that is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.630
 even a few carbohydrates and avoid 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.780
 maybe with protein and fat in it 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.459
 then the protein can do the same 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.590
 pour out insulin as well as the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.290
 carbohydrates, in part, maybe even 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.450
 more so a unique food 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.079
 may well be more insulin 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.269
 as a carbohydrate rich 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.670
 Food and that is quite often 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.070
 So forget the insulin index 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.430
 quite important is basic knowledge why 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.459
 that is also why this coni dransfeld 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.060
 really does not really separate 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.519
 is possible and maybe none 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.010
 makes sense as I said in a nutshell 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.260
 again very briefly the answer to 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.530
 I can ask the carbohydrates question 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.200
 I am to represent Konrad and represent 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.079
 No, I have carbs and fat 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.980
 in it to no but it is wrong so 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.290
 I can do it 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.390
 Of course you can do that if you can 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.340
 In my opinion, the life around 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.019
 a lot harder 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.360
 want to do because you have to in 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.580
 isolated carbohydrates food 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.920
 find isolated fed food 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.780
 Find isolated protein foods and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.360
 basically taken in the stomach and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.400
 The intestine pulls everything together and it comes 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.129
 not only very many 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.599
 carbohydrates insulin out but also 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.599
 quite a lot of other foods
