and<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.220> am<00:02:38.310> NOT<00:02:38.519> what<00:02:38.730> often<00:02:39.150> happens<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.810> we

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
and I am NOT what often happens is we

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.039 
and I am NOT what often happens is we
start<00:02:41.190> off<00:02:41.340> somewhere<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.390> middle<00:02:42.660> or<00:02:42.900> to

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
start off somewhere in the middle or to

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.199 
start off somewhere in the middle or to
the<00:02:43.080> right<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.530> center<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.549> Republicans

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the right of center then the Republicans

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.600 
the right of center then the Republicans
go<00:02:45.390> into<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> extreme<00:02:46.230> right<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:47.160> end<00:02:47.370> up

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
go into the extreme right and we end up

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.850 
go into the extreme right and we end up
with<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:48.239> settlement<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.080> very<00:02:49.290> far<00:02:49.620> to

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
with a settlement that is very far to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.680 
with a settlement that is very far to
the<00:02:49.950> right<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.340> think<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> president<00:02:51.630> should

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
the right I think the president should

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.539 
the right I think the president should
have<00:02:52.049> been<00:02:52.230> very<00:02:52.500> clear<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:52.950> terms<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.370> social
