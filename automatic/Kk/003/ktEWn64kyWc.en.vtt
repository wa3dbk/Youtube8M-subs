I'm<00:03:21.740> starting<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.280> enjoy<00:03:22.610> Slayer<00:03:23.240> lacs

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
I'm starting to enjoy Slayer lacs

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.600 
I'm starting to enjoy Slayer lacs
especially<00:03:24.380> because<00:03:24.740> every<00:03:25.220> task<00:03:25.400> is

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
especially because every task is

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.160 
especially because every task is
different<00:03:26.110> every<00:03:27.110> drops<00:03:27.470> or<00:03:27.650> difference<00:03:27.980> and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
different every drops or difference and

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.729 
different every drops or difference and
learning<00:03:30.170> my<00:03:30.740> way<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:32.140> cannoning<00:03:33.140> efficiently

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
learning my way to cannoning efficiently

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.640 
learning my way to cannoning efficiently
so<00:03:34.250> every<00:03:34.700> double<00:03:35.120> hit<00:03:35.300> spots<00:03:35.690> will<00:03:36.620> be

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
so every double hit spots will be

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.370 
so every double hit spots will be
recorded<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.550> I<00:03:37.730> will<00:03:37.910> do<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.450> guide<00:03:38.959> on<00:03:39.230> that
