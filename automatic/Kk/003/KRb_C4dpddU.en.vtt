ever<00:00:00.870> since<00:00:01.170> his<00:00:01.319> amateur<00:00:01.589> days<00:00:01.890> I've<00:00:02.100> always

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
ever since his amateur days I've always

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.730 
ever since his amateur days I've always
felt<00:00:02.460> that<00:00:02.580> David<00:00:02.939> Price<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.929> guy<00:00:04.230> who<00:00:04.290> lacks

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
felt that David Price is a guy who lacks

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.829 
felt that David Price is a guy who lacks
confidence<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.549> self-belief<00:00:05.790> now<00:00:06.779> he

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
confidence and self-belief now he

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.000 
confidence and self-belief now he
obviously<00:00:07.020> has<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> certain<00:00:07.740> amount<00:00:07.830> of

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
obviously has a certain amount of

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.160 
obviously has a certain amount of
confidence<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.670> confidence<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> thing

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
confidence and confidence is a thing

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.080 
confidence and confidence is a thing
that<00:00:10.200> can<00:00:10.440> go<00:00:10.530> up<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.889> down<00:00:11.010> depending<00:00:11.340> on

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
that can go up and down depending on

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.089 
that can go up and down depending on
your<00:00:12.240> experiences<00:00:12.929> some<00:00:13.230> experiences<00:00:13.860> will

your experiences some experiences will

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.580 
your experiences some experiences will
push<00:00:14.370> your<00:00:14.730> confidence<00:00:15.210> levels<00:00:15.509> up<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.109> other

push your confidence levels up and other
experiences<00:00:17.039> will<00:00:17.490> bring<00:00:17.730> your<00:00:17.910> confidence

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
experiences will bring your confidence

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.710 
experiences will bring your confidence
levels<00:00:18.630> down<00:00:18.920> but<00:00:19.920> everyone<00:00:20.310> has<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.880> baseline

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
levels down but everyone has a baseline

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.429 
levels down but everyone has a baseline
level<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.380> confidence<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:23.970> equal

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
level of confidence and it's not equal

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
level of confidence and it's not equal
amongst<00:00:25.439> people<00:00:25.619> some<00:00:26.490> people<00:00:26.519> are

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
amongst people some people are

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.820 
amongst people some people are
inherently<00:00:27.210> more<00:00:27.960> confident<00:00:28.560> than<00:00:28.650> others

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
inherently more confident than others

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.450 
inherently more confident than others
and<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.269> trait<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.619> genetic

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and this can be a trait that is genetic

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.229 
and this can be a trait that is genetic
a<00:00:32.640> lot<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.239> or<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.320> based<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.710> very

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
a lot of time or it can be based on very

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.520 
a lot of time or it can be based on very
or<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> series<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.309> events<00:00:39.020> in<00:00:40.020> their<00:00:40.350> life

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
or a series of events in their life

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.889 
or a series of events in their life
maybe<00:00:41.430> early<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.090> their<00:00:42.239> life<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.420> set

maybe early on in their life that set

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.950 
maybe early on in their life that set
that<00:00:42.930> confidence<00:00:43.649> level<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.690> it's<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that confidence level and it's like a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.990 
that confidence level and it's like a
confidence<00:00:46.680> equilibrium<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:47.730> always

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
confidence equilibrium that they always

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.049 
confidence equilibrium that they always
seem<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> come<00:00:48.480> back<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.760> David

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
seem to come back to but with David

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
seem to come back to but with David
Price<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> say<00:00:52.140> he's<00:00:52.410> always<00:00:52.590> seems<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
Price like I say he's always seems to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.069 
Price like I say he's always seems to
lack<00:00:53.129> confidence<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.449> thing<00:00:54.690> he<00:00:54.870> seems

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
lack confidence but one thing he seems

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.590 
lack confidence but one thing he seems
to<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.530> confident<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.480> he

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to be very confident about is that he

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.010 
to be very confident about is that he
could<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.840> any<00:00:58.170> Joshua<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.579> find<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.020> very

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
could be any Joshua and I find that very

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139 
could be any Joshua and I find that very
interesting<00:01:01.399> very<00:01:02.399> very<00:01:02.489> interesting

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
interesting very very interesting

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.929 
interesting very very interesting
because<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.559> I've<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.949> explained<00:01:05.400> he's

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
because as as I've just explained he's

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
because as as I've just explained he's
not<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> most<00:01:06.360> confident<00:01:06.810> guy<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.830> he<00:01:07.920> seems

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
not the most confident guy but he seems

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.010 
not the most confident guy but he seems
very<00:01:08.280> very<00:01:08.880> sure<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> himself<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.840> comes

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
very very sure of himself when it comes

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.899 
very very sure of himself when it comes
to<00:01:10.170> acne<00:01:10.320> Joshua<00:01:10.830> everyone<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.580> seen

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
this guy in every time he's talked to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
this guy in every time he's talked to
him<00:01:14.100> even<00:01:14.340> his<00:01:14.430> body<00:01:14.610> language<00:01:14.850> when<00:01:15.210> he<00:01:15.240> was

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.370 
corroborated that claim they both said
that<00:02:01.049> yeah<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.500> did<00:02:01.740> actually<00:02:01.890> happen<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
that yeah this did actually happen I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.109 
that yeah this did actually happen I
wasn't<00:02:04.380> there<00:02:04.469> myself<00:02:04.860> obviously<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> can't

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
wasn't there myself obviously so I can't

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.880 
wasn't there myself obviously so I can't
say<00:02:06.329> whether<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.719> definitely<00:02:07.469> happened<00:02:07.770> or

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
say whether it definitely happened or

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.040 
say whether it definitely happened or
not<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.399> based<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.660> corroborating

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
not but based on the corroborating

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.380 
not but based on the corroborating
evidence<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:10.800> different<00:02:11.160> people<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:12.300> I've

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
evidence from different people that I've

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.190 
evidence from different people that I've
spoken<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
spoken to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.020 
spoken to
I<00:02:13.260> think<00:02:14.160> there's<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> very<00:02:14.550> good<00:02:14.610> chance<00:02:14.730> that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
I think there's a very good chance that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.670 
I think there's a very good chance that
this<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.180> true<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.870> top<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.500> fact

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
this is true on top of that the fact

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.410 
this is true on top of that the fact
that<00:02:16.770> David<00:02:16.980> price<00:02:17.310> seems<00:02:17.550> very<00:02:17.760> confident

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
that David price seems very confident

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.550 
that David price seems very confident
about<00:02:18.510> being<00:02:19.760> Andy<00:02:20.760> Joshua<00:02:21.349> price<00:02:22.349> was

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
about being Andy Joshua price was

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.640 
about being Andy Joshua price was
obviously<00:02:22.800> very<00:02:22.860> confident<00:02:23.489> about<00:02:23.550> being

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
obviously very confident about being

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.559 
obviously very confident about being
Tyson<00:02:25.650> Fury<00:02:25.830> because<00:02:26.190> he<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.400> Furion<00:02:26.790> Fury<00:02:27.390> any

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
Tyson Fury because he be Furion Fury any

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.600 
Tyson Fury because he be Furion Fury any
amateurs<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.620> think<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.069> price<00:02:29.430> is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
amateurs and I think that price is

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.640 
amateurs and I think that price is
confidence<00:02:30.090> about<00:02:30.209> being<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.840> me<00:02:31.349> Joshua

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
confidence about being and me Joshua

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.800 
confidence about being and me Joshua
comes<00:02:31.980> from<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.220> fact<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.550> he<00:02:33.239> probably<00:02:33.480> did

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
comes from the fact that he probably did

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.650 
comes from the fact that he probably did
drop<00:02:34.590> him<00:02:34.800> or<00:02:35.400> possibly<00:02:35.970> stop<00:02:36.239> him<00:02:36.450> in

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
drop him or possibly stop him in

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.430 
drop him or possibly stop him in
sparring<00:02:37.430> although<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.810> according<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
sparring although this according to the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.360 
sparring although this according to the
people<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.799> spoke<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.549> happened<00:02:42.030> while

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
people I spoke to this happened while

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.670 
people I spoke to this happened while
Joshua<00:02:44.370> was<00:02:44.519> still<00:02:44.670> am<00:02:44.849> still<00:02:45.209> an<00:02:45.330> amateur<00:02:45.680> so

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
Joshua was still am still an amateur so

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.110 
Joshua was still am still an amateur so
obviously<00:02:47.280> things<00:02:47.489> have<00:02:47.610> changed<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.000> lot

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
obviously things have changed a lot

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.180 
obviously things have changed a lot
since<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:49.380> because<00:02:49.709> he<00:02:49.830> dropped<00:02:50.040> him

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
since then just because he dropped him

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.410 
since then just because he dropped him
in<00:02:50.280> sparring<00:02:50.549> doesn't<00:02:50.910> mean<00:02:51.000> he'll<00:02:51.120> drop<00:02:51.269> him

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
in sparring doesn't mean he'll drop him

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.210 
in sparring doesn't mean he'll drop him
now<00:02:51.569> doesn't<00:02:51.870> mean<00:02:51.959> he'll<00:02:52.079> beat<00:02:52.260> him<00:02:52.380> now<00:02:52.560> but

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
now doesn't mean he'll beat him now but

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.740 
now doesn't mean he'll beat him now but
psychologically<00:02:54.120> these<00:02:54.269> are<00:02:54.480> things<00:02:54.660> that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
psychologically these are things that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.190 
psychologically these are things that
that<00:02:55.380> people<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.459> get<00:02:56.610> over<00:02:57.200> some

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
that people have to get over some

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.589 
that people have to get over some
fighters<00:02:58.790> will<00:02:59.790> remember<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.299> fact<00:03:00.510> that

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
fighters will remember the fact that

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.910

by a certain guy and they'll never
really<00:03:03.930> get<00:03:04.110> over<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.709> person<00:03:05.130> will

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
