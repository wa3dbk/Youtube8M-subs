00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.780
 if you have found some chicken 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.630
 fallen from the nest it is easy that you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.570
 ask how can I feed it for 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.289
 that I have mounted this video so that 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.270
 can easily explain how to do it 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.630
 we need food for puppies 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.630
 dogs 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.810
 this size is the smallest it can be 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 no matter what is important 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 is that it is food for puppies and not 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.770
 for adults because it has a quantity 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.780
 greater protein which is what 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.989
 they need the chickens when they are small 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 the adult might be a little 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 poor if it is of good quality because as 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.989
 everything better because normally it is 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.989
 more balanced 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.480
 we need also 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.480
 a hard way 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.590
 we will also need a boat 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.880
 preferably wide-mouth glass 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.810
 wide mouth to put the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.810
 chopper blades 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.330
 and a large syringe of which 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.190
 they call for food that they are 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.260
 in the pharmacies these telling us are 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.570
 much larger than the normal ones of 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.570
 injection is not difficult to find 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 and we will also need a little bit of 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.930
 water to soak food 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.380
 here you have the most amount of food or 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.659
 unless you have to put it to mix it 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.840
 with an egg it does not have to be 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.860
 Exactly there can not be a little more a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.750
 little bit less 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.690
 the first thing is to put the food 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.520
 in the glass jar and we add it 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.520
 the amount of enough water 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.590
 the meal may take a couple of hours or 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.670
 three to finish soaking goes well 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.650
 give a little movement to a couple of 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.650
 times so that it is uniformly soaked 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.320
 here we can see 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.320
 how should the food be left once 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.110
 is soaked does not have to remain water 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.970
 because if there would not be a soup and before 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.140
 to give it to the chickens with the syringe 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.140
 we could drown the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.850
 well, once we have it that way 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.820
 we take the hard egg 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.000
 and we open it, you could take the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.740
 shell there would be no problem 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.590
 the only thing that would happen is that when 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.300
 chop it normally the pieces of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.670
 too large peel and would not happen 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.850
 by the syringe tube then it is 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.880
 preferable to take it off we miss the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.270
 egg 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.270
 inside to chop it after everything together 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.440
 Y 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.879
 Well, it is already as you see, it does not have 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.180
 to be any piece hard or 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.340
 especially pieces of the egg white 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.400
 too big because if you do not 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.379
 would attack by putting it in the syringe and if 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.860
 jumps squeezing could kill 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.860
 to the chickens to break the crop 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.290
 well then we want that texture has to 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.370
 have the food once it is finished 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.370
 of itching is 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.530
 then the next step is to catch 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.970
 disassemble the syringe and using the back 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.370
 of the spoon go filling this with food 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.430
 we use the back because in this way it is 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.830
 easier to go tightening and that we do not 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.750
 there are air bubbles in between if we 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.400
 there are air bubbles what happens is 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.130
 that food will come out more pressure 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.670
 sometimes that others and we will put everything 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.130
 lost no no no problem because they 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.780
 let's hurt 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.780
 but we are not going to stain all 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.030
 you can see that everything is quite 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.060
 uniform and there have been bubbles left 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.530
 air in the middle 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.530
 now we put the plunger 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.080
 and we press it until it reaches the 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.060
 top part 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.610
 and leave the food this is the 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.650
 consistency that must have say 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.979
 that does not fall or that there is not 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.979
 to tight 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.499
 an advice that I give you with these losses 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.349
 is that they usually do not last for many days 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:57.360
 After a few days it starts to 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.180
 grab the rubber of the plunger and it's 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.490
 preferable to look for a new one because it is 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.340
 difficult to fix them does not serve to put 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.340
 oil or talc or anything else 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.460
 Well, we have prepared food 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.590
 now we just need to feed them like 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.590
 you see when they are like that, it is not 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.360
 need to do too much for them to open 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.360
 the peak when they hear noise 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.780
 they open it and it's very easy to feed them 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.580
 The advantage of this syringe is that it 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.580
 same that you have one like you will have 20 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.749
 It is very easy 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:39.289
 It is convenient to do the same as 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:41.259
 parents clean the nest well for that 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.419
 you can use some pieces like these 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:46.189
 or even better plastic is also 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.759
 easy to find them in pharmacies and 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.759
 they are cheap 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.200
 do not forget that once in a while with a 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.260
 smallest syringe 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.330
 you have to give them a little water not much 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.590
 and you do not need to give him every 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.690
 time 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.460
 keep in mind that this mixture is not 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.400
 suitable for chickens of species of 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.470
 eels like goldfinches greenfinches for 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.169
 these are found in stores 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.120
 animals some mixes already prepared 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.279
 as I guess not everyone will know 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.949
 distinguish which species a 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:26.740
 chicken that you have found trying 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.279
 here put a few to be able 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.279
 recognize
