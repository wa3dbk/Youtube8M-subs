00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.279
 good evening everyone and thierry tonight I 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.990
 will present you a protection 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.200
 than receive from mobile 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.559
 point phones fr it's a cover for 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.599
 them for the ipad mini while there are two 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.609
 functions including the first 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.310
 obviously that of protecting the ipad is 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.080
 also the smart function then 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.760
 the smart function I remind you 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.789
 for those who have forgotten or who do not 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.650
 do not know it's the know the shutter the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.579
 flapper party that pauses 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.710
 your your ipad when you say that 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.260
 you reposition it on the on the screen 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.360
 ipad 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.000
 so I took you this decision 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 white color compound that and it's not 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.469
 a white is not a white French a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.329
 white led white white beige we will say 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.149
 1 is really very nice that pretty 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.680
 changes a bit because I admit that 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.010
 until now I had a lot of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.500
 black it does not prevent it can very well 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.859
 go with the black ipad or the white ipad 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.859
 suddenly 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.070
 so this is this little so so here 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.130
 it consists of a part so shell in 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.460
 polycarbonate a protective shell 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.290
 which of course leaves something to be 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.500
 everything that is 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.680
 the outputs of small speakers the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.670
 volume 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.290
 the goal 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.330
 from the camera the jack 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.040
 finally everything is accessible and it's 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.290
 normal and fortunately but hey it's 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.190
 well underline we never know so I 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.840
 will take the little ipad that I would have 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.210
 slipped into his new hull of 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.630
 protection then we support a little bit 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:59.539
 to be sure everything is going well 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:01.399
 this is it that's done so I know 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.429
 not if you see well I think so 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.799
 yes good the ipad is apparently 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.330
 completely protected there is no step 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.310
 screen protruding from the south of the support 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:19.810
 everything and everything is well stalled everything is good 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.810
 here I am here so 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.140
 here is the famous the famous shutter 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:31.769
 smart I show you I 'm them 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.260
 position so the screen is off is 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.310
 invaded it consumes more battery 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.810
 finally as soon as you go to school 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:44.849
 here it is it works it is impeccable 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.000
 so other function of these hulls of 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.359
 protection obviously it's doing it 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.120
 also serves as support 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:59.340
 it is sufficient, of course, to fold the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.459
 magnetic support in order to have that's the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.269
 do not lay in front of you 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.069
 fall nice if you want 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.650
 to watch is not a film 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.980
 what television listen to music 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.569
 see your jackets 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:21.000
 Here bah is impeccable in its method 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:23.790
 that sense that's where it's positioned 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.829
 simply I resume my chewing 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.459

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.049

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.139
 if you heard it but no I know 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.690
 that my mini ipad is idle and not 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.220
 worry there the whole go you feel 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.769
 very happy with the release of the small 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.540
 pregnant the port mini dock lightning 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.239
 have shown that we will see better 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.250
 everything is accessible so here is so 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.260

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.180

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.200
