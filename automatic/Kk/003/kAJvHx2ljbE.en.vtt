00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.600
 Welcome to Detroit warmly 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.309
 Welcome in 2015 and sincerely 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.649
 welcome to the world premiere of 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 mercedes that's the glp and this car 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.350
 is somehow familiar 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.199
 suv coupÃ© that was already there 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 correctly with bmw and that the x6 and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.050
 but it would not be mercedes if 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.470
 they do not make it right the first time 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.540
 would 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.460
 they do not just have the gop 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.850
 brought along but also the same 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.640
 amg version and that has up to 585 ps 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.509
 not exactly about ten ps 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.009
 more than a bmw x6 m so the 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.570
 competitor is clear 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.740
 from the outside we have already seen 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.840
 mercedes in the last few weeks already 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.320
 little bit revealed but sat in it 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320
 not me 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.000
 in the interior arrived you have to say 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.740
 Everything looks pretty chic 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.420
 from her but we are also in the amg 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.950
 that means with carbon and 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.140
 a bit more alu worked so 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.480
 a lot of bling bling anyway that ge coupe 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.350
 looks basically like that already 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.030
 means we have this new one 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.100
 control element we already know that 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.480
 the c class with the touchpad and what 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.220
 you do indeed like actually free 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.810
 standing monitor is here 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.610
 bit in the faucet with 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.940
 incorporated are as chic as me 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.890
 find 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.200
 otherwise you have to say that actually 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.280
 knobs known typical mercedes and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.280
 exactly as you would expect 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.720
 Let's return to the topic again 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.310
 pay facts data this is the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.010
 s version that stands in this case, so to speak 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.650
 for top because that's the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.210
 power peak with 585 hp that goes 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.890
 by the way, from zero to one hundred in say 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.600
 and write 42 seconds 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.480
 there is also the same engine with it 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.280
 557 hp including two petrol engines 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.670
 with 357 and 333 ps and boarding the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.770
 forms a diesel with 258 hp 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.050
 that will probably be so close 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.550
 start under 70,000 euros 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.959
 what else is new for everyone 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.150
 First time you can change the gear 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.459
 order automatic and you can here 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.380
 that will be the face of the 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.560
 his new m class 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.000
 but that will be called gl then so 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.280
 a small farewell from detroit 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.120
 the e-mail facelift we will then 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.120
 see in new york
