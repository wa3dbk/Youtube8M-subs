00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.390
 we are in a new chapter more of the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.620
 road to maestro in playstation 4 we are 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.300
 in a search and destroy game 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.969
 many of you ask me is in mode 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.880
 league in search and destroy because always 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.830
 I have harbor in link take the flag 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.900
 very rarely because he almost never touches 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.520
 the truth already you know that it is a way 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.320
 that almost never touch then very good 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.880
 they I found out about this patita to look for 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.980
 instruct that it's pretty cool in the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.380
 map of violas as you are observing and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.289
 it's a game against subscribers now 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.820
 it was our turn and I take advantage of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.680
 say something good the game I did not record it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.120
 live and I'll explain several 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.129
 little things that are quite important 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.719
 referring to this series the first thing to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.910
 play league mode beginning in four 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.629
 Many of you tell me to invite you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 add I have to confirm that you do not 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.399
 I can accept anyone in the press and they are 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.260
 four I have about 500 friends and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.480
 he does not let me accept anyone else, that is 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.770
 say the console are looking for 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.809
 complete and I'm going to have to erase them 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.820
 but I do not know how to erase them because neither 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.829
 let me say playstation 4 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.930
 Horribly wrong mind since I accepted to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 so many people with which I can not affect 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.490
 Nobody no longer because he does not want 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.890
 because the ps4 is completely wet 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.780
 and the day it goes wild what I will do is 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 will keep people because it is that if not 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.250
 I can not use it I'm very sorry for 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.320
 us but good you know that I do diet 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.510
 with subscribers from time to time very from 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.280
 now and then today is when 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.950
 I will add and give people once 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 have everyone all erased and I will 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.790
 always in advance as I said the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.350
 previous time good, something else that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.880
 I want to comment in the previous chapter 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.480
 from the road to teacher for those who 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.310
 follow playstation 4 in the previous 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.020
 chapter was going to raise the promotion to 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.150
 platinum and I could not upload it because no 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.770
 sorry the promotion now can not 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.620
 upload it because in the next game 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.940
 that was the one that was going to rise I dropped the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.920
 connection that is to say start the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.350
 departure and just be in the account 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.560
 I dropped back to the game that is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.689
 and went back down to silver 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.610
 I could not raise that peace and obviously you 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.590
 I was going to put the chunk in which I dropped 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.210
 of the game but also gave me error 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.549
 the format that was not good 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.470
 incredible the bad luck I had that 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.290
 day in fact is that it can happen to me that already 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.870
 and turn off the console completely and not 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.090
 I played again until the day before yesterday I was 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.410
 already the double explained how you will know all 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.180
 that I hope you have taken advantage of 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.769
 stop me in prison 4 then I can not 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.030
 take advantage of a lot because I'm level 50 and 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.140
 I'm not going to rise in prestige, I hope 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.000
 just place so take advantage 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.590
 pretty so graphics 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.500
 I was just telling you those little things 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.200
 and now other pretty important things 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.450
 referring to the channel you know that now 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.100
 we are having quite a few games in 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.319
 which the critical heat war 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.060
 you keep just I do it because I 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.760
 it seems funny many of you if 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.160
 you tell me that if I do not like the call of 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.380
 duty that leaves you do not worry that to 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.810
 I love advanced warfare and I 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.819
 love the call of duty is true is 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.280
 I'm certainly not going to deny that this game 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.200
 I find it the most pathetic in the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.330
 public simply by the more making and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.190
 by the fact of the jumps however to 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.840
 me the fact of the jumps I love or 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.970
 it is a very big contradiction 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.160
 in competitive the fact that there 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.690
 jumps because they attract me a lot but in the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.220
 public causes it to be out of control and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.470
 when I like to play public I 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.629
 like to have the map very controlled 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.610
 it's one thing a personal opinion that in 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.900
 the call of duty I love simply 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.940
 I make those videos because I think 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.860
 funny but not because I do not like 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.510
 many other sites if you do not like I do not know 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.830
 what to stop performing the game that is not 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.709
 a form of reality is a way of 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.599
 have fun to you and well then 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.150
 since you riÃ¡is a while not 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.150
 we are here to be at a funeral is 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.579
 what I think I do not know or at the same time 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.200
 he has a lot of hey the videos of the 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.290
 that sends to take by sack between 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.030
 quotes to call of duty or what is in the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.260
 stop angry for example vote for 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.660
 call it somehow simply 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.959
 they are angry in games that I do not upload 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.160
 they have a lot of support the truth they have 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.420
 many likes but they also have many 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.360
 nonsense and many negative comments 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.829
 obviously I know that the comments 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.450
 negative can not be avoided that the 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.829
 nonsense can not be avoided but 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.780
 I just want you to take it 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.629
 joke and with freedoms not the few 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.489
 that you do not like so one of two yes 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.740
 you want not to see the videos or 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.320
 take them as what they are what they are 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.270
 I do not know if it shows in the video but 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.190
 I hope so that when I'm in 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.370
 plan go to take for ass call of duty 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.020
 I'm acting and what I want is that you 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.520
 you laugh with me not me when they pass me 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.960
 these things is not that I got angry 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.150
 So yes there is times that you like 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.150
 a couple of things like that happen a little 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.460
 not complicated and you end up a little bit 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.500
 to the bun and good then yes 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.300
 reality really that's where the cap comes 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.860
 anger that I did and continue to attract 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.200
 channel because it seems fun I 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.790
 when I see that repeated I laugh 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.350
 I say how could I have that there would be so much 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.529
 a game yes that is stupid not 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.639
 you know, I say 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:51.379
 to piss me off little by itself but the 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.169
 heat to me takes me out of my boxes is 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.639
 to say it does not come off as the worst of me but 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.019
 while I love it so it has 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.779
 Clear hard for me is the best game 

00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:01.369
 that exists, I can not change it for another 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.499
 is decided by playing thousands of games in 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:07.129
 call of duty play or be sorry the 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:09.289
 player league of legends I played at 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.359
 make it the world of warcraft and played 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.889
 thousand games and the call of duty no doubt 

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:14.869
 some is the one that amuses me the most 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.639
 I played the game with a lot of fifa 

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:18.949
 of played I do not know how to play all kinds of 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.379
 games and heat and that's what I most 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.209
 attracts and as I say the 'advance warfare me 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.219
 It seems like the worst call of duty to 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:27.289
 me or I like much more the modern 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.269
 warfare 3 I really like black 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.909
 ops 1 I like white much more 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:33.769
 states good that 's obvious the goal is not 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.289
 I like it more is true though for me 

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:38.749
 Those of you who know, I am a player who 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.849
 I really like the way to search and 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.919
 destroy and the ghost for me was the best 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.109
 game to play seeks to say many 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.209
 European and American players too 

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:48.619
 they say it but for the other ways the 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.959
 truth is that it was horrible and as a game 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:54.110
 also and public ones too so 

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:56.449
 nothing guys I just clarify these 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.699
 little things you know we 're in gold 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.279
 now in gold division and next 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.579
 rock chapter your teacher will do it in 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.319
 life 2.0 to make it more fun and what 

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:09.019
 I will make this game in life I was going to upload 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:11.689
 so why do you have everything 

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:13.339
 this up to date because many of you 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.839
 you think I'm going to leave warfare behind and 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.309
 so do not worry about not 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.749
