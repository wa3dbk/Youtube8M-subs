00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.840
 the dragonfly is part of the diet 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.480
 of the bass the propeller lure is one of 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.180
 the most effective games that we can 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.880
 use when the dragonfly is near 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.640
 from the surface of the water a lure of 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 surface that mimics a large insect that 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.199
 has fallen on the surface of the water 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.680
 the dragonfly likes to fly around or 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.190
 near any tree or brush that is 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.250
 on the shore or in the water 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.399
 slide the lure near the branches 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.399
 of the tree brings the refuge to the base 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.310
 a coordinated movement of cane and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.370
 reel makes the lure slide 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.740
 correctly collected continues with 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.080
 small wrist movements 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.470
 propeller lure glides over 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.460
 of the surface of the water producing 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.460
 noise and splash 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.540
 sometimes the insistence on placing the 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.500
 decoy in the right place gives the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.500
 desired result 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.100
 at the third set, the minced 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 my insistence on placing the lure 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.050
 under the tree was because the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.690
 branch near the water was the dragonfly 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.590
 I guessed and guessed that some base was 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.590
 stalking the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.299
 one 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.700
 a good piece that was 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:40.150
 hunting almost 30 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.700
 centimeters deep 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.920
 the only possible bait that was found 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.920
 near him was the dragonfly 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.760
 on days of intense heat when 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.910
 he hears the cicada the grasshoppers and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.650
 dragonflies are activated the bass knows that the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.650
 food can come from above 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.170
 the lure goes right next to the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.409
 undergrowth that is where the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.480
 glass and the chopped does not occur although 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:40.359
 has followed and when the bait has stopped 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.359
 is when the attack has occurred
