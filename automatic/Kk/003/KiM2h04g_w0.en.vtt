00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.380
 treasure hunt waiting I had 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.910
 brought back a metal detector to audard 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.770
 unlisted to change spa towel 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.050
 I let go of hands and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 feet and tulle and slowly plunges into 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.240

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.840
 diving under sabline and ben you can 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.979

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.940
 and seahorse all dry 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.120
 an old piece and which dated from 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.580
 mathusalem and is also a piece of glass 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.670
 so polite who looked but 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.840
 one to one emerald 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.959
 you're going to be eyes I went in 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.540
 box the night the times offered me a 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.540
 show sound and total light 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.380
 in fact I do not just have to spend 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.920
 holiday at the sea de berre it was good 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.920
 since that 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.600
 m 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.530
 1 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.569
 it's such a magical place but 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.810
 it's really missing a lot for 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.010
 that it becomes a real paradise so he 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.500
 there is always to say that it is very 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.660
 well like that it's too complicated 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.400
 to change things that it would be too much 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.480
 long but I believe it you know it's 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.650
 like to finish his first knitting or 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.080
 when you arrive at the end of your first 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.090
 novel where when we were little cons 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.410
 paste the last thumbnail into our 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.610
 album 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.910
 so that's for sure it takes a little 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.580
 of effort and perseverance 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.910
 but when it happens it's worth all 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.910
 treasures 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.040
 e 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 e 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.680
 e 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.409
