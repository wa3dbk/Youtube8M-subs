to<00:04:52.490> select<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.940> gold<00:04:53.180> star<00:04:53.510> again<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.169> we're

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
to select the gold star again and we're

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.900 
to select the gold star again and we're
going<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.919> apply<00:04:55.070> one<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.520> other<00:04:55.640> colors

rvw Mt 24 a and in this case the color

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.710 
rvw Mt 24 a and in this case the color
I'm<00:05:10.130> looking<00:05:10.190> for<00:05:10.700> is<00:05:10.910> rvw<00:05:11.500> 24e<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:13.720> you'll

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
I'm looking for is rvw 24e and you'll

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.060 
I'm looking for is rvw 24e and you'll
see<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:15.050> screen<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.590> has<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.710> different

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
see on screen that has a different

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.370 
see on screen that has a different
appearance<00:05:16.340> but<00:05:16.910> certainly<00:05:17.840> when<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.110> print

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
appearance but certainly when you print

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.750 
appearance but certainly when you print
these<00:05:18.500> two<00:05:18.770> you<00:05:18.919> may<00:05:19.040> notice<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:19.580> like

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
these two you may notice this like

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.940 
these two you may notice this like
difference<00:05:20.240> in<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.690> gold<00:05:20.930> tones<00:05:21.290> so<00:05:21.680> it's<00:05:21.860> a

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
difference in the gold tones so it's a

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.530 
difference in the gold tones so it's a
great<00:05:22.130> idea<00:05:22.160> to<00:05:22.610> print<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:23.060> chart<00:05:23.300> on

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
great idea to print the chart on

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.450 
great idea to print the chart on
whatever<00:05:24.229> media<00:05:24.710> you're<00:05:24.830> going<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.070> be<00:05:25.160> using

most<00:05:25.700> often<00:05:26.680> now<00:05:27.680> what<00:05:27.890> we're<00:05:28.010> going<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.160> do<00:05:28.370> is

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
most often now what we're going to do is

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.580 
most often now what we're going to do is
just<00:05:28.760> really<00:05:29.000> select<00:05:29.450> the<00:05:29.690> star<00:05:30.110> one<00:05:30.350> last

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
just really select the star one last

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.190 
just really select the star one last
time<00:05:30.919> and<00:05:31.330> return<00:05:32.330> it<00:05:32.479> back<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.840> original

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
time and return it back the original

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.960 
time and return it back the original

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.350 

now<00:05:47.009> we're<00:05:47.189> gonna<00:05:47.279> show<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:47.639> a<00:05:47.729> technique<00:05:47.969> for

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
now we're gonna show you a technique for

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.330 
now we're gonna show you a technique for
creating<00:05:48.539> gradients<00:05:49.289> with<00:05:49.620> metallic<00:05:50.099> silver

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
creating gradients with metallic silver

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.089 
creating gradients with metallic silver
and<00:05:50.810> if<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:51.930> don't<00:05:52.110> already<00:05:52.289> have<00:05:52.439> it<00:05:52.560> open<00:05:52.740> on

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
and if you don't already have it open on

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.189 
and if you don't already have it open on
your<00:05:53.249> window<00:05:53.580> you<00:05:53.969> want<00:05:54.150> to<00:05:54.240> go<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.569> main

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
your window you want to go to the main

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.790 
your window you want to go to the main
menu<00:05:55.439> and<00:05:55.590> select<00:05:55.849> gradient<00:06:00.529> now<00:06:01.529> what<00:06:01.710> we're

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
menu and select gradient now what we're

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.830 
menu and select gradient now what we're
gonna<00:06:01.860> do<00:06:02.159> is<00:06:02.310> we're<00:06:02.460> going<00:06:02.639> to<00:06:02.909> make<00:06:03.569> this<00:06:03.689> a

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
gonna do is we're going to make this a

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.809 
gonna do is we're going to make this a
linear<00:06:04.050> gradient<00:06:04.439> and<00:06:04.919> you<00:06:05.279> can<00:06:05.430> see<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.729> the

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
linear gradient and you can see that the

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.939 
linear gradient and you can see that the
gradient<00:06:06.060> window<00:06:06.479> changes<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.259> I'm<00:06:07.800> gonna

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
gradient window changes and I'm gonna

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.850 
gradient window changes and I'm gonna
select<00:06:08.210> our<00:06:09.210> D<00:06:09.539> G<00:06:09.689> metallic<00:06:10.080> silver<00:06:10.349> for<00:06:10.770> my

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
select our D G metallic silver for my

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.579 
select our D G metallic silver for my
endpoint<00:06:11.460> in<00:06:11.639> this<00:06:11.789> gradient<00:06:12.180> I'm<00:06:13.169> gonna<00:06:13.349> drag

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:13.589 
endpoint in this gradient I'm gonna drag

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.489 
endpoint in this gradient I'm gonna drag
it<00:06:13.650> over<00:06:14.069> and<00:06:14.279> you'll<00:06:15.210> notice<00:06:15.419> that<00:06:15.539> in<00:06:15.990> the

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:16.499 
it over and you'll notice that in the

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.709 
it over and you'll notice that in the
gradient<00:06:16.740> slider<00:06:17.159> the<00:06:17.969> end<00:06:18.180> value<00:06:18.360> has

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719 
gradient slider the end value has

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.439

changed<00:06:19.259> to<00:06:19.919> metallic<00:06:20.759> silver<00:06:20.999> and<00:06:21.300> it's

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
changed to metallic silver and it's

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.149 
changed to metallic silver and it's
hundred<00:06:21.719> percent<00:06:21.960> opacity<00:06:22.499> at<00:06:22.979> the

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
hundred percent opacity at the

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:27.260 
hundred percent opacity at the
hundred-percent<00:06:23.430> location<00:06:26.060> now<00:06:27.060> we're<00:06:27.180> going

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
hundred-percent location now we're going

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.360 
hundred-percent location now we're going
to<00:06:27.330> select<00:06:27.539> our<00:06:27.960> DG<00:06:28.289> metallic<00:06:28.710> silver<00:06:28.919> again

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
to select our DG metallic silver again

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.159 
to select our DG metallic silver again
and<00:06:29.969> bring<00:06:30.150> it<00:06:30.240> over<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:30.419> the<00:06:30.599> left<00:06:30.779> side<00:06:30.990> of

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
and bring it over to the left side of

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.730 
and bring it over to the left side of
the<00:06:31.259> gradient<00:06:31.849> at<00:06:32.990> what's<00:06:33.990> called<00:06:34.199> the<00:06:34.349> zero

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
the gradient at what's called the zero

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.820 
the gradient at what's called the zero
percent<00:06:35.129> location<00:06:35.960> but<00:06:36.960> right<00:06:37.139> now<00:06:37.289> the<00:06:37.349> value

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
percent location but right now the value

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.279 
percent location but right now the value
is<00:06:37.979> a<00:06:38.009> hundred<00:06:38.279> percent<00:06:38.370> so<00:06:39.300> to<00:06:39.360> change<00:06:39.930> that

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
is a hundred percent so to change that

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.559 
is a hundred percent so to change that
we're<00:06:41.009> gonna<00:06:41.099> go<00:06:41.339> over<00:06:41.580> to<00:06:41.699> the<00:06:41.819> top<00:06:42.029> in<00:06:42.330> the

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
we're gonna go over to the top in the

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.010 
we're gonna go over to the top in the
color<00:06:42.779> swatch<00:06:43.460> window<00:06:44.460> and<00:06:44.810> drag<00:06:45.810> that<00:06:45.870> over

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
color swatch window and drag that over

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.219 
color swatch window and drag that over
to<00:06:46.229> the<00:06:46.409> left<00:06:46.560> now<00:06:47.509> normally<00:06:48.509> you'd<00:06:48.719> create<00:06:49.199> a

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
to the left now normally you'd create a

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:50.809 
to the left now normally you'd create a
gradient<00:06:49.469> and<00:06:49.740> possibly<00:06:50.069> bring<00:06:50.639> it<00:06:50.729> all<00:06:50.789> the

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
gradient and possibly bring it all the

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.909 
gradient and possibly bring it all the
way<00:06:50.879> over<00:06:51.089> to<00:06:51.180> zero<00:06:51.509> but<00:06:52.050> for<00:06:52.110> metallic<00:06:52.649> silver

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
way over to zero but for metallic silver

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.209 
way over to zero but for metallic silver
it's<00:06:53.610> really<00:06:53.939> best<00:06:54.149> to<00:06:54.360> set<00:06:54.539> your<00:06:54.629> gradient

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:55.219 
it's really best to set your gradient

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:57.589 
it's really best to set your gradient
beginning<00:06:56.219> point<00:06:56.490> at<00:06:56.759> 40%

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
beginning point at 40%

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:58.670 
beginning point at 40%
otherwise<00:06:57.870> you're<00:06:58.050> not<00:06:58.169> gonna<00:06:58.289> have<00:06:58.439> much<00:06:58.589> of

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
otherwise you're not gonna have much of

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.010 
otherwise you're not gonna have much of
a<00:06:58.770> metallic<00:06:59.159> effect<00:06:59.520> but<00:07:00.360> you<00:07:00.479> can<00:07:00.719> set<00:07:00.990> it

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
a metallic effect but you can set it

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.619 
a metallic effect but you can set it
lower<00:07:01.289> if<00:07:01.439> you<00:07:01.589> want<00:07:01.770> to<00:07:02.009> so<00:07:02.909> I'll<00:07:03.029> set<00:07:03.270> mine<00:07:03.449> at

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:03.629 
lower if you want to so I'll set mine at

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.689 
lower if you want to so I'll set mine at
40%<00:07:03.960> and<00:07:06.500> what<00:07:07.500> we'll<00:07:07.620> do<00:07:07.770> now<00:07:07.949> is<00:07:07.979> we're<00:07:08.520> going

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
40% and what we'll do now is we're going

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.469 
40% and what we'll do now is we're going
to<00:07:10.159> look<00:07:11.159> at<00:07:11.219> that<00:07:11.310> value<00:07:11.789> and<00:07:12.060> now<00:07:12.240> our

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 
to look at that value and now our

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.719 
to look at that value and now our
gradient<00:07:12.779> really<00:07:13.439> goes<00:07:13.649> from<00:07:13.860> 40<00:07:14.189> percent<00:07:14.279> to

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729 
gradient really goes from 40 percent to

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.860 
gradient really goes from 40 percent to
100<00:07:15.060> percent<00:07:15.360> and<00:07:16.789> when<00:07:17.789> I<00:07:17.819> now<00:07:18.089> click<00:07:18.599> on<00:07:18.719> my

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
100 percent and when I now click on my

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.989 
100 percent and when I now click on my
gradient<00:07:19.110> you<00:07:19.979> notice<00:07:20.219> that<00:07:20.279> the<00:07:20.490> star<00:07:20.759> in<00:07:20.909> the

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:20.999 
gradient you notice that the star in the

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:23.420 
gradient you notice that the star in the
window<00:07:21.149> here<00:07:21.659> has<00:07:21.870> changed<00:07:22.439> to<00:07:22.949> reflect<00:07:23.069> that

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
window here has changed to reflect that

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.700 
window here has changed to reflect that
gradient<00:07:23.879> value<00:07:24.180> from<00:07:24.569> 40<00:07:24.899> percent<00:07:24.930> to<00:07:25.319> 100

gradient value from 40 percent to 100
percent<00:07:25.740> metallic<00:07:26.460> silver<00:07:26.699> and<00:07:27.649> what<00:07:28.649> you<00:07:28.770> can

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
percent metallic silver and what you can

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.010 
percent metallic silver and what you can
do<00:07:29.039> also<00:07:29.189> is<00:07:29.430> now<00:07:30.149> that<00:07:30.330> you've<00:07:30.449> created<00:07:30.779> this

gradient you can just drag it over into
your<00:07:33.330> swatches<00:07:33.629> and<00:07:34.229> it'll<00:07:34.710> be<00:07:34.830> there<00:07:35.039> for
