00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.949
 Nautilus guide 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:14.280
 we start with the runes marks of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:18.450
 armor seals of indecency life of 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.680
 armor and finally children of 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.530
 Magic resistance 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.910
 or you can use this in which I use in 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:33.070
 rne what is percentage stamps of 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.560
 life that is very efficient in the 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.450
 energy not so much but good also 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:46.840
 may vary 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:49.530
 masters we will use 9 of resistance and 21 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.530
 useful 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.219
 you can use the one that I use in the run 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.010
 it's almost similar but it's focused 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.190
 more in physical endurance and endurance 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:08.420
 magic and armor 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.420
 Chachachá de Rincon Chachachá 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:20.030
 the skills first we start with the 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.200
 level 2 and we raise the q and level 3 you 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.240
 we finished climbing the double view 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.590
 or you can upload double tails first if it's 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.320
 that you meet champions 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.780
 aggressive like the morgana or the avalanche 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.270
 who play you are always wearing 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.990
 life until more can not 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.399
 invoking spells here you have two 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.990
 options the first is to turn on and 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:52.340
 flash the second is exhaustion and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:56.330
 flash and what to use I always use 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.750
 exhaustion although people say that 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.289
 Nautilus has too much CC and is placed 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.049
 to light is not a bad option but to 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.239
 the long is not going to help you anymore 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.209
 that when it comes to defending your a 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.840
 He drove in a team fai exhaustion will be 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.840
 of much help 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.680
 object 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.880
 the main objects will be shield 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.190
 the relic four good crackers 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.240
 You can also opt for 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.450
 secondary that is based more on 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.060
 resistance and good defense now let's see 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.860
 how to play with nautilos is not difficult 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.340
 but you have to have a few things in 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.220
 account such as entering a 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.890
 fight when the enemy sports is without 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.900
 skills also take into account the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.900
 resistance and the life of the opponent 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.420
 always protect car as this 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.260
 small fight 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.390
 I would have had exhaustion and I would be 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.390
 dead to be hard 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.920
 you have to keep in mind some things 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.710
 before treating you 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.260
 First 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.010
 take into account four players 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.830
 enemies if you are five of them 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.380
 there are three grab anyone who gets 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.080
 put on your way no matter what party 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.140
 you want to grab anybody when it's a 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.290
 country five against five always grab 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.020
 the weaker at the same time the tennis or 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.870
 those champions who have no escape 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.710
 they will be easier to kill 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.270
 obviously you will not pull a very low 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.410
 because you would get into a serious problem 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:03.060
 my mother would be something crazy of huancayo 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:06.060
 haha take a short shot and assured 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.730
 a victory but it does assure to treat them 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.140
 tim fain as long as there is a good 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.080
 combination in it 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.930
 good communication and the most 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.720
 important to know when to start a 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.269
 good fight can also affect your 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.690
 external factors what I believe that I 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.690
 I have 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.699
 well until my militia arrived 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.430
