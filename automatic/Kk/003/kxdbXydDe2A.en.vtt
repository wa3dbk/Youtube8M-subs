00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.250
 how is it with the key you always have a key at your year 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.440
 from syria has always had to give up a salary 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.440
 not all 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.440
 they sometimes have to get lost 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.350
 yes you have 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.730
 yes it is ridiculous with that bike is put on it they would thereby 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.620
 we are going to talk about it here 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.870
 in any case I can still remember what happened after the conversion and 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.360
 is, just like him, on the street 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.990
 how do you prevent the key from being lost 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.730
 and about someone who has been speaking to the Palestinian state 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.270
 well 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 it is already nonsense for you 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.290
 also the ep 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.910
 is very easy 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.770
 I don't even mind if you make up about 25,000 of that 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:17.099
 it was a big deal as an introduction Dierckx here this is a key so that 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.560
 You step into your left affairs which is a real thing 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.330
 who's your pocket who's not big about who around your neck who I thought so who's one 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.690
 fantastic who in your own agenda 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.569
 and who 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.860
 only you don't know 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.559

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.629
 we give that this year in a secret place you might be somewhere 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.719
 Well then I know for sure that you are much smaller than at least hoping 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.759
 that a personal contribution is planned 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.039
 otherwise I don't think so 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.479

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.339
