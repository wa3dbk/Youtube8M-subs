collar fittings very very important it's
the<00:00:10.980> most<00:00:11.219> important<00:00:11.959> part<00:00:12.959> of<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.830> harness

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
the most important part of the harness

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.359 
the most important part of the harness
as<00:00:15.360> far<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.809> fit<00:00:16.049> goes<00:00:16.350> because<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.920> takes<00:00:17.160> all

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
as far as fit goes because it takes all

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.790 
as far as fit goes because it takes all
the<00:00:17.400> load<00:00:19.430> it's<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.580> good<00:00:20.790> idea<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.570> each<00:00:22.440> horse

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the load it's a good idea for each horse

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.580 
the load it's a good idea for each horse
to<00:00:23.040> have<00:00:23.220> his<00:00:23.370> own<00:00:23.580> collar<00:00:23.970> fitted<00:00:24.870> to<00:00:25.020> him<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
to have his own collar fitted to him and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.870 
to have his own collar fitted to him and
no<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:25.920> else<00:00:26.190> uses<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:28.040> now<00:00:29.040> firstly<00:00:29.520> putting

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
no one else uses it now firstly putting

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.639 
no one else uses it now firstly putting
putting<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.450> collar<00:00:30.690> on<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:32.250> best<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.300> to

putting the collar on the best way is to

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.069 
putting the collar on the best way is to

fingers down the sides like that and at
the<00:01:37.799> bottom<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:39.240> whole<00:01:39.450> thicker<00:01:40.409> part<00:01:40.710> of

comfortably slide in even even almost

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.960

doubled<00:01:44.790> over<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:46.790> just<00:01:47.790> in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
doubled over like like this just in

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
doubled over like like this just in
there<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.810> want<00:01:49.080> any<00:01:49.290> more<00:01:49.560> room<00:01:50.189> there

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
there you don't want any more room there

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.670 
there you don't want any more room there
because<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.960> collar<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.409> tend<00:01:52.650> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
because that the collar would tend to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.420 
because that the collar would tend to
move<00:01:52.920> too<00:01:53.189> much

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
move too much

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.719 
move too much
on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> horse<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.830> course<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:56.520> if

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
on the horse and of course if there's if

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.270 
on the horse and of course if there's if
there's<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:57.330> lot<00:01:57.600> less<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.040> choke

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
there's a lot less it's going to choke

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.460 
there's a lot less it's going to choke
the<00:01:59.460> horse<00:01:59.670> but<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.420> better<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.140> collar

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
the horse but it's better for a collar

the horse but it's better for a collar
to<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:02.299> almost<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.780> little<00:02:03.810> small<00:02:04.320> than<00:02:04.680> too<00:02:04.950> big

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
to be almost a little small than too big

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.630 
to be almost a little small than too big
it<00:02:07.229> does<00:02:07.500> less<00:02:07.770> camp<00:02:08.099> damage<00:02:09.379> this<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.439> a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
it does less camp damage this is a

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.510 
it does less camp damage this is a
collar<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.230> tool<00:02:13.230> for<00:02:13.620> measuring<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.280> horse

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
to fit in with the collar

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.980 
to fit in with the collar
now<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> lot<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.580> time<00:02:17.820> what<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.810> is

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
now a lot of the time what you can do is

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.080 
now a lot of the time what you can do is
try<00:02:19.260> various<00:02:19.830> collars<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:20.610> which<00:02:20.820> one

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
try various collars and see which one

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.810 
try various collars and see which one
fits<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.630> best<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.140> measure<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.400> know

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
fits the best and measure that to know

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.690 
fits the best and measure that to know
what<00:02:24.030> size<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.930> horse<00:02:25.140> requires<00:02:25.740> but

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
what size that the horse requires but

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.400 
what size that the horse requires but
this<00:02:26.910> little<00:02:27.090> tool<00:02:27.420> here<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.750> very<00:02:27.990> handy

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
this little tool here is very handy

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.130 
this little tool here is very handy
because<00:02:28.530> it'll<00:02:29.070> tell<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.430> straight<00:02:29.760> away<00:02:30.140> so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
because it'll tell you straight away so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.520 
because it'll tell you straight away so
you<00:02:31.200> lay<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.830> along<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.490> shoulder<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.060> that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
you lay it along the shoulder like that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.860 
you lay it along the shoulder like that
up<00:02:34.530> at<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> front<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.460> wither<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.090> just

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
up at the front of the wither and just

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.230 
up at the front of the wither and just
move<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.410> bottom<00:02:37.800> went<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.760> till<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.090> touches

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
move this bottom went up till it touches

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.510 
move this bottom went up till it touches
the<00:02:39.600> throw<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:41.280> tells<00:02:41.520> me<00:02:43.340> 24<00:02:44.340> inches<00:02:46.520> so

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
the throw and it tells me 24 inches so

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.420 
the throw and it tells me 24 inches so
here<00:02:48.180> are<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.390> two<00:02:48.630> different<00:02:49.590> styles<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
here are the two different styles of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.100 
here are the two different styles of
collar<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:53.430> obviously<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.510> American

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
collar this obviously is the American

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.130 
collar this obviously is the American
style<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.790> New<00:02:57.480> Zealand<00:02:57.510> or

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
style and this is the New Zealand or

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.110 
style and this is the New Zealand or
Australian<00:02:58.860> or<00:02:59.190> English<00:03:00.290> style<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.500> collar

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
Australian or English style of collar

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.670 
Australian or English style of collar
the<00:03:03.120> difference<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.050> shape<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
the difference is the shape of the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.000 
the difference is the shape of the
throat<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.790> English<00:03:06.540> New<00:03:06.930> Zealand<00:03:07.260> one<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.620> a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
throat the English New Zealand one is a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.910 
throat the English New Zealand one is a
little<00:03:08.550> more<00:03:08.670> pointed<00:03:09.740> obviously<00:03:10.740> to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
little more pointed obviously to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.260 
little more pointed obviously to
accommodate<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.790> windpipe<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.410> horse

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
accommodate the windpipe of the horse

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.530 
accommodate the windpipe of the horse
but<00:03:15.270> in<00:03:15.570> practice<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.800> find<00:03:17.240> it<00:03:18.240> really

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
but in practice we find it really

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.970 
but in practice we find it really
doesn't<00:03:18.900> make<00:03:19.020> any<00:03:19.080> difference<00:03:19.470> when<00:03:19.860> it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
doesn't make any difference when it

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.580 
doesn't make any difference when it
comes<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.370> work<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.660> fitting<00:03:22.080> is<00:03:22.320> done

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
comes to work and the fitting is done

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.880 
comes to work and the fitting is done
exactly<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.370> same<00:03:23.610> as<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.780> measuring<00:03:25.350> for

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
exactly the same as is the measuring for

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.340 
exactly the same as is the measuring for
size<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.550> collar<00:03:26.820> this<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.140> from

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
size of the collar this one it's from

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.120 
size of the collar this one it's from
the<00:03:28.560> bottom<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.310> throat<00:03:29.640> there<00:03:30.030> -<00:03:31.020> just<00:03:31.950> up

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
the bottom the throat there - just up

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.500 
the bottom the throat there - just up
into<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.490> top<00:03:32.700> where<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.940> top<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.330> neck

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
into the top where the top of the neck

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.140 
into the top where the top of the neck
would<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:34.460> so<00:03:35.460> this<00:03:35.640> one<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.000> about<00:03:36.150> 5<00:03:38.150> 65

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
would be here so this one is about 5 65

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.960 
would be here so this one is about 5 65
70<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:40.430> think<00:03:41.430> that's<00:03:41.610> about<00:03:41.760> 23<00:03:42.570> inches
