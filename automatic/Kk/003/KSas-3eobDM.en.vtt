00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.260
 it is already a true classic the game 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.230
 where the whole story started 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.210
 gameplay the enemies the environment all 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.340
 in this game it is so well done that the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.379
 it's really a pleasure to play it over and over 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.449
 time also has five finals 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.580
 different that you can get to get 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.610
 depending on your actions as you move forward 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.560
 the game will take more than one scare and 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.660
 also more of a headache to the 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.149
 time to solve some riddles of 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.540
 game if you have not played we do 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.480
 you wait and if you played it dat the pleasure 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.850
 to return to the terror of silente and in addition 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.160
 is one did totally uncensored and with 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.020
 subtitles in Spanish there is no 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.119
 adventure the strict sense of the 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.220
 word that can get away so much from the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.920
 trucks to be as confusing as the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.259
 hell if the clarity in the plot is 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.940
 quality signal in the rpg the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.310
 designers silent and have shown 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.829
 a remarkable singularity for 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.229
 worry about it but maybe the 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.420
 immaturity of the horror genre as well as 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.039
 the scarcity of titles that exploit it has 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.860
 forced a series of false 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.619
 expectations it is possible that silent and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.170
 could be the future as opposed 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.570
 with silent 'resident evil' and it's not a 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.090
 action adventure to look for a better 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.340
 term is more psychological where 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.829
 'resident evil' marks a path for a 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.689
 silent story adventure explicit and 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.179
 has a sweaty and unpredictable 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.610
 nightmare story the game begins 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.500
 when your array the protagonist 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.110
 you recover the knowledge after a 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.520
 car accident in which 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.950
 hopefully you avoid someone 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.600
 running on the asphalt 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.759
 then you discover that your daughter has 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.789
 abandoned the car while you were leaving 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.130
 to check the damage very well 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.099
 7 year old kids do that sort of thing 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.110
 what is less easily explained is 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.180
 that when you find her she runs away 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.890
 letting you be stabbed by a 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.780
 zombie kids gang who 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.640
 They are reminiscent of grayish ones 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.260
 aliens with eyes torn from 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.959
 tenth file 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.299
 from this point in the introduced plot 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.069
 in the dark and confusion and even 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.799
 when it extends its overwhelming 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.439
 everything all too fast in my 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.390
 silent opinion and leaves a confused trail 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.150
 of contradictory and not answered 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.190
 information you have two states or worlds 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.860
 where to develop the action that are going 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.629
 alternated throughout the game 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.030
 the first happens during the day and is the most 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.790
 normal where you face a city 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.980
 ghost with some monsters and where 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.980
 you must mainly interact with the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.470
 half the second is like a nightmare 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.510
 where it is at night there is no soil but 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.340
 bars and monsters harass you 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.079
 constantly to flee are the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.849
 kill until you meet a 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.489
 final enemy that gives you the key to 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.530
 normal world after killing it by a 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.379
 analysis of a conventional adventure 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.780
 this would be terrible in the context 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.200
 to play a nightmare is something 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.299
 close to bright visually silent 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.700
 and is somewhat superior to others of the tomb type 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.489
 raider offering an extensive variety 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.630
 of landscapes with detailed setting 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.790
 is where the fog usually 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.040
 to fulfill the capabilities of the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.590
 machine hiding the graphic generation 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.840
 further away the game uses this effect 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.880
 to increase the tension the scenes 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.890
 nocturnal in which you move 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.140
 with a flashlight as the only source of 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.900
 light generated in real time to all your 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.330
 effects are especially 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.040
 claustrophobic against the variety 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.050
 of monsters is not as broad as 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.510
 it should be but then the players 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.370
 who would like to progress to meet 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.590
 with a brood of horrible beings are 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.110
 in these moments well served by a 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.690
 good number of other titles in the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.580
 3d generation in real time highlights the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.920
 use of camera routines that give a 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.710
 representative and effective vision that 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.330
 according to keiichiro toyama director proceed 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.700
 of inspiration arrived from 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.650
 hollywood to vis cronenberg and lynch and that 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.989
 they put an end to the problems they imposed 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.260
 the limitations of ceta buffering dps 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.900
 x good friends that's all I hope so 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.900
 enjoy is a great game until next time
