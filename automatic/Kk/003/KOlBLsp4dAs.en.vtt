 hi minecraft friends my name is 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:15.609
 capogreco bains and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:18.250
 how to go to the island of mushrooms in 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:25.200
 michael the first thing we have to do 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:27.270
 is to create a new world any name 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.040
 if you want to play it in upload them to the colo 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.080
 creative the same thing I'm going to put in 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.610
 creative to be able to fly in more 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.380
 world options to whom he tells 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.890
 seed to make the generator of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.020
 worlds we put the number 4 follows 4 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.410
 and this is left as they want but this 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.640
 in type of same by default 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.640
 we create in a new world 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 they have to be a bit to load 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.920
 and we appear in a small I can get 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.250
 is doing we are going to go towards the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250
 tip 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.250
 the support 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.350
 and what you see in front is today 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.310
 it's the island the mushrooms followed 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.310
 we direct socialisms 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.070
 they will see that the earth is different and 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.830
 the flavors are going well 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.580
 with white spots like the sun or 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.729
 classics and these are the types of mushrooms 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.770
 and their trunks are white as well 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.409
 they were giants 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.829
 and the most important thing about this island if not 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.689
 they have gone up are the banks that are 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.649
 animals that only inhabit this 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.860
 list 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:49.000
 they call it cow mutants or bach mushrooms or 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 cows with both or red cows sometimes 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.110
 important of these cows is that they are 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.250
 red and they have fungi on their back 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.120
 and if we give it 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.120
 I tell you 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.060
 we have second click to the bottom and sometimes 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 I said more cows 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.260
 and if we give wheat to this and 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.459
 it is reproduced 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.420
 and they come out we take them out to the children as 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.849
 women anyway that was all a 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.110
 small basic tutorial I hope that you 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.940
 I liked it 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.400
 continue touring the island because it is 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.000
 giant 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.710
 and there are abandoned mines we are from the island 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.100
 so if you play them your opponent is going to 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.620
 be very good 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.300
 I hope you liked tutorial 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.860
