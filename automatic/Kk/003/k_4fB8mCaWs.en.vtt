00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello youtube lords all those who 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.610
 are watching in this video is not a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.880
 video this time until sometimes I'm 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.519
 talking about turtle care 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.060
 cleaning the aquarium and others for those who 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.259
 must have all the tokage 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.439
 this my forms are very high are 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:29.380
 small is already an aquarium or good 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.380
 a quality quite well 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.000
 the turtles are trained with 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.000
 although concretion some 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.710
 I keep my eyesight 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.989
 for like two months or three if I use a 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.230
 special pasta 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:06.500
 they are a few drops like blue dye 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:09.740
 They help a lot and we use the anti chlorine 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.200
 especially so that it ballasts all 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.440
 turtles do not get irritated at the eyes that 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.710
 the chlorine draws the water from the tap not 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:24.150
 have I'm going to eat your food 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.540
 good new ones like buying your supplement 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.020
 food 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.290
 meals are like larvae or charales is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.960
 a good food every time 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.960
 that changes the water I use 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.479
 and invite yale 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.509
 it is to put himself missing to leave 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:58.539
 practically protein for shell and 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:02:05.850
 It serves to shell out but 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:05.850
 well I will not tell you 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.069
 already carry 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.500
 I have 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.860
 a glass painted here 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.300
 this one put him in special stripes 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.070
 to mark how much water you need to put 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.010
 turtles why my boys the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.630
 they carry and they have it 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.590
 At this rate we will fill it with water 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.700
 is what I'm going to do now let me 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.700
 I'm going to fill it 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.099
 when I return 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:43.740
 I already filled it not until the last 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.530
 for the third then let's paddle 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:52.390
 We are going to open this one 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.990
 let's drop drop just esp / n so much 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.990
 for me 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.060
 so 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.049
 j 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.960
 and water and apple 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.720
 with dyes 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.980
 in fact 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.199
 something special 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.199
 more time you have something very 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.380
 perfection is a stain we have for 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.100
 there but already 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.100
 - 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.969
 let say 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.169
 good 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.169
 this in theory 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.650
 but the color of the car 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.200
 with a stick or anything reveal it 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.889
 because as well as 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.819
 some kind of hair that is eaten 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:38.689
 colored water with dyes then 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.689
 let's throw them 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.460
 you do not worry it does not hurt you 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:53.129
 to those turtles we're just clarifying 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.129
 the water so that it is clean 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:01.210
 let's save now something else that I 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:04.750
 I can tell you is the anti chlorine 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:09.720
 let's take a drop 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.720
 a drop just let me 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.630
 it was hard, you see 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.040
 it's just to purify the water 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.729
 well we are ready those are the 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:37.280
 care could show them ramp 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:39.290
 and the thermometer 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:45.800
 the heater the temperature of the 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:50.420
 thermometer for the good I'll be I say 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:54.050
 that that green line is in 30 and 80 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:57.610
 the other is the waterfall 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:01.840
 that has out an activated that we have 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:04.460
 since I finish cleaning the water 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.479
 because he never said something he has not done in 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:11.840
 me a lot of this coloring the problem 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:14.870
 of taking a lot of that coloring is what 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.659
 that causes these tontunas to be given 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:21.949
 colors good beings colors of another 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:24.500
 extra color and from home raise a 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:27.620
 drop your perfect one but I 'll 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.789
 I suggest that in a glass with water made in 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.789
 the drops please 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.780
