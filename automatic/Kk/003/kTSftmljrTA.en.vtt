00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.480
 hello everyone with you annette and we 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.520
 We continue to cut on e100 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 we talked about the fact that there are three types 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.760
 shells shrinkage is dark gold and 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.520
 light clean mine I do not 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.250
 their koreish bebashkah melons but last battle 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.320
 we cheerfully drove the bebashkah on their 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.739
 The topic has not been solved yet. 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.330
 Well, let's joke in comments about the topic is not 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.930
 Revealed Well, so here is the second fight hidden 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.180
 village 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.050
 Well, it so happened that we met 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.800
 here another weaving is now waiting for 2 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.140
 not forced and the hood on the left here's how 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.239
 do in this situation especially quart 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.910
 you will not enter anyone on this map 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.950
 more on such hippo dough remains 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.990
 just to butt forehead 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.149
 but in general, we sin nowhere 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.479
 complain at all for this weave 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.940
 devoted created first bgh I missed 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.670
 and without thinking twice began to hold a mine 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.090
 after all the bright side she took over 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.880
 outward 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.700
 But pictures of the enemy laid hopes 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.369
 on a day on the head and let's see 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.789
 what came of it as you know 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.950
 landmine is a win-win lottery and in 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.990
 the game depends on the nasty file of that place 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.229
 where does this servant please himself and 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.850
 if the place is too thick skin damage 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.520
 less well and if not because 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.130
 lips are such an uncomplicated formula 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.560
 calculating the damage of high-explosive projectile for 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.299
 the smallest 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.970
 so undoubtedly efficiency when shooting 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.360
 land mines significantly lower than the gold a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.450
 looking e100 everyone immediately starts charging 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.180
 Golda Misha will show us 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.970
 get up in this hurts but i wanted to 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.430
 still stand out from the crowd and arrange 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.360
 full test drive high-explosive shells 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.130
 yes even on the most durable opponents oh 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.160
 and itâ€™s probably not sweet 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.040
 the crew captain contusion bring always 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.100
 so at the wrong time 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.860
 bool1 and bool2 ding like this actually 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.450
 there is a fight and I gradually 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.350
 disassemble opponents they are without 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.620
 effectively babe tinkles at me 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.290
 gods as well then all matched weaving 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.950
 against hundreds of ideal situation for 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.569
 video 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.709
 but all good things ever 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.830
 ends and here went disco 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.650
 Rushed on foot seeing me jump 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.900
 and for less hurried to remember me tank 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.050
 Weaving enemy that plus everything 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.380
 Mangold decided to fornicate me in the NLDA 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.520
 broke my engine without being ashamed straight 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.780
 will throw and even generally I'm on a harp 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.780
 skyscraper came to my rear and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.080
 such 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.640
 we lost in this fight but none the less 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.600
 moral of this fable 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.700
 find so many land mines against the same 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.460
 the toughest acres as I managed 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.910
 fight off your hp and would actually be in the top 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.250
 list for damage yes of course it is not damage 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.690
 for level ten but fight value 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.850
 scientific point of view 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.760
 what if in sparring with such serious 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.160
 opponents managed to repel their HP and 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.980
 perform the utility rate for the team 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.200
 then we can conclude that the bomb 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.160
 there is a place to be and no need to refuse 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.680
 yourself in pleasure 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.459
 once again zasdaldili them between the eyes 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.660
 to the enemy 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.360
 and finally the dark side of the force with 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.150
 moon cookies parks and frau 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.940
 fight on gold i don't know what is there 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.430
 comment weaving just rides and 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.739
 just kills a day no wonder she 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.200
 actually recognized by tanks in gold 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.730
 addicted and that doesn't only speak on 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.900
 head on can reveal your true 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.380
 potential 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.070
 give the sea fun fun 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.500
 I say as it is, what is there to hide on 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.230
 gulder tank rightfully bears the status of one 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.070
 of the most dangerous opponents in the random 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.670
 it's just a real stern he 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.460
 huge is huge rather rather slow and 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:30.660
 extremely good and here's the alpha transmits 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.050
 Hello Soviet Fri-Sau 2700k together with 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.240
 all of the above make us 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.580
 present hulk which smash-break 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.790
 then tears off the towers and just annihilates 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.130
 punch and 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.230
 to fight dozens of here and so 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.240
 head to head 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.090
 worthy only on a goldie so don't 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.440
 need to be greedy and even more so shy 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.420
 your weight your rules are true for damage we 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.930
 pay by d 18 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.050
 but it's worth it by the way shells we 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.300
 more than enough and even if the fight is too 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.850
 it can stretch us sometime 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.780
 will remove the restrictions on the amount of gold in 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.940
 ammunition 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.490
 less than a hundred when they shoot gold 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.970
 only as a necessity but it 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.920
 a completely different story 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.110
 maybe not all the bombs in the past 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.550
 fighting and going to gold could 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.020
 avoid defeat 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.650
 Isn't it the main victory in our game? 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.260
 here is such 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.650
 food for thought at least for 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.860
 me on the one hand, light am who 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.610
 whispers play on bb in which case you 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.730
 will help out a landmine on the other shoulder and which 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.810
 seduces by the golden glitter of cumulative 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.730
 think about it like that 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.190
 us about Mausgan even say nothing 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.370
 I will try and with him for completeness 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.410
 pictures but not that 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.290
 don't you wanna wanna ride with mine 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.570
 data swing mouse still chip weave 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.110
 rollers everyone decides of course himself for 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.419
 myself 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.790
 Well, for my part I tried to help 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.370
 you decide on the choice of strategy and 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.580
 give pleasant moments watching 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.919
 my video by the way this fight with a bunch 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.020
 perks because he played earlier than 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.630
 I came to the decision that I will throw off 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.660
 perks but then looking at the bill and so everything 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.120
 it is clear there are not perks for deciding Well 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.449
 summing up I can say that the tank is very 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.090
 nice to play it fun to play it 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.949
 interesting medals and even more so now 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.919
 when she was added to a bunch of little ones 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:38.830
 awards will take out just KAMAZ 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:42.130
 so have fun and play 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.889
 what are you playing bb land mines or gold 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.400
 try on bb do not rush to grab 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.460
 Golda 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.020
 If possible, use land mines for 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.940
 Golda clean only when 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.860
 brewing such a moment that the team 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.430
 let down because of your little 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.250
 breaking a piece of paper you can't oh well
