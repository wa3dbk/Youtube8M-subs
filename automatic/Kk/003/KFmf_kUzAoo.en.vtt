there's no time for that
on<00:02:13.620> two<00:02:13.830> knives<00:02:14.959> also<00:02:15.959> bear<00:02:16.319> spray<00:02:16.880> but<00:02:17.880> this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
on two knives also bear spray but this

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.410 
on two knives also bear spray but this
gives<00:02:18.900> me<00:02:19.170> an<00:02:19.319> option<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:20.069> isn't<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.000> far

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
gives me an option that isn't so far

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.380 
gives me an option that isn't so far
away<00:02:22.099> with<00:02:23.099> bear<00:02:23.310> spray<00:02:23.550> or<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.970> few<00:02:24.150> feeds

away with bear spray or and a few feeds
with<00:02:24.840> knives<00:02:25.110> you're<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.770> much<00:02:26.130> less<00:02:26.430> than<00:02:26.580> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
with knives you're in much less than a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.620 
with knives you're in much less than a
few<00:02:26.849> feet<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.209> might<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.690> yeah<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.760> like

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
you know we're human beings our brains

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.199 
you know we're human beings our brains
are<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.530> reason<00:02:34.830> why<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.819> are<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> dominant

are the reason why we are the dominant
species<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.050> planet<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.680> tools<00:02:38.250> make<00:02:39.209> it

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
species on this planet and tools make it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.610 
species on this planet and tools make it
so<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.130> we<00:02:41.130> live<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.550> long<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.500> is
