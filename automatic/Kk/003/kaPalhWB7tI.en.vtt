00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
vacuum boost source once your car's

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.779

vacuum<00:00:27.089> manifold<00:00:27.720> right<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> got<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.679> up

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
vacuum manifold right here I got it up

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.689 
vacuum manifold right here I got it up
eBay<00:00:29.249> it<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.699> 15<00:00:30.599> bucks<00:00:31.189> comes<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.430> six

vacuum<00:00:52.320> source<00:00:53.329> cap<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.660> there<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
vacuum source cap right there so it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.529 
vacuum source cap right there so it's
really<00:00:58.199> easy<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.589> install<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.429> just<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:00.300> I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
really easy to install I just go out I

and<00:01:02.640> get<00:01:03.089> a<00:01:03.329> couple<00:01:03.750> inches<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.560> vacuum<00:01:05.070> line

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and get a couple inches of a vacuum line

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.110 
and get a couple inches of a vacuum line
and<00:01:05.640> eighty<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> vacuum<00:01:08.310> hose<00:01:08.550> for<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
and eighty the vacuum hose for this

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.840 
and eighty the vacuum hose for this
right<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.690> is<00:01:09.900> eleven<00:01:10.770> thirty<00:01:11.010> seconds<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
I got a 3/8 inch vacuum hose and a tee

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.320 
I got a 3/8 inch vacuum hose and a tee
you<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.640> want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> cut<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.300> middle

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
you just want to cut it in the middle

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
you just want to cut it in the middle
put<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.780> tee<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.170> make<00:01:19.890> sure<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:20.130> clamp<00:01:20.430> them

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
put the tee in make sure you clamp them

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.280 
put the tee in make sure you clamp them
down<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.300> going<00:01:21.480> to<00:01:21.570> lose<00:01:21.750> vacuum

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
down so you're not going to lose vacuum

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.240 
down so you're not going to lose vacuum
or<00:01:22.410> lose<00:01:22.590> boost<00:01:22.920> once<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.060> turbo<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.710> run

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
or lose boost once you are turbo and run

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
or lose boost once you are turbo and run
it<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:26.400> through<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:27.170> I'm<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.380> turbid

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it right through there I'm not turbid

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560 
it right through there I'm not turbid
right<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:29.910> soon<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.360> just

right now I will be really soon I just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.620 
right now I will be really soon I just
took<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> air<00:01:31.800> conditioner<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:33.270> having

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
took the air conditioner out I'm having

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.420 
took the air conditioner out I'm having
trouble<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.170> compressor<00:01:34.740> there's<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
trouble with this compressor there's a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.860 
trouble with this compressor there's a
couple<00:01:35.730> boats<00:01:35.910> that<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.210> being<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.660> little

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
couple boats that are being a little

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.770 
couple boats that are being a little
stubborn<00:01:37.080> but<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:37.740> getting<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.190> so

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
stubborn but we're getting them up so

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.210 
stubborn but we're getting them up so
hold<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> receiver<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.740> suction<00:01:41.100> end

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
hold the receiver out the suction end

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.020 
hold the receiver out the suction end
liquid<00:01:41.490> line<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> way<00:01:42.300> up<00:01:42.510> to<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.050> point

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
liquid line all the way up to that point

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.030 
liquid line all the way up to that point
so<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.060> are<00:01:45.570> good<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.260> go<00:01:46.380> besides<00:01:46.800> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so we are good to go besides this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.580 
so we are good to go besides this
compressor<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:48.000> being<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.110> douche<00:01:49.380> bag

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590

boost gauge
all<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:53.870> did<00:01:54.020> was<00:01:54.200> hook<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.420> vacuum<00:01:56.420> hose

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
all I did was hook on the vacuum hose

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.420 
all I did was hook on the vacuum hose

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
why not run on through the spark plugs

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.210 
why not run on through the spark plugs
and<00:02:30.830> coming<00:02:31.430> out<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.670> side<00:02:33.010> right<00:02:34.010> into
