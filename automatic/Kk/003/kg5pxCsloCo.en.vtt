technology<00:01:26.770> which<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.400> basically<00:01:27.820> an<00:01:28.150> AR

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
technology which is basically an AR

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.170 
technology which is basically an AR
device<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.770> sits<00:01:29.980> on<00:01:30.130> your<00:01:30.280> head<00:01:30.460> and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
device that sits on your head and

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.970 
device that sits on your head and
essentially<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.840> know<00:01:31.960> allows<00:01:32.260> you<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.680> i

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
essentially you know allows you to i

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.530 
essentially you know allows you to i
guess<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.160> map<00:01:33.670> things<00:01:33.970> onto<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.360> real

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
guess like map things onto the real

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.660 
guess like map things onto the real
world<00:01:34.870> and<00:01:35.050> interact<00:01:35.500> with<00:01:35.650> it<00:01:35.770> they<00:01:36.460> showed

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
world and interact with it they showed

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.040 
world and interact with it they showed
up<00:01:36.850> i<00:01:37.000> guess<00:01:37.180> one<00:01:37.480> sort<00:01:37.690> of<00:01:37.720> gaming

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
up i guess one sort of gaming

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.600 
up i guess one sort of gaming
application<00:01:38.560> with<00:01:38.650> that<00:01:38.770> which<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:38.920> minecraft

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
application with that which is minecraft

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.800 
application with that which is minecraft
which<00:01:39.790> looks<00:01:40.000> really<00:01:40.300> cool<00:01:40.480> what<00:01:40.630> did<00:01:40.660> you

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
which looks really cool what did you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.710 
which looks really cool what did you
think<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.110> hololens<00:01:41.730> I'm<00:01:42.730> someone<00:01:43.210> who<00:01:43.300> likes

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
think of hololens I'm someone who likes

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.330 
think of hololens I'm someone who likes
forward-thinking<00:01:44.200> technology<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:45.100> think

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
forward-thinking technology and I think

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.130 
forward-thinking technology and I think
that<00:01:45.460> Microsoft<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:45.970> taking<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.480> pretty<00:01:46.900> strong

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
that Microsoft is taking a pretty strong

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.870 
that Microsoft is taking a pretty strong
first<00:01:47.500> step<00:01:47.740> here<00:01:47.980> you<00:01:48.520> have<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> lot<00:01:48.820> of
