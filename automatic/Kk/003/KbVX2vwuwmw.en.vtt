00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:07.089
 Here, the WTV looked and although now a Case tested the Laxey PETA 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.409
 that come from Giuseppe in the 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.949
 to get tested here in Cologne see that student is suitable 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.650
 has a crimson camera and this brand Thor Steinar 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.419
 because this will be fixed 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.419
 Per cent costs in the Bund a shock well ten points 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.410
 one of three four days it is already in Germany if that 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.239
 Competing products are also available for 30 out of 20 funds 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.250
 Vollmer's corner apple-logo is pretty well excluded for me 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.550
 is otherwise 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.380
 we can all see connections and bartens 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.840
 are also engraved on it and that can be correct 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.730
 easy on it big for me it is 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.770
 The iPad may feel a little better planning though 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.520
 slipped too easily out of the hand with this flexible one 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.010
 It's just great to hold on 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.370
 then it can be easy with one hand 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.870
 so not comfortable with for Wednesday 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.290
 also fits what is when I slip out of hand 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.620
 you can see the whole thing even more 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.130
 so now it's on it and here could really see all the inputs and 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.500
 Wattens work wonderfully, too 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.010
 partly on cars mayor before marriage 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.080
 I do not really have a problem with it 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.490
 to hit everything 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.979
 and the switches to use there speakers and yet most of all he also came 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.110
 so it works really well if you think okay now 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.100
 I buy such a rubber then I can 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.870
 for example, not to use a bag with the opposite is the case me 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.969
 For example, have Heinz Spleen from New Crate on the back 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 you can easily take it 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.800
 yes you can see 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.140
 it just slides in and out 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 is about asking yourself and would like for example 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.049
 Delta Shell the SIM "Me percent bio Bremen but here are fabric reference 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.210
 no problem 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.900
 works wonderfully 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.010
 that was the track victory 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.680
 for ten dollars from Giuseppe m is not surprised at the effect 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.519

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.379
