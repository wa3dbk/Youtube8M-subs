 misgovernment 2013 to 10 2018 of the government

 for the manufacture of aircraft and their 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.599
 components results in having 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.950
 that depend on technology from others 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.510

 aerial material radars and systems 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.150

 they are operational and 142 are out 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.750
 of service so to reverse 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.910

 as well as 81 aircraft detailed in his 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.750
 report the sedena to me it seems very 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.430
 I miss that you invest so much in 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.040
 armament is a lot of money in 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.880
 armament that he 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.500
 that the supplier is us no wonder 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.990
 but if I'm surprised that you buy equipment 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.350
 of this type for example the case of 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.140
 combi vehicles as they are proper for 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.260
 war they are planning so that they 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.130
