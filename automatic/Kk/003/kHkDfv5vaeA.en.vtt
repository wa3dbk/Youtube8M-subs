so<00:00:07.269> we're<00:00:07.420> doing<00:00:07.629> Meridian<00:00:07.960> stress

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
so we're doing Meridian stress

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.680 
so we're doing Meridian stress
assessment<00:00:08.950> with<00:00:09.459> the<00:00:09.580> MSS<00:00:10.090> professional

registered<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.829> what<00:00:29.980> you're<00:00:30.159> doing<00:00:30.429> is

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
registered and what you're doing is

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.190 
registered and what you're doing is
evaluating<00:00:31.179> the<00:00:31.300> energetic<00:00:31.810> state<00:00:31.989> of<00:00:32.110> the

evaluating the energetic state of the
acupuncture<00:00:32.739> Meridian<00:00:33.130> and<00:00:33.250> then

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
acupuncture Meridian and then

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.550 
acupuncture Meridian and then
determining<00:00:34.360> what<00:00:34.630> affects<00:00:35.020> those<00:00:35.290> meridians

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
determining what affects those meridians

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.550 
determining what affects those meridians
in<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:35.980> positive<00:00:36.190> way<00:00:37.380> acupuncture<00:00:38.380> has<00:00:38.440> been

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
in a positive way acupuncture has been

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.110 
in a positive way acupuncture has been
around<00:00:38.860> for<00:00:39.070> thousands<00:00:39.490> of<00:00:39.580> years<00:00:39.640> and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
around for thousands of years and

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.720 
around for thousands of years and
meridians<00:00:41.110> correlate<00:00:41.680> with<00:00:42.160> traditional

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
meridians correlate with traditional

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.790 
meridians correlate with traditional
acupuncture<00:00:43.270> points<00:00:43.750> and<00:00:43.960> that's<00:00:44.470> how<00:00:44.650> we're

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
acupuncture points and that's how we're

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.180 
acupuncture points and that's how we're
able<00:00:44.830> to<00:00:45.310> basically<00:00:46.170> check<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.320> see<00:00:47.560> how

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
able to basically check to see how

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.980 
able to basically check to see how
balanced<00:00:48.700> an<00:00:48.790> individual<00:00:49.240> is<00:00:49.390> by<00:00:49.600> introducing

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
balanced an individual is by introducing

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.470 
balanced an individual is by introducing
a<00:00:50.170> microcurrent<00:00:50.680> of<00:00:50.890> electricity<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.640> so<00:00:52.330> by

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
a microcurrent of electricity and so by

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.440 
a microcurrent of electricity and so by
doing<00:00:52.540> that<00:00:52.990> we<00:00:53.680> can<00:00:53.980> actually<00:00:54.190> place<00:00:55.090> a<00:00:55.120> bio

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
doing that we can actually place a bio

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.750 
doing that we can actually place a bio
pro<00:00:55.750> cell<00:00:56.350> chip<00:00:56.590> right<00:00:56.950> on<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.160> phone<00:00:57.400> and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
pro cell chip right on the phone and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.420 
pro cell chip right on the phone and
have<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.510> subject<00:00:58.750> hold<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.320> up<00:00:59.740> to<00:00:59.950> their<00:01:00.100> ear

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
have the subject hold it up to their ear

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.370 
have the subject hold it up to their ear
and<00:01:00.670> then<00:01:01.090> we<00:01:01.210> can<00:01:01.360> immediately<00:01:01.630> see<00:01:02.110> how

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
and then we can immediately see how

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.369 
and then we can immediately see how
those<00:01:02.530> electromagnetic<00:01:03.010> fields<00:01:03.820> are

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
those electromagnetic fields are

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.840 
those electromagnetic fields are
reflected<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:05.860> that<00:01:05.979> those<00:01:06.100> meridians<00:01:06.369> can

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
reflected so that those meridians can

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.090 
reflected so that those meridians can
maintain<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.420> balanced<00:01:07.840> state<00:01:08.079> which<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:09.010> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
maintain a balanced state which in the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.670 
maintain a balanced state which in the
long<00:01:09.250> run<00:01:09.310> means<00:01:10.240> actually<00:01:10.659> being<00:01:11.230> healthier

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
long run means actually being healthier

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.480 
long run means actually being healthier
in<00:01:12.400> a<00:01:12.520> clinical<00:01:12.970> setting<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.870> could<00:01:14.080> address

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
in a clinical setting you could address

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.370 
in a clinical setting you could address
well<00:01:15.490> over<00:01:15.700> 60<00:01:16.120> different<00:01:16.240> points<00:01:16.840> by

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
well over 60 different points by

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.530 
well over 60 different points by
screening<00:01:17.800> both<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.250> hands<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.790> feet<00:01:19.030> to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
screening both the hands and the feet to

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.210 
screening both the hands and the feet to
cover<00:01:19.750> all<00:01:20.020> of<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.170> vital<00:01:20.530> organs<00:01:20.620> throughout

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
cover all of the vital organs throughout

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.670 
cover all of the vital organs throughout
the<00:01:21.400> body<00:01:21.580> but<00:01:22.240> today<00:01:22.510> we<00:01:22.720> just<00:01:22.930> chose<00:01:23.200> seven

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
the body but today we just chose seven

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.060 
the body but today we just chose seven
key<00:01:23.890> points<00:01:24.370> that<00:01:25.050> basically<00:01:26.050> covered<00:01:26.979> the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
key points that basically covered the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.520 
key points that basically covered the
lymphatics<00:01:27.670> one<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.630> lungs<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.140> large

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
lymphatics one of the lungs the large

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.880 
lymphatics one of the lungs the large
intestine<00:01:30.159> nervous<00:01:30.940> system<00:01:31.620> circulation<00:01:32.620> and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
intestine nervous system circulation and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.440 
intestine nervous system circulation and
also<00:01:33.580> cellular<00:01:34.270> metabolism<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.670> key<00:01:37.090> idea

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
also cellular metabolism so the key idea

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.940 
also cellular metabolism so the key idea
here<00:01:37.510> is<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.780> get<00:01:38.049> all<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.350> your<00:01:38.440> readings<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.860> a

without the BioPod cell chip I could see

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.970 
without the BioPod cell chip I could see
an<00:01:47.770> immediate<00:01:48.400> decrease<00:01:49.120> in<00:01:49.330> energy<00:01:49.800> signs<00:01:50.800> of

an immediate decrease in energy signs of

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.740 
an immediate decrease in energy signs of
stress<00:01:51.280> on<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.760> meridians<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.300> were<00:01:52.600> being

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
stress on the meridians that were being

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.440 
stress on the meridians that were being
addressed<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.590> then<00:01:54.340> once<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.880> x<00:01:55.060> approach

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
addressed and then once the x approach

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.640 
addressed and then once the x approach
cell<00:01:55.810> chip<00:01:56.050> was<00:01:56.290> placed<00:01:57.070> onto<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.550> phone<00:01:57.790> then

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
cell chip was placed onto the phone then

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.620 
cell chip was placed onto the phone then
immediately<00:01:59.650> there<00:01:59.890> was<00:02:00.100> an<00:02:00.460> improvement<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
immediately there was an improvement and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.300 
immediately there was an improvement and
all<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.080> those<00:02:02.200> meridians<00:02:02.500> bringing<00:02:03.190> them

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
all of those meridians bringing them
