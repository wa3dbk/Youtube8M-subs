00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.330
 good my dear colleagues 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.880
 Today I 'm going to show you how to ride 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.510
 windows 7 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.550
 to these computers to their almost all 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.160
 the ultrabook and now extends this 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.770
 moment they are coming as well just 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.900
 as in 28 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.700
 and the people there are a lot of people who have not 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 could attach to windows 8 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.260
 so I'm going to show you this this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.760
 computer comes with this reference to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.530
 Its is 400 s 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.780
 this also serves for the asus is the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 306 which is exactly the same on 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.260
 time what happens is that one is of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.160
 second generation and one is third 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.160
 it's third generation 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.190
 for our switch to windows then 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.040
 obviously we have to have the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.100
 Windows 7 installer in a memory 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.100
 usb 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.790
 well I'm going to show you something 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.980
 we have to have this program that is 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.410
 the easy program for making windows 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.560
 7 For there are people who ask me 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.100
 They do not know how to do everything is simple 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.820
 simply because we give here 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.960
 let's see next 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.940
 and here I put 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.810
 here I increased equipment here I already have 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.900
 installed windows 7 I give it to accept 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.550
 because it is where it is temporary and the usb 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.790
 is usb is usb I'm going to put it in this 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.790
 device 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.789
 precisely in this device and I already 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.789
 position 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.300
 I look for my usb memory 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.140
 that instant is already done 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.500
 he just pointed it out and I give him to accept and 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.630
 there he starts to make the copy 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.290
 I'm not going to do that now because 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.260
 already there is the information of how 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.940
 it becomes good second step already when 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.630
 we have made the story in our memory 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.710
 usb windows 7 now simply what 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.710
 We have to do 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.550
 learn our computer access 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.550
 and give smiths 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.710
 ready and after farting there 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.610
 only two options that you have to move but 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.610
 First 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.140
 I give him here 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.420
 I go here to wood in wood I have to 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.290
 look at what is this that peace wood 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.590
 be in world and that the aus csm is in 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.420
 16 book that is the only and the other option 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.180
 because there are only two options that you have to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.260
 move so that it works for us in windows 7 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.260
 and the other options 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.170
 the security well control that is the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.660
 Segurity work over there where 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.210
 saves the serial of windows 8 of this 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.230
 machine when one installs windows 8 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.950
 in this machine 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.200
 the serial never does not ask again no 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.510
 does not ask again because it is 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.180
 saved in the bios of the machine if 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.550
 we leave this activated it will not load us 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.530
 windows 7 and it's not going to load us 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.800
 to load the memory of no 2 science 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.320
 that you just have to give it here 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.150
 it is paid to see 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:35.150
 enter we give you disabled ready then 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.860
 doing those two steps then we put 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.860
 our usb memory 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.940
 for her going to load 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.370
 we give you here in this option 6 change 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.370
 means to save the changes and we give it 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.950
 enter then exit configuration le 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.130
 we give it to save the configuration and 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.130
 Salt 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.830
 and start loading our memory 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.830
 usb 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.930
 and there until there is going to start installing 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.930
 in windows 7 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.330
 and good 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.720
