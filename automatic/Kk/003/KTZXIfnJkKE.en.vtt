and<00:04:16.570> then<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:16.840> how<00:04:16.930> much<00:04:17.109> of<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.440> cheap

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
and then and how much of the cheap

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.360 
and then and how much of the cheap
versions<00:04:18.640> so<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.570> 47<00:04:20.079> fed<00:04:20.260> is<00:04:20.440> very

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
versions so the 47 fed is very

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.250 
versions so the 47 fed is very
reasonable<00:04:21.640> it's<00:04:22.120> 950<00:04:22.870> dollars

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
reasonable it's 950 dollars

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.940 
reasonable it's 950 dollars

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
you can get neither color we get a

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.110 
you can get neither color we get a
little<00:04:28.190> bit<00:04:28.280> more<00:04:28.430> pricey<00:04:28.670> in<00:04:29.210> my<00:04:29.360> opinion

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
little bit more pricey in my opinion

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.180 
little bit more pricey in my opinion

a little bit of a more open head basket
and<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:53.390> used<00:04:53.660> instead<00:04:54.080> of<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.380> multi<00:04:54.830> cap<00:04:55.100> which

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
and I used instead of a multi cap which

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.450 
and I used instead of a multi cap which

right<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:07.130> really<00:05:08.060> those<00:05:08.240> are<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.480> only

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
right and really those are the only

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.920 
right and really those are the only
differences<00:05:09.080> no<00:05:09.470> small<00:05:09.830> differences<00:05:10.600> add<00:05:11.600> to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
differences no small differences add to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.490

the<00:05:12.050> price<00:05:12.260> of<00:05:12.890> course<00:05:13.330> but<00:05:14.330> they<00:05:14.450> also<00:05:14.630> open

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
the price of course but they also open

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.530 
the price of course but they also open
up<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.740> sound<00:05:16.010> a<00:05:16.160> little<00:05:16.280> bit<00:05:16.460> more<00:05:16.670> and<00:05:16.940> they

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
up the sound a little bit more and they

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.800 
up the sound a little bit more and they
keep<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.350> really<00:05:18.920> big<00:05:19.100> bottom<00:05:19.520> end<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.090> so

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
keep a really big bottom end to it so

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.020 
keep a really big bottom end to it so
it's<00:05:20.960> really<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.380> feature<00:05:21.770> vocal<00:05:22.460> kind<00:05:22.880> of

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
it's really a feature vocal kind of

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.990 
it's really a feature vocal kind of
microphone<00:05:23.830> ok<00:05:24.830> so<00:05:25.070> we've<00:05:25.190> also<00:05:25.340> got<00:05:25.610> one

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
microphone ok so we've also got one

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.850 
microphone ok so we've also got one
other<00:05:26.120> mic<00:05:26.390> hair<00:05:26.630> ribbon<00:05:26.960> mic<00:05:27.110> it<00:05:27.500> was<00:05:27.620> really

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
other mic hair ribbon mic it was really

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.550 
other mic hair ribbon mic it was really
microtek<00:05:28.460> shoeless<00:05:28.820> it's<00:05:29.750> more<00:05:30.050> like<00:05:30.230> an<00:05:30.380> old

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
microtek shoeless it's more like an old

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.840 
microtek shoeless it's more like an old
RCA<00:05:30.850> called<00:05:31.850> the<00:05:31.970> Seville<00:05:33.220> it's<00:05:34.220> a<00:05:34.280> point<00:05:34.520> 25

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850

folding machine that this old tool die

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.310 
folding machine that this old tool die
guy<00:05:40.310> made<00:05:40.760> me<00:05:40.970> up<00:05:41.120> in<00:05:41.270> San<00:05:41.450> Francisco<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.200> you

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
guy made me up in San Francisco and you

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.780 
guy made me up in San Francisco and you
want<00:05:42.530> you<00:05:42.680> wind<00:05:42.920> it<00:05:43.070> through<00:05:43.310> to<00:05:43.430> fold<00:05:43.640> the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
want you wind it through to fold the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.750 
want you wind it through to fold the
ribbon<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:45.380> cinnamic<00:05:45.890> transformer<00:05:46.580> and

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
ribbon and a cinnamic transformer and

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.380 
ribbon and a cinnamic transformer and
then<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.270> made<00:05:47.480> it<00:05:47.600> active<00:05:48.110> with<00:05:49.090> 4j<00:05:50.090> faites

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
then I made it active with 4j faites

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.800 
then I made it active with 4j faites
from<00:05:50.750> linear<00:05:51.140> systems<00:05:51.670> ls1<00:05:52.670> 70s<00:05:53.240> it's<00:05:53.480> really

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
from linear systems ls1 70s it's really

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.250 
from linear systems ls1 70s it's really
just<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:54.110> buffer<00:05:54.740> driver<00:05:55.190> circuit<00:05:55.820> and<00:05:56.260> it

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
just a buffer driver circuit and it

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.650 
just a buffer driver circuit and it
gives<00:05:57.440> you<00:05:57.560> like<00:05:57.680> a<00:05:57.710> 15<00:05:58.220> to<00:05:58.520> 25<00:05:58.940> DB<00:05:59.270> boost

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
gives you like a 15 to 25 DB boost

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.980 
gives you like a 15 to 25 DB boost
really<00:06:00.530> really<00:06:01.400> clean<00:06:01.640> keeps<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.180> noise

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
really really clean keeps the noise

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.770 
really really clean keeps the noise
floor<00:06:03.230> low<00:06:03.560> and<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:04.910> variance<00:06:05.270> of<00:06:05.420> the<00:06:05.540> boost

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
floor low and the variance of the boost

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.510 
floor low and the variance of the boost
is<00:06:05.960> dependent<00:06:06.440> on<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.650> current<00:06:07.010> coming<00:06:07.250> from

is dependent on the current coming from
your<00:06:07.700> phantom<00:06:08.300> power<00:06:08.510> right<00:06:09.470> okay<00:06:09.860> so<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:11.180> how

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
your phantom power right okay so so how

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.650 
your phantom power right okay so so how
much<00:06:11.690> for<00:06:12.560> this<00:06:12.680> one<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:12.950> this<00:06:13.460> one's<00:06:13.700> 850<00:06:14.390> and

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
much for this one and this one's 850 and

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.960 
much for this one and this one's 850 and
really<00:06:15.290> it<00:06:15.380> has<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:15.560> really<00:06:16.100> old<00:06:16.520> school

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
really it has a really old school

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.640 
really it has a really old school
vintage<00:06:17.300> tone<00:06:17.780> to<00:06:17.990> it<00:06:18.020> so<00:06:18.200> you're<00:06:18.350> not<00:06:18.470> going

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
vintage tone to it so you're not going

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.220 
vintage tone to it so you're not going
to<00:06:18.770> it's<00:06:19.190> not<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:19.460> condenser<00:06:20.240> and<00:06:20.480> it's<00:06:20.900> not<00:06:21.200> a
