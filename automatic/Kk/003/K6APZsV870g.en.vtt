hello<00:00:02.850> youtube<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.240> is<00:00:03.480> going<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.870> be<00:00:03.929> a

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
hello youtube this is going to be a

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.260 
hello youtube this is going to be a
tutorial<00:00:04.140> on<00:00:04.500> how<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.799> writing<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.130> said<00:00:05.310> okay

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
tutorial on how to writing you said okay

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.709 
tutorial on how to writing you said okay
so<00:00:07.170> first<00:00:07.740> step<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.610> get<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.790> unicycle<00:00:09.179> when

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
so first step is to get a unicycle when

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.600 
so first step is to get a unicycle when
she<00:00:10.050> probably<00:00:10.320> already<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.219> done<00:00:11.340> or<00:00:11.550> you

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
she probably already have done or you

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.430 
she probably already have done or you
might<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.849> looking<00:00:12.090> into<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:13.259> is

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
might be looking into one this is

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.620 
might be looking into one this is
specifically<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.099> trial<00:00:14.400> unicycle<00:00:15.059> there<00:00:15.480> are

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
specifically a trial unicycle there are

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.180 
specifically a trial unicycle there are
many<00:00:15.809> types<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.109> unicycles<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.830> learn

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
many types of unicycles and you learn

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.859 
many types of unicycles and you learn
about<00:00:17.369> those<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.970> venture<00:00:18.270> into<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
about those as you venture into the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.830 
about those as you venture into the
sport<00:00:19.140> okay<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.210> thing<00:00:21.480> you're

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
sport okay so the first thing you're

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.910 
sport okay so the first thing you're
going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> want<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.230> know<00:00:22.289> about<00:00:22.650> your

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
going to want to know about your

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.400 
going to want to know about your
unicycle<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.240> crank<00:00:24.600> length<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
unicycle is the crank length so the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.259 
unicycle is the crank length so the
crank<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.980> metal<00:00:26.340> part<00:00:26.519> right<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
crank is this metal part right here and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.240 
crank is this metal part right here and
it's<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.810> attaches<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> wheel<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.800> axle

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it's what attaches the wheel to the axle

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490 
it's what attaches the wheel to the axle
to<00:00:29.310> actually<00:00:29.550> get<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> wheel<00:00:29.880> spinning<00:00:30.500> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
to actually get the wheel spinning the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.220 
to actually get the wheel spinning the
crank<00:00:31.769> length<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.219> important<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
crank length is important because it

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.459 
crank length is important because it
determines<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.760> easy<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.690> roll<00:00:37.290> up

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
determines how easy it is to roll up

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.180 
determines how easy it is to roll up
obstacles

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
obstacles

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400 
obstacles
so<00:00:38.790> my<00:00:38.940> first<00:00:39.120> unicycle<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> freestyle<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so my first unicycle is a freestyle and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
so my first unicycle is a freestyle and
it<00:00:40.500> had<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:40.800> short<00:00:41.160> cranks<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.910> short

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it had really short cranks really short

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.360 
it had really short cranks really short
cranks<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.690> good<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.379> fast<00:00:43.680> but

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
cranks are good for going fast but

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.340 
cranks are good for going fast but
they're<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:44.730> very<00:00:44.940> good<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.899> rolling<00:00:46.260> up

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
they're not very good for rolling up

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.250 
they're not very good for rolling up
things<00:00:46.680> or<00:00:47.360> control<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:48.989> you're<00:00:49.079> learning

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
things or control when you're learning

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
things or control when you're learning
it's<00:00:49.559> better<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.920> bigger<00:00:50.100> cranks<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it's better to have bigger cranks the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
it's better to have bigger cranks the
second<00:00:51.360> thing<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:51.840> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
second thing you're going to want to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.150 
second thing you're going to want to
worry<00:00:52.140> about<00:00:52.320> when<00:00:52.440> you're<00:00:52.530> learning<00:00:52.680> there

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
worry about when you're learning there

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.470 
worry about when you're learning there
are<00:00:53.190> many<00:00:53.399> factors<00:00:53.610> videos<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.360> but

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
are many factors videos like up but

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
are many factors videos like up but
there<00:00:54.600> are<00:00:54.660> only<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:54.960> important<00:00:55.320> things<00:00:55.350> for

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
there are only two important things for

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
there are only two important things for
learning<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> seat<00:00:57.809> height<00:00:58.050> okay

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
learning and not as the seat height okay

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.350 
learning and not as the seat height okay
this<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.890> higher<00:00:59.160> seat

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
this is a higher seat

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.110 
this is a higher seat
is<00:01:00.450> going<00:01:00.630> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> better<00:01:00.990> for<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:02.120> not

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
is going to be better for you well not

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000 
is going to be better for you well not
too<00:01:03.330> high<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.540> you<00:01:03.810> can<00:01:03.990> carry<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.770> pedal

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
too high that you can carry so pedal

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
too high that you can carry so pedal
anymore<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.910> taller<00:01:06.240> C<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.690> better<00:01:06.810> than

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
anymore but a taller C is better than

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.390 
anymore but a taller C is better than
throwing<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.470> you're<00:01:07.590> sitting<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:07.890> Miss<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
throwing if you're sitting like Miss on

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.550 
throwing if you're sitting like Miss on
your<00:01:08.550> unicycle<00:01:08.880> seat<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.750> low<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.200> that's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
your unicycle seat really low or that's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.860 
your unicycle seat really low or that's
not<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.890> okay<00:01:11.250> should<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.720> it's

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
not right okay should be that when it's

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.170 
not right okay should be that when it's
down<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:14.160> put<00:01:14.340> us<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.730> way<00:01:14.820> down<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
down you put us all the way down the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.360 
down you put us all the way down the
only<00:01:15.270> train<00:01:15.510> station<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> seat

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
only train station going on and the seat

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.060 
only train station going on and the seat
in<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.850> legs<00:01:18.030> should<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.660> then

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
in your legs should be a little bit then

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.260 
in your legs should be a little bit then
okay<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.340> shouldn't<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.729> flustered<00:01:21.000> like

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
okay so it shouldn't be flustered like

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.430 
okay so it shouldn't be flustered like
this<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> shouldn't<00:01:22.050> have<00:01:22.140> trouble

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
this and you shouldn't have trouble

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.320 
this and you shouldn't have trouble
reaching<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.800> should<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.160> nice<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.760> relaxed

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
reaching it should be nice and relaxed

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.980 
reaching it should be nice and relaxed
okay<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.830> next<00:01:26.070> step<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.870> be

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
okay the next step is going to be

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.390 
okay the next step is going to be
getting<00:01:28.170> comfortable<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.010> a<00:01:29.070> second

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
getting comfortable with you in a second

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so people when they first try the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.510 
so people when they first try the
industry<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.680> man<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> want<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.220> try<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
industry with man I want to try that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850 
industry with man I want to try that
thing<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.720> try<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.380> this
