just want to show you something that's

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.040 
just want to show you something that's
not<00:00:05.549> so<00:00:05.819> pleasant<00:00:06.180> but<00:00:06.930> it's<00:00:07.620> oftenly<00:00:08.660> met<00:00:09.660> in

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
not so pleasant but it's oftenly met in

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.530 
not so pleasant but it's oftenly met in
orchid<00:00:10.860> growing<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.550> any<00:00:11.969> other<00:00:12.210> plant

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
orchid growing and any other plant

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.760 
orchid growing and any other plant
growing<00:00:12.840> which<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.590> an<00:00:14.099> aphid<00:00:14.519> infestation

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
growing which is an aphid infestation

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.010 
growing which is an aphid infestation
now<00:00:16.770> aphids<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:18.119> bugs<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.660> can

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
now aphids are some bugs that you can

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.099 
now aphids are some bugs that you can
find<00:00:19.320> pretty<00:00:19.680> often<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.609> lot<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
find pretty often if you have a lot of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.929 
find pretty often if you have a lot of
houseplants<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.769> find<00:00:23.010> them<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.310> roses

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
houseplants you can find them on roses

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.560 
houseplants you can find them on roses
on<00:00:24.269> hibiscus<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:26.160> lot<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> other<00:00:26.910> plants

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
on hibiscus and a lot of other plants

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.620 
on hibiscus and a lot of other plants
and<00:00:28.019> what<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.789> far<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.060> I've<00:00:30.330> seen

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and what they do is as far as I've seen

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.639 
and what they do is as far as I've seen
they<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.219> chew<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.989> buds<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
they like to chew on the buds the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.880 
they like to chew on the buds the
flowers<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> stems<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:36.000> orchids

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
flowers and the stems of orchids

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.709 
flowers and the stems of orchids
probably<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.850> tissue<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.270> softer

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
probably because the tissue is softer

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.869 
probably because the tissue is softer
and<00:00:40.160> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> leaves<00:00:41.550> actually<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.450> didn't<00:00:43.140> see

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
and on the leaves actually I didn't see

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.549 
and on the leaves actually I didn't see
anything

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
anything

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
anything
so<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:46.770> guessing<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.579> affect<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.510> blooms

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
so I'm guessing they affect the blooms

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.139 
so I'm guessing they affect the blooms
but<00:00:49.379> still<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> pretty<00:00:51.030> sight

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
but still it's it's not a pretty sight

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.560 
but still it's it's not a pretty sight
and<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.050> shouldn't<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.500> left<00:00:52.710> untreated<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and it shouldn't be left untreated and I

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.790 
and it shouldn't be left untreated and I
just<00:00:54.809> wanted<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> show<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> how<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:55.770> look

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
just wanted to show you how they look

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
just wanted to show you how they look
like<00:00:56.190> look<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.149> tiny<00:00:58.940> fleas<00:00:59.940> let's<00:01:00.390> say

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
like look like tiny fleas let's say

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.020 
like look like tiny fleas let's say
green<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.649> white<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.100> color<00:01:02.340> sometimes<00:01:02.730> they

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
green or white in color sometimes they

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.800 
green or white in color sometimes they
can<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.300> black<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:05.250> haven't<00:01:05.610> seen<00:01:06.000> black

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
can get black but I haven't seen black

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.390 
can get black but I haven't seen black
efforts<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.439> orchids

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
efforts on orchids

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.719 
efforts on orchids
I've<00:01:08.549> seen<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.210> roses<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.580> they<00:01:11.580> can

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
I've seen it on roses and they can

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.810 
I've seen it on roses and they can
actually<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.600> transmitted<00:01:13.170> by<00:01:13.500> winds<00:01:13.920> they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
actually be transmitted by winds they

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
actually be transmitted by winds they
can<00:01:14.970> travel<00:01:15.150> by<00:01:15.390> wind<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.049> bring<00:01:16.350> home<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
can travel by wind you can bring home a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.399 
can travel by wind you can bring home a
flower<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> plant<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.689> has<00:01:19.340> aphid<00:01:20.340> X<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
flower or a plant that has aphid X and

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.230 
flower or a plant that has aphid X and
you<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> bring<00:01:24.060> them

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you you don't know when you bring them

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.490 
you you don't know when you bring them
in<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.450> house<00:01:24.659> actually<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.259> they're

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
in your house actually but they're

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.940 
in your house actually but they're
pretty<00:01:25.650> common<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:28.110> way<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> treat<00:01:28.680> them

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
pretty common and the way I treat them

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.020 
pretty common and the way I treat them
is<00:01:29.250> by<00:01:30.119> using<00:01:30.299> an<00:01:30.689> insecticide<00:01:31.350> which<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.369> mild

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
is by using an insecticide which is mild

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.319 
is by using an insecticide which is mild
it<00:01:33.540> doesn't<00:01:33.900> affect<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> plant<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.119> works

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it doesn't affect the plant and it works

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.960 
it doesn't affect the plant and it works
pretty<00:01:36.750> well<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:38.369> use<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
pretty well with them I can use the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.609 
pretty well with them I can use the
isopropyl<00:01:39.840> solution<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.540> yeah<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.990> didn't

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
isopropyl solution but yeah I didn't

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.889 
isopropyl solution but yeah I didn't
really<00:01:43.890> find<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.670> don't<00:01:44.850> find<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.450> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
really find it you don't find them you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.170 
really find it you don't find them you
don't<00:01:46.020> find<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.680> type<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> alcohol<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
don't find that a type of alcohol and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.380 
don't find that a type of alcohol and
pharmacies<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.520> only<00:01:50.610> find<00:01:52.340> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
pharmacies here you can only find the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.450 
pharmacies here you can only find the
ethanol<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.140> think<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.560> ethanol<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
ethanol one I think it's ethanol and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.380 
ethanol one I think it's ethanol and
it's<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> blue<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.670> one<00:01:59.820> they<00:01:59.939> used<00:02:00.149> in

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
