00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.119
 hi everyone today a few days ago I was here today I bring you a video in which I intend 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 point out the differences between the flu that we knew so far and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.699
 injured that went on sale this month here in Spain 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.470
 and nothing we have simply output at first glance seems more differences 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.140
 in the obvious between the two devices 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.070
 I hope you can find them interesting and if you have any questions 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.500
 do not want to write me on twitter and the facebook account 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.610
 Well, as you can see 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.200
 one of the biggest differences between the gray we know up to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.530
 now that this model here and the grip and two that has taken chest this month 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.920
 February here in Spain 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.470
 well that is here is basically the size the size and the possibility 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.409
 to use strings of up to eight with nine 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.030
 n in the new model so far we have to fix ropes below in the cone 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.390
 cho in the previous model generates a little delicate had to be so 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 depending on the insurer so that the cam will correctly block the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.390
 rope 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.210
 in the now-a-hundred model the cam is a little bit narrower 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.770
 I'm going to teach you 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 let's see if we can see it 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.430
 here it is 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.410
 if you can see n the width of the cam 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.500
 the old model that is here 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.960
 it's a little bit superior 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.360
 across the cam of this model the new 22 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.170
 what is it that makes us use the guided with more strings 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.830
 narrower than eight with movements 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.980
 tell me that the difference between both is what I said before basically 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.680
 size 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.000
 the power to use on ropes sea 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.310
 closer 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.229
 and the weight 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.409
 in more or less it is reduced by a third, which is what I told you before and 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.409
 little bit more unemployment all those who use ropes 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.940
 more the more narrow d again with eight 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.289
 For his part he commented that this figure as a model 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.969
 the zero for all those yes yes using ropes of beauty in the background or 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.710
 ten with four even 11 millimeters so good the change either 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.139
 is to be very important
