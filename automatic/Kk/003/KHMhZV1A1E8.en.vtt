00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:08.410
 hello good today I do a review of a 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:10.330
 canon goal a 35 80 a 45 6 has 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.349
 many years ago they left 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.230
 for the 500 and analog cameras 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.390
 this type of cameras but nowadays 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.020
 continue to use since they are targets 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.760
 cheap and they are very fast they focus very 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:31.740
 fast even faster than the 1755 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.740
 1855 from the original camera 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.320
 nothing as you see has autofocus and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.180
 the range is not very big but it 's a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.629
 lightweight objective I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.629
 how much do you weigh 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 weighs 179 grams the same as it would weigh 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.870
 50 fixed plus or minus 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 and nothing I'm going to mount on the camera 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.519
 let's do a few approaches to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.340
 that you see the quick focus that has 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.140
 and the image quality that I have I'm not going 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
 to treat the images I will not pass them 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.910
 neither by photoshop nor 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.940
 none of this so you can see the quality 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.010
 of the original image that the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.580
 target'm using a Canon 600 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.210
 to plus 600 for more or 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.619
 less gays but I will not treat the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.350
 picture in any way in fact I'm going to 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.570
 put in neutral and judge for you 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.460
 themselves the image quality and speed 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.710
 of video since I'm also going to make a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.340
 short video so you can see the speed of 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.340
 approach that has 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.810
 we have already mounted the objective as 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.630
 you can see 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.310
 the range is not too much but good 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.799
 It's really not bad and I'm going to 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.810
 teach the speed of focus you have 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.580
 a manual we focus all the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.150
 automatic left 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.150
 ah 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.880
 and approach we do again annual 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.479
 that approach 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.200
 what 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.200
 ah 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.670
 we have been lost there a little we go back to 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.670
 do it for the third time and last 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.870
 as you can see we focus very fast 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.910
 to make a short video of teaching a 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.910
 little how the colors and others look 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.260
 singer 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.000
 OK 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.280
 It has very good colors very good 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.640
 quality the truth that is a goal that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.600
 I was surprised when I tried it and 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.760
 good 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.290
 there is much more to say the truth that you 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.400
 I recommend I recommend you what 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.500
 what do you do and I say for 50 euros 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.930
 more or less you can find it more expensive 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.770
 and cheaper you can find them by 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.110
 there and nothing else to tell you I hope that 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.190
