00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
weekend as well so honestly I think it's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.650 
weekend as well so honestly I think it's
more<00:00:31.529> intelligent<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.430> start<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:33.630> now

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
more intelligent to start right now

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.479 
more intelligent to start right now
because<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.070> people<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
because you're going to have people that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.490 
because you're going to have people that
didn't<00:00:35.760> make<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.239> week<00:00:36.510> continuing<00:00:37.469> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
didn't make it this week continuing to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
didn't make it this week continuing to
attempt<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> make<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.030> tournament's

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
attempt to make it in the tournament's

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.940 
attempt to make it in the tournament's
down<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> line<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.469> you're<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> have

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
down the line so you're going to have

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.190 
down the line so you're going to have
more<00:00:41.460> people<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.360> longer<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.719> goes<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.079> my

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
more people the longer it goes in my

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.450 
more people the longer it goes in my
opinion<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.649> more<00:00:43.800> people<00:00:43.980> finding<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.399> oh

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
opinion and more people finding out oh

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250 
opinion and more people finding out oh
so<00:00:44.789> basically<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.750> best<00:00:45.930> shot<00:00:46.110> for

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so basically if your best shot for

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
so basically if your best shot for
getting<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.280> opinion<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.879> weekend

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
getting in in my opinion is this weekend

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
getting in in my opinion is this weekend
and<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:48.930> most<00:00:49.469> people<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and I think most people are going to be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
and I think most people are going to be
playing<00:00:50.250> standard<00:00:50.730> broods<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.379> that's<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
playing standard broods so that's what I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.779 
playing standard broods so that's what I
think<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> my<00:00:53.370> viewers<00:00:53.430> are

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
think a lot of my viewers are

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.459 
think a lot of my viewers are
comfortable<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
comfortable with so I think a lot of

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.110 
comfortable with so I think a lot of
people<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.949> overlooking<00:00:56.550> specifically

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
people will be overlooking specifically

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.420 
people will be overlooking specifically
fastest<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:59.039> there's<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> be

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
fastest and I think there's going to be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
fastest and I think there's going to be
a<00:00:59.489> lot<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.760> people<00:00:59.879> overlooking<00:01:00.449> bgh<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.109> bgh

is one or two percent I'm going to

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.910 
is one or two percent I'm going to
assume<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.050> case<00:04:29.170> with<00:04:29.350> paypal<00:04:29.740> as
