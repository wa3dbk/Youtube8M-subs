00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:06.290 

we're<00:00:03.209> here<00:00:03.449> at<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.629> back<00:00:04.110> canal<00:00:04.590> this<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.790> fresh

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.300 
we're here at a back canal this is fresh

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.839 
we're here at a back canal this is fresh
water<00:00:06.630> but<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.080> has<00:00:07.320> also<00:00:07.890> salt<00:00:08.189> water<00:00:08.400> coming

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
water but it has also salt water coming

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.850 
water but it has also salt water coming
in<00:00:08.999> from<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.360> Gulf<00:00:09.599> periodically<00:00:10.379> so<00:00:10.740> we

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
in from the Gulf periodically so we

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.589 
in from the Gulf periodically so we
should<00:00:11.070> find<00:00:11.370> some<00:00:11.579> brackish<00:00:12.030> water

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
should find some brackish water

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.049 
should find some brackish water
Gary<00:00:13.289> Lafleur<00:00:13.679> can<00:00:14.039> you<00:00:14.159> tell<00:00:14.400> us<00:00:14.429> why<00:00:14.789> that's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
Gary Lafleur can you tell us why that's

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.380 
Gary Lafleur can you tell us why that's
important<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> estuary<00:00:16.640> well<00:00:17.640> lower

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
important in the estuary well lower

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.960 
important in the estuary well lower
salinity<00:00:18.750> water<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.350> me<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.700> what's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
salinity water to me is is what's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.580 
salinity water to me is is what's
characteristic<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.630> an<00:00:21.750> estuary<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.410> got

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
characteristic of an estuary you got

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.650 
characteristic of an estuary you got
certain<00:00:23.280> types<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:23.700> animals<00:00:24.120> that<00:00:24.270> live<00:00:24.480> in

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
certain types of animals that live in

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
certain types of animals that live in
high<00:00:25.140> salinity<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:26.010> would<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.610> move

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
high salinity and they would you move

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.779 
high salinity and they would you move
pelagic<00:00:27.360> animals<00:00:28.020> but<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:28.980> find<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.610> in

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
pelagic animals but what we find here in

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.630 
pelagic animals but what we find here in
an<00:00:29.940> estuary<00:00:30.270> are<00:00:30.930> just<00:00:31.440> a<00:00:31.620> few<00:00:31.830> animals<00:00:32.129> that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
an estuary are just a few animals that

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.790 
an estuary are just a few animals that
really<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.120> well<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.600> something<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.560> half

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
really do well in something like half

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.780 
really do well in something like half
seawater<00:00:35.790> salinity<00:00:36.000> something<00:00:36.720> like<00:00:36.900> ten<00:00:37.650> to

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
seawater salinity something like ten to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.090 
seawater salinity something like ten to
fifteen<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.120> twenty-five<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.800> only<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
fifteen to twenty-five and not only that

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100 
fifteen to twenty-five and not only that
but<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.940> special<00:00:42.360> group<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.660> animals

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
but then it's a special group of animals

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.300 
but then it's a special group of animals
that<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:45.079> they're<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.230> sensitive<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> too

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
that can they're not sensitive to too

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.060 
that can they're not sensitive to too
big<00:00:47.640> fluctuations<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.570> salinity<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.829> deep

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
big fluctuations in salinity so in deep

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.010 
big fluctuations in salinity so in deep
sea<00:00:50.340> water<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:51.000> always<00:00:51.300> really<00:00:51.840> high

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
sea water it's always really high

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
sea water it's always really high
salinity<00:00:52.530> 35<00:00:53.130> parts<00:00:53.430> per<00:00:53.460> thousand<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.300> here

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
salinity 35 parts per thousand but here

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.270 
salinity 35 parts per thousand but here
you<00:00:54.720> can<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:55.020> within<00:00:55.290> an<00:00:55.500> hour<00:00:55.649> from<00:00:56.040> five

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you can go within an hour from five

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.760 
you can go within an hour from five
parts<00:00:56.610> per<00:00:56.670> thousand<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:58.020> big<00:00:58.230> wave<00:00:58.469> comes

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
parts per thousand if a big wave comes

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.560 
parts per thousand if a big wave comes
into<00:00:59.100> maybe<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.790> up<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> 20<00:01:00.329> parts

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
into maybe all the way up to 20 parts

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.910 
into maybe all the way up to 20 parts
per<00:01:00.630> thousand<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> big<00:01:01.710> rain

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
per thousand and then when a big rain

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.020 
per thousand and then when a big rain
comes<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.309> go<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.610> way<00:01:02.640> back<00:01:02.850> down<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
comes you go all the way back down to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.950 
comes you go all the way back down to
five<00:01:03.329> parts<00:01:03.570> per<00:01:03.719> thousand<00:01:04.259> so<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.960> what's

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
five parts per thousand so it's what's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
five parts per thousand so it's what's
characteristic<00:01:07.620> of<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:07.830> area<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
characteristic of an area like this is

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600 
characteristic of an area like this is
is<00:01:09.210> only<00:01:09.540> these<00:01:09.840> animals<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.370> tolerate

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
is only these animals that can tolerate

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.899 
is only these animals that can tolerate
big<00:01:12.390> salinity<00:01:12.990> fluxes<00:01:13.640> let's<00:01:14.640> take<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
big salinity fluxes let's take a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600 
big salinity fluxes let's take a
salinity<00:01:15.360> ready<00:01:16.130> okay<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.400> two

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
salinity ready okay we have two

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
salinity ready okay we have two
different<00:01:17.820> types<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.330> instruments<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.080> we

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
different types of instruments here we

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
different types of instruments here we
have<00:01:19.440> them<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.890> maybe<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> more<00:01:20.700> traditional

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
have them the maybe the more traditional

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.899 
have them the maybe the more traditional
and<00:01:21.780> that's<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.260> refractometer<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and that's this refractometer so it

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.399 
and that's this refractometer so it
measures<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.299> refractive<00:01:24.869> index<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.350> water

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
measures the refractive index of water

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.789 
measures the refractive index of water
and<00:01:26.750> these<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.960> although<00:01:28.260> they're<00:01:28.590> more

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and these are although they're more

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.870 
and these are although they're more
traditional<00:01:29.250> they're<00:01:29.340> still<00:01:29.610> pretty

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
traditional they're still pretty

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.219 
traditional they're still pretty
expensive<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.510> you<00:01:30.689> always<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> be

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
expensive so you always have to be

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
expensive so you always have to be
careful<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.100> by<00:01:32.670> reading<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
careful with them and by reading the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.170 
careful with them and by reading the
meniscus<00:01:33.689> by<00:01:34.500> looking<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.610> instrument

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
meniscus by looking into this instrument

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.830 
meniscus by looking into this instrument
I<00:01:36.270> read<00:01:36.720> something<00:01:37.080> like<00:01:37.790> about<00:01:38.790> 17<00:01:39.450> maybe<00:01:39.720> 18

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I read something like about 17 maybe 18

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.590 
I read something like about 17 maybe 18
porch<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.560> thousand<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.240> then<00:01:42.240> carries

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
porch of a thousand and then carries

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
porch of a thousand and then carries
looking<00:01:42.900> at<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.259> using<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.130> Wi-Fi<00:01:44.610> salan

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
looking at the using a Wi-Fi salan

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.070 
looking at the using a Wi-Fi salan
ometer<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.430> an<00:01:47.790> electronic<00:01:48.479> method

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
ometer and this is an electronic method

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.260 
ometer and this is an electronic method
and<00:01:49.290> actually<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.770> measuring<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:50.939> got<00:01:51.150> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and actually it's measuring they got the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.440 
and actually it's measuring they got the
conductance<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.549> transfers<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.820> into

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
conductance and it transfers that into

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.569 
conductance and it transfers that into
salinity<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.409> looks<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.280> getting<00:01:56.400> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
salinity and looks like I'm getting a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.370 
salinity and looks like I'm getting a
reading<00:01:56.970> pretty<00:01:57.240> close<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.900> got<00:01:58.110> dr.

compared to other other more systems we

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.990 
compared to other other more systems we

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
have this great huge

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.750 
have this great huge

fresh<00:02:17.980> water<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.970> right<00:02:19.540> there's<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.960> very

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
fresh water to right there's a very

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.470 
fresh water to right there's a very

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
ocean water very steep gradient in these

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.750 
ocean water very steep gradient in these
other<00:02:22.810> estuaries<00:02:23.440> that's<00:02:24.130> one<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.490> reasons

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
other estuaries that's one of reasons

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.340 
other estuaries that's one of reasons
we're<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.060> productive<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.720> because<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
we're so productive is because of the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.180 
we're so productive is because of the
vast<00:02:26.620> size<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.490> our<00:02:27.910> estimate<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.450> absolutely

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
vast size of our estimate of absolutely

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.949 
vast size of our estimate of absolutely
so<00:02:30.190> we've<00:02:30.370> got<00:02:30.520> something<00:02:31.300> important<00:02:31.690> here<00:02:31.870> we

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
so we've got something important here we

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.820 
so we've got something important here we
got<00:02:32.110> fish<00:02:32.500> for<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:34.209> big<00:02:34.420> fish<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.870> eat<00:02:34.900> but

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
got fish for the big fish to eat but

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.340 
got fish for the big fish to eat but
then<00:02:35.950> we<00:02:36.040> also<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.580> some<00:02:36.970> fish<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:38.200> are

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
then we also have some fish that are

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.280 
then we also have some fish that are
young<00:02:38.620> catch<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.690> debtor<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.990> are

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
young catch of this debtor that are

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.170 
young catch of this debtor that are
going<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.470> be<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.830> fish<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.400> eat<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:43.030> know

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
going to be a fish that we eat you know

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.410 
going to be a fish that we eat you know
what<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.390> guy<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> Atlantic

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
what this guy is so this is the Atlantic

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.750 
what this guy is so this is the Atlantic

you<00:02:48.760> know<00:02:48.850> crustaceans<00:02:49.630> are<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> big<00:02:49.959> part<00:02:50.140> of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
you know crustaceans are a big part of

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.449 
you know crustaceans are a big part of
our<00:02:50.350> life<00:02:50.530> here<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:50.860> Louisiana

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
our life here in Louisiana

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.420 
our life here in Louisiana
and<00:02:52.080> what<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> lot<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.380> people<00:02:53.590> know<00:02:53.770> about<00:02:53.800> or

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
and what a lot of people know about or

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.040 
and what a lot of people know about or
this<00:02:54.760> crustacean<00:02:55.209> here<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.870> the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
this crustacean here this is the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.380 
this crustacean here this is the
crawfish<00:02:56.459> we<00:02:57.459> don't<00:02:57.610> find<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.940> much<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.300> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
crawfish we don't find it much in the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.449 
crawfish we don't find it much in the
estuary<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.020> up<00:02:59.170> estuary<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.310> it's

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
estuary but it's up estuary and so it's

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.220 
estuary but it's up estuary and so it's
connected<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.540> bottom<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.020> estuary

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
connected to the bottom of the estuary

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.410 
connected to the bottom of the estuary
it<00:03:03.100> lives<00:03:03.370> in<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> water<00:03:03.820> that's<00:03:04.090> flowing

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
it lives in the water that's flowing

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.990 
it lives in the water that's flowing
down<00:03:04.750> into<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.200> saltwater<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.370> make<00:03:06.730> what<00:03:06.910> we

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
down into the saltwater to make what we

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.390 
down into the saltwater to make what we
call<00:03:07.150> an<00:03:07.300> estuary<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.020> so<00:03:08.739> we<00:03:08.890> eat<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.130> lot<00:03:09.370> of

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
call an estuary and so we eat a lot of

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.310 
call an estuary and so we eat a lot of
these<00:03:09.610> guys<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.180> then<00:03:10.239> another<00:03:10.720> decapod

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
these guys and then another decapod

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.590 
these guys and then another decapod
crustacean<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.820> big<00:03:13.000> part<00:03:13.270> of<00:03:13.420> a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
crustacean that's a big part of a

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.780 
crustacean that's a big part of a
healthy<00:03:14.110> estuary<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:14.860> what<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.160> what<00:03:15.489> we<00:03:15.520> got

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
healthy estuary is what we what we got

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.500 
healthy estuary is what we what we got
here<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:16.630> come<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> little<00:03:17.049> closer<00:03:17.410> we<00:03:17.799> got<00:03:17.950> a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
here so come a little closer we got a

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.970 
here so come a little closer we got a
crab<00:03:19.510> there<00:03:19.870> are<00:03:20.019> crab<00:03:20.260> there<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.739> crab

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
crab there are crab there and a crab

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.640 
crab there are crab there and a crab
here<00:03:21.280> these<00:03:21.730> are<00:03:21.910> all<00:03:22.090> fiddler<00:03:22.660> crabs<00:03:22.930> but<00:03:23.530> in

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
here these are all fiddler crabs but in

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.350 
here these are all fiddler crabs but in
Louisiana<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:25.450> have<00:03:25.930> kind<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.470> special

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
Louisiana we have kind of a special

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.330 
Louisiana we have kind of a special
closeness<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.810> animals<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.890> estuary

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
closeness to the animals in the estuary

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.509 
closeness to the animals in the estuary
and<00:03:30.549> one<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.630> one<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.290> ways<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.280> we

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
and one of the one of the ways that we

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.100 
and one of the one of the ways that we
show<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.030> by<00:03:34.120> giving<00:03:34.390> them<00:03:34.480> special<00:03:34.750> name

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
show that is by giving them special name

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.660 
show that is by giving them special name
so<00:03:35.350> what<00:03:35.470> do<00:03:35.530> y'all<00:03:35.680> call<00:03:35.709> these<00:03:36.250> little<00:03:36.549> guys

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
so what do y'all call these little guys

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.090 
so what do y'all call these little guys
you<00:03:36.730> don't<00:03:37.060> call<00:03:37.209> them<00:03:37.299> fiddler<00:03:37.660> crabs<00:03:38.100> -

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
you don't call them fiddler crabs -

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.490 
you don't call them fiddler crabs -
Lulu's<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:39.910> everybody<00:03:40.360> in<00:03:40.510> Louisiana<00:03:41.019> on<00:03:41.230> on

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
Lulu's so everybody in Louisiana on on

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.930 
Lulu's so everybody in Louisiana on on
the<00:03:41.650> coast<00:03:41.860> here<00:03:42.010> thinks<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.430> these<00:03:42.549> as<00:03:42.700> -

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
the coast here thinks of these as -

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.930 
the coast here thinks of these as -
Lulu's<00:03:43.269> this<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.320> Yuka<00:03:44.650> my<00:03:44.829> knacks<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.730> could

people<00:05:32.170> hardly<00:05:32.530> ever<00:05:32.740> see<00:05:33.040> it<00:05:33.160> but<00:05:33.670> it's<00:05:33.790> some

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
people hardly ever see it but it's some

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.400 
people hardly ever see it but it's some
times<00:05:34.180> of<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.450> year<00:05:34.630> they<00:05:34.780> come<00:05:34.960> out<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.290> lay

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
times of the year they come out to lay

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.020 
times of the year they come out to lay
their<00:05:35.590> eggs<00:05:35.770> into<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.130> water<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:36.580> so<00:05:36.730> every

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
their eggs into the water and so every

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.610 
their eggs into the water and so every
now<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.360> then<00:05:37.450> you<00:05:37.630> find<00:05:37.870> great<00:05:38.050> man<00:05:38.380> crabs

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
now and then you find great man crabs

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.250 
now and then you find great man crabs
coming<00:05:38.950> across<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.520> road<00:05:40.030> and<00:05:40.930> they<00:05:40.990> become

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
coming across the road and they become

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.930 
coming across the road and they become
roadkill<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:42.040> that's<00:05:42.160> when<00:05:42.340> people<00:05:42.790> bring

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
roadkill and that's when people bring

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.820 
roadkill and that's when people bring
them<00:05:43.090> into<00:05:43.240> us<00:05:43.510> but<00:05:44.169> they<00:05:44.260> also<00:05:44.290> have<00:05:44.680> these

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
them into us but they also have these

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.590 
them into us but they also have these
great<00:05:45.100> big<00:05:45.340> ice<00:05:45.520> stalks<00:05:45.970> here<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.360> this<00:05:46.450> is

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
great big ice stalks here and this is

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.390 
great big ice stalks here and this is
one<00:05:46.960> of<00:05:46.990> their<00:05:47.200> important<00:05:47.620> endocrine<00:05:48.040> organs

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
one of their important endocrine organs

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.760 
one of their important endocrine organs
it's<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.060> same<00:05:49.330> similar<00:05:49.900> than<00:05:50.169> to<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.740> eye

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
it's the same similar than to the eye

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.590 
it's the same similar than to the eye
stalk<00:05:51.160> that<00:05:51.310> you<00:05:51.370> can<00:05:51.520> see<00:05:51.730> on<00:05:51.820> this<00:05:51.940> crab<00:05:52.240> here

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
stalk that you can see on this crab here

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.780 
stalk that you can see on this crab here
the<00:05:53.200> same<00:05:53.440> eye<00:05:53.650> stuff<00:05:53.980> that<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.220> can<00:05:54.370> see<00:05:54.580> here

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
the same eye stuff that you can see here

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.690 
the same eye stuff that you can see here
and<00:05:54.910> so<00:05:55.169> these<00:05:56.169> are<00:05:56.410> sort<00:05:56.980> of<00:05:57.100> important<00:05:57.550> from

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
and so these are sort of important from

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.340 
and so these are sort of important from
a<00:05:57.790> comparative<00:05:58.300> point<00:05:58.540> of<00:05:58.720> view<00:05:58.870> as<00:05:59.080> well<00:05:59.290> as

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
a comparative point of view as well as

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.190 
a comparative point of view as well as
from<00:05:59.650> a<00:05:59.740> physiological<00:06:00.010> point<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:00.700> view<00:06:01.200> okay

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
from a physiological point of view okay

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.750 
from a physiological point of view okay
so<00:06:02.260> this<00:06:02.560> is<00:06:02.770> something<00:06:03.070> else<00:06:03.190> that<00:06:03.310> we<00:06:03.430> find

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
so this is something else that we find

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.990 
so this is something else that we find
here<00:06:04.060> in<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.930> estuary<00:06:05.440> and<00:06:05.890> and<00:06:06.610> just

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
here in the the estuary and and just

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.090 
here in the the estuary and and just
like<00:06:07.240> fiddle<00:06:07.600> crabs<00:06:07.900> you<00:06:08.080> have<00:06:08.260> to<00:06:08.440> look<00:06:08.710> hard

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
like fiddle crabs you have to look hard

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.220 
like fiddle crabs you have to look hard
for<00:06:09.220> these<00:06:09.580> these<00:06:10.000> are<00:06:10.360> GU<00:06:10.600> Kenzi<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.140> the

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
for these these are GU Kenzi of the

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.740 
for these these are GU Kenzi of the
missile<00:06:11.620> and<00:06:11.800> they're<00:06:12.580> all<00:06:12.790> at<00:06:13.120> the<00:06:13.270> bottom<00:06:13.419> of

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
missile and they're all at the bottom of

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.880 
missile and they're all at the bottom of
spartina<00:06:14.290> leaves

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
spartina leaves

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.330 
spartina leaves
sport<00:06:15.490> china<00:06:15.700> roots<00:06:16.030> so<00:06:16.990> this<00:06:17.200> is<00:06:17.560> the<00:06:17.919> ribbed

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
sport china roots so this is the ribbed

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.000 
sport china roots so this is the ribbed
mussel<00:06:18.880> and<00:06:19.320> it's<00:06:20.320> just<00:06:20.530> another<00:06:20.770> one<00:06:20.980> of

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
mussel and it's just another one of

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.000 
mussel and it's just another one of
those<00:06:21.250> important<00:06:22.200> physiology<00:06:23.200> models<00:06:23.830> that

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
those important physiology models that

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.550 
those important physiology models that
also<00:06:24.190> are<00:06:24.550> important<00:06:25.090> ecological<00:06:25.720> component

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
also are important ecological component

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.690 
also are important ecological component
of<00:06:26.860> the<00:06:26.950> estuary<00:06:27.240> these<00:06:28.240> have<00:06:28.510> sort<00:06:29.169> of<00:06:29.260> a

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
of the estuary these have sort of a

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.100 
of the estuary these have sort of a
symbiotic<00:06:30.700> relationship<00:06:31.480> with<00:06:31.600> sport<00:06:31.900> I<00:06:32.050> know

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
symbiotic relationship with sport I know

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.779 
symbiotic relationship with sport I know
as<00:06:32.380> well<00:06:32.860> as<00:06:33.030> the<00:06:34.030> yuca<00:06:34.630> crabs<00:06:34.900> and<00:06:35.610> you<00:06:36.610> can

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
as well as the yuca crabs and you can

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.230 
as well as the yuca crabs and you can
teach<00:06:37.060> students<00:06:37.930> about<00:06:38.050> how<00:06:38.520> species<00:06:39.520> in<00:06:40.030> the

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
teach students about how species in the

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.409 
teach students about how species in the
or<00:06:40.930> are<00:06:41.770> interrelated<00:06:42.220> and<00:06:42.819> depend<00:06:43.180> on<00:06:43.270> each

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
or are interrelated and depend on each

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.779 
or are interrelated and depend on each
other<00:06:43.660> this<00:06:44.080> is<00:06:44.139> a<00:06:44.259> nice<00:06:44.500> model<00:06:44.830> for<00:06:45.130> that<00:06:45.280> it's

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
other this is a nice model for that it's

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.370 
other this is a nice model for that it's
not<00:06:45.970> just<00:06:46.210> sport<00:06:46.419> aina<00:06:46.690> out<00:06:46.960> there

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
not just sport aina out there

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.559 
not just sport aina out there
it's<00:06:47.830> spartina<00:06:48.400> with<00:06:48.639> GU<00:06:48.789> Kinzie<00:06:49.180> the<00:06:49.360> myths

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:49.569 
it's spartina with GU Kinzie the myths

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.689 
it's spartina with GU Kinzie the myths
or<00:06:49.720> the<00:06:49.840> rib<00:06:49.990> muscle<00:06:50.410> at<00:06:50.590> the<00:06:51.190> base<00:06:51.370> of<00:06:51.400> its

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
roots and it's also sport tena that

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.529 
roots and it's also sport tena that
surrounded<00:06:54.280> by<00:06:54.400> fiddler<00:06:54.789> crabs<00:06:55.030> like<00:06:55.300> this

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
surrounded by fiddler crabs like this

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:57.930 
surrounded by fiddler crabs like this
that<00:06:56.349> are<00:06:56.470> living<00:06:56.650> underneath<00:06:57.009> the<00:06:57.250> sport

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940

that are living underneath the sport
kind<00:06:58.060> of<00:06:58.210> canopy<00:06:58.509> and<00:06:58.780> so<00:06:58.960> it<00:06:59.110> gives<00:06:59.770> them<00:07:00.039> a<00:07:00.099> an

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
kind of canopy and so it gives them a an

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.490 
kind of canopy and so it gives them a an
appreciation<00:07:01.090> for<00:07:01.270> the<00:07:01.539> interrelatedness<00:07:02.229> of

appreciation for the interrelatedness of

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.939 
appreciation for the interrelatedness of
species<00:07:03.220> and<00:07:03.370> yesterday<00:07:04.470> now<00:07:05.470> we're<00:07:05.680> ready<00:07:05.860> to

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:05.949 
species and yesterday now we're ready to

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:07.559 
species and yesterday now we're ready to
find<00:07:06.250> out<00:07:06.490> whether<00:07:06.639> there<00:07:06.910> is<00:07:07.030> a<00:07:07.060> salinity

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:07.569 
find out whether there is a salinity

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.200 
find out whether there is a salinity
difference<00:07:08.199> from<00:07:08.470> the<00:07:08.860> back<00:07:09.099> canal<00:07:09.550> and<00:07:09.849> the
