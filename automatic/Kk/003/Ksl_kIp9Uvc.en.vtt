 difference waking up in an environment 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.130
 natural with respect to waking up in the

 city ​​with stress with the hurry with 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.469

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.170
 to the little button to put the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.659

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.850
 a province that really something else does not 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.850
 I know but nature is too much for them 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.880

 where are you going 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.080
 what a big question about where are you going from 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.140
 where do we come from where are we going 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.600
 we are great existential questions 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.850
 Well, if I'm talking about soria and 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.190

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.030
 very athletic man and is a man who 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.640
 live life in a completely 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.040
 different after having overcome a 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.140
 cancer a person who has a lot to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.390
 teach others and that helps them live 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.010
 much better and says how long is 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.980

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.720
 Well look we are in the guard house 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.700

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.400
 lungs that has the one that has the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.080
 province was the guardian house as 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.260
 your own name indicates that is 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.729
 now it has changed a little bit but 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.800
 before you came here you were with the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.560

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.990
 chimney you have some sausages and others 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.220
 and it has been growing until this then 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.560
 is very well taken care of and that is a 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.450

 exercise well I do not think they do not 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.410
 exercise here is a sin because I'm 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.320
 here in the valonsadero mountain which is the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.420

 well very much popular athlete that 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.760
 use 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.209
 these circuits of many miles 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.790
 and for all tastes and qualities as well 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.450
 it's a matter of you taking the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.030
 shorts and good but before if I 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.370
 you allow a toast with beer and a 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.550
 good sports session a little if 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.580
 is always at the point later after 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.580
 If not good then here I start before 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.040
 you believe in a natural and ecological healthy uncle 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.770
 the best we can do at the beginning is 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.840
 put me in ecological mode is not ok 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.060
 let's see from here the button the subject 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.160
 the themes and choose from alico and we 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.200
 we put in ecological mode that is already 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
 so we'll evaluate you later to see if 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.500
 your driving is truly 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.330
 ecological, I'll try to do it well 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.730
 because I have also come to this moment 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.020
 to enjoy the car because it is 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.300
 charming very soft 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.760
 I'm here tense waiting for me to evaluate 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.560
 correctly of my ecological driving 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.470
 but that I put that I put good 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.120
 note you will get one of the drive from the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.850
 one and if you are really driving from 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.710
 ecological way the truth is that always 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.980
 driving through this kind of places and without 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.980
 doubt 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.050
 well this is the ride that goes by 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.450
 next to the duero 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.200
 I inspire in so many and so many 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.200
 machado 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.080
 and at the bottom of more terms the hermitage of 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.229
 san saturio which is the pattern of soria and 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.720
 a virgin full of pins and 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.970
 young girls come to look for their pin and 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.009
 if they find it, they marry the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.350
 promise that on the day they contract 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.979
 you announce they have to come and leave 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.979
 other endings 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.789
 go go so here you have your barracks 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.789
 general, yes, this is a passion 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:53.449
 big of my life where he helped people 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.610
 to know each other to relax and especially to 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.189
 through a fantastic tool that 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.560
 is the natal chart of the natal chart 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.689
 what an incredible way that the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.819
 people know their energies and their 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:08.270
 life missions their shadows their 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.730
 potentials and here I know 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.620
 site for my divine where we can 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.070
 help to get better because 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.390
 we all have a fantastic life that 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.660
 is waiting for us but we have to go out to 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.660
 your meeting 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.419
 hello oscar or how it is 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.419
 I have a news for you there may be 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:37.850
 refueled after hundreds and hundreds 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.590
 of kilometers I have reported but but 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.560
 well as he consumes I was not either 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.479
 marking 33 and pico liters per 100 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.580
 kilometers but good this this supposes 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.949
 less than a motorcycle, it's hard to believe it 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.290
 I'm just like you, I do not believe it 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.930
 this car is something incredible because nothing 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.810
 that you continue with your journey with your return 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.490
 of 40 and even within so many 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.130
 kilometers that do not see you again for 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.840
 the gas station that I hope until later 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.840
 can or a hug thanks
