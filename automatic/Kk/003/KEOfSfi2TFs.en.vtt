same time I'll give it I'll give it a
shot<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.729> guys<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.659> once

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
shot and see what you guys think so once

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.700 
shot and see what you guys think so once
again<00:01:42.960> watch<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.470> you're<00:01:43.590> wearing

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.719 

there's<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.689> three<00:01:49.110> sharp<00:01:49.470> calls<00:01:49.920> but

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
there's just three sharp calls but

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.130 
there's just three sharp calls but
obviously<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> takes<00:01:51.630> time<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.110> takes

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
obviously it takes time and it takes

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.830 
obviously it takes time and it takes
practice<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.880> bought<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> practice

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
walking through some distances but I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.800 
walking through some distances but I
found<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:08.879> really<00:02:09.149> effective<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.660> was

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
found it really really effective I was

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.339 
found it really really effective I was
shooting<00:02:10.080> mainly<00:02:10.349> over
