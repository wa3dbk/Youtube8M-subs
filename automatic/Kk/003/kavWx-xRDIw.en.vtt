my<00:01:41.280> own<00:01:41.310> tutorial<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.750> i<00:01:43.049> was

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
my own tutorial is because i was

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.780 
my own tutorial is because i was
watching<00:01:43.860> other<00:01:43.979> tutorials<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.729> they

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
watching other tutorials and they

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
watching other tutorials and they
weren't<00:01:44.939> being<00:01:45.180> very<00:01:45.329> helpful<00:01:45.869> because<00:01:46.110> i

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
weren't being very helpful because i

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.740

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
to go launch your custom map and I will

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:58.999 
to go launch your custom map and I will
be<00:06:52.349> doing<00:06:52.499> a<00:06:52.949> let's<00:06:53.279> play<00:06:53.669> of<00:06:53.699> this<00:06:57.680> Mac<00:06:58.680> if

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 
be doing a let's play of this Mac if

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:00.920 
be doing a let's play of this Mac if
it's<00:06:59.669> good<00:06:59.909> I<00:07:00.089> haven't<00:07:00.330> actually<00:07:00.479> fired<00:07:00.839> it

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
it's good I haven't actually fired it

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.499 
it's good I haven't actually fired it
that<00:07:01.050> much<00:07:01.229> and<00:07:01.729> then<00:07:02.729> it'll<00:07:03.149> probably<00:07:03.360> just

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
that much and then it'll probably just

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:05.149 
that much and then it'll probably just
rename<00:07:04.080> survive<00:07:04.409> one<00:07:04.589> will<00:07:04.709> probably<00:07:04.979> be<00:07:05.069> at
