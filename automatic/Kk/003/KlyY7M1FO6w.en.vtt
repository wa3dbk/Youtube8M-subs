 I bring you the game zone setup and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.379
 my area basically in my room 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.419
 because there is no play area is that the 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.730
 zone of the game is like half room 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.430
 directly and the bed would already be the other 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.440
 and the closet and something else is already 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.270
 there the room ends but good of 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.800
 I bring it to you so that the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.960
 see to somehow be more 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.520
 transparent with you I am a friend 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.120
 the room and hopefully one day you can 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.920
 be here I do not know how to talk and play all 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.780
 together it would be somehow enjoy 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.970
 so guys let's go there 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.280
 to see if we go for it let's see 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.770
 we have here the imac we have an imac of 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.470
 21 inches with your editing program 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.630
 here we have what to record put the micro 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.250
 give it to record we have the line of 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.750
 time that helps me to go back in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.090
 the time if a game was not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.150
 recording going back and you would see that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.490
 how I was playing and good 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.740
 the program of editing is perfect 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.140
 simple to download very everything very 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.820
 mechanical and I'm really glad that what 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 so be it because it gives me a lot 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.490
 life because I really have so many 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.410
 things to do and it's a tremendous burden 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.050
 if I had to complicate myself when editing 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.360
 good to edit not because then I go to 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.030
 program there is mobile that would be this 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.190
 here it would be this one here this 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.170
 little star but this helps me 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.460
 record and then already edited it and all that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.110
 I know it takes me longer but 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.720
 well at least the time to record but 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.080
 now then we have here the sims 3 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.360

 ds I have the mind in 3ds was a card 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.520
 of the game as you will all have, I suppose 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.380
 it's a classic not to buy well from 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.380
 some way is a classic and good here 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 I have a passport, the phone that I have 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.900

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.970

 quite and you see the change I do not know is like 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.610
 a change of saying wow uncle is a Syrian 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.860
 I do not know it's a brutal change so I do not know 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.170
 I think you'll like them, you'll laugh 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.420

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.850
 setup but good here you see it 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.840

 they put them in room so they smell 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.590
 Well, there are many hours playing and 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.840

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.050

 headset but I have here the micro and what 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.660
 It happened then that some videos will be 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.120

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.160

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.830
