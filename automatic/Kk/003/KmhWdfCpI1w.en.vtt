00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:11.900
 so people today we try the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:16.009
 half of 150 kilos and let's see 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.009
 how much to repeat when the sheep 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.910
 OK 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:44.670
 okay a 20 repetitions was that or 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:44.670
 rather a 20 half so the 22 x 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 10 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.720
 10a and here again the same plus 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.680
 rod 50 kilos 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.450
 Who is this is unfortunately a kind 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.300
 oblique bank because I press such a 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.960
 you know how well you can do it 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.960
 to get away 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.230
 I have to do this somehow best 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 saw off 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.650
 So get away with it really 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.270
 somehow create more repetitions 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:44.459
 because as I said I've done so 21.5 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:47.400
 just repetitions means almost 22x 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.410
 if he were too shallow bank I would have 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.830
 easy 50 kilo the half from 125 to 30 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.730
 time I could have done easily, therefore, 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.730
 I'm not making any progress here 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.260
 What does that mean, I have to somehow 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.050
 try that the bank cut off 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.620
 and how so far or so I ran there 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:16.070
 then he wants to press clean as 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:23.090
 said a 20 repetitions almost 22 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:25.790
 or that was almost 22 because 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.500
 Unfortunately 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.780
 normally keeps to the weights also 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.970
 you can stand out from it repetitions 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.560
 and then do it 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.150
 but then I do not have you here now 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.269
 Done because he was at the lever 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.880
 Here is so high this way is so high 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:46.860
 So that counts as 22 but say 21 times 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.920
 I look this shit off me more 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.610
 Repetitions create but as I said 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.959
 not bad either 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.790
 That little bank was like that 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.450
 you know, HÃ¶rmann goes the harder 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.959
 will that 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:05.250
 The deeper is the easier the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:07.040
 nevertheless with 50 kilo over 20 of the or 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.349
 English 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.739
 and if it were flat bank I would have 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.340
 relaxed 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:17.390
 somehow so no idea 30 created 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.390
 Until next time
