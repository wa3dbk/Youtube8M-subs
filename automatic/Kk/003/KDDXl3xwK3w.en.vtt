00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
wide that's where I start forming it

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.389 
wide that's where I start forming it
over<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.600> openings<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:53.979> give<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.340> an

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
over the openings and I give it an

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.240 
over the openings and I give it an
overlap<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:54.880> uh<00:01:55.119> about<00:01:56.049> a<00:01:56.110> 5/8<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.770> an<00:01:56.890> inch<00:01:57.009> or

half<00:01:57.429> inch<00:01:57.700> on<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.890> side<00:02:00.130> nor<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.850> rolled<00:02:01.179> that

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
half inch on the side nor I rolled that

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.289 
half inch on the side nor I rolled that
over<00:02:01.659> by<00:02:01.810> using<00:02:02.039> this<00:02:03.039> tool<00:02:03.369> here<00:02:03.670> well

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
over by using this tool here well

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.880 
over by using this tool here well
actually<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:04.659> is<00:02:04.720> like<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.200> make<00:02:05.380> your<00:02:05.770> own

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
actually this is like to make your own

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.430 
actually this is like to make your own
screen<00:02:06.280> frame<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:07.569> I<00:02:07.630> use<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:07.990> rolling

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
screen frame and then I use this rolling

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.589 
screen frame and then I use this rolling
tool<00:02:08.649> I'll<00:02:08.920> put<00:02:09.099> it<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.190> there<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.640> easy<00:02:10.269> way

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
tool I'll put it in there and easy way

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.500 
tool I'll put it in there and easy way
to<00:02:11.610> start<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.840> get<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.080> nice<00:02:14.849> right<00:02:15.849> angle<00:02:15.880> or

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
to start to get a nice right angle or

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.979 
to start to get a nice right angle or
our<00:02:16.720> fold<00:02:17.049> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> screen<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.810> is

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
our fold on the screen and this is

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.990 
our fold on the screen and this is
actually<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.349> cut<00:02:20.830> off<00:02:20.980> piece<00:02:21.280> but<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.640> can<00:02:21.760> see

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
actually a cut off piece but you can see

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.339 
actually a cut off piece but you can see
that<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:24.010> know<00:02:24.130> de<00:02:24.640> nice<00:02:25.170> finished<00:02:26.170> little

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
that you know de nice finished little

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.289 
that you know de nice finished little
piece<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:26.890> relatively<00:02:27.549> stiff<00:02:27.880> its

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
piece and it's relatively stiff its

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.110 
piece and it's relatively stiff its
malleable<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.280> pretty<00:02:30.459> much<00:02:30.549> form<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.000> on

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
malleable so you pretty much form it on

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.990 
malleable so you pretty much form it on
there<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:31.569> just<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.470> duct<00:02:32.650> tape<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:33.069> and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
there and then just a duct tape on and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.690 
there and then just a duct tape on and
push<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.110> duct<00:02:35.260> tape<00:02:35.620> down<00:02:35.920> good<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:36.549> in

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
push the duct tape down good so it's in

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.479 
push the duct tape down good so it's in
a<00:02:36.760> good<00:02:36.940> contact<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:40.950> plastic<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
a good contact with a plastic and the

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.620 
a good contact with a plastic and the
screening<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.340> looks<00:02:45.630> perfectly

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
screening and it looks perfectly

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.390 
screening and it looks perfectly
acceptable<00:02:47.019> from<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.380> outside<00:02:47.709> as<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.250> can

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
acceptable from the outside as you can

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.660 
acceptable from the outside as you can
see<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.930> maybe<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:51.130> funky<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.579> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
see and maybe a little funky on the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.380 
see and maybe a little funky on the
insulation<00:02:53.819> it'll<00:02:54.819> be<00:02:54.940> fine

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
insulation it'll be fine

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.229 
insulation it'll be fine
for<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.870> while<00:02:56.079> if<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.130> does<00:02:57.700> start<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.030> come<00:02:58.209> off

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
for a while if it does start to come off

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.759 
for a while if it does start to come off
the<00:02:58.510> duct<00:02:58.660> tape<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.019> can<00:02:59.140> always<00:02:59.260> put<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.650> new

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
the duct tape you can always put on new

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.680 
the duct tape you can always put on new
duct<00:03:00.010> tape<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:00.400> use<00:03:00.639> this<00:03:00.819> goop<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.389> kind<00:03:01.660> of

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
duct tape or use this goop to kind of

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.170 
duct tape or use this goop to kind of
secure<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.170> duct<00:03:02.380> tape<00:03:02.639> but<00:03:03.639> I<00:03:03.850> think<00:03:04.060> it'll

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
secure the duct tape but I think it'll

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.550 
secure the duct tape but I think it'll
last<00:03:04.359> pretty<00:03:04.600> good<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.400> that's<00:03:06.760> your

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
last pretty good so that's your

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.009 
last pretty good so that's your
remediation<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.739> won't<00:03:08.950> call<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.340> mod<00:03:09.940> as<00:03:10.870> I

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
remediation I won't call it a mod as I

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.360 
remediation I won't call it a mod as I
hear<00:03:11.260> all<00:03:11.380> these<00:03:11.530> Cougars<00:03:11.859> calling

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
hear all these Cougars calling

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.780 
hear all these Cougars calling
everything<00:03:12.579> I<00:03:12.819> doing<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:14.459> it's<00:03:15.459> more<00:03:15.639> like

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
everything I doing that it's more like

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.430 
everything I doing that it's more like
your<00:03:16.269> fixing<00:03:16.720> which<00:03:16.870> should<00:03:17.049> have<00:03:17.139> been<00:03:17.260> fixed

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
your fixing which should have been fixed

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.479 
your fixing which should have been fixed
in<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.709> first<00:03:17.950> place

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
in the first place

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.949 
in the first place
which<00:03:18.880> bridge<00:03:19.120> has<00:03:19.239> been<00:03:19.329> done<00:03:19.510> for<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.840> in

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
which bridge has been done for you in

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.500 
which bridge has been done for you in
the<00:03:20.019> fixed<00:03:20.260> place<00:03:20.760> that's<00:03:21.760> why<00:03:21.940> it's<00:03:22.090> called<00:03:22.269> a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
the fixed place that's why it's called a

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.140 
the fixed place that's why it's called a
remediation<00:03:25.019> one<00:03:26.019> more<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.290> go<00:03:27.060> takes<00:03:28.060> a

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
remediation one more to go takes a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.809 
remediation one more to go takes a
little<00:03:28.269> while<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.600> do<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:30.519> it's<00:03:30.639> worth

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
little while to do this but it's worth

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.300 
little while to do this but it's worth
it<00:03:31.319> incidentally<00:03:32.319> if<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:32.829> don't<00:03:33.069> have<00:03:33.190> these

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
it incidentally if you don't have these

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.979 
it incidentally if you don't have these
screened<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.030> equivalent<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.540> having<00:03:34.600> a
