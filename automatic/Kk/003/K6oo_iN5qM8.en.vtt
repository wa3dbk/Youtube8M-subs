00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.480
 some great red news but for 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.490
 this year starting the race line 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.340
 good morning everyone , this year we go out 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.470
 with a new line race is called hero 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.179
 we have a new present with between 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.429
 a new graphic a new technology e 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.550
 prop bet we can see on these 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:37.090
 here we found about ninety 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.030
 technology also on the attack that 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.600
 we say with much less force to 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.100
 regulate it almost 60 percent less than 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.350
 strength to regulate it and performance 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.840
 very interesting and lightness 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.460
 I definitely recommend you try it e 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.490
 something more about the structure this is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.520
 a structure that you present as yes 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.200
 down from the race world we tried it 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.300
 with the race pro mode below was with i 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.340
 our athletes 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.850
 basically it consists of one in one 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.100
 split ram material that allows the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.150
 ski to enter well into the curve and to 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 people to put things 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.230
 the flexibility of skiing between inter 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.970
 parma and inter ok news but not 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.990
 end up here because also on the line 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.030
 lower than the race 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 we have an important both adam also 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.110
 an important innovation on our new one 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.360
 experience line this is the new one 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.720
 xperia line practically on this one 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.300
 line 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.180
 we represent the line is part of the 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.970
 category or the mountain view ours 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.430
 partnership with audi I say is the 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.350
 our allroad ski is practically there 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.550
 ship and we quietly use to go 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.170
 on the track but when we find some 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.880
 different snow conditions we can 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.750
 quietly use them to have 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.850
 excellent for the heart 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.100
 the novelty this year is the arts 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.240
 practically this technological novelty 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.490
 that we had included on our line 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.370
 single freeride and we also brought 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.720
 this line will make the ski lighter 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.880
 lower a little hoarse so that it is one 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.680
 easier to use skis that I take more 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.360
 quickly push ok though the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.740
