00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
get host a lot more than I do my

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.290 
get host a lot more than I do my
connection<00:00:28.410> isn't<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.859> greatest<00:00:29.300> display

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
connection isn't the greatest display

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.609 
connection isn't the greatest display
which<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.570> might<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.439> pretty

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
which you might think it's pretty

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.580 
which you might think it's pretty
average<00:00:31.859> 15<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.030> 20<00:00:33.329> up<00:00:33.510> our<00:00:33.719> download<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
average 15 to 20 up our download and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.799 
average 15 to 20 up our download and
about<00:00:35.059> 1.5<00:00:36.059> upload<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.579> 50<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:39.059> 60<00:00:39.540> ms<00:00:40.140> ping

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
about 1.5 upload with a 50 to 60 ms ping

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.060 
about 1.5 upload with a 50 to 60 ms ping
so<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> greatest<00:00:43.350> connection

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
so it's not the greatest connection

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.670 
so it's not the greatest connection
whole<00:00:44.250> time<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.870> it's<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.379> enough<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
whole time but it's not it's enough that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400 
whole time but it's not it's enough that
I<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.280> host<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:48.420> host<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:49.020> like

what<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.790> going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.329> black<00:01:57.659> ops

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
what it's going to be like in black ops

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.039 
what it's going to be like in black ops
2<00:01:58.020> no<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.770> knows<00:01:58.920> yet<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.659> opens<00:02:00.659> balance

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
2 no one knows yet so opens balance

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.940 
2 no one knows yet so opens balance
though<00:02:01.610> not<00:02:02.610> getting<00:02:03.049> dedicated<00:02:04.049> servers<00:02:04.770> so

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
though not getting dedicated servers so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.289 
though not getting dedicated servers so
we're<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.280> probably<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.180> host

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
we're going to probably going to be host

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.389 
we're going to probably going to be host
advantage<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.960> black<00:02:07.140> ops<00:02:07.380> 2

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
advantage and black ops 2

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.449 
advantage and black ops 2
but<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:09.879> got<00:02:10.149> off<00:02:10.360> after<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:10.959> game<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> I

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
but I got off after this game so I

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.800 
but I got off after this game so I
didn't<00:02:12.670> have<00:02:12.790> any<00:02:12.970> more<00:02:13.150> games<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.450> play<00:02:13.510> as

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
didn't have any more games to play as

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.020 
didn't have any more games to play as
host<00:02:14.310> which<00:02:15.310> would<00:02:15.430> have<00:02:15.489> been<00:02:15.549> nice<00:02:15.790> because

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
host which would have been nice because

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.130 
host which would have been nice because
it<00:02:16.180> probably<00:02:16.299> got<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> got<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.689> few<00:02:16.840> more<00:02:16.959> game

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
it probably got I got a few more game

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.539 
it probably got I got a few more game
plays<00:02:17.379> in<00:02:17.590> which<00:02:17.709> i<00:02:18.040> think<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:19.120> i<00:02:19.269> had<00:02:19.299> got<00:02:19.659> host

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
plays in which i think if i had got host

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.819 
plays in which i think if i had got host
how<00:02:21.549> many<00:02:21.730> times<00:02:21.939> my<00:02:22.120> side<00:02:22.299> houses<00:02:22.689> home<00:02:23.530> Jerry

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
how many times my side houses home Jerry

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.369 
how many times my side houses home Jerry
but<00:02:23.980> if<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.159> had<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.780> some<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.959> times<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.290> I

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
but if I had it some of the times that I

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.860 
but if I had it some of the times that I
played<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.769> jungle<00:02:27.239> because<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.480> chopper

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
played on jungle because the chopper

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.009 
played on jungle because the chopper
gunners<00:02:29.109> are<00:02:29.319> amazing<00:02:29.890> on<00:02:30.010> host<00:02:30.329> if<00:02:31.329> I<00:02:31.659> had<00:02:31.810> got

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
gunners are amazing on host if I had got

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.300 
gunners are amazing on host if I had got
it<00:02:32.170> if<00:02:32.290> you'd<00:02:32.439> like<00:02:32.680> some<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> times<00:02:33.189> I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
it if you'd like some of the times I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.470 
it if you'd like some of the times I
played<00:02:33.489> on<00:02:33.609> jungle<00:02:33.909> against<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.269> players

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
played on jungle against the players

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.210 
played on jungle against the players
some<00:02:35.019> of<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.140> players<00:02:35.319> i<00:02:35.500> played<00:02:35.709> against<00:02:36.099> i

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
some of the players i played against i

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.710 
some of the players i played against i
think<00:02:36.459> i<00:02:36.519> could<00:02:36.579> have<00:02:36.819> broke<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.239> ground<00:02:37.540> war

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
think i could have broke the ground war

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.929 
think i could have broke the ground war
record<00:02:38.049> one<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.379> these<00:02:38.470> times<00:02:38.730> four<00:02:39.730> kills

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
record one of these times four kills

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.479 
record one of these times four kills
which<00:02:40.299> i<00:02:40.420> think<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:40.659> like<00:02:40.950> 160<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.129> don't<00:02:42.400> know

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
which i think it's like 160 I don't know

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.210 
which i think it's like 160 I don't know
159<00:02:43.359> something<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:44.409> that<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.769> could<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.040> think

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
159 something like that I could I think

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.099 
159 something like that I could I think
I<00:02:45.280> could<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.519> broken<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.909> if<00:02:46.030> I've<00:02:46.510> had<00:02:46.750> like

thinks he has all under control but I

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.200 
thinks he has all under control but I
thinking<00:05:05.470> there's<00:05:06.370> like<00:05:06.490> less<00:05:06.790> than<00:05:06.970> ten

thinking there's like less than ten

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.940 
thinking there's like less than ten
episodes<00:05:07.420> left<00:05:07.960> so<00:05:08.170> I'm<00:05:08.230> thinking<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.770> don't
