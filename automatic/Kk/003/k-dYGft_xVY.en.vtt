00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
how how unusual is this kind of service

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.900 
how how unusual is this kind of service
what<00:07:27.440> causes<00:07:27.680> it<00:07:27.980> well<00:07:28.190> you<00:07:28.310> know<00:07:28.400> what<00:07:28.610> we<00:07:28.700> had

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:28.910 
what causes it well you know what we had

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.970 
what causes it well you know what we had
is<00:07:29.150> we<00:07:29.420> had<00:07:29.450> area<00:07:29.960> low<00:07:30.050> pressure<00:07:30.320> just<00:07:30.650> setting

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:30.980 
is we had area low pressure just setting

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.710 
is we had area low pressure just setting
up<00:07:31.100> towards<00:07:31.520> the<00:07:31.670> east<00:07:31.880> and<00:07:32.270> won't<00:07:32.450> we<00:07:32.540> head

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 
up towards the east and won't we head

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.810 
up towards the east and won't we head
down<00:07:32.870> towards<00:07:33.200> us<00:07:33.260> up<00:07:33.470> the<00:07:33.920> Tradewinds<00:07:34.520> and

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:34.820 
down towards us up the Tradewinds and

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.120 
down towards us up the Tradewinds and
the<00:07:34.880> problem<00:07:35.300> is<00:07:35.480> wouldn't<00:07:36.230> a<00:07:36.260> plane<00:07:36.620> this<00:07:37.070> is

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130 
the problem is wouldn't a plane this is

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.560 
the problem is wouldn't a plane this is
very<00:07:37.400> likely<00:07:37.640> what<00:07:37.910> happened<00:07:38.330> when<00:07:38.450> it

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570 
very likely what happened when it

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.890 
very likely what happened when it
started<00:07:38.930> to<00:07:39.080> ascend<00:07:39.440> from<00:07:39.710> 36,000<00:07:40.640> to<00:07:40.970> 38,000

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:41.900 
started to ascend from 36,000 to 38,000

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.960 
started to ascend from 36,000 to 38,000
feet<00:07:42.050> what<00:07:42.290> we<00:07:42.410> had<00:07:42.620> was<00:07:42.860> directional<00:07:43.790> wind

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:43.970 
feet what we had was directional wind

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.730 
feet what we had was directional wind
shear<00:07:44.210> and<00:07:44.300> what<00:07:44.480> is<00:07:44.630> that<00:07:44.810> it<00:07:45.140> basically

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
shear and what is that it basically

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.590 
shear and what is that it basically
means<00:07:46.010> when<00:07:46.370> you<00:07:46.550> get<00:07:46.670> shear<00:07:47.060> when<00:07:47.360> you<00:07:47.450> get<00:07:47.570> a

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:47.600 
means when you get shear when you get a

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.630 
means when you get shear when you get a
change<00:07:47.960> in<00:07:48.170> height<00:07:48.470> and<00:07:48.770> that<00:07:49.160> looks<00:07:49.490> like

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:49.640 
change in height and that looks like

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.490 
change in height and that looks like
likely<00:07:49.910> with<00:07:50.210> what<00:07:50.390> happened<00:07:50.840> as<00:07:50.990> we<00:07:51.170> just<00:07:51.380> see

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:51.500 
likely with what happened as we just see

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.320 
likely with what happened as we just see
that<00:07:51.620> severe<00:07:51.950> turbulence<00:07:52.190> but<00:07:52.640> area<00:07:53.240> low

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330 
that severe turbulence but area low

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.030 
that severe turbulence but area low
pressure<00:07:53.600> up<00:07:53.810> towards<00:07:54.200> Northeast<00:07:54.740> and<00:07:54.980> you

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.040 
pressure up towards Northeast and you

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.230 
pressure up towards Northeast and you
can<00:07:55.160> see<00:07:55.280> where<00:07:55.400> the<00:07:55.460> winds<00:07:55.670> are<00:07:55.790> going<00:07:56.060> right

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 
can see where the winds are going right

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.630 
can see where the winds are going right
through<00:07:56.300> there<00:07:56.690> so<00:07:57.320> that<00:07:57.650> is<00:07:57.920> likely<00:07:58.220> what

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:58.640 
through there so that is likely what

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.090 
through there so that is likely what
caused<00:07:58.970> that<00:07:59.560> incident<00:08:00.560> what<00:08:00.650> we<00:08:00.740> just<00:08:00.860> showed

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.100 
caused that incident what we just showed

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.830 
caused that incident what we just showed
you<00:08:01.160> on<00:08:01.520> the<00:08:01.550> video<00:08:01.880> and<00:08:02.120> that<00:08:02.240> package<00:08:02.570> coming

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 
you on the video and that package coming

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.500 
you on the video and that package coming
out<00:08:03.140> of<00:08:03.680> that<00:08:03.860> area<00:08:04.070> out<00:08:04.310> of<00:08:04.340> the<00:08:04.550> US<00:08:04.880> so<00:08:05.240> again

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:05.510 
out of that area out of the US so again

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.150 
out of that area out of the US so again
certainly<00:08:06.260> could<00:08:06.410> have<00:08:06.500> been<00:08:06.620> worse<00:08:06.800> we're

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:07.160 
certainly could have been worse we're

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.740 
certainly could have been worse we're
happy<00:08:07.370> to<00:08:07.460> hear<00:08:07.550> that<00:08:07.610> everybody<00:08:08.060> is<00:08:08.510> doing

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:08.750 
happy to hear that everybody is doing

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.410 
happy to hear that everybody is doing
okay
