 does the sweetest thing and that you then see the interviewer 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.780
 and for a television interview that you also think of the eviction 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.470
 look into your eyes and be surprised 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.160
 is the number of different places 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.939

 selects what you use for that a good in tehran is an interior in which 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.900
 the interviewer 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.900
 is genuinely interested in this interview series 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.900
 and that also stands above and it itself 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.730
 after an interview it is only really successful if you are genuinely interested 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.000
 make sure you don't find someone between you or you in a bank branch j 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.980
 who tried not meant fight 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.160
 but he deeply tries to fathom the other person

 robber to bring circular saw 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.730
 about to mucilage 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.650
 the bite are as you would talk to 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.590
 Leijsen speak to someone who would like to decorate in the cafe 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.460
 because you really like it 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.619
 and not as deep as you have to splash 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.219
 Imagine being interviewed and you are sitting in front of someone every year 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.179
 with skin and hair understand well that's that is the greatest charm that you can 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.479
 undergo 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.759
 yes that increases the chance that you might want to go against your own 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.969
 expose 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.919
 it's just listening I find when interviewing 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.419
 that you do ask 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.279
 do participate in the sense that you might prepare them here and there and 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.119
 but most preparation requires asking for an interview 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.579
 I make sure I know a lot the person in question 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.099
 it is really only about the answers which is the best answer 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.949
 only the third or fourth answer went through the light when the first answered 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.519
 You know that you hear that you must ensure that you are in third or fourth place 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.009
 answer on certain subject comes that is essential a good interview 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.859
 and if you noticed someone like that 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.169
 the real 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.409
 is fair 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.099
 and what has been thought is being said 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.549
 that said 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.170
 that human rights own bed that people trained a lot in the past show 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.189
 that really continue 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.089
 That says Harry is struggling with it 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.089
 there can really be suspects again 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.379
 you would in veendam 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.419
 then that is true 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.259
 the viewers listeners and readers 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.740
 that can do something with it 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.300
 I think I can see my place of it myself
