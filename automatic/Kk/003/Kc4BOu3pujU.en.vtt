00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.520
 high heat 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:51.560
 then I reduce the heat I fold from above 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:54.920
 tomatoes close the lid and leave 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.140
 minutes to sing tomatoes in five minutes 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.210
 need to deliver and wait while they 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.470

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.420
 hesitated further close and let them 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.910
 continue to stew in general then if you 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.579

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.570

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.460

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.800
 [music] 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.310
 chopped tomatoes load back 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.310
 by weight 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:47.040

 any meat for watering began to boil 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.300
 I reduce the heat by closing the lid and 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.950
 leave to stew for 10 15 minutes 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.360
