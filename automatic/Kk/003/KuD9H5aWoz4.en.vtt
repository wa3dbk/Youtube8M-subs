glary<00:02:29.599> utilities<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.849> I<00:02:31.849> have<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.209> tutorial<00:02:32.630> on

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
glary utilities and I have a tutorial on

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.900 
glary utilities and I have a tutorial on
that<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.410> can<00:02:33.560> check<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.770> out

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
that you can check that out

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.480 
that you can check that out
just<00:02:35.480> look<00:02:35.630> for<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.930> on<00:02:36.020> my<00:02:36.140> channel<00:02:36.560> okay

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
just look for it on my channel okay

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.120 
just look for it on my channel okay
basically<00:02:37.790> what<00:02:38.210> glary<00:02:38.510> would<00:02:38.780> do<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:40.010> were

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
basically what glary would do you were

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.510 
basically what glary would do you were
going<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:41.020> optimize<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.200> improve<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.830> you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
going to optimize and improve and you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.040 
going to optimize and improve and you
will<00:02:43.670> go<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:44.230> startup<00:02:45.230> manager<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:47.510> we're

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
will go to startup manager and we're

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.250 
will go to startup manager and we're
glad<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.130> what's<00:02:49.400> good<00:02:49.610> about<00:02:49.700> glary<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
glad and what's good about glary is it

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.110 
glad and what's good about glary is it
lets<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.590> know<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:52.280> know<00:02:52.400> what<00:02:52.670> program<00:02:53.090> is

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
lets you know you know what program is

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.510 
lets you know you know what program is
needed<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.260> what<00:02:54.590> program<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.070> really<00:02:55.340> don't

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
needed and what program you really don't

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.150 
needed and what program you really don't
need<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:57.050> higher<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.290> red<00:02:57.680> mark<00:02:57.950> let's

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
need it the higher the red mark let's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.570 
need it the higher the red mark let's
say<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.490> right<00:02:58.640> here<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.890> more<00:03:01.070> likely<00:03:01.430> you

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
say this right here the more likely you

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.330 
say this right here the more likely you
don't<00:03:01.850> really<00:03:02.060> need<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.590> if<00:03:03.590> it's<00:03:03.800> all<00:03:03.950> green

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
don't really need it if it's all green

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.050 
don't really need it if it's all green
it's<00:03:05.180> perfectly<00:03:05.740> okay<00:03:06.740> it<00:03:07.490> doesn't<00:03:07.850> really

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
it's perfectly okay it doesn't really

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.610 
it's perfectly okay it doesn't really
slow<00:03:08.360> your<00:03:08.510> computer<00:03:08.540> down<00:03:08.960> whatever<00:03:09.350> it's

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
slow your computer down whatever it's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.130 
slow your computer down whatever it's
starting<00:03:10.010> but<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.940> more<00:03:11.090> red<00:03:11.360> on<00:03:11.600> here<00:03:11.630> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
starting but the more red on here the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.080 
starting but the more red on here the
slower<00:03:12.410> your<00:03:12.680> startup<00:03:13.070> time<00:03:13.310> would<00:03:13.490> be<00:03:13.520> in

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
slower your startup time would be in

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.070 
slower your startup time would be in
other<00:03:14.300> words<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:17.360> find<00:03:17.690> out<00:03:17.780> more<00:03:18.020> about

and<00:05:09.229> in<00:05:09.379> here<00:05:09.680> on<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.949> performance<00:05:10.309> there's<00:05:10.699> a

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
and in here on the performance there's a

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.409 
and in here on the performance there's a
lot<00:05:10.939> of<00:05:10.969> stuff<00:05:11.300> that<00:05:11.419> you<00:05:11.599> could<00:05:11.749> take<00:05:11.930> off<00:05:13.419> to

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
you like to have on there but you do

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.139 
you like to have on there but you do
that<00:05:48.919> that'll<00:05:49.249> help<00:05:49.339> your<00:05:49.520> computer<00:05:49.939> run<00:05:50.120> a

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:50.149 
that that'll help your computer run a

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.899 
that that'll help your computer run a
little<00:05:50.330> bit<00:05:50.509> more<00:05:50.629> faster<00:05:51.110> as<00:05:51.199> well<00:05:51.909> but

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
little bit more faster as well but

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.610 
little bit more faster as well but
unfortunately<00:05:53.599> when<00:05:53.749> you<00:05:53.839> do<00:05:53.990> do<00:05:54.139> that<00:05:54.169> it

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
unfortunately when you do do that it

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.159 
unfortunately when you do do that it
does<00:05:55.129> take<00:05:55.430> some<00:05:55.759> of<00:05:55.909> that<00:05:55.939> you<00:05:56.149> know<00:05:56.270> cool<00:05:56.960> or

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
does take some of that you know cool or

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.950 
does take some of that you know cool or
neat<00:05:57.469> things<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:58.219> when<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:58.759> Vista<00:05:59.089> has<00:05:59.240> it

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
neat things that when the Vista has it

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.200 
neat things that when the Vista has it
gives<00:06:00.229> a<00:06:00.379> Texan<00:06:00.770> all<00:06:00.889> that<00:06:01.069> off<00:06:01.279> of<00:06:01.430> there<00:06:01.460> like

keep your computer running faster is

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:13.089 
keep your computer running faster is
always<00:06:11.330> do<00:06:11.479> your<00:06:11.599> defrag<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.800> stuff<00:06:12.979> like

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
always do your defrag and stuff like

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.399 
always do your defrag and stuff like
that<00:06:13.159> especially<00:06:13.430> if<00:06:13.729> you<00:06:13.819> have<00:06:13.849> XP<00:06:14.360> this<00:06:15.199> guy

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
that especially if you have XP this guy

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.170 
that especially if you have XP this guy
believe<00:06:15.860> that<00:06:16.159> you<00:06:16.520> know<00:06:16.580> it<00:06:16.759> normally

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
believe that you know it normally

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.989 
believe that you know it normally
automatically<00:06:17.959> does<00:06:18.139> it<00:06:18.259> on<00:06:18.379> its<00:06:18.409> own<00:06:18.789> but<00:06:19.789> you

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:19.999 
automatically does it on its own but you

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:21.760 
automatically does it on its own but you
have<00:06:20.120> a<00:06:20.149> laptop<00:06:20.449> or<00:06:20.810> something<00:06:21.110> like<00:06:21.169> that<00:06:21.229> you

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
have a laptop or something like that you

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.589 
have a laptop or something like that you
need<00:06:22.370> to<00:06:22.459> go<00:06:22.580> ahead<00:06:22.669> and<00:06:22.909> when<00:06:22.999> you're<00:06:23.149> defrag

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
need to go ahead and when you're defrag

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.779 
need to go ahead and when you're defrag
cuts<00:06:23.899> most<00:06:24.889> people<00:06:25.189> they<00:06:25.279> don't<00:06:25.399> leave<00:06:25.610> their

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
cuts most people they don't leave their

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.360 
cuts most people they don't leave their
laptops<00:06:26.270> on<00:06:26.860> twenty-four/seven<00:06:27.860> like<00:06:28.339> a

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
laptops on twenty-four/seven like a

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.999 
laptops on twenty-four/seven like a
desktop<00:06:28.849> computer<00:06:29.080> so<00:06:30.080> if<00:06:30.529> you<00:06:30.680> have<00:06:30.800> a<00:06:30.830> laptop

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
desktop computer so if you have a laptop

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.219 
desktop computer so if you have a laptop
and<00:06:31.580> you<00:06:32.089> always<00:06:32.270> turn<00:06:32.569> it<00:06:32.810> off<00:06:32.930> and<00:06:32.959> on

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
and you always turn it off and on

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:34.989 
and you always turn it off and on
because<00:06:34.009> you<00:06:34.219> know<00:06:34.310> you<00:06:34.370> don't<00:06:34.520> use<00:06:34.759> it<00:06:34.789> as

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:34.999 
because you know you don't use it as

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.290 
because you know you don't use it as
much<00:06:35.029> and<00:06:35.509> you're<00:06:35.599> putting<00:06:35.749> it<00:06:35.930> up<00:06:37.270> make<00:06:38.270> sure
