regime<00:00:09.420> as<00:00:09.980> you<00:00:10.980> can<00:00:11.099> see<00:00:11.250> there<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.519> a

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
regime as you can see there is a

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.430 
regime as you can see there is a
comparison<00:00:12.059> sheet<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:12.630> both<00:00:12.780> guns<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.290> we'll

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
comparison sheet for both guns and we'll

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.079 
comparison sheet for both guns and we'll
go<00:00:13.500> ahead<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.679> goes<00:00:13.860> over<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.519> advantages

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
go ahead and goes over some advantages

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.640 
go ahead and goes over some advantages
that<00:00:15.150> division<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.750> confluence<00:00:16.049> has<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.500> was<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
that division of confluence has it was a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.580 
that division of confluence has it was a
service<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.550> base<00:00:17.760> damage<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.300> 11<00:00:18.960> more

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
service for base damage it has 11 more

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.070 
service for base damage it has 11 more
base<00:00:19.830> damage<00:00:20.100> that's<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.880> body<00:00:21.119> shots<00:00:21.570> then

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
base damage that's like body shots then

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
base damage that's like body shots then
the<00:00:22.260> service<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.920> headshot<00:00:23.699> damage<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.090> has

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
the service and headshot damage it has

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.230 
the service and headshot damage it has
24<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> pretty<00:00:26.039> big<00:00:26.279> dip<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
24 which is a pretty big dip and that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.240 
24 which is a pretty big dip and that
can<00:00:27.420> change<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.080> know<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> lot<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.470> gunfights

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
can change you know a lot of gunfights

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.330 
can change you know a lot of gunfights
overall<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:31.109> what<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> service<00:00:32.040> really

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
overall and then what the service really

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.040 
overall and then what the service really
has<00:00:32.520> over<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.910> vision<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.360> confluence<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
has over the vision of confluence is the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.740 
has over the vision of confluence is the
rate<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> fire<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> course<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.790> has<00:00:35.969> less

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
rate of fire of course and it has less

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
rate of fire of course and it has less
range<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.380> has<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> lot<00:00:37.800> more<00:00:37.950> stability<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
range and has a lot more stability and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.030 
range and has a lot more stability and
the<00:00:39.030> reload<00:00:39.360> speed<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> same<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.890> can

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the reload speed is the same but you can

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
the reload speed is the same but you can
watch<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:41.399> videos<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.850> tried<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> compare

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
watch these videos I tried to compare

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.750 
watch these videos I tried to compare
them<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.140> match<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.520> same

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
them and match them up with the same

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.029 
them and match them up with the same
length<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.539> same<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.050> everything

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
length and the same you know everything

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.459 
length and the same you know everything
is<00:00:47.190> pretty<00:00:47.460> much<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.969> same<00:00:48.360> throughout<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
is pretty much the same throughout this

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.170 
is pretty much the same throughout this
whole<00:00:49.680> video<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> will<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.730> able<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
whole video so you will be able to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.569 
whole video so you will be able to
compare<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> guns<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.680> well<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.160> then

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
compare the guns very well and then

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.130 
compare the guns very well and then
throughout<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> end<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> video<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.750> can

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
throughout the end of the video you can

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410 
throughout the end of the video you can
you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.739> say<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.460> opinion<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.059> vision<00:00:57.360> of

the first segment is you'll be watching
is<00:01:10.049> actually<00:01:10.470> set<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.100> Rumble<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.760> way<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
is actually set up in Rumble this way I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
is actually set up in Rumble this way I
can<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.360> accurate<00:01:12.510> representation<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
can get an accurate representation of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.910 
can get an accurate representation of
each<00:01:14.700> gun<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.479> how<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> stats<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
each gun and how the stats are and the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
each gun and how the stats are and the
ranges<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.460> everything<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.360> boost

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
ranges and everything so I do not boost

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
ranges and everything so I do not boost
I<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.470> wanted<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.740> clear<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.100> guys<00:01:20.369> this

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
I just wanted to clear that up guys this

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700 
I just wanted to clear that up guys this
is<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> easiest<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.259> best<00:01:22.470> way<00:01:22.590> you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
is the easiest way and the best way you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
is the easiest way and the best way you
know<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> compare<00:01:23.729> each<00:01:23.880> video<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> same

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
know to compare each video at the same

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.679 
know to compare each video at the same
range<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:27.180> easier

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
range and it's you know it's just easier

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.620 
range and it's you know it's just easier
this<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> stats<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.600> instead<00:01:30.600> of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
this way to get the stats and instead of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
this way to get the stats and instead of
you<00:01:30.810> know<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:31.170> into<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.470> game<00:01:31.650> trying<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.070> get
