00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.150 

now<00:01:35.660> if<00:01:35.720> we<00:01:35.840> get<00:01:36.020> out<00:01:36.170> our<00:01:36.200> glasses<00:01:36.620> view<00:01:36.950> hold

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
now if we get out our glasses view hold

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.860 
now if we get out our glasses view hold
this<00:01:37.340> one<00:01:37.550> Davina<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:37.940> we're<00:01:38.180> gonna<00:01:38.270> pour<00:01:38.630> you

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
this one Davina and we're gonna pour you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.510 
this one Davina and we're gonna pour you
pour<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.260> into<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.650> glass<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:39.890> I'll<00:01:40.250> pour

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
pour that into that glass and I'll pour

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.640 
pour that into that glass and I'll pour
this<00:01:40.700> one<00:01:40.910> into<00:01:41.150> here<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.630> we're<00:01:42.380> showing

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
this one into here and we're showing

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.790 
this one into here and we're showing
that<00:01:43.180> when<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:44.390> use<00:01:44.660> a<00:01:44.690> blender<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.530> are

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
that when you use a blender you are

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.730 
that when you use a blender you are
actually<00:01:46.360> pulverizing<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.390> plant<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.680> you

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
actually pulverizing the plant so you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.760 
actually pulverizing the plant so you
are<00:01:49.130> effectively<00:01:50.110> outsourcing<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.260> chewing

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
are effectively outsourcing the chewing

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.000 
are effectively outsourcing the chewing
to<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.310> machine<00:01:52.790> when<00:01:53.690> you<00:01:53.840> use<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> juicer<00:01:54.560> if

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
to a machine when you use a juicer if

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.490 
to a machine when you use a juicer if
you<00:01:55.130> give<00:01:55.340> zero<00:01:55.640> in<00:01:55.910> on<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:56.300> one<00:01:56.540> here<00:01:57.020> okay

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
you give zero in on this one here okay

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.130 
you give zero in on this one here okay
there<00:01:57.710> you<00:01:57.740> go<00:01:57.979> there<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.460> can<00:01:59.060> see<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.840> what

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
there you go there you can see that what

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.170 
there you go there you can see that what
we're<00:02:00.320> taking<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:00.800> extracting<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.400> water<00:02:01.640> out

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
we're taking is extracting the water out

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.440 
we're taking is extracting the water out
from<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.750> cucumber<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.950> juicing<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.060> much

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
from the cucumber so juicing is much

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.260 
from the cucumber so juicing is much
more<00:02:05.750> like<00:02:05.990> drinking<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.800> blending<00:02:07.790> is<00:02:07.970> much

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
more like drinking and blending is much

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.300 
more like drinking and blending is much
more<00:02:08.509> like<00:02:08.750> eating<00:02:09.140> both<00:02:09.530> are<00:02:09.770> good<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.250> if

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
more like eating both are good and if

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.650 
more like eating both are good and if
you<00:02:10.399> said<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.700> me<00:02:10.729> which<00:02:11.000> one's<00:02:11.270> better<00:02:11.480> it's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
you said to me which one's better it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.000 
you said to me which one's better it's
kind<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:12.050> saying<00:02:12.290> well<00:02:12.620> what's<00:02:12.800> better

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
kind of like saying well what's better

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.830 
kind of like saying well what's better
than<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.250> drinking<00:02:13.700> or<00:02:13.880> eating<00:02:13.910> we<00:02:14.450> need<00:02:14.690> to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
than a drinking or eating we need to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.050 
than a drinking or eating we need to
drink<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.230> we<00:02:15.290> need<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:16.130> fiber<00:02:16.459> in<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.820> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
drink and we need the fiber in it and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.430 
drink and we need the fiber in it and
the<00:02:17.120> skins<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.660> things<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.290> this

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
the skins and things like that but this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.100 
the skins and things like that but this
is<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.680> direct<00:02:19.130> nutrient<00:02:20.060> into<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.720> system

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
is a direct nutrient into the system

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.960 
is a direct nutrient into the system
absolutely<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.760> concentration<00:02:22.760> of

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
absolutely the concentration of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.479 
absolutely the concentration of
nutrients<00:02:23.570> because<00:02:24.020> when<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.560> actually<00:02:24.800> look

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
nutrients because when you actually look

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.040 
nutrients because when you actually look
at<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.790> that's<00:02:26.150> gonna<00:02:26.300> be<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.540> lot<00:02:26.780> harder

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
at that that's gonna be a lot harder

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.050 
at that that's gonna be a lot harder
look<00:02:27.290> at<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.470> consistency<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.280> versus

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
look at the consistency of that versus

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.430 
look at the consistency of that versus
this<00:02:29.209> is<00:02:29.360> going<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.600> be<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> lot<00:02:29.930> harder<00:02:30.110> to

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
this is going to be a lot harder to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.920 
this is going to be a lot harder to
absorb<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.130> consume<00:02:31.880> more<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.480> it's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
absorb and consume more of this it's

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.500 
absorb and consume more of this it's
easier<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.920> get<00:02:34.070> lot<00:02:34.340> more<00:02:34.580> nutrient<00:02:35.150> density

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
easier to get lot more nutrient density

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.850 
easier to get lot more nutrient density
on<00:02:35.720> using<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.500> juicer

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
on using a juicer

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.410 
on using a juicer
okay<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:37.160> mix<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.700> up<00:02:37.820> is<00:02:37.940> what<00:02:38.060> you're<00:02:38.209> saying

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
okay so mix it up is what you're saying

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.970 
okay so mix it up is what you're saying
now<00:02:39.019> what<00:02:39.200> we've<00:02:39.320> done<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.500> we<00:02:39.680> have<00:02:39.769> brought

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
now what we've done is we have brought

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.560 
now what we've done is we have brought
in<00:02:40.130> some<00:02:40.160> risk<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.880> risk<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.269> called<00:02:41.480> the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
in some risk a risk of you called the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.960 
in some risk a risk of you called the
ABC<00:02:42.200> juice<00:02:42.470> okay<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.100> we're<00:02:43.400> gonna<00:02:43.519> fire<00:02:43.790> this

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
ABC juice okay and we're gonna fire this

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.460 
ABC juice okay and we're gonna fire this
up<00:02:44.150> now<00:02:44.360> we're<00:02:44.540> gonna<00:02:44.690> see<00:02:44.900> you're<00:02:45.170> gonna<00:02:45.260> give

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
up now we're gonna see you're gonna give

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.770 
up now we're gonna see you're gonna give
me<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> hand<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:47.840> take<00:02:48.140> these<00:02:48.290> very<00:02:48.769> simple

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
me a hand so you take these very simple

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.210 
me a hand so you take these very simple
and<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.019> do<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.260> plunging<00:02:51.650> or<00:02:51.799> I'll<00:02:51.980> do<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
and you do the plunging or I'll do the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.240 
and you do the plunging or I'll do the
feet<00:02:56.440> you're<00:02:57.440> gonna<00:02:57.560> put<00:02:57.769> some<00:02:57.920> pressure<00:02:58.070> on

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
feet you're gonna put some pressure on

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.340 
feet you're gonna put some pressure on
there<00:02:58.519> in<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.790> few<00:02:59.030> taps

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
there in a few taps

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.180 
there in a few taps
we<00:03:00.500> put<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:02.540> through<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:04.240> here<00:03:05.240> we<00:03:05.330> go

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
we put in through this here we go

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.620 
we put in through this here we go
patient<00:03:07.190> tears<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.910> our<00:03:08.060> face<00:03:08.330> Oh

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
patient tears and our face Oh

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.240 
patient tears and our face Oh
everything<00:03:11.630> goes<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.650> what<00:03:12.860> we<00:03:12.980> want<00:03:13.190> to

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
everything goes in and what we want to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.880 
everything goes in and what we want to
try<00:03:13.490> and<00:03:13.640> do<00:03:13.820> is<00:03:14.690> we<00:03:14.840> want<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.050> try<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.410> is

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
try and do is we want to try and it is

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.760 
try and do is we want to try and it is
much<00:03:16.130> color<00:03:16.580> I've<00:03:17.390> done<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> demo<00:03:18.140> one<00:03:18.410> here<00:03:18.590> for

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
much color I've done a demo one here for

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.640 
much color I've done a demo one here for
you<00:03:18.830> in<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.040> mason<00:03:19.400> jar<00:03:19.610> what<00:03:19.940> do<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.090> say

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.320 

we've<00:03:24.650> got<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:24.800> be<00:03:24.950> usually<00:03:25.550> use<00:03:25.910> an<00:03:26.030> apron

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330
