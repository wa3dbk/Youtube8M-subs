for example manner match well back for

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.690 
for example manner match well back for
like<00:01:12.780> 2<00:01:13.020> million<00:01:13.229> coins<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:14.280> he's<00:01:14.460> first

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
like 2 million coins when he's first

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.760 
like 2 million coins when he's first
released<00:01:15.090> which<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:16.110> he<00:01:16.229> probably<00:01:16.439> would

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
released which is what he probably would

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.070 
released which is what he probably would
have<00:01:16.920> gone<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:18.090> said<00:01:18.420> he's<00:01:18.600> been<00:01:18.780> kept

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
have gone for but said he's been kept

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
have gone for but said he's been kept
from<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.979> 200<00:01:21.320> 282<00:01:22.340> 420<00:01:23.340> k<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.580> that's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
from I think 200 282 420 k so that's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.249 
from I think 200 282 420 k so that's
what<00:01:24.000> they've<00:01:24.150> kept<00:01:24.360> well<00:01:24.570> back<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> guys

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
what they've kept well back to guys

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.289 
what they've kept well back to guys
