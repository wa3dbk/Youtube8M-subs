00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.529
 I will disassemble the drain in my case, I just have it 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.339
 I will cut in half why I leave 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.100

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:40.010
 rich aroma and taste meanwhile 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:43.750
 I'll put the boiling water for the marinade a little bit 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.550
 I salt I added half a teaspoon 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.149

 bay leaf and 2 juniper berries 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.590
 continue to cut plums in order to 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.789
 cook pickled plum 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.280
 better to use varieties 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:18.550
 strong will not be very soft a little 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.849
 need to take not matured if u 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.550
 so I have already boiled marinade 

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:27.700
 it's time to add vinegar to the marinade 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.700
 take off the stove 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.690
 adding vinegar forty-fifty grams 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.929
 then I'll add the plum and then I will 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.920
 spread the can 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.920
 look how beautiful it turns out 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.140
 and it will be delicious believe me why I don't 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.150
 I boil because then I will 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.330
 pasteurize pickled plum 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.950
 in convection so we while she insist 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.010
 I will add to the jar 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.010
 dill inflorescence 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:14.130
 like this a sheet of horseradish is for flavor 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.680
 savory taste 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.190
 Now I will quietly spread 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.130
 plum and put on force to be thrust 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.540
 literally 10 15 minutes is very pleasant 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.520
 the aroma comes from the badian from the clove from 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.520
 bay leaf and of course the ebb 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:52.050
 cinnamon close the jar and now I drain 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.840
 I clean pasteurize here in such 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.270
 convection oven if you do not have such a house 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.000
 grill nothing terrible and pasteurized 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.650
 its preparation of the usual traditional 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.480
 in the old way that is, put 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.220
 jar in a pot of boiling water but 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.510
 be sure to put a cloth to 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:16.070
 the bank does not burst here is enough for me 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.070
 temperature of 160 degrees for ten minutes 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.620
 so ten minutes have passed i'm neat 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.600
 I take out the bank because it is after 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.200
 pasteurization is very hot to keep such 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.830
 pickled pleasant plum can be up to 1 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.570
 of the year 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.110
 at room temperature and in 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.110
