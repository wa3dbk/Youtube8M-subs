00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:19.739
 [Music] 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.050
 hello how about friends this time 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.180
 I bring a new customization for 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.010
 our android devices this 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.689
 customization practically the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.880
 we can do on any device 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.890
 since we do not need a version of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.360
 Android so recent so we can 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.460
 do with any launcher that we 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.190
 allow to change the icons whether new 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.140
 launcher to dw launcher or other so I 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.580
 I will use the nova launcher all 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.710
 files and applications that 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.199
 We will need to leave them as always 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.970
 in my blog so let's start 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.980
 first to our file explorer 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.980
 to install the applications that 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.640
 card so here we look for the folder 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.140
 called cell in the basement ccw which 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.360
 we should have downloaded it already 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.000
 previously and that is where we have the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.530
 files that we need we select 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.300
 one of the files 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.790
 in my case, select the weather 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.770
 we wait for him to upload the file and a 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.990
 Once we load, we touch on the screen 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.850
 so that our widget appears and 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.330
 now we just resize it and what 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.330
 we accommodate 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.860
 once we have finished changing them 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.120
 and the other pack of icons that I'll leave you 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.460
 they will be like these 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.470
 if we leave more than one desk 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.330
 we can put some other vide that we 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.520
 like or put some apps of which 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.890
 more we use as in my case and change them 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:34.460
 the icon 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:36.919
 [Music] 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.569
 If you like, you can also change the 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.819
 icon to the apps in your drawer 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.979
 applications but I'll leave them like this already 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.780
 we just need to customize the bar 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.210
 notifications and our list will be 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.310
 personalization for that we open our 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.289
 application called cell in voter dels 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.539
 in which we installed in the beginning 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.610
 will quickly load the yellow bar and 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:57.710
 will tell us that the theme has been installed well 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:01.300
 that we can go out and now we open the 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:04.360
 super status bar application 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.159
 we go to topics we look for the topic that 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.770
 we just installed and we mark the 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:12.580
 box of our subject we go back and 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:15.009
 now we activate our application 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.930
 as you see, our bar has already changed 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:18.890
 status and notifications now we 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.070
 we go out and we go to the adjustments 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.880
 [Music] 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:25.950
 accessibility we select super status 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.840
 vaart we turn on and in the window that we 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.060
 will appear we will accept 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.860
 we have to do this because if not 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.990
 we do this will not show us the 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.270
 notifications in our good bar 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.729

 tired to do them so in this 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.370
