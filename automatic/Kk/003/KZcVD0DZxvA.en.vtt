some<00:01:31.300> weather<00:01:31.479> stripping<00:01:31.540> weather<00:01:32.440> stripping

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
some weather stripping weather stripping

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.180 
some weather stripping weather stripping
from<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.460> local<00:01:34.300> hardware<00:01:34.540> store<00:01:35.070> stuck<00:01:36.070> it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
from a local hardware store stuck it

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.520 
from a local hardware store stuck it
around<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.540> edges<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.020> license<00:01:38.350> plate

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
around the edges of the license plate

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.450 
around the edges of the license plate
got<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.550> whole<00:01:39.790> roll<00:01:40.060> for<00:01:40.869> dollar<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.040> 80<00:01:42.160> cent

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
got a whole roll for dollar and 80 cent

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.430 
got a whole roll for dollar and 80 cent
I<00:01:42.550> think<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.600> it's<00:01:43.960> not<00:01:44.080> like<00:01:44.259> you're<00:01:44.380> gonna

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
I think so it's not like you're gonna

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.359 
I think so it's not like you're gonna
spend<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.770> lot<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:44.950> money

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
spend a lot of money

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.840 
spend a lot of money
what<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.270> do<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.950> off<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.250> license<00:01:48.580> plate

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
what I do is take off the license plate

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.650 
what I do is take off the license plate
the<00:01:49.509> bit<00:01:49.869> type<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.410> think<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.190> use<00:01:51.340> 10<00:01:52.300> for

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
the bit type I think you can use 10 for

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.330 
the bit type I think you can use 10 for
English<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:56.759> which<00:01:57.759> one<00:01:57.940> is<00:01:58.090> this<00:01:58.740> 1332<00:01:59.740> for

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
English or which one is this 1332 for

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.969 
English or which one is this 1332 for
metric<00:02:00.700> either<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.119> works<00:02:01.300> I<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:02.710> actually

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
metric either one works I think actually

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.510 
metric either one works I think actually
I<00:02:03.160> even<00:02:03.280> tried<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.610> English<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.530> uh<00:02:05.560> just

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
I even tried the English but uh just

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.850 
I even tried the English but uh just
take<00:02:06.729> off<00:02:06.880> take<00:02:07.120> it<00:02:07.180> off<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.659> polish<00:02:08.320> ripping

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
take off take it off and polish ripping

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.590 
take off take it off and polish ripping
I'll<00:02:09.429> skip<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:09.820> part<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.179> video<00:02:10.269> because

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.750

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.770 

they<00:02:42.110> should<00:02:42.410> notice<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:43.480> back<00:02:44.480> deck

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
they should notice that the back deck

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.360 
they should notice that the back deck
and<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.380> trunk<00:02:45.650> are<00:02:45.800> still<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.160> rattle

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
and the trunk are still going to rattle

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.030 
and the trunk are still going to rattle
the<00:02:47.330> license<00:02:47.720> plate<00:02:47.930> however<00:02:48.110> should<00:02:48.530> not<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
license plate was the highest higher

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.320

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.680 

now<00:02:57.960> it's<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.940> trunk<00:02:59.940> itself<00:03:00.240> rattling

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
now it's just a trunk itself rattling

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.530 
now it's just a trunk itself rattling
the<00:03:01.380> trunk<00:03:01.650> rattle<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.700> actually<00:03:03.090> even<00:03:03.420> easier

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the trunk rattle is actually even easier

do to fix the rattle these two screws on
either<00:03:45.930> side<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.380> hook<00:03:46.560> I've<00:03:47.490> gotta

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
either side of this hook I've gotta

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.340 
either side of this hook I've gotta
loosen<00:03:47.880> them<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.420> enough<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.080> that<00:03:49.140> this

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
loosen them just enough so that this

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.800 
loosen them just enough so that this
hook<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.650> free<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.880> just<00:03:50.970> push<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.420> hook<00:03:51.540> all

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
hook is free you just push the hook all

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.650 
hook is free you just push the hook all
the<00:03:51.930> way<00:03:52.020> down<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.500> retighten<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.460> screws<00:03:53.730> so

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
the way down and retighten the screws so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.780 
the way down and retighten the screws so
let<00:03:54.900> me<00:03:54.960> do<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.170> real<00:03:55.320> quick

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.690 

and<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.959> bit<00:04:03.140> size<00:04:03.379> is<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.799> same<00:04:04.010> size<00:04:04.340> of

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
and the bit size is the same size of

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.920 
and the bit size is the same size of
1332

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.979 

so<00:04:10.930> as<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.620> can<00:04:11.739> see<00:04:11.970> hope<00:04:12.970> now<00:04:13.209> moves<00:04:13.840> around

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
so as you can see hope now moves around

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.030 
so as you can see hope now moves around
like<00:04:14.579> I<00:04:15.579> do<00:04:15.760> is<00:04:15.970> let<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.299> go<00:04:16.449> all<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.780> way<00:04:16.810> down

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
like I do is let it go all the way down

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:26.320 
like I do is let it go all the way down
and<00:04:18.040> then<00:04:18.160> retighten<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.729> screws

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.240 

all<00:04:26.479> right<00:04:26.629> so<00:04:26.750> now<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.930> hook<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:27.259> lower<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.099> it

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
all right so now the hook is lower so it

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.369 
all right so now the hook is lower so it
should<00:04:28.460> hold<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.789> trunk<00:04:29.060> down<00:04:29.270> better<00:04:29.720> let's

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:30.379 
should hold the trunk down better let's

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.890 
should hold the trunk down better let's
give<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.949> play<00:04:31.129> and<00:04:31.310> see<00:04:31.430> if<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.610> works<00:04:34.900> also

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
give it a play and see if it works also

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.300 
give it a play and see if it works also
it<00:04:36.229> doesn't<00:04:36.379> affect<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.830> way<00:04:36.919> your<00:04:37.069> trunk

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
it doesn't affect the way your trunk

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.240 
it doesn't affect the way your trunk
closes<00:04:39.099> batteries<00:04:40.099> ran<00:04:40.250> out<00:04:40.310> there<00:04:40.930> put<00:04:41.930> a

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
closes batteries ran out there put a

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.439 
closes batteries ran out there put a
play<00:04:43.539> same<00:04:44.539> song<00:04:44.810> same<00:04:45.710> volume<00:04:46.039> but<00:04:46.400> now<00:04:47.330> that

we've moved that hook down let's see

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:59.490 
we've moved that hook down let's see
what<00:04:49.009> the<00:04:49.099> difference<00:04:49.430> is

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
do find out now closing up your trunk so

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.470 
do find out now closing up your trunk so
that<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.740> doesn't<00:05:31.010> rattle<00:05:31.190> when<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.090> rattles

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
that it doesn't rattle when it rattles

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.350 
that it doesn't rattle when it rattles
it's<00:05:32.780> really<00:05:33.680> it's<00:05:33.800> opening<00:05:34.250> right<00:05:34.400> here<00:05:34.460> back

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
it's really it's opening right here back

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.300 
it's really it's opening right here back
and<00:05:35.570> forth<00:05:35.780> and<00:05:35.960> hitting<00:05:36.350> the<00:05:36.470> metal<00:05:36.620> so

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
and forth and hitting the metal so

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.680 
and forth and hitting the metal so
you're<00:05:37.460> losing<00:05:37.790> a<00:05:37.850> lot<00:05:38.030> of<00:05:38.150> pressure<00:05:38.390> and<00:05:38.600> a

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
you're losing a lot of pressure and a

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.170 
you're losing a lot of pressure and a
lot<00:05:38.720> of<00:05:38.870> bass<00:05:39.140> in<00:05:39.350> the<00:05:39.410> process<00:05:39.920> so<00:05:40.580> doing<00:05:41.060> this
