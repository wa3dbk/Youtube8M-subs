set this will help remove any color cast

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.040 
set this will help remove any color cast
from<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.460> file<00:00:22.759> and<00:00:23.300> it'll<00:00:23.509> give<00:00:23.630> you<00:00:23.720> a<00:00:23.810> great

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
from the file and it'll give you a great

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.599 
from the file and it'll give you a great
starting<00:00:24.439> point<00:00:24.680> before<00:00:24.800> making<00:00:25.250> any<00:00:25.430> other

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
starting point before making any other

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.609 
starting point before making any other
color<00:00:25.910> adjustments<00:00:26.480> let's<00:00:27.349> look<00:00:27.500> at<00:00:27.560> the

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
color adjustments let's look at the

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.769 
color adjustments let's look at the
photo<00:00:27.830> below<00:00:28.099> I<00:00:28.490> definitely<00:00:29.390> say<00:00:29.539> that<00:00:29.689> this

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
photo below I definitely say that this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.109 
photo below I definitely say that this
photo<00:00:30.019> has<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.679> green<00:00:30.949> color<00:00:31.250> cast<00:00:31.580> and<00:00:32.059> I

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
photo has a green color cast and I

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.119 
photo has a green color cast and I
suspect<00:00:32.570> it's<00:00:32.750> because<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.320> natural<00:00:33.620> blue

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
suspect it's because the natural blue

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.799 
suspect it's because the natural blue
light<00:00:34.339> coming<00:00:34.640> from<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.000> right<00:00:35.360> hand<00:00:35.570> side

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
and the artificial yellow light that's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.640 
and the artificial yellow light that's
coming<00:00:38.120> from<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.390> left<00:00:38.540> hand<00:00:38.780> side<00:00:38.900> and<00:00:39.320> it's

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
coming from the left hand side and it's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.890 
coming from the left hand side and it's
giving<00:00:39.890> us<00:00:40.010> an<00:00:40.160> overall<00:00:40.519> green<00:00:40.879> cast<00:00:41.210> I'm

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
giving us an overall green cast I'm

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.090

results showing us if we were to make

that target selection as our neutral

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
that target selection as our neutral
now<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> am<00:01:21.570> looking<00:01:21.899> for<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.079> black<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> white<00:01:22.590> or

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
now I am looking for a black a white or

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.670 
now I am looking for a black a white or
a<00:01:22.979> gray<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.240> could<00:01:24.600> select<00:01:24.899> her<00:01:25.140> jacket<00:01:25.590> but

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
a gray and I could select her jacket but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.889 
a gray and I could select her jacket but
I<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.009> don't<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.899> black

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
I really don't know if it's a black

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.380 
I really don't know if it's a black
jacket<00:01:28.259> or<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> navy<00:01:28.740> blue<00:01:29.159> jacket<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.179> might

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
jacket or a navy blue jacket so I might

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.029 
jacket or a navy blue jacket so I might
be<00:01:30.539> safer<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.140> actually<00:01:31.590> making<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
be safer just actually making the

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.490 
be safer just actually making the
selection<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> blinds<00:01:32.969> and<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.200> think

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
selection on the blinds and I do think

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.480 
selection on the blinds and I do think
that<00:01:34.590> looks<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.460> just

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that looks really good if we just

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.999 
that looks really good if we just
preview<00:01:36.119> before<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.990> after<00:01:37.799> we've

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
preview before and after we've

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.910 
preview before and after we've
definitely<00:01:38.250> removed<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> green<00:01:39.390> cast

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
definitely removed that green cast

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.350 
definitely removed that green cast
although<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.310> color<00:01:41.520> still<00:01:41.880> could<00:01:42.240> be

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
although the color still could be

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.059 
although the color still could be
improved<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:42.960> bit<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.039> of

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
improved a little bit and that's one of

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.529 
improved a little bit and that's one of
the<00:01:44.219> things<00:01:44.429> I<00:01:44.549> want<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.789> let<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.939> know<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
the things I want to let you know is

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.600 
the things I want to let you know is
once<00:01:45.929> we<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.289> make<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.860> white<00:01:47.250> balance

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
once we do make that white balance

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.300 
once we do make that white balance
selection<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.569> not<00:01:48.840> definitive<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.159> go

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
selection it's not definitive we can go

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
selection it's not definitive we can go
in<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.819> change<00:01:51.299> our<00:01:51.569> temperature<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.229> is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
in and change our temperature which is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.559 
in and change our temperature which is
our<00:01:52.500> blue<00:01:52.709> yellow<00:01:53.069> color<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.580> our<00:01:54.060> tint<00:01:54.390> which

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
our blue yellow color or our tint which

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.600 
our blue yellow color or our tint which
is<00:01:54.720> our<00:01:54.869> green<00:01:55.080> magenta<00:01:55.259> color<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.039> in<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
is our green magenta color and in this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.800 
is our green magenta color and in this
case<00:01:56.819> I<00:01:56.970> think<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.209> going<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.390> warm<00:01:57.569> up<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
case I think I'm going to warm up the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
case I think I'm going to warm up the
image<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.319> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.649> bit<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.880> think

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
image just a little bit more and I think

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.279 
image just a little bit more and I think
I'm<00:02:00.119> gonna<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.509> tint<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.049> I'm<00:02:01.110> gonna

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
I'm gonna go to my tint and I'm gonna

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.529 
I'm gonna go to my tint and I'm gonna
remove<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.069> bit<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.429> magenta<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
remove a little bit of the magenta it

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.899 
remove a little bit of the magenta it
looks<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:03.929> hot<00:02:04.349> so<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.130> think<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.729> looks

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
looks a little hot so I think that looks

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.449 
looks a little hot so I think that looks
a<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.689> bit<00:02:06.929> better

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
a little bit better

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.430 
a little bit better
again<00:02:08.459> previewing<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.000> before<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.630> after

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
again previewing it before and after

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.069 
again previewing it before and after
we've<00:02:10.619> definitely<00:02:10.799> removed<00:02:11.549> that<00:02:11.720> green<00:02:12.720> cast

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
we've definitely removed that green cast

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.960 
we've definitely removed that green cast
and<00:02:13.620> really<00:02:13.920> made<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> photo<00:02:14.549> look<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.819> lot

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and really made the photo look a lot

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.030 
and really made the photo look a lot
more<00:02:15.120> natural<00:02:15.269> I'm<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.319> zoom<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.769> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
more natural I'm going to zoom in and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.370 
more natural I'm going to zoom in and
just<00:02:17.310> previewing<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.819> before<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.480> after<00:02:19.230> you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
just previewing it before and after you

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.350 
just previewing it before and after you
can<00:02:19.500> see<00:02:19.530> again<00:02:20.340> we've<00:02:20.579> really<00:02:20.849> removed<00:02:21.209> that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
can see again we've really removed that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.210 
can see again we've really removed that
green<00:02:21.510> cast<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.349> we've<00:02:22.530> created<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.980> great

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
green cast and we've created a great

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.849 
green cast and we've created a great
starting<00:02:23.610> point<00:02:23.819> we<00:02:23.970> haven't<00:02:24.769> adjusted<00:02:25.769> our

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
starting point we haven't adjusted our

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.309 
starting point we haven't adjusted our
exposure<00:02:26.700> or<00:02:26.970> made<00:02:27.150> any<00:02:27.180> tonal<00:02:27.780> curves<00:02:28.019> and

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
exposure or made any tonal curves and

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.809 
exposure or made any tonal curves and
we've<00:02:28.500> already<00:02:28.680> really<00:02:29.190> improved<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.609> photo

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
we've already really improved the photo

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.309 
we've already really improved the photo
a<00:02:29.910> lot

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
a lot

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.020 
a lot
there's<00:02:31.739> another<00:02:32.010> example<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.549> want<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.819> show

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
there's another example I want to show

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.570 
there's another example I want to show
you<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.420> that's<00:02:33.689> this<00:02:33.840> one<00:02:33.989> here

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
you and that's this one here

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.790 
you and that's this one here
in<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.060> previous<00:02:36.420> example<00:02:37.050> we<00:02:37.080> did<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
in the previous example we did have a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.680 
in the previous example we did have a
mixed<00:02:38.220> lighting<00:02:38.460> situation<00:02:39.210> which<00:02:39.420> does

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
mixed lighting situation which does

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.680 
mixed lighting situation which does
cause<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.190> color<00:02:41.190> cast<00:02:41.490> but<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.210> wanted<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> let

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
cause a color cast but I wanted to let

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.240 
cause a color cast but I wanted to let
you<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.050> natural<00:02:43.260> light<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.800> cause

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
you know that natural light can cause

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.310 
you know that natural light can cause
the<00:02:44.430> color<00:02:44.640> cast<00:02:44.880> as<00:02:45.150> well<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.630> while<00:02:46.170> it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
the color cast as well and while it

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.130 
the color cast as well and while it
might<00:02:46.440> not<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.770> as<00:02:46.890> obvious<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.670> photo

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
might not be as obvious in this photo

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.260 
might not be as obvious in this photo
there<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> blue<00:02:49.890> color<00:02:50.220> cast<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.880> image

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
there is a blue color cast to this image

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.850 
there is a blue color cast to this image
and<00:02:51.450> that's<00:02:51.750> because<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.260> was<00:02:52.380> shot<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.770> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
and that's because it was shot in the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.580 
and that's because it was shot in the
morning<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.460> rather<00:02:54.420> than<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.050> warm

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
morning and rather than in the warm

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.410 
morning and rather than in the warm
light<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.040> afternoon<00:02:56.340> we're<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.150> cool

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
light of the afternoon we're in the cool

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420 
light of the afternoon we're in the cool
light<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> morning<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.100> has<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
light of the morning and it's just has a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.820 
light of the morning and it's just has a
blue<00:03:00.000> tone<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:00.900> again<00:03:01.380> I'm<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.710> gonna

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.190 
bring the yellow down a little bit and
introduce<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.940> little<00:03:21.120> bit<00:03:21.209> more<00:03:21.360> blue<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.870> I'm

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
introduce a little bit more blue and I'm

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.780 
introduce a little bit more blue and I'm
just<00:03:22.320> gonna<00:03:22.470> back<00:03:22.740> off<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.310> magenta<00:03:23.610> a

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
just gonna back off on the magenta a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.400 
just gonna back off on the magenta a
little<00:03:24.030> bit<00:03:24.180> but<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.840> think<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.170> looks<00:03:25.350> really

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
little bit but I think that looks really

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.260 
little bit but I think that looks really
good<00:03:25.830> right<00:03:26.010> there<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.400> again<00:03:26.610> previewing<00:03:27.150> it

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
good right there so again previewing it

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.630 
good right there so again previewing it
before<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.990> after<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.040> can<00:03:29.160> see<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.520> we've

before and after you can see that we've
definitely<00:03:29.880> removed<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.600> blue<00:03:31.110> cast<00:03:31.410> and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
definitely removed that blue cast and

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.370 
definitely removed that blue cast and
we've<00:03:32.130> made<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.910> skintone<00:03:33.750> look<00:03:33.990> a<00:03:34.080> lot<00:03:34.260> more

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380
