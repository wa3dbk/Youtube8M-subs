00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
on here and it's called a mathematical

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.639 
on here and it's called a mathematical
relationship<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.079> an<00:01:10.289> inverse

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
relationship there is an inverse

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.889

relationship between pole dancing and
clothing<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.009> as<00:01:14.429> skill<00:01:15.090> increases<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
clothing that is as skill increases the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.219 
clothing that is as skill increases the
amount<00:01:16.319> of<00:01:16.649> pull<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.159> clothing<00:01:17.670> decreases<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
amount of pull of clothing decreases so

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.230 
amount of pull of clothing decreases so
my<00:01:19.409> little<00:01:19.560> character<00:01:20.130> naturally<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.819> gets

my little character naturally this gets
very<00:01:21.929> little<00:01:22.259> less<00:01:22.429> and<00:01:23.429> that's<00:01:23.819> definitely

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
very little less and that's definitely

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.789 
very little less and that's definitely
how<00:01:24.329> you<00:01:24.389> come<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.929> pull<00:01:25.139> it<00:01:25.259> first<00:01:25.499> you
