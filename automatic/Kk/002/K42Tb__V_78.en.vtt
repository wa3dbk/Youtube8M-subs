00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.500
 Here is a recipe for a strawberry diet 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.420
 cake now diego is not really but 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 The best approach is the fresh strawberries 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.580
 on the field or in the garden or at the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 build around the corner then you have such 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.779
 delicious things like here 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.029
 So take 500 grams of fresh 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 strawberries then raspberries nectarines or 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.529
 other fresh fruit as you like 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:37.500
 one tastes best 500 grams 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:39.390
 lean curd two a lemon 1 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640
 teaspoon baking powder a packet 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.680
 pudding vanilla flavor and two 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.149
 packet red topping bus though 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.760
 now here was one more picture 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.030
 two to three tablespoons of coconut shavings and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.629
 a tablespoon of butter in addition to something 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.770
 which we sweet to the eggs Trentmann 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.010
 because the protein is a separate one 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.820
 the strawberries have turned up 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 Puree these 500 grams result in approximately 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.240
 500 milliliters strawberry puree 500 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.860
 milliliters should be otherwise 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.340
 a little more strawberries or less 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340
 use 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:32.090
 Then you put the quark in a bowl 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:35.299
 to it come the two yellow tablespoons 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.409
 butter if it is not so hard 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.750
 it works better than this 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.289
 So best of all before from the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.289
 take a fridge 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.670
 a packet of pudding powder 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:11.410
 a teaspoon of baking powder and the thing 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.180
 from half a lemon or just 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.930
 a tablespoon depending on taste like 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:23.410
 One would like to have it all 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.970
 mixing well with each other is a nice one 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.370
 sluggish mass has emerged 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:33.000
 the egg whites are opened two 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.500
 snow and then under this quark mass 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:46.330
 Carefully lifted that a beautiful 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:47.800
 loose creamy quark mass develops the 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.780
 mast this mass can be before 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.489
 Of course, the quark mass you can before 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.049
 of course also with you 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.430
 stevia sweet tastes so completely without sweet 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.430
 It's not right 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.330
 Carefully fold the egg into it 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.130
 and then I give it into a springform 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.330
 have this ground of springform ago with 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.480
 baking paper laid out then sticking to it 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:34.800
 not so much better off 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:37.050
 Loosen soil still evenly 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.670
 and if you want you can still 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.600
 with fresh fruit this quark mass 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.400
 occupy 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.130
 lehmann si bÃ¤ckt you can but it works 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.200
 even after baking so it is me 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.270
 the quasi a bit dark you can 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.730
 to take something for the first time 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:57.500
 that strawberry puree with the cake 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.500
 mix and boil briefly 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.450
 I still have the floor here 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.870
 Raspberries are used after baking and 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.790
 then that would be briefly boiled 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:18.330
 strawberry puree with the red bus over 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.540
 this soil and about the fruits and 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.160
 let that cool for a moment 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.970
 there you can garnish it to your liking 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.450
 about decorate and then I wish 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.450
 Enjoy your meal
