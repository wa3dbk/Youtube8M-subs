 moisture is allowed to escape 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.300
 Here we have a separate one 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.920
 sink with a mirror cabinet 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.240
 adjacent further cabinets in which the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.170
 others travel their clothes 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.850
 can accommodate 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.740
 because the vehicle is designed for 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.110
 up to five people here again 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.070
 large fridge with ice compartment and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.900
 Now we are back in the 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.520
 living area arrived with the the net 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.440
 I would like to give it a quick look again 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.880
 demonstrate how easy it really is 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.890
 is she nice to a back and 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.190
 works as the first one takes the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.190
 upholstery is this to the side 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.630
 so the others are completely stuck up 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:28.049
 So only one table lifts him one piece 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:30.750
 highly curious look a short time the 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.840
 briefly and then squeezed 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:39.689
 below 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.750
 Now you have the lying surface plain 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.069
 the upholstery again 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:53.159
 it is very thick Prussian knows it 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:54.930
 really very drunk to sleep and 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.980
 for the table leg have an extra 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.549
 dusty down here 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:06.900
 then you do not stop and the bed 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.150
 is finished behind me they see the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.040
 alps this is the place to sleep for 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.689
 the third and fourth person and that 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.340
 biggest mate what we here in the vehicle 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.229

 we will move more room for the night 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.130
 just put the mattress forward 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.260
 and you have a huge deck area 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.180
 for two people on both sides 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.099
 Do you have windows with these for you 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.750
 The night turns can be directly under 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.870
 We raised a pass for that 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.480
 to the comfortable driver's cab 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.240
