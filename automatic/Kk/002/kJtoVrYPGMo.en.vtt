00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.109 
kind of cutting board we use well I
think<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.979> important<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.790> know<00:01:38.909> for

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
think it's important to you know for

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
think it's important to you know for
especially<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.810> raw<00:01:39.960> meat<00:01:40.350> definitely<00:01:41.340> i

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
especially for raw meat definitely i

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.710 
especially for raw meat definitely i
like<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> use<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.850> glass<00:01:42.090> cutting<00:01:42.420> board

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
like to use a glass cutting board

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.319 
like to use a glass cutting board
because<00:01:42.960> would<00:01:43.770> definitely<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.090> as

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
because would definitely get that as

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.810 
because would definitely get that as
clean<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.170> would<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.979> porous<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
clean as you want it would is porous so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.249 
clean as you want it would is porous so
it<00:01:47.939> definitely<00:01:48.149> takes<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.780> some<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it definitely takes in some of the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.249 
it definitely takes in some of the
bacteria<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.369> foodborne<00:01:50.700> bacteria<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> it's

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
bacteria the foodborne bacteria and it's

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.200 
bacteria the foodborne bacteria and it's
really<00:01:52.439> hard<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.490> i<00:01:53.790> would

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
really hard to get that out so i would

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.749 
really hard to get that out so i would
suggest<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.960> raw<00:01:55.079> meats<00:01:55.759> especially

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
suggest for raw meats especially

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.490 
suggest for raw meats especially
definitely<00:01:57.360> using<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.719> glass<00:01:57.930> cutting<00:01:58.200> board

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
definitely using a glass cutting board

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.350 
definitely using a glass cutting board
