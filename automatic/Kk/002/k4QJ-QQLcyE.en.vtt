 [Music] 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.700
 public transport in Peru is 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.260
 is in crisis in the last week 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.580
 the constant traffic accidents 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.500
 they have claimed the lives of many people 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.779
 the picture the national institute of 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.869
 statistics in the country every year die 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.430
 on the slopes 3500 people and the cost 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.920
 that leave the accidents for the state 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.010
 amounts to 1,500 million dollars a 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.309
 alarming fact unfortunately in the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.800
 Peru we are going through a situation 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.449
 very critical in transit and transportation 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.960
 and this has gone from bad to worse every time 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.839
 20 years ago when there is a turn in the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.600
 country we come out of a difficult crisis 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.019
 economic and social is released 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.199
 transport routes are released and in that 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.930
 At the moment, the authorities do not foresee that 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.820
 it was indispensable that companies 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.110
 they owned the units 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.790
 vehicular 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.440
 for the transport specialist is 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.640
 necessary for a single entity to be the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.100
 responsible for regulating transportation 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.930
 public today in Peru are 7 the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.960
 authorities that regulate transportation in 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.740
 peru the last report that we have the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.820
 last year they have died 4 thousand 50 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.510
 people in a single year there are 86 thousand 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.810
 traffic accidents in a year 45 thousand 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.580
 disabled injured then this 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.130
 situation is obviously extremely 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.080
 complex in 2009 a system of 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.180
 points that shows that each lack of 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.979
 traffic the driver accumulated marks and 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.960
 get to 100 the license was suspended 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.070
 of driving however the drivers are 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.990
 refuses to give your information to be 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.790
 intervened to this is added the lack 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.259
 of road culture that is still not very scarce 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.180
 in the country which is reason for more 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.030
 traffic accidents definitely 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.740
 it is necessary to promote the road culture 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.540
 there has to be a change of attitude 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.729
 there has to be a leadership of the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.340
 authorities and the population has to 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.440
 be part of this change one last 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.940
 survey indicates that 59 percent of 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.590
 users consider transportation 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.650
 public as bad or lousy 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 I do not think it's too deficient we have a 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.660
 automotive park very very poor and with 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.879
 many wall-level complications 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.819
 graphics were anywhere they do not have 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.250
 some good defined routes have routes 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.019
 but they do not define in what whereabouts 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.879
 good standing the Peruvian government has 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.470
 announced that it will toughen the laws that 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.540
 penalize traffic accidents that 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.580
 generate deaths jorge de la quintana
