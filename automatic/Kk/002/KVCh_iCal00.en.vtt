00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 in this video we will proceed to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.990
 storyboard of our video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.840
 so we already have scripts and this one 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.900
 the script we will now turn into 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.809
 various shots here i have presented to you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.260
 here is such a storyboard template 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.050
 You can download the template under the video or in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.779
 course download from bonus materials 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.789
 so it consists of four columns 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 here voice or speech is what you 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.160
 You read the pictures here. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.380
 expect to insert time here 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.079
 and here are some notes 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.050
 let's see how it all looks 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.180
 so in the beginning we take these phrases 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.149
 what you see on the screen now is 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.289
 drawn video and paste it into 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.000
 the first frame is we will have the first scene 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.430
 we select a drawing 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.770
 such a composition here by the way is somewhat 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.379
 different drawings I already took from 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.750
 finished movie you can so creatively 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.439
 think what would you like that? 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.890
 submit to this phrase and measure 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.920
 how long will it last for example i 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.530
 presented it this way here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.439
 will first appear island just 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.619
 sound music and then will appear 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.220
 man and only then will he go himself 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.390
 sound 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.390
 here look 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.880
 what you see on the screen now 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.290
 here that is like this then this 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.840
 turned into life 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.780
 that is, I have designated here for example three 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.110
 seconds this music lasts all sorts of birds 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.590
 sing 4 seconds something says man 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.560
 still 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.350
 just 7 seconds really it's just 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.530
 An example is that you understand that this 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.810
 This and I write in the notice at the beginning sounds 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.240
 music without hair and that is to say 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.520
 it was understandable either for me or for 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.789
 announcer who will then voice 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.430
 further take the next phrase you spend 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.300
 money for advertising and there is no sales here 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.790
 two such pictures are placed here i am 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.280
 thought up here for example spend 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.730
 no money for advertising sales 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.950
 pockets and the duration of this scene 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.860
 three seconds but this is what I measured at 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.319
 tap aid measure although you can and 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.570
 hold up this scene that is it 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.450
 measure chrono measure how much is about a thief 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.850
 goes but nevertheless you can do 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.709
 there is some pause something to insert here 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.560
 that is, there is some sound to write in 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.310
 notes god delay there is something else 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.680
 is the next phrase constantly 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.549
 looking for new subscribers and the result 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.650
 lamentable 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.600
 that is, 2 such pictures here I am 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.870
 presented what it looked like 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.870
 People looking for new subscribers to the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.570
 the result he has no vine is omitted 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.320
 i.e. hands drop pocket and again 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.320
 empty 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.900
 Here on the chronometer it is three seconds though 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.299
 again you can add here 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.579
 also in the notes you can write something 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.850
 so you want to hear some may 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.310
 special effect 0 for example when you have there 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.340
 something then appear there man started 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.220
 make money ringing coins or when 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.070
 until the end of registration there are only 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.660
 there 36 hours 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.130
 tactics such an alarm clock and you write 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.500
 alarm clock ticking 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.859
 that is, that's how it is composed 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.859
 full storyboard of your video
