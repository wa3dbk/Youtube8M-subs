00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:56.280
 brine for brine brine we will 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:02.100
 First boil with all the spices and

 send in the fridge for 4 days 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:21.920
 so let's start so we are about to boil 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.439
 our pickle spice appreciated it 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.369
 special price no longer needed mother did not take 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:31.729
 all we need to cool 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.490
 pour another here breast two 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.770
 kilogram kilogram each piece then 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.799
 there is 2 liters just enough to fill 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:46.369
 completely the surface of the meat and send 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.970
 in the fridge for 4 days until we have breast 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:55.009
 bursting smell chic 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:58.659
 the truth is not passed 45 days, well, it's even 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:04.429
 better than one of the professionals 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:07.789
 salted and up to two weeks process 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:11.989
 smoked show will not be similar 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.980
 like previous videos that is, we will 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:19.510
 smoke in the kitchen with a water seal 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.830
 we fill in water we insert a hose 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.040
 controls the process of smoking will be with 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:30.160
 using a thermometer 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:35.090
 when the temperature reaches 90 degrees 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:40.120
 we count time 1 hour that is such 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.220
 us time smoking sawdust use 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.880
 also 50 percent oak 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:51.829
 50 percent alder connected in two 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:56.120
 tablespoons every well all the following 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:03:00.140
 inclusion will be after smoking immediately 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:05.140
 hot pieces i'm throwing in the pan with 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.250
 boiling water and I will cook for half an hour 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.720
 then we will see what we have 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.230
 It turned out and so you about smoked an hour 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.319
 now hot we throw immediately 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.569
 in boiled water and we will boil 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.090
 cook for half an hour so we cooked people 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:31.129
 cooked for half an hour 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.129
 chilled you let's try 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.040
 very soft cut 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.049
 very tasty sent the longest 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.870
 very gentle smell chic i think that 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.820
 we got separately want to say 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.260
 about 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.220
 thermometer thermometer convenient 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:28.570
 controls the smoking process 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:32.920
 but in my case with a little morning when 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.370
 I went to the regime optimal smoked with 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.580
 slow gas cap 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:46.270
 hot thermometer showed me 70 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:49.690
 degrees i.e. the thermometer will be very 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.510
 useful when we will smoke 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.790
 use use on the grill then 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:00.190
 is there an uncontrollable such process 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:05.430
 and to understand that you went to work 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.810
 smoking mode on thermometer 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:14.410
 set to 70 degrees 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.979
 and we can safely smoke on further on 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.850
 brazier 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:24.280
 if the temperature is higher respectively 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:27.130
 need to remove google and rich fire because 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.990
 otherwise I think that when smoked 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:36.600
 fish especially mackerel skin may already 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:46.419
 crack because of this because of strong 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:48.100
 fire like that 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.030
