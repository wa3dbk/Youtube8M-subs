00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.730
 do not 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.930
 a drunk he is such a good at 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.610
 video we should know a new glitch with 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.369
 the one that we are going to be able to cross 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.980
 walls we could say and have objects 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 hidden behind a wall without the need of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.910
 have remains or do a super tutorial 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.770
 complex let's use the stairs 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.070
 and nothing we will see 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.650
 well let's start first I'll 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.880
 explain a bit how they work or how 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.970
 is built on the end we will see 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.940
 of the tutorial and good works using 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.300
 the stairs are in shape 1 when you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.400
 put together and make the corner that there is a 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.360
 good bus that is what makes you lose 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.670
 the heat box for a moment if you enter 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.020
 this block to this block around here giving 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.020
 as a round let's see it 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.020
 and we have it here 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.880
 there is a little patience too if not 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.440
 it comes out at the beginning but very simple 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.590
 I recommend that you put and approximately 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.050
 this point and what good comes out and you 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.900
 you can measure up and I 'll see 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.480
 which is the best position and good here 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.070
 I have another thing that I know even better with 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.470
 that we are going to be able to cross walls in 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.480
 we are going to be able to have chests on 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.480
 leeds is exactly the same notice 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.509
 I'm gone if you do more 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.390
 fast does not work I've done it before 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.010
 more faster you have to have patience and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.409
 good how can I get out I'll repeat it 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.749
 will not bring more 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.090
 here that we can have here we can 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.670
 have a chest equally or an exit 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.409
 a secret entrance the only problem 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.600
 what I see to this is that he always throws you 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.850
 to this side I do not know why I never 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.640
 leave so you have approved a thousand things from 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.770
 all ways like post wall is 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.260
 impossible to get out so you can 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.320
 walk perfectly 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.399
 as you can see, this is very simple 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.090
 it works with that, so we're not going to see the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.090
 tutorial 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.709
 well let's comment here I have already 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.140
 done the example I would recommend that I 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.690
 copy 6 feet in the construction I'm going 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.849
 to do entirely is to say exact 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.390
 because it's going to cost less and I've already 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.910
 done a lot of tests and well there are some 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.250
 tricks or blocks that better than 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.260
 are in one way or another like this we are going to 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.769
 start and we're going to need any 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.330
 type of ladder is worth it and we put it 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.340
 this form can have all the length that 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.290
 you want but here I do not recommend either 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.680
 have more because to be more 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.940
 cumbersome to do this worth of all 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.580
 ways I could do it as well 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.709
 you want once we have this, let's go 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.930
 to put a block here we break it and 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.959
 we put around here the sides more 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.440
 blocks thus being hollow inside 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.440
 OK 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.220
 when we have this according to what 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.810
 we want to do we are going to have to remove 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.849
 some blocks in this case should not be 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.330
 remove anything is placed so good if 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.060
 you can put here one too 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.680
 and we have already done this the one in the chest 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.710
 the sencillito it very simple 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.260
 very easy and now let's see the one of the 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.170
 stone my car but before 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.720
 I tell you that I'll make a tutorial 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.650
 also of rest at the end of the video as well 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.510
 that we're not going to see the main card 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.739
 this is exactly the same as the leeds but 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.650
 well the blocks behind are going to 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.560
 place in a different way and we're going to 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.300
 have to enter the main card of another 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.500
 way we are not going to have to do it 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.790
 from this side but from this corner 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.069
 you have to imagine also where 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.490
 you are going to place and good and you 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.080
 you try 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.970
 well first of all let's go see 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.620
 how should we enter we have to 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.879
 enter from this corner doing 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.879
 almost to the same procedure 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.920
 patience we have not followed 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.880
 OK 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.580
 it's worth as you see the only 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.300
 we would have to do it because that is to do it 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.330
 from here to get as close as possible and 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.490
 approximately on this side it is worth 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.840
 well from that now if I want 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.789
 get out of there because every time 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.800
 leave the main card we will have 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.270
 what to do is place blocks here 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.470
 You are here also to finish what 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.570
 pass 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.520
 Well, it does not matter, I would go out here 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.320
 also good the two ways you can 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.870
 get out there for here so what 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.180
 we are going to do is heal us in health is 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.520
 say let's prevent we were going to 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.650
 place everything in a way that I know 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.240
 that we will not be able to leave it 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.130
 first of all let's go placing 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.500
 this as you see here I have placed the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.720
 slaps and another card and this is pretty 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.460
 important we place here I double that for 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.650
 that we can not is to pee on the islands 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.090
 we're always going to have to leave here 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.010
 in front of the main pickpocket 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.360
 and you see , I've already left here inside and 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.699
 is already done here too 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.180
 we could place as I said before a 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.460
 chest 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.810
 as before in the tutorial there is also 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.639
 there was a chest but neither did 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.330
 I recommend a lot because we can totally 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.930
 use 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.330
 the cliche this is very comfortable and now 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.849
 let's see the tutorial of the rest 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.520
 well here we would have already what would be the 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.590
 reston system is very simple one 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.379
 only as you need are pistons and a 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.099
 signal on or off as you can 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:50.020
 see here I will love doing it 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.360
 although I have it blocked as you see there 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.169
 a block can not be entered into the chest 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.969
 but now if I turn out this well yes so 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.939
 how good we can get to build it 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:03.639
 it is very, very simple, first thing 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:07.259
 let's find the area where we go 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.259
 to make the lic 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.870
 as fast right here 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.820
 ok we have all these blocks 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.860
 when we already have these are going to be these 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.910
 down here because the chest for nothing 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.000
 good 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.890
 the chest as already by the bank was going to 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.890
 to be here is worth then 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.480
 are going to have to be these is all here 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.110
 the pistons are going to have to be 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.940
 at this level it is worth 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.030
 we put them as we can if we want 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.150
 we can break this 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.840
 we put this like this and we're going to put it 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.510
 and the subtraction is going to come here is worth a 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.580
 level further up by 1 total the 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.520
 The chest does not look like that, just like a 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.530
 little bit hidden but we'll have to 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.750
 do it for example take it out for a 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.810
 wall imagine that here is a 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.390
 wall then like the network this if the 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.960
 block is lit with a slight the 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.040
 going down would be as simple as 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.170
 have it here we could hide this 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.830
 in our house and as you see the same 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:19.870
 it would be on that is impossible 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:24.639
 enter once we pay it 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:27.590
 Well, we could take the items 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:30.890
 It is very simple 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.740
 you can not have a look and 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.169
 nothing guys 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.490
 and good guys this has been the tutorial 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:39.310
 today I hope you liked the 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.710
 it's true that it's pretty cool 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.120
 if you do not know how to do something it does not work 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.729
 you can leave it in the comments and I 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.550
 I help at the moment and well who is 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:51.550
 asking in particular 300 I'm not going to 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:54.580
 be able to climb I think in the mansion in 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.169
 the special 300 because I'm very close 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.539
 of time and every time I open the map 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:00.009
 I try to do new things and improve it and 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:03.819
 finish it then I start to put things 

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:05.500
 new out well then it ended and no longer 

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:07.690
 I have time and good exams 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.729
 I'm also going to travel and good thousand 

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.870
 things with nothing guys I hope there's 

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:12.370
 liked the video give to the jce
