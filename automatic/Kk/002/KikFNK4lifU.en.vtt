reality check because there's not going
to<00:01:45.190> be<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.340> great<00:01:45.520> play<00:01:45.850> every<00:01:46.120> time<00:01:46.150> do<00:01:46.810> they

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
to be a great play every time do they

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.900 
to be a great play every time do they
have<00:01:46.930> mistakes<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.800> we<00:01:48.160> take<00:01:48.340> those<00:01:48.490> mistakes

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
have mistakes and we take those mistakes

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.730 
have mistakes and we take those mistakes
and<00:01:49.090> try<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.330> show<00:01:49.570> them<00:01:49.600> we<00:01:50.200> also<00:01:50.350> show<00:01:50.650> them

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
and try to show them we also show them

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.960 
and try to show them we also show them
what<00:01:50.830> they<00:01:50.920> did<00:01:51.070> right<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.610> can<00:01:51.760> learn<00:01:51.909> from

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
what they did right so we can learn from

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.659 
what they did right so we can learn from
either<00:01:52.210> one<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.480> those
