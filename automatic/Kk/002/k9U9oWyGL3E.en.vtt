you can see right there

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.530 
you can see right there
the<00:00:29.849> LEDs<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:30.990> cracked<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.910> actually<00:00:33.329> see

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the LEDs have cracked and actually see

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.690 
the LEDs have cracked and actually see
it<00:00:33.630> has<00:00:33.750> flaked<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> little<00:00:34.469> bit<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.579> you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
can see that only half my LEDs are still

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.500 
can see that only half my LEDs are still
on<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:40.050> some<00:00:40.860> spots<00:00:41.190> no<00:00:41.550> not<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.000> spots<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
on in some spots no not in all spots and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.950 
on in some spots no not in all spots and
look<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:43.290> cracked<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.890> other<00:00:44.040> corner<00:00:44.960> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
look get cracked in this other corner so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.119 
look get cracked in this other corner so
in<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> next<00:00:46.289> day<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.620> two<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:46.860> gonna<00:00:47.010> be

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
in the next day or two I'm gonna be

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400 
in the next day or two I'm gonna be
shooting<00:00:48.120> another<00:00:48.270> video<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.690> reinstalling

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
shooting another video on reinstalling

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250 
shooting another video on reinstalling
them<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.829> might<00:00:49.980> try<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.539> file<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
them I might try to file down some of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.580 
them I might try to file down some of
those<00:00:52.440> corners<00:00:53.420> see<00:00:54.420> back<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.379> light

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
those corners see back here the light

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.240 
those corners see back here the light
looks<00:00:55.829> great<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.430> don't<00:00:56.699> think<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.059> had<00:00:57.210> any

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
looks great I don't think we had any

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.880 
looks great I don't think we had any
loss<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.550> LEDs<00:01:00.859> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.969> here

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
loss of LEDs and then up in here

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.000 
loss of LEDs and then up in here
yeah<00:01:04.890> looks<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.339> most<00:01:05.580> most<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.240> those<00:01:06.360> are

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
yeah looks like most most of those are

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
yeah looks like most most of those are
are<00:01:08.010> working<00:01:08.400> good<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.790> had<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> couple<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.420> but

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
are working good we had a couple out but

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
are working good we had a couple out but
you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:11.040> know<00:01:11.159> there's<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.520> issues

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
you can see you know there's some issues

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.200 
you can see you know there's some issues
on<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> sharp<00:01:12.689> corners<00:01:13.490> where<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> turn<00:01:14.909> they

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
on the sharp corners where you turn they

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
on the sharp corners where you turn they
start<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> break<00:01:15.689> apart<00:01:18.590> we've<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> couple

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
start to break apart we've got a couple

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.910 
start to break apart we've got a couple
more<00:01:20.250> down<00:01:20.430> there<00:01:21.320> those<00:01:22.320> looking<00:01:22.680> pretty

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
more down there those looking pretty

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.929 
more down there those looking pretty
good<00:01:23.270> that's<00:01:24.270> kind<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.810> under<00:01:25.229> my

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
good that's kind of just under my

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.969 
good that's kind of just under my
fishing<00:01:26.939> platform<00:01:27.450> though<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.200> don't<00:01:28.740> mean

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
fishing platform though so I don't mean

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.270 
fishing platform though so I don't mean
it's<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.579> light<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:30.860> but<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.009> can

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
see I mean even with half the lights

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.069 
see I mean even with half the lights
going<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.500> some<00:01:34.740> spots<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:36.810> still

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
going in some spots it really still

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
going in some spots it really still
lights<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> bottom<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> boat<00:01:38.189> really

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
lights up the bottom of the boat really

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.590 
lights up the bottom of the boat really
nice<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> check<00:01:41.189> my<00:01:41.310> other<00:01:41.340> videos<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
nice so check my other videos like I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.859 
nice so check my other videos like I
said<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> got<00:01:43.049> my<00:01:43.229> initial<00:01:43.710> install<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.869> I'm

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
said I got my initial install these I'm

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
said I got my initial install these I'm
gonna<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.140> putting<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.439> some<00:01:46.619> blue<00:01:46.890> ones<00:01:47.240> some

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
gonna be putting in some blue ones some

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200 
gonna be putting in some blue ones some
blue<00:01:48.390> LEDs<00:01:49.369> for<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> replacement<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.119> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
blue LEDs for the replacement and I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.310 
blue LEDs for the replacement and I
might<00:01:51.390> try<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.670> might<00:01:53.670> try<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.180> some<00:01:54.420> some

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
might try to I might try to do some some

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.480 
might try to I might try to do some some
different<00:01:55.680> stuff<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> install<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
different stuff on the install so that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.240 
different stuff on the install so that
it<00:01:59.490> prevents<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> cracking<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> future

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
it prevents the cracking in the future

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.060 
it prevents the cracking in the future
but<00:02:02.250> hey<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.460> 15<00:02:03.000> bucks<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.390> year<00:02:03.920> even<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:04.979> you

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
but hey for 15 bucks a year even if you

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.399 
but hey for 15 bucks a year even if you
got<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.219> replace<00:02:05.549> them<00:02:05.729> every<00:02:05.820> year<00:02:06.409> it's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
got to replace them every year it's

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
got to replace them every year it's
still<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> great<00:02:07.890> solution<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:09.509> those<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
still a great solution so those are the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.800 
still a great solution so those are the
waterproof<00:02:10.289> LEDs<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:11.099> bottom<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.580> Amazon

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
waterproof LEDs as bottom on Amazon

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.320 
waterproof LEDs as bottom on Amazon
