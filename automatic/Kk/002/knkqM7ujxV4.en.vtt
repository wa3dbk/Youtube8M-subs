00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.929
 just like myself, I am now after the game but on a website 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.170
 To be specific, close to poker fans point 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.559
 here you can pretty much everything important about in advance as well as 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 possible also about strategies for Pocan and see 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.839
 and year could show for the first time what we are on Info Infor is foul 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.879
 Erfurt while you and that means i 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.769
 IEB circle points so maybe points ago 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.030
 and the avalanche transceiver you can not directly see how much she heads 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.690
 but urgently 4 TV 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 lion dog becomes fourth in the time 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 he always has a starting point 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030
 that is when I say for example 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.740
 4 in Footsie on Power Points have these are beside to points 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.620
 then throw up a reason to keep a starting point 3 power point mark 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.980
 here could also see where polished the information and his team take 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.899
 The power comes first when experiencing 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.810
 to 2 317 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.810
 this brings 2 the wife is of course he could too 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.620
 Percent flea market parents from this knows that percent needed change 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.330
 pressure point 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.230
 then he spat on 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.270
 because the times meant so today us team Yemen 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.280
 Breitungen 3 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.810
 Percent can 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.290
 Remarks 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 swallows 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.420
 still Euro 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.180
 this will be the team-em Piepenburg Initiative Pauli 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.110
 Dießen Pokemon and the figures of the BAG Brand are allied 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.470
 Pauli will be shown including boxers 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.410
 since we all want to do with great that is a good 3 9 Kahn 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 of course we want and point percent and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.219
 Initiative points so that's different Cologne train 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.330
 and the study best 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.540
 knows here 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.540
 and 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.900
 what can work so well ATX 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.250
 in Kaiserswerth numbers do the subject dog you can underneath it 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.989
 Evaluate the result 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.479
 me Peter Pan 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.479
 so after the LVT Vienna is completed 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.249
 In May, I wonder if it's two with ball now 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:29.879
 the one with the poisonous info training in the sea flows here I have 20 52 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.139
 Percent advance on attack 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:38.930
 22 buy-up initiative around six on cocktail and this is there at percent 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.369
 Everton the board members were distributed 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.509
 STS day was trained and 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:51.679
 because according to British law and law, this leaves with three factions 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:57.599
 a whole 21 spurred billion, and that already at the w 50 and fared one 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.719
 what will become at Hundt 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.879
 Percent would make a difference and also ameliorate 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:13.329
 19 Initiative and municipalities only pv projects will soon break the four percent 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.750
 and at the t-home and back 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.530
 this one too had recently returned underneath with Marlies a not uncommon 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.909
 Numbers in front 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.549
 Sodom ORF still to prove that 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.609
 this 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.799
 Information also really bring something shared cockpit 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.749
 This is best demonstrated by an example 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:38.079
 and should be in the the pokemon songs and fight against that is called popcorn 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.459
 so 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.459
 Sacrifice language of Goethe's novel Haug 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.599
 so there is a bit 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.379
 it took a bit of a pause 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.550
 come on come you come so saved 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.749
 sda and countries for the first time 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:14.869
 first 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:18.759
 already trained with the under his care trained with wood and then 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.069
 then with the 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.069
 be well trained to help parents 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.120
 she praised but I have eleven percent 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.980
 today his wife percentage really plays the church love Petric 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.409
 Hypnotic case 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.009
 Hopp Hopp Hopp Hopp Hopp Hopp Hopp 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.009
 London 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.889
 as the race again 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.779
 it was good 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:51.770
 Therefore, be with them and twelve now well trained the product 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.770
 Geislingen with its branches 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:04:59.900
 and 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.780
 it does a lot 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.050
 and a little over half 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.050
 we remember that and 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.339
 let's see how many of us have the latest »crime scene« 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.589
 so and that includes Bernd Hoffmann 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.279
 bla bla bla bla faculty hobby group g FC Porto stuck 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.800
 Krabbelkäfer 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.380
 sealed with a great deal of sleeping aid 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.280
 Ghandy goes to the last fight 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.280
 the the 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.520
 so it is for its investors to occupy and occupy 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.240
 be well trained and be a guitarist 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.240
 and do »says Maaz the Vogtlander 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.580
 and look for Servette scored 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.409
 you'll see 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.219
 much more than last time 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.879
 Consider that was thought is only a bit but represents the first time 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:09.490
 in front 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.740
 it basically becomes a reason 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.409
 and around 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.590
 the Ravens from Hunted comes then it has to take this little bit 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.659
 and 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.830
 yes it's not that a lot of fields 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.210
 and so 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.710
 now that would have sweet lectures and brings her every Olpe before 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.319
 two weeks where in the canton of St 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.839
 So great great football if that's what you have to say last but not least 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.819
 Businesses come to wear
