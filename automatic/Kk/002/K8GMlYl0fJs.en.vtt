00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.809 
recognize just how great it was because
it<00:03:20.959> was<00:03:20.989> really<00:03:21.440> good<00:03:21.590> dancing<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.130> really<00:03:22.579> feel

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
it was really good dancing I really feel

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.390 
it was really good dancing I really feel
like<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.329> camera<00:03:23.690> didn't<00:03:23.959> catch<00:03:24.019> a<00:03:24.739> lot<00:03:25.340> of

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
like the camera didn't catch a lot of

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.949 
like the camera didn't catch a lot of
the<00:03:25.579> choreography<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.480> don't<00:03:26.750> think<00:03:26.840> that

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
the choreography so I don't think that

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.449 
the choreography so I don't think that
the<00:03:27.170> camera<00:03:27.530> caught<00:03:27.889> a<00:03:28.840> lot<00:03:29.840> of<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:31.160> the

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
the camera caught a lot of like the the

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.280 
the camera caught a lot of like the the
things<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:31.819> we<00:03:31.910> worked<00:03:32.180> hard<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.810> perfect

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
things that we worked hard to perfect

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.970 
things that we worked hard to perfect
yeah<00:03:33.829> so<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.819> think<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.690> audience<00:03:36.109> it<00:03:36.769> was

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
yeah so I think for the audience it was

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.520 
yeah so I think for the audience it was
it<00:03:37.220> was<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.370> good<00:03:37.579> show<00:03:37.819> but<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.120> as<00:03:38.780> far<00:03:39.019> as<00:03:39.139> TV

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
it was a good show but I as far as TV

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.259 
it was a good show but I as far as TV
goes<00:03:39.739> like<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.130> camera<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.459> caught<00:03:40.849> you

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
goes like the camera just caught you

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.599 
goes like the camera just caught you
know<00:03:41.389> the<00:03:41.510> art<00:03:41.720> is<00:03:41.930> always<00:03:42.319> like<00:03:42.709> that<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:43.069> Sean

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
know the art is always like that is Sean

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.699 
know the art is always like that is Sean
and<00:03:43.940> Sean<00:03:44.120> had<00:03:44.359> a<00:03:44.389> lot<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.660> like<00:03:44.959> good<00:03:45.319> ideas

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
and Sean had a lot of like good ideas

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.830 
and Sean had a lot of like good ideas
visually<00:03:45.980> for<00:03:46.579> like<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.880> whole<00:03:47.000> stage<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:47.690> I
