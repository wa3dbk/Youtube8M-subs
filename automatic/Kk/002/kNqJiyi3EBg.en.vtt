request kind of I've been asked many
times<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.920> create<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.730> League<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.330> lightsaber

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
times to create a League of lightsaber

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.160 
times to create a League of lightsaber
that<00:00:28.080> does<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:28.710> use<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.369> round<00:00:29.880> pieces<00:00:30.720> that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that does not use the round pieces that

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.639 
that does not use the round pieces that
I<00:00:31.309> use<00:00:32.309> very<00:00:32.520> commonly<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> lightsabers

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I use very commonly with the lightsabers

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.530 
I use very commonly with the lightsabers
so<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:35.940> dinking<00:00:36.210> around<00:00:36.270> with

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
so I was just dinking around with

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.569 
so I was just dinking around with
different<00:00:36.840> concepts<00:00:37.380> trying<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> figure<00:00:38.520> out

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
different concepts trying to figure out

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.299 
different concepts trying to figure out
what<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.390> possible<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> could<00:00:40.890> create

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
what was possible or what I could create

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.030 
what was possible or what I could create
and<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.940> had<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> pieces<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.890> come

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and what I had the pieces for and I come

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.930 
and what I had the pieces for and I come
up<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.870> modified<00:00:45.870> one-off<00:00:46.410> type

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
up with a modified one-off type

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.819 
up with a modified one-off type
lightsaber<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:49.070> mock-up<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.879> no

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
lightsaber this is a mock-up there is no

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.220 
lightsaber this is a mock-up there is no
correlation<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:54.420> anyone<00:00:54.809> else's

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
correlation with it to anyone else's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
correlation with it to anyone else's
lightsaber<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.949> far<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.879> just

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
lightsaber as far as I know I just

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.590 
lightsaber as far as I know I just
created<00:00:57.690> something<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.109> looked<00:00:58.469> cool<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
created something that looked cool and

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
created something that looked cool and
had<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.989> decent<00:01:01.230> concept<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> idea<00:01:02.460> behind

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
had a decent concept the idea behind

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
had a decent concept the idea behind
this<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> full-on<00:01:03.809> two-handed

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
this was to have a full-on two-handed

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.760 
this was to have a full-on two-handed
lightsaber<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.630> idea<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.869> me<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> this

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
lightsaber the idea for me was that this

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.760 
lightsaber the idea for me was that this
would<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.130> something<00:01:08.479> like<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.630> long<00:01:10.020> sword<00:01:10.500> or

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
would be something like a long sword or

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.620 
would be something like a long sword or
a<00:01:10.799> huge<00:01:11.189> sword<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:11.970> type<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.420> deal<00:01:12.600> but

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
a huge sword you know type of deal but

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.649 
a huge sword you know type of deal but
in<00:01:13.170> lightsaber<00:01:13.890> form<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> blade<00:01:15.210> itself

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
in lightsaber form so the blade itself

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
in lightsaber form so the blade itself
would<00:01:16.470> actually<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.979> longer<00:01:17.460> than<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.820> standard

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
would actually be longer than a standard

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.390 
would actually be longer than a standard
lightsaber<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.530> doesn't<00:01:19.799> really<00:01:19.920> make<00:01:20.340> sense

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
lightsaber it doesn't really make sense

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.820 
lightsaber it doesn't really make sense
because<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.270> far<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.960> tell<00:01:22.290> there<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.500> no

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
because as far as I can tell there is no

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.940 
because as far as I can tell there is no
weight<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.490> lightsaber<00:01:24.030> except<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
weight to a lightsaber except for the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.929 
weight to a lightsaber except for the
part<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.820> hold<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:28.579> don't<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:29.759> that

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
part you hold so I don't know what that

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
part you hold so I don't know what that
means<00:01:30.210> aside<00:01:30.659> from<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.439> whole<00:01:31.590> concept

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
means aside from that the whole concept

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.069 
means aside from that the whole concept
behind<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.700> two-handed<00:01:33.210> lightsaber<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.930> get

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
behind a two-handed lightsaber is to get

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.190 
behind a two-handed lightsaber is to get
a<00:01:34.110> harder<00:01:34.619> swing<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.659> those<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.990> there

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
a harder swing so for those out there

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.340 
a harder swing so for those out there
that<00:01:37.229> we're<00:01:37.619> looking<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.979> something<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
that we're looking for something that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.770 
that we're looking for something that
utilized<00:01:40.400> Legos<00:01:41.400> without<00:01:41.939> using<00:01:42.360> those<00:01:42.479> round

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
utilized Legos without using those round

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.550 
utilized Legos without using those round
pieces<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.159> good<00:01:44.790> start<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
pieces this is a good start for you the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.910 
pieces this is a good start for you the
base<00:01:46.890> concept<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.509> used<00:01:49.229> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
base concept here I think can be used to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.069 
base concept here I think can be used to
create<00:01:50.159> many<00:01:50.729> different<00:01:50.820> ideas<00:01:51.420> with

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
create many different ideas with

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.010 
create many different ideas with
lightsabers<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.520> biggest<00:01:53.850> issue<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.479> concept

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
lightsabers the biggest issue or concept

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.260 
lightsabers the biggest issue or concept
flaw<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:55.979> you're<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.909> no<00:01:57.119> matter

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
flaw that you're going to have no matter

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
flaw that you're going to have no matter
what<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.840> whether<00:01:58.469> or<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.040> fit<00:01:59.310> your
