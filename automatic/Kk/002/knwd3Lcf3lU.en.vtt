00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
bigger dogs over small dogs but we think

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.999 
bigger dogs over small dogs but we think
you<00:02:09.569> would<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.810> great<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.739> great<00:02:10.920> with

him<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.319> does<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.739> another<00:02:13.950> dog<00:02:14.160> we<00:02:14.340> think

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
him that does have another dog we think

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.670 
him that does have another dog we think
he<00:02:14.580> could<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:14.940> benefit<00:02:15.300> from<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.680> and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680

just older children just because he

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.640 
just older children just because he
thinks<00:02:24.420> he's<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.750> lap<00:02:24.870> dog<00:02:25.110> he<00:02:25.349> doesn't<00:02:25.590> know
