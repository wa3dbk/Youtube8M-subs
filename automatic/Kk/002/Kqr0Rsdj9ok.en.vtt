00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
but these are probably a close second

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
but these are probably a close second
but<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.909> hard<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.330> random

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
but it's it's hard to really random

but it's it's hard to really random
they're<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.799> well-executed<00:01:14.600> if<00:01:15.600> you

celebrate with him on a private birthday
party<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.400> he<00:02:15.580> displayed<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.570> lot<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.110> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
party and he displayed a lot of the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.560 
party and he displayed a lot of the
upcoming<00:02:17.590> way<00:02:17.830> tues<00:02:18.310> before<00:02:19.150> they<00:02:19.240> released

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
upcoming way tues before they released

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.390 
upcoming way tues before they released
and<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.350> was<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.860> was<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.070> first<00:02:21.250> time

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and so this was that was the first time

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.180 
and so this was that was the first time
that<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:21.640> saw<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:22.090> shoe<00:02:22.330> in<00:02:22.480> person<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.190> I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that I saw this shoe in person and I

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.520 
that I saw this shoe in person and I
wanted<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:25.030> her<00:02:25.120> sense<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:26.440> know

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
wanted to have her sense and you know

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.050 
wanted to have her sense and you know
almost<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.950> year<00:02:27.130> later<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.400> finally<00:02:27.610> got<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.850> pair

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
almost a year later I finally got a pair

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.100 
almost a year later I finally got a pair
so<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.950> yeah<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> sample<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:32.080> that

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
so but yeah this is a sample so that

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.170 
so but yeah this is a sample so that
these<00:02:32.500> never<00:02:32.860> released<00:02:33.280> again<00:02:33.970> these<00:02:34.120> were

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
these never released again these were

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.870 
these never released again these were
friends<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.660> family<00:02:35.020> only<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.890> believe<00:02:36.459> that

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
friends and family only I believe that

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.449 
friends and family only I believe that
the<00:02:37.090> factory<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.510> China<00:02:37.750> did<00:02:38.170> did<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.070> did

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
the factory in China did did you did

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.510 
the factory in China did did you did
have<00:02:39.640> some<00:02:39.880> leaks<00:02:40.120> there's<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:41.310> extra<00:02:42.310> set<00:02:42.489> of

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
have some leaks there's a extra set of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.410 
have some leaks there's a extra set of
laces<00:02:42.910> again<00:02:43.660> these<00:02:43.780> are<00:02:43.840> 3m<00:02:44.200> laces<00:02:44.560> as<00:02:44.709> well

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
laces again these are 3m laces as well

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.350 
laces again these are 3m laces as well
white<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.870> 3mm<00:02:47.670> wit<00:02:48.670> woven<00:02:49.090> throughout

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
white with the 3mm wit woven throughout

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.760 
white with the 3mm wit woven throughout
but<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.830> sample<00:02:51.100> pair<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.770> it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
but this is a sample pair and it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.190 
but this is a sample pair and it
actually<00:02:53.920> does<00:02:54.250> have<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.580> sample<00:02:54.910> tag<00:02:55.200> you

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
actually does have the sample tag you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.600 
actually does have the sample tag you
can<00:02:56.380> see<00:02:56.560> there<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:58.450> they<00:02:58.600> are<00:02:58.750> size<00:02:59.020> 15<00:02:59.610> it's

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
can see there and they are size 15 it's

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.970 
can see there and they are size 15 it's
been<00:03:00.850> unusual<00:03:01.360> because<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.959> lot<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.470> sample

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
been unusual because a lot of the sample

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.370 
been unusual because a lot of the sample
way<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.790> Wade's<00:03:04.060> some<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.810> them<00:03:04.959> have<00:03:05.170> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
way of Wade's some of them have the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.770 
way of Wade's some of them have the
sample<00:03:05.739> tag<00:03:05.920> inside<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.700> some<00:03:06.910> don't<00:03:07.120> I've

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
sample tag inside and some don't I've

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.479 
sample tag inside and some don't I've
never<00:03:07.989> really<00:03:08.350> been<00:03:08.380> able<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.800> determine<00:03:09.040> why

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
never really been able to determine why

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.900 
never really been able to determine why
there's<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:09.880> discrepancy<00:03:10.180> there<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:11.910> most

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
there's a discrepancy there but most

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.360 
there's a discrepancy there but most
likely<00:03:13.090> it's<00:03:13.480> because<00:03:13.709> some<00:03:14.709> are<00:03:14.739> actually

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
likely it's because some are actually

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.789 
likely it's because some are actually
officially<00:03:16.269> issued<00:03:16.690> samples<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.590> they<00:03:17.680> get

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
officially issued samples so they get

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.470 
officially issued samples so they get
the<00:03:17.920> tag<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.340> then<00:03:18.489> some<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:19.030> come<00:03:19.180> off<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
the tag and then some just come off the

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.860 
the tag and then some just come off the
line<00:03:19.660> they're<00:03:20.440> not<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.650> full<00:03:20.950> production

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
line they're not a full production

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.870 
line they're not a full production
retail<00:03:22.870> version<00:03:23.350> but<00:03:24.190> they<00:03:24.370> don't<00:03:24.519> have<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.670> tag

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
retail version but they don't have a tag

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.000 
retail version but they don't have a tag
either<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.480> there<00:03:25.799> but<00:03:26.799> they're<00:03:26.920> still

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
either so there but they're still

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.740 
either so there but they're still
considered<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.519> sample<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:27.880> guess<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.299> there's

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
considered a sample I guess so there's

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.259 
considered a sample I guess so there's
those<00:03:29.019> end<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.320> leaking<00:03:29.730> really<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> icy

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
those end up leaking really like the icy

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.350 
those end up leaking really like the icy
outsole<00:03:32.370> you'll<00:03:33.370> notice<00:03:33.730> if<00:03:33.940> you've<00:03:34.060> seen<00:03:34.209> any

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
iceman to lowes they yellow quite easily

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.430 
iceman to lowes they yellow quite easily
and<00:03:51.299> even<00:03:52.299> out<00:03:52.390> of<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> box<00:03:52.780> there<00:03:53.079> yellowed

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
and even out of the box there yellowed

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.910 
and even out of the box there yellowed
and<00:03:53.650> these<00:03:55.049> don't<00:03:56.049> really<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.530> mean<00:03:56.650> there's<00:03:56.860> a

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
and these don't really I mean there's a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.979 
and these don't really I mean there's a
little<00:03:57.160> bit<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:57.880> can<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.720> camera

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
little bit of you can and the camera

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.960 
little bit of you can and the camera
probably<00:03:59.320> won't<00:03:59.440> even<00:03:59.530> pick<00:03:59.799> it<00:03:59.829> up<00:03:59.980> right<00:04:00.910> in

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
probably won't even pick it up right in
