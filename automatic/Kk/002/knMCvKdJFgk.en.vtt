hello<00:00:08.400> everybody<00:00:08.610> today<00:00:08.790> we're<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.360> be

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
hello everybody today we're going to be

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.320 
hello everybody today we're going to be
going<00:00:09.660> through<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.320> last<00:00:10.530> four<00:00:11.010> edges<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
going through the last four edges on the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.820 
going through the last four edges on the
seven<00:00:12.630> by<00:00:12.719> seven<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.170> they<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.679> most

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
seven by seven because they are the most

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.550 
seven by seven because they are the most
difficult<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.639> like<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.109> nine<00:00:16.410> by

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
difficult and just like in the nine by

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650 
difficult and just like in the nine by
nine<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.949> eight<00:00:17.130> by<00:00:17.310> eight<00:00:17.490> walk<00:00:18.359> throughs

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
nine and eight by eight walk throughs

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.700 
nine and eight by eight walk throughs
we're<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.199> using<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> same

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
we're going to be using the same

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.769 
we're going to be using the same
algorithm<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.369> flipping<00:00:20.730> algorithm<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.689> I'm

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
algorithm the flipping algorithm but I'm

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.759 
algorithm the flipping algorithm but I'm
going<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.960> go<00:00:22.020> through<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.260> again<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.619> in

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
going to go through it again just in

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.720 
going to go through it again just in
case<00:00:22.800> you're<00:00:23.100> new<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.279> my<00:00:23.369> channel<00:00:23.400> you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
case you're new to my channel you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.070 
case you're new to my channel you
haven't<00:00:23.939> seen<00:00:24.119> them<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.900> haven't

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
haven't seen them or you haven't

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960 
haven't seen them or you haven't
memorized<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> yet<00:00:25.560> or<00:00:25.800> something<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.699> anyways

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
memorized it yet or something so anyways

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
memorized it yet or something so anyways
what<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> does<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> flips<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.109> whole<00:00:28.289> edge

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
what it does is it flips a whole edge

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.990 
what it does is it flips a whole edge
and<00:00:28.830> that's<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> only<00:00:29.340> technique<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.880> we're

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
and that's the only technique that we're

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.389 
and that's the only technique that we're
going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> use<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.599> order<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.900> build<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.890> or

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
going to use in order to build the or

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.100 
going to use in order to build the or
the<00:00:32.550> only<00:00:32.669> algorithm<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.239> should<00:00:33.420> say<00:00:33.600> using<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the only algorithm I should say using to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.840 
the only algorithm I should say using to
build<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> last<00:00:34.559> four<00:00:34.829> edges<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
build the last four edges and the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.209 
build the last four edges and the
algorithm<00:00:36.329> goes<00:00:36.360> R<00:00:37.350> u<00:00:38.160> R<00:00:38.430> prime<00:00:38.910> F<00:00:39.469> R<00:00:40.469> prime<00:00:40.890> F

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
algorithm goes R u R prime F R prime F

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.069 
algorithm goes R u R prime F R prime F
prime<00:00:41.840> R<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.610> flips<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.149> over<00:00:45.239> so

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
prime R and that just flips it over so

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.880 
prime R and that just flips it over so
basically<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.890> go

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
basically what I'm going to do is go

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
basically what I'm going to do is go
through<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.489> look<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:51.960> nice

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
through and look at I see a really nice

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
through and look at I see a really nice
case<00:00:52.379> already<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:53.070> at<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> edges<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
case already look at all the edges and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.910 
case already look at all the edges and
see<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.170> need<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.449> done<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.739> one

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
see what I need to be done so I see one

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.099 
see what I need to be done so I see one
really<00:00:59.190> quick<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.600> this

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
really quick that I want to do it's this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
really quick that I want to do it's this
one<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> good<00:01:02.129> case<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.640> showed<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.000> on

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
one this is a good case I showed this on

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.520 
one this is a good case I showed this on
the<00:01:03.359> nine<00:01:03.480> by<00:01:03.629> nine<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.260> bit<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the nine by nine and a little bit on the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.000 
the nine by nine and a little bit on the
eight<00:01:04.650> by<00:01:04.830> eight<00:01:04.979> where<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.560> backwards

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
eight by eight where this is backwards

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
eight by eight where this is backwards
so<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.460> see<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.720> center<00:01:10.140> piece

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so we can see that this the center piece

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.070 
so we can see that this the center piece
is<00:01:10.590> always<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.670> anything<00:01:12.360> else<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.869> might

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is always right anything else here might

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.750 
is always right anything else here might
be<00:01:13.110> wrong<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
be wrong so I know that this is going to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570 
be wrong so I know that this is going to
be<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.509> red<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.960> white<00:01:16.200> side<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.369> is

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
be the red and white side this is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.749 
be the red and white side this is
backwards<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.930> belongs<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
backwards so it belongs down here and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.520 
backwards so it belongs down here and
this<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.060> belongs<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.470> I'm

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this one belongs up there so what I'm

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.080 
this one belongs up there so what I'm
going<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> put<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> same<00:01:23.790> row

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
going to do is put this in the same row

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.050 
going to do is put this in the same row
is<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> by<00:01:24.600> turning<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.049> over<00:01:26.030> back<00:01:27.030> over

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
is that by turning it over back over

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.980 
is that by turning it over back over
here<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> kick<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.400> out

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
here and I'm going to kick this one out

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.770 
here and I'm going to kick this one out
using<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> I've<00:01:33.030> kicked<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.659> out

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
using that so I've kicked that one out

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.109 
using that so I've kicked that one out
over<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> flip<00:01:35.880> this

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
over to here now I'm going to flip this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.289 
over to here now I'm going to flip this
edge<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:38.130> algorithm<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> description

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
edge the algorithm is in the description

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.460 
edge the algorithm is in the description
I<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.570> want<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.840> through<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> every<00:01:40.229> time

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I don't want to go through it every time

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.850 
I don't want to go through it every time
and<00:01:41.540> bring<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.619> see

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and bring this back and now you can see

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.300 
and bring this back and now you can see
that<00:01:44.369> we've<00:01:44.549> created<00:01:44.930> one<00:01:45.930> entire<00:01:46.259> edge<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that we've created one entire edge so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.710 
that we've created one entire edge so
let's<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.579> through<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.540> one

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
let's go through I can see that this one

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.270 
let's go through I can see that this one
here<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.079> also<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.560> same<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.130> thing

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
here is also the same kind of thing

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.330 
here is also the same kind of thing
going<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:55.189> think<00:01:56.189> that

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
going on so I think that I think that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.709 
going on so I think that I think that
that's<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that's what I'm going to do I'm going to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.420 
that's what I'm going to do I'm going to
bring<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:59.060> the<00:02:00.060> same<00:02:00.299> plane<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
bring this in the same plane as this so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
bring this in the same plane as this so
turn<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> over<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> same

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
turn it over so now it's in the same

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.490 
turn it over so now it's in the same
plane<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.340> kick<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.060> out

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.390 

and<00:02:08.590> now<00:02:09.310> I'm<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.330> flip<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.660> edge<00:02:14.400> bring

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
and now I'm going to flip the edge bring

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.030 
and now I'm going to flip the edge bring
it<00:02:15.520> back<00:02:15.730> which<00:02:16.630> brings<00:02:16.900> back<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.440> one<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.830> I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
it back which brings back this one and I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.590 
it back which brings back this one and I
know<00:02:18.100> that's<00:02:18.340> not<00:02:18.460> where<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.790> belongs<00:02:19.090> because

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
know that's not where it belongs because

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.630 
know that's not where it belongs because
that's<00:02:20.200> not<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:20.710> we<00:02:21.160> have<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.430> bring

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
that's not the one we have to bring

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.140 
that's not the one we have to bring
these<00:02:21.940> two<00:02:22.920> underneath<00:02:23.920> here<00:02:24.310> now<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:25.000> what<00:02:25.120> I

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
these two underneath here now so what I

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.050 
these two underneath here now so what I
want<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.420> do<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.750> bring<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.260> underneath

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
want to do is bring this underneath

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.680 
want to do is bring this underneath
where<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.090> belongs

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
where it belongs

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.310 
where it belongs
and<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:30.360> flip<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.540> over<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:31.990> it'll<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.200> on

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
and then flip this over so it'll be on

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.660 
and then flip this over so it'll be on
these<00:02:32.470> three<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:32.890> protect<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.370> for<00:02:33.520> when<00:02:33.640> I

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
these three and protect it for when I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.990 
these three and protect it for when I
bring<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.000> back<00:02:38.490> just<00:02:39.490> like<00:02:39.580> that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
bring this back just like that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.150 
bring this back just like that
and<00:02:40.090> now<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.690> want<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.110> bring<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.740> location

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
and now I want to bring to this location

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.180 
and now I want to bring to this location
underneath<00:02:42.790> these<00:02:43.240> two<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:44.230> bring<00:02:44.440> both<00:02:44.980> of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
underneath these two so bring both of

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.750 
underneath these two so bring both of
these<00:02:45.340> underneath<00:02:45.880> these<00:02:46.870> two<00:02:47.340> flip<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.550> and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
these underneath these two flip this and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.520 
these underneath these two flip this and
now<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:52.000> bring<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.300> back<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.290> now<00:02:53.380> we've

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
now I can bring this back so now we've

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.770 
now I can bring this back so now we've
got<00:02:53.710> this<00:02:53.860> one<00:02:54.070> done<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.460> this<00:02:54.940> one<00:02:55.090> done<00:02:55.270> not

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
got this one done and this one done not

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.630 
got this one done and this one done not
spring<00:02:56.140> these<00:02:56.350> two<00:02:56.530> close<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.310> each<00:02:57.400> other<00:02:57.490> so

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
spring these two close to each other so

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.120 
spring these two close to each other so
we<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.910> see<00:02:58.180> what<00:02:58.300> we<00:02:58.390> need<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.660> do<00:02:59.070> all<00:03:00.070> right

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
we can see what we need to do all right

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.220 
we can see what we need to do all right
again<00:03:00.820> we've<00:03:01.030> got<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.450> kind<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.780> thing<00:03:01.870> where

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
again we've got this kind of thing where

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.260 
again we've got this kind of thing where
the<00:03:02.440> center<00:03:02.800> is<00:03:02.830> here<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.460> we've<00:03:03.910> got<00:03:04.090> one

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
the center is here and we've got one

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.180 
the center is here and we've got one
flipped<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.230> we've<00:03:05.380> got<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.680> correct<00:03:06.040> one

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
flipped and we've got the correct one

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.730 
flipped and we've got the correct one
that<00:03:06.310> belongs<00:03:06.670> here<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.540> same<00:03:07.780> plane<00:03:08.140> so

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
that belongs here in the same plane so

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.210 
that belongs here in the same plane so
what<00:03:08.890> we're<00:03:09.010> going<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.160> do<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.550> move<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.030> in

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
what we're going to do is move that in

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.300 
what we're going to do is move that in
kicking<00:03:12.220> out<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.370> one<00:03:12.550> that's<00:03:12.730> wrong<00:03:13.000> flip<00:03:13.780> it

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.580 

bring<00:03:18.310> this<00:03:18.430> back<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.120> now<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.350> need

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
bring this back and now we just need

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.729 
bring this back and now we just need
this<00:03:20.709> one<00:03:20.950> piece<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:23.260> see<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.560> we<00:03:23.709> are

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
this one piece and I see that we are

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.570 
this one piece and I see that we are
going<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.190> have<00:03:25.200> parity<00:03:26.200> that's<00:03:26.980> okay<00:03:27.250> because

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
going to have parity that's okay because

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.729 
going to have parity that's okay because
we<00:03:27.880> have<00:03:27.910> algorithms<00:03:28.420> for<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:29.500> one

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
we have algorithms for that so this one

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.900 
we have algorithms for that so this one
is<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:32.380> one<00:03:32.590> right<00:03:32.709> here<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:33.160> we<00:03:33.670> need<00:03:33.790> to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
is this one right here and we need to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.040 
is this one right here and we need to
bring<00:03:34.090> this<00:03:34.209> underneath<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.780> which<00:03:34.870> means

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
bring this underneath it which means

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.780 
bring this underneath it which means
that<00:03:35.170> we<00:03:35.320> have<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.560> flip<00:03:35.830> this<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.520> instead<00:03:36.700> of

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
that we have to flip this so instead of

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.920 
that we have to flip this so instead of
doing<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.030> flipping<00:03:37.300> algorithm<00:03:37.720> I'm<00:03:37.780> just

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
doing the flipping algorithm I'm just

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.090 
doing the flipping algorithm I'm just
going<00:03:38.050> to<00:03:38.110> turn<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.320> over<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.650> put<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:38.950> back

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
going to turn it over and put it back

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.350 
going to turn it over and put it back
here<00:03:39.519> bring<00:03:40.360> this<00:03:40.450> location<00:03:41.019> under<00:03:41.230> it<00:03:42.360> I'm

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
here bring this location under it I'm

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:51.660 
here bring this location under it I'm
going<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.630> flip<00:03:43.870> this<00:03:44.019> over<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:48.660> then<00:03:50.670> realign

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
going to flip this over and then realign

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.790 
going to flip this over and then realign
now<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.630> can<00:03:52.900> see<00:03:53.110> that<00:03:53.200> they're<00:03:53.350> all<00:03:53.380> done

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
now you can see that they're all done

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.780 
now you can see that they're all done
except<00:03:54.550> for<00:03:55.019> this<00:03:56.019> one<00:03:56.230> this<00:03:56.560> parity<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.160> I

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
except for this one this parity and I

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.770 
except for this one this parity and I
know<00:03:57.850> there's<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.180> couple<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.570> different

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
know there's a couple of different

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.449 
know there's a couple of different
algorithms<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.440> I'm<00:03:59.620> not<00:03:59.769> very<00:03:59.980> fast<00:04:00.250> with

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
algorithms and I'm not very fast with

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.100 
algorithms and I'm not very fast with
the<00:04:00.550> finger<00:04:00.820> tricks<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.300> don't<00:04:01.480> usually<00:04:01.780> do

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
the finger tricks I don't usually do

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.710 
the finger tricks I don't usually do
these<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:03.489> know<00:04:03.610> double<00:04:03.940> flick<00:04:04.180> moves<00:04:04.480> or

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
these you know double flick moves or

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.120 
these you know double flick moves or
anything<00:04:04.750> I'm<00:04:05.440> not<00:04:05.590> going<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.800> go<00:04:05.860> through<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
anything I'm not going to go through the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.610 
anything I'm not going to go through the
algorithm<00:04:06.340> I'm<00:04:06.700> just<00:04:07.000> going<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.239> actually<00:04:08.200> I

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
algorithm I'm just going to actually I

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.009 
algorithm I'm just going to actually I
guess<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.950> can<00:04:09.070> go<00:04:09.250> through<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:10.750> for<00:04:10.959> you

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
guess I can go through it just for you

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.290 
guess I can go through it just for you
guys<00:04:11.170> who<00:04:11.320> want<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.560> know<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.120> grip

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
guys who want to know it's you can grip

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.300 
guys who want to know it's you can grip
both<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.690> these<00:04:13.810> layers<00:04:14.050> when<00:04:14.320> you<00:04:14.440> do<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.709> the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
both of these layers when you do it the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.909 
both of these layers when you do it the

and R 2 and that is the edges I'm sure

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.040 
and R 2 and that is the edges I'm sure
by<00:04:45.400> now<00:04:45.430> after<00:04:45.789> watching<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.240> 9<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.569> 8<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:46.960> the

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
by now after watching the 9 to 8 and the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.379 
by now after watching the 9 to 8 and the
7<00:04:47.229> you<00:04:47.919> have<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:48.159> pretty<00:04:48.430> good<00:04:48.550> concept<00:04:48.759> on<00:04:49.150> how

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
7 you have a pretty good concept on how

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.149 
7 you have a pretty good concept on how
to<00:04:49.449> do<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.169> could<00:04:50.259> really<00:04:50.440> just<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:51.009> could

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
to do it you could really just you could

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.649 
to do it you could really just you could
solve<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.580> hundred<00:04:51.849> by<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:51.970> hundred<00:04:52.060> using<00:04:52.569> the

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
solve a hundred by a hundred using the

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.210 
solve a hundred by a hundred using the
same<00:04:52.900> method<00:04:53.259> all<00:04:53.710> of<00:04:53.979> it

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
same method all of it

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.719 
same method all of it
alright<00:04:54.849> guys<00:04:54.969> thanks<00:04:55.330> for<00:04:55.419> watching
