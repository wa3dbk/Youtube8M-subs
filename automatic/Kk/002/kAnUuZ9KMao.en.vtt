00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:30.960
 hi this video is not about cars 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:34.140
 This video gardeners lovers I what 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 I am therefore not sure what to do 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.040
 I decided to ask you my advice 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.040
 there is a tree subscribers 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.720
 called columnar apple 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:51.390
 pretty good tree for him just 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.770
 three years, u will return it for 3 years already I 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.059
 planted in the fall in the spring of next year 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:03.619
 grown 10 apples on it by the way she especially 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.979
 in growth did not increase next year 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:12.780
 there were no apples at all for this year 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.750
 It turned out that she blossomed I decided 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.479
 see what's going to grow up honestly 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.740
 saying i was shocked a tree in not growing 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.450
 added that is how would see if 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 the trunk is not so big at all but 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.800
 So that's so bad, but if 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:39.000
 look here here are apples here are apples 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:43.560
 you see the camera is not very close 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.500
 you can do it in a prominent place and here are the apples 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:53.780
 here apples apples can generally be long 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.780
 show right here i will be here 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.390
 here is an apple total I counted 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.410
 somewhere around fifty apples with given 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.640
 the fact that these apples here were growing 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:13.700
 about centimeters 6 7 such here 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 so then I imagine this will be the floor 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.240
 hundreds of apples how much will it all weigh 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:24.010
 i'm honest i'm afraid that these 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:27.380
 tiny twigs just broken off and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.250
 here's how to deal with this situation 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:35.180
 opinion to tear off all the small apples to 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.600
 there are a dozen and a half two apples left 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.860
 on such the most-most-most wanted to 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.520
 would anyone ask gardeners 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.450
 is besides body repair how 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.310
 better to do 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.230
 or leave as it is but props 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.280
 it is unreal to put subtree in general 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.330
 I can't even imagine how to do it 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.220
 tie up just one left 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.090
 cut the apples or wait while she 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.100
 collapse of the suspension branches break off 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.050
 because when the first year grew 10 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.050
 apples and I myself was shocked as she stood 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.260
 write in the comments if someone 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.950
 understands understands in this matter I do not 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.070
 gardener and gardener special but somehow 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.080
 need to solve this problem bye 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.080
 hi waiting for comments
