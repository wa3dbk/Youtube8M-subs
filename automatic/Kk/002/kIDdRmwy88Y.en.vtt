 ok so you go through the hallway of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.750
 right and then you 'll be careful 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.649
 you 'll go take this little key to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.649
 wheel that provides the best 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.700
 perfect normally you have to 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.470
 hear the distinctive little noise that 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.930
 confirms that you took it so with the 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.940
 x key on xbox the square on 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.620
 playstation when you get it 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.720
 and as loopback is activated the 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.950
 first generator to turn on the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.270
 current possibly if you do not 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.760
 do not know I'm two stone 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.440
 shots in this one we'll say in this 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.090
 same video I show you at the same time 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.580
 like turning on the power to be able to 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.869
 activate the world the exo combination so 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.090
 your exoskeleton simply 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.619
 then he will choose this door where 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.750
 the other door is the same thing all 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.820
 way you will spend exactly the same 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.130
 number of money there the way that you me 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.040
 way taken is the way to the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.690
 general room to activate the whole 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.160
 of the current that means all the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.570
 generators must be turned on 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.580
 see the little red threads that you 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.920
 drive the wheel generators it takes all 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.190
 enabled the banks to be able to have 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.660
 the set of active generators must 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.039
 see that I'm going to do a little fade 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.060
 chained because for the simple and 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.530
 good reason that I did not have enough 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.890
 of money force and a list of 150 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.710
 points 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.140
 so a bit later we arrive 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.520
 to this famous in the sleeve and after 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.250
 simply to this famous room 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.110
 mainstream or what I'm going 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.090
 have to activate so you still see that 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.729
 I was still looking for etc 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.170
 there is no problem I will look for 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.030
 the last generator everything you have 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.200
 to look at each other and we'll say in the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.970
 piece the red thread of the domain 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.950
 generally to the generators you will see 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.150
 that I was slightly tired 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.590
 when I realize them is this video 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.099
 but there are no worries I activate the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.990
 generator 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.640
 we'll go straight on, you'll see 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.470
 in a few seconds so buy 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.080
 our range the exos survival you have to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.060
 recover imperatively here and it's 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.810
 just next look right next you 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.810

 distinctive there one is back in the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.700
 main round when active and the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.709
 current point and this time you go 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.489
 on the other side and you select this 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:51.200
 little corpse 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:53.209
