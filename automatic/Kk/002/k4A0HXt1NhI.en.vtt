00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.509
 hello people welcome to another class 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.550
 of ecology and today we will continue 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 our subject ecosystems a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.310
 ecosystem is basically composed of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 two very important parts of the factors 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.119
 biotic and biotic factors to the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.270
 biotic factors are the living factors of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.350
 an ecosystem would be the living community 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.379
 This is a community community. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.829
 it would be a community community 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.570
 would be the set of populations 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.930
 Oh my god, address 15, which is one 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.520
 Population population is a set of 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.960
 individuals of the same species 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.010
 so if I have a community I 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.440
 I have a set of populations 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.250
 different or I have a set 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.410
 of different species living in a 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.780
 certain environment, this is a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.970
 So many species of trees 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.340
 species of micro-organisms species of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.229
 Species monkeys than thought might 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 have in a certain environment 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.750
 only that is not only what forum 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.860
 ecosystem, we need factors to 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.810
 biotic know when the act in front 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.990
 of the word he denies that he comes next 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.640
 then the abiotic factor is a factor not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.130
 i live right 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.619
 that is, the non-living things that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.270
 allow life looks just that romantic 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.210
 How philosophical and I just told 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.430
 you a non-living thing that allows you to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.130
 very important life for example would be 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.899
 light that makes photosynthesis is allows 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.460
 photosynthesis would be the water would be the phd in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.470
 a particular environment can not be 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.840
 very basic acid it has to have 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 finally the pph suitable for a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.909
 community is not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:01.049
 to salinity the nutrients that have a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.750
 certain environment, all this is 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.240
 considered abiotic factors then 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.209
 when in the community with the factors 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.700
 that allow her to live has a 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.800
 right ecosystem 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.470
 Good people, what I want 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.420
 I mean with that for you people 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.670
 will start to enter here in the structure 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.420
 of a community 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 're following you will start talking 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.850
 in trophic levels trophic levels are 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.310
 actually tact food levels have 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.380
 a certain hierarchy a word 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.850
 inadequate but it has some some 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.900
 organization when the subject is 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.350
 food 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.890
 you have a community always always 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.260
 producer and should have a 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.530
 always with composer too 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.120
 who is a producer is the producer 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.900
 that produces organic matter for 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.850
 you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.110
 In the previous video we talked about 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.820
 photosynthesis 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.890
 then in most ecosystems 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.220
 terrestrial we have with the producer 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.900
 someone who is photosynthesizing photos 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.270
 inter x angel only that there are other types 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.040
 of autographs, that is to say 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.150
 there are others and types of living beings 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.170
 which may come from organic matter 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.950
 to practice it did not lack people spoke 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.489
 glucose was that it was the food of beings 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.660
 there is another type of 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:36.140
 trophic metabolism that is aaa to forget 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:39.150
 which is here my synthesis that tells me the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.180
 big tse teaser difficult to write 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.830
 which my synthesizes before '' difficult 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.690
 writing and speaking at the same time is a 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.920
 art is very difficult only after years 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.200
 of practice 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.030
 so the producer is always a 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.950
 photosynthesizing or 1 kimi 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.170
 sympathetic the difference between 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.090
 two that the energy to 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.360
 photosynthesizers produce their 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.750
 their organic matter comes from the 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.300
 light so photo comes from photon ne 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.640
 And what's more interesting also produces the 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.590
 same food produces organic matter 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.150
 only that energy does not come from light comes from 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.910
 a chemical reaction 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.380
 usually an oxidation reaction that 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.840
 can happen spontaneously in the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.080
 environment or induced by the micro 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.669
 body but is a chemical reaction that 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.320
 releases energy're 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.810
 and this energy will be harnessed to 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.100
 the construction of organic matter 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.010
 it's chemical action ok 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.470
 Good if you have who produces the food. 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.260
 has to have it in a coma then right then 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.660
 consumers will be 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.030
 the guys that are is to have others is to have 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.770
 other moat 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.200
 then having another child has 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.570
 different categories have the guy that he 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.130
 herbivore is what I want to start 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.290
 plant has the face that is carnivorous that I 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.800
 I want to like your face and I have a face that is 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.150
 omnivore I want here got the egg up 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.120
 playing in the drawer 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.430
 the joke do not write it down there the guy 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.190
 which is omnivorous, it feeds on both 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.639
 sources it runs as much plant as it is 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.190
 Animal food source then're these 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.530
 three guys are erotic so they are 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.810
 consumers need to eat a 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.470
 photosynthetic or someone eating a 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.700
 photosynthesizers and decomposers 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.130
 interact with all other levels 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.460
 trophic right because they have to recover 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.590
 die everybody die die 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.350
 microorganism dies motorcycle bug world 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.110
 everyone has to be decomposed who 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.289
 are composer decomposers 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:48.330
 are usually fungi and some 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:52.010
 tac bacteria are also erotic right 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.780
 then on our first trophic level 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:59.010
 there will always be producers 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.650
 're consumers will be right ahead 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.990
 may have in the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th level 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.389
 never in the first and the 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.330
 decomposers interact with all 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:13.050
 trophic levels because everyone dies 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:17.210
 Agents a kiss for you and even 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.210
 the next video went
