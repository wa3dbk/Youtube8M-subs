00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 new video

 the nike and 3 double so that's the beast 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.210
 I ordered it a week later 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.050

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.829
 that I wear today is with the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.540
 light manager 3 so that's the beast I do not 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.399
 do not turn the video with the lights 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.930
 artificial since bourges was only 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.600

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.790
 present the nike and 3 that you 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.820
 can see at least the colors at the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.959
 natural light that would not hurt 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.689

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:13.709

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.439
