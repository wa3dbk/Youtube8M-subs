 It goes itself galvan Here it is so packed 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.130
 on a needle 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:17.799
 not so very much so much like triniti 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:21.640
 sews wrong here such strings to me 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:25.450

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.370
 how are they available to almost everyone yes 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.889
 you can bet someone likes them 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.780
 design and to someone not but these kits 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:36.849
 any needlewoman can afford 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.889
 prices are very affordable 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.549
 even on a premium set price of 380 hryvnia 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.120
 this 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.069
 considering a very good price 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.650
 they are normal beautiful beautiful 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:57.599
 sets in the region of 100 150 hryvnia for 80 70 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:01.450
 hryvnia so i like these sets 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:05.620
 Look how much and do not even know 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.739
 how many hanks here I find it difficult 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.549
 say probably black black goes on 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:18.849
 otherwise. four 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:22.979
 a lot of black here is a lot of gray 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.979
 too, and this is such a 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:32.570
 gray color and this is the scheme 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.970
 huge color 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:41.540
 colors character scheme than me not 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.940
 like a scheme of such a plan only 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.680
 paper here if paper was not 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.850
 glossy because i will allow i 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.910
 I mark with a marker 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:05:00.050
 what I am embroidering and of course the marker is not 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:02.600
 takes glossy paper here 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.980
 the only thing that I don't like so much 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:10.340
 everyone is pleased with the content of the set 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:15.100
 In general, the girls basically have which 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:19.280
 do not mark at all sew parking I sew 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.380
 either by color or if it is big 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.420
 work then 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.880
 I embroider parking but within one 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.260
 a quarter of a square by color lazy 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:33.250
 parking and for somehow called somehow 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.250
 so probably 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:48.500
 such a wonderful scheme I am very pleased 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.500
 the acquisition 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.600
 so who like you can safely 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.780
 order more on my sheep 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.110
 needlewoman still price in principle 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.980
 very off scale 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.590
 You can try to order this set 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:17.410
