00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.409

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.390
 inside besides this told ia price 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.010
 this supplement so that's all who 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.580
 weeks after opening will be able to get into

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.180
 but hereafter after passing the first 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.460
 quarter will have to pay extra 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.420
 entry into each quarter will cost the player 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.820
 seven hundred gold 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.560
 or 230 rubles at the same time will be 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.000
 the ability to immediately purchase a set of all 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.100
 quarters but note 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 even if you buy everything does not open 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.090
 will be one per week also 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.100
 reported on the heroic mode of each 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.869
 quarter after killing all the bosses in 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.149
 there you will gain access to the heroic 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.830
 mode complexity there will be much more and 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.349
 even veterans of the game will be able to feel 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.430
 some discomfort but in reward for it 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.110
 new card shirt is waiting for you 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.459
 long since started an open beta test 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.769
 game arh lord 2 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.900
 as it became known at the stage of experience and will 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.420
 4 servers are available , each of which 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.459
 tied to his country 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.739
 Russian as you know there is no essence 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.840
 games in pvp it uses the standard 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.849
 Bidding that new combat system and indeed 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.989
 nothing special is remarkable on 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.880
 same bt 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.470
 players will have the opportunity to choose one 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.300
 of two fractions and raise bye 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.190
 maximum 41 level 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.470
 also in the game at the testing stage will be 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.970
 missing the main feature 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.980
 massive pvp battles and indeed 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.319
 much of the content here to me 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.920
 it is personally unclear why carry out an open 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.989
 beta test 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.790
 and not give access to everything when already 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.180
 the world about it can be safely considered 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.650
 game release 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.840
 by the way about the releases not so long ago 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.299
 developers from red five studios 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.470
 reported the release of their ever changing 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.950
 firefall games 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.260
 release date is scheduled for July 29 and early 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.940
 access 15 game that will also 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.340
 distributed as free-to-play 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.650
 right now you can buy inside 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.299
 play sets for 30 or 100 dollars 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.220
 I really don't know who needs it 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.950
 the game has shown from the very first days 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.019
 what is the innovation interesting in 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.510
 quotes of course and as I understand it 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.190
 also nothing has changed personal play 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.000
 I'm definitely not going to this one 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.920
 I advise recently on the official website 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.989
 league of league games appeared next 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.269
 an article in which the developers told 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.670
 what to expect in the game and there is no speech 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.280
 will not go about updating the gorge but about 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.440
 teaching players how do you know the threshold of games 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.150
 moba genre is always damn high 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.859
 compared to other games even though 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.350
 the fact that they are played by millions of players 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.540
 around the world and so developers from 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.549
 Paradise games decided that their current mode 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.100
 learning does not fit players around 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.900
 create a new bot and mentors namely 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.030
 so they baptized their update 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.070
 allow poets players to learn the game 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.810
 self tuning complexity 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.120
 explaining what skills are worth buying 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.920
 how much gold to accumulate and when will they return 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.170
 to the base while the developers understand 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.120
 that it is impossible to train a player right away 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.769
 professional level therefore everything 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.750
 tasks that will be in this mode 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.070
 will be relevant specifically for this 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.419
 the level of the hero and his actions 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.699
 sandbox developers and mom under 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.070
 name dr and papules bus laid out on 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.380
 My letter to my site is addressed to all 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.510
 waiting for the game as reported in the letter 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.850
 game beta test will start very soon 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.010
 In addition, the letter is present 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.169
 a huge list of changes made to 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.240
 the game is there and the sound graphics are finished 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.190
 artificial intelligence crafting edits 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.070
 game world interface system 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.440
 pets mission, and more also 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.060
 told about the reputation of the NPC that is 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.200
 if you decide to kill fractional 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.090
 Nepis do not expect a warm welcome in 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.419
 once again the end of the release is small 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.850
 Interactive with the answers to your questions 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.040
 whether in survarium story if yes you can 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.960
 more and more famous who will 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.479
 the main character is generally correct 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.790
 replied in the comments this is emma main 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.840
 the hero in it is your character and plot and so 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.930
 there is Khan's world 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.100
 have fun why to elder scrolls 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.800
 online is so bad 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.260
 the reason is quite obvious and I said it 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.240
 not once the bottom line is what they did 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.490
 online game to pump money from 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.630
 popular universe literally from fat and 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.400
 due to fans of the series 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.919
 and it would be ok if you play 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.720
 did good and so is the usual mom 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.480
 only her marketing campaign 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.610
 too big 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.100
 Misha what do you think about Odessa universe 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.270
 online whether to play it update 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.490
 for the game come out quite often 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.330
 come up with all sorts of adventure 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.220
 entertaining 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.470
 but please understand to play it even for the sake of 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.390
 the setting is not necessary in the end 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.520
 slide to the fact that you will be given new 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.620
 dil se that you will pass this week and 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.980
 then will get equipment from it 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.900
 just before the release of the new dlc 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.810
 can you suggest a game similar to r2 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.700
 online with lots of pvp and no strong donat 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.950
 otherwise, you need a game 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.280
 asian school okay i'm probably already 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.110
