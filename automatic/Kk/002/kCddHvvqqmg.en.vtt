00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.140
 ok let's say the blues roots 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.580
 when we talk about blues 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.809
 basically it all starts from this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.809
 what we hear here 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 trousers 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.519
 let's start with a turn around 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.870
 which is developed in this mode 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:14.040
 robert johnson clearly plays with le 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.380
 I remember now my friends are my fingers 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.270
 they understand why a wooden rope with 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 the strings of a wooden guitar 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.330
 something metal I didn't have a certain 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.659
 is a call me a gentleman for a 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.109
 work that does not know what 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.729
 so look clearly clearly online 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.729
 you can also find the paintwork 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:02:12.929
 shuffle or always on 12 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.849
 we play it index and thumb 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.510
 then substantially substantially 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.510
 the use of a pick 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.569
 and not only 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.450
 sometimes I don't even think about it sometimes 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.450
 use your forefinger and thumb 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.599
 for example very often in the 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.470
 texas style development are put 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.470
 inside the bar 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.010
 for example also sixth intervals 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:29.470
 major minor but more has been talked about 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.120
 once of the dominant agreement of 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.129
 me but in this case it didn't even come 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.790
 designed by robert johnson his 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.159
 genius was to start creating 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.470
 clearly being the singer for 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.379
 excellence of the blues of that period 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.260
 the blues in that case the treatment 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.849
 wonderful that a monstrous other songs 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.849
 very important 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.240
 just the bearing 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.970
 and then go get it 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.890
 all the pentatonic forms that they are 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.010
 clearly imi as we saw one 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.320
 time I think there are rituals 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.720
 clapton that make boats no in 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.710
 this is where they come 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.710
 used for cadences
