00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
not only taste the sauce by itself but

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.800 
not only taste the sauce by itself but
to<00:00:26.670> eat<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> dish<00:00:28.349> some<00:00:28.800> cooked<00:00:29.070> food

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.959 
to see exactly what the proper pairing
for<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> sauce<00:00:34.320> would<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.640> what<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.700> tastes

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969

which are the hottest habanero peppers

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.889 
which are the hottest habanero peppers
out<00:01:38.970> there<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.020> already<00:01:40.650> say<00:01:40.829> jalapenos<00:01:41.899> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
out there as I already say jalapenos and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.249 
out there as I already say jalapenos and
they<00:01:43.110> could<00:01:43.320> reach<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.770> excess<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.399> five<00:01:45.259> maybe

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
they could reach in excess of five maybe

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.030 
they could reach in excess of five maybe
five<00:01:46.619> eighty<00:01:47.630> thousand<00:01:48.630> Scoville<00:01:49.020> units<00:01:49.380> so

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
five eighty thousand Scoville units so

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.859 
five eighty thousand Scoville units so
it's<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.549> depending<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.060> how<00:01:51.240> much<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.600> use

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it's just depending on how much they use

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.340 
it's just depending on how much they use
this<00:01:52.259> could<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.560> pretty<00:01:52.829> hot<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.229> actually

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
this could be pretty hot but it actually

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.050 
this could be pretty hot but it actually
sounds<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.040> sweet<00:01:56.399> sauce<00:01:56.700> because

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
sounds like a pretty sweet sauce because

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.020 
sounds like a pretty sweet sauce because
of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.240> presence<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> apple<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.590> there

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
of the presence of the apple in there

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.639 
of the presence of the apple in there
and<00:02:00.030> addition<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.869> salsa<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:02.969> anyway<00:02:03.649> I'm

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and addition to the salsa so anyway I'm

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.770 
and addition to the salsa so anyway I'm
going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.100> take<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> shrink-wrap<00:02:06.030> off<00:02:06.509> here

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
off but at least I could

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690
