00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
if GV and the xsellize is the cracked

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.880 
if GV and the xsellize is the cracked
version<00:02:18.580> or<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:20.030> can<00:02:20.330> pay<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.020> developer<00:02:21.590> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.950 
version or you can pay the developer and
I<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:22.550> it's<00:02:22.700> three<00:02:23.000> dollars<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.660> can<00:02:23.690> get

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
I think it's three dollars you can get

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.070 
I think it's three dollars you can get
the<00:02:24.110> paid<00:02:24.380> version<00:02:24.740> which<00:02:25.460> is<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.790> same<00:02:26.090> but

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the paid version which is the same but

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.160 
the paid version which is the same but
it's<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.620> support<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.250> developer<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.170> I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
it's to support the developer and I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.870 
it's to support the developer and I
believe<00:02:30.560> I'm<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.250> go<00:02:31.580> ahead<00:02:31.610> and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
believe I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.270 
believe I'm going to go ahead and
install<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.410> kind<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.890> installed

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
install this I just kind of installed

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.550

the<00:02:35.180> cracked<00:02:35.510> version<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:36.080> see<00:02:36.260> how<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.470> was

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
the cracked version to see how it was
