00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.890
 hello my name is yana i 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.690
 I represent the company electric motor 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.439
 today in our heading answers to 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.720
 questions 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.890
 I will tell you how to make a hole in 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.410
 concrete wall to make a hole in the concrete 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.920
 just take a wall 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.170
 punch and hammer and do it or 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.420
 if you have a power tool 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.980
 can do it with a shock 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.989
 drill or perforator 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.489
 let's hear what they say about it 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:54.800
 our experts contract openings in 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.929
 the concrete wall is made very simple and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.410
 Not some of their first take lay 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:03.040
 by holes 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:07.430
 the second drilled a minute of glory to every 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.210
 In fact there is a special building 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.210
 devices that allow 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 are called 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.500
 not on for no 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.500
 they wo n't come at all 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.890
 even his puncher that kind of 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.890
 or drill preparations that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.840
 what is this tool called 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.060
 I must call him correctly 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.290
 in the park 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.670
 smooth 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.190
 who is not very effectively the right end 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:52.780
 drilling a hole in the model so the wall 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:56.570
 grill but probably that of a drill 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.200
 can afford to cut through or 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.800
 to drill 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.140
 oniton using a hammer 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.140
 or 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
 drill
