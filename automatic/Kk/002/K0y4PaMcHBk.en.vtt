00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.879
 hello welcome and welcome to a 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.500
 new video of books to read where you 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.719
 summarize readings January 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.340
 2015 and well that sometimes readings 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.080
 interesting or readings that have 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.880
 disappointed there have been readings that have 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.400
 been without mass of readings that have 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.199
 amazed a lot because if you have interest 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.880
 I have goodreads that good to see and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.830
 functional of the video but I put here 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.359
 all the reviews that I'm reading sound 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.859
 are instantaneous let's say there's no 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.109
 wait for weeks until they are in 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.150
 the blog or what to expect here 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.860
 are the day they take a book then to 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.660
 the minutes that the book ends 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.280
 I put a radio so you are interested in the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.320
 leaves under the kings the first book that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 I read during the month of January 2015 it was 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.010
 the truth about information analysis 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.260
 It was a book that came within my challenge 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.450
 10 x 20 but that does not get to meet or 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.309
 no pardon, do not get to meet the challenge 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.440
 but this book if I enter the challenge 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.180
 it means that what you read in the challenge 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.500
 I put four stars on five but 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.000
 The truth is that I was disappointed because 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.039
 I thought it was going to be a 5-book 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.539
 about 5 because good had a premise 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.800
 very interesting as I was reading 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.770
 he had some very interesting characters 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.060
 some plots very I do not know how they had 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.600
 something but little by little it was 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.250
 deflating a little 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.990
 certain things that do not finish me 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.880
 convince but good the truth about a 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.650
 list is a very interesting reading to the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.780
 that I put a lot of exposure because there 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.670
 many things that underline many things 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.799
 that collide let's say the truth is that 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.630
 I recommend the novel no longer buying 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.040
 the hard cover or whatever for the truth 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.330
 is that it's very finite so that's 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.850
 can you comment for speaking then the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.680
 buy and it's interesting me the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.690
 I recommend in general, then I read 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.100
 persÃ©polis volume 2 that as you know in 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.289
 December I read the first volume of 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.909
 Persepolis that I leave the link below 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.830
 frap out of the month of December so in 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.810
 january I have to be worth persepolis all of 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.759
 author to marian satrapi too and good 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.920
 Well, I already put a 5 out of 5 because 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.020
 he liked it much more than the first part 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.610
 have certain things that I missed in 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.460
 the first and here you can see 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.200
 really a rebellion let's say for part 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.880
 of the protagonist towards her regime and 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.830
 we can already see how the political ideas 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.600
 social ideas are seen more 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.880
 clear that the first tome the end you 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.710
 So, as you told me about the first one, 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.240
 my mouth open to say why so 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.979
 I'll have to read soon the third and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.780
 the fourth that are not sequels that arrive 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.179
 directly the facts of this one because it is 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.790
 interesting to continue with persepolis and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.010
 Well that's 5 out of 5 because it really is 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.840
 great after I read the fourth volume of 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.040
 blue exorcist and kazue kato that like 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.109
 you know it's one of my manga series 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 favorites and the truth is that I 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.049
 disappointed slightly but I think that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.090
 because I was waiting for her with many 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.859
 you win because the third one was too much 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.510
 Well, yes, although there are certain 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.640
 things like that a little stuffing test and that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.250
 you see that everything is being prepared for 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.930
 a fifth and following volumes so that the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.609
 plot explode so that we find ourselves 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.230
 with new surprises but yes that the 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.420
 truth is that the fourth volume left me 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.090
 something cold but I still like it 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.709
 I still like it so much 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.209
 nothing will I tell you when I go 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.829
 making a more general idea of the manga 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.750
 because he really has gone four volumes 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.209
 of 13 almost published so really 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.040
 I'm just starting after lady gone 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.489
 and that will go after the second part of from 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.870
 I chose a 5 out of 5 because the 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.340
 truth is that I did not think to put the 5 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.419
 about 5 but as I was reading the book 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.169
 there were things he said that is this 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.090
 favor 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.680
 they were plan some product dresses a few turns 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.030
 in the plot so unexpected things of 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.189
 bellver what I said 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.139
 okay maybe they do not have things like I had the 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.760
 First book right now I could not say 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.560
 but there are things that I missed 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.210
 but nevertheless in this second it 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.550
 they supplement with other things like that 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.890
 and the plot really wonderful and 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.150
 In addition , the end is not typical and I 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.010
 I'm going to leave with a new plot that 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.930
 I never would have thought that it could open 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.280
 facing the third book that I never 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.500
 I would have imagined and the truth is that it is 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.750
 very interesting to see how it develops 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.790
 in the one that is the next part and 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.620
 Well, you see I've put a lot 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.540
 exporo is worth I put for instagram 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.270
 shaking I'm going no but I have 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.160
 many many post-its but good is what 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.410
 that there is and finally only a desire law 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.660
 of the gas to be given in ebook format I bought it 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.890
 for one euro to the casting of the flash I put 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.420
 the stars over five because the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.210
 true that it was a story that the law 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.970
 fast and that did not convey much 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.000
 this curious one is entertaining but there is 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.040
 some things that I do not or not because of 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.250
 things really had it not now 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.810
 I remember because today he has not given to see 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.010
 I think that what is in itself the story of 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.450
 I kind of like many 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.670
 ghosts by itself is a bit 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.770
 strange and they can fuck and everything but 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.360
 I do not know do not know why it's not a ghost 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.040
 ok I do not want to do spoilers either 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.540
 a ghost is therefore another 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.890
 but it does not make sense and no longer that 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.990
 make sense but it is a bit more 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.300
 taken but good that is entertaining 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.220
 or that a 2 by 5 is not such a bad grade and 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.590
 nothing during the month of January I did not read great 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.240
 thing more the truth is that I was in 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.250
 half a month without reading do not ask me 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.140
 because and now in February I think I'm 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.360
 recovering a little bit that there was 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.760
 left through reading and I'm already 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.200
 overcoming my reading hole that is the worst 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.970
 what can the readers pass us 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.990
 blip reader is horrible truth because 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.300
 nothing I hope you liked this 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.700
 video that officially announced that 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.310
 In a little bit you can see a video 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.660
 that will be a box the tour but a box the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.580
 tweet but that's not going to be a box the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.020
 future because I'm going to buy some 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.880
 shelves then what I'm going to do 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.500
 is to record the process in which I put 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.540
 the new shelves changes and all 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.980
 the books and reorganized that I think is 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.170
 more interesting so well what 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.850
 you will see soon and nothing that I hope 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.410
 that you like this video that pokes you 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.210
 like and all those things and see you in 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.990
 social networks and all that france 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.990
 see me goodbye
