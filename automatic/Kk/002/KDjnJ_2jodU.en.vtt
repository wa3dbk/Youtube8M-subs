okay<00:00:01.920> this<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.639> what<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> slipper<00:00:03.179> clutch

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay this is what a slipper clutch

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.249 
okay this is what a slipper clutch
should<00:00:04.200> sound<00:00:04.500> like<00:00:05.480> and<00:00:06.480> then<00:00:06.720> I'm<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.109> to

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
should sound like and then I'm going to

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.120 
should sound like and then I'm going to
show<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:08.160> contrast<00:00:09.620> what<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.650> slipper

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
show you in contrast what a slipper

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.020 
show you in contrast what a slipper
should<00:00:11.849> not<00:00:12.120> sound<00:00:12.420> like<00:00:12.769> which<00:00:13.769> will<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.219> what

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
should not sound like which will be what

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.650 
should not sound like which will be what
we<00:00:15.150> call<00:00:15.179> barking<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> differential<00:00:16.650> or

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
we call barking the differential or

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.620 
we call barking the differential or
differential<00:00:18.660> squeal<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:20.300> placing<00:00:21.300> your<00:00:21.420> rim

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
differential squeal so placing your rim

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.370 
differential squeal so placing your rim
Oh<00:00:21.750> control<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.519> tire<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.260> your<00:00:25.260> other

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
Oh control on one tire and your other

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.740 
Oh control on one tire and your other
hand<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> other<00:00:25.920> tire<00:00:26.420> give<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> full

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
hand on the other tire give it full

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.269 
hand on the other tire give it full
throttle<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.590> should<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> wheels

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
throttle and you should see the wheels

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.420 
throttle and you should see the wheels
in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> front<00:00:30.019> come<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.199> anywhere<00:00:32.009> from<00:00:32.189> three

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
in the front come up anywhere from three

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.799 
in the front come up anywhere from three
to<00:00:32.460> six<00:00:32.550> inches<00:00:33.059> that's<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.450> you're<00:00:33.600> looking

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to six inches that's what you're looking

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.139 
to six inches that's what you're looking
for<00:00:36.440> that's<00:00:37.440> perfect<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.730> don't<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
for that's perfect you don't want to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.580 
for that's perfect you don't want to
hold<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> throttle<00:00:39.690> down<00:00:39.960> any<00:00:40.200> more<00:00:40.379> than

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
hold the throttle down any more than

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.170 
hold the throttle down any more than
that<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:40.980> it'll<00:00:41.489> generate<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that because it'll generate a lot of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.610 
that because it'll generate a lot of
heat<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.649> slipper<00:00:44.040> clutch<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.809> do

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
heat in this slipper clutch and just do

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.810 
heat in this slipper clutch and just do
further<00:00:47.219> wear<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> damage<00:00:48.710> okay<00:00:52.579> okay<00:00:53.579> in

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
further wear and damage okay okay in

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.360 
further wear and damage okay okay in
contrast<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.050> slipper<00:00:55.590> clutch<00:00:55.620> should

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
contrast to what a slipper clutch should

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.299 
contrast to what a slipper clutch should
sound<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> nice<00:00:57.600> smooth

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
sound like which is a nice smooth

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.760 
sound like which is a nice smooth
slipping<00:00:59.309> noise<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
slipping noise this is going to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.539 
slipping noise this is going to
demonstrate<00:01:03.049> what<00:01:04.049> barking<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> differential

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
demonstrate what barking a differential

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.920 
demonstrate what barking a differential
sounds<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> good<00:01:07.650> sound

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
sounds like and it's not a good sound

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.200 
sounds like and it's not a good sound
what<00:01:09.930> I've<00:01:10.049> done<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.350> intentionally<00:01:11.210> loosened

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
what I've done is intentionally loosened

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
what I've done is intentionally loosened
the<00:01:12.659> differential<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.560> I've<00:01:14.189> tightened<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the differential and I've tightened the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.340 
the differential and I've tightened the
slipper<00:01:15.180> clutch<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:16.409> induce<00:01:17.119> the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
slipper clutch to induce the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.420 
slipper clutch to induce the
differential<00:01:19.350> ball's<00:01:19.560> slipping<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
differential ball's slipping on the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.480 
differential ball's slipping on the
rings<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.500> not<00:01:22.500> having<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> slipper<00:01:23.400> clutch

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
rings and not having the slipper clutch

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.359 
rings and not having the slipper clutch
kick<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> incorrect

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
kick in and this is the incorrect

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
kick in and this is the incorrect
setting<00:01:26.990> this<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.200> give<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> reference

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
setting this will give you a reference

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
setting this will give you a reference
point<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> hear<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.240> on

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
point so that if you hear this out on

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
point so that if you hear this out on
the<00:01:30.390> track<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:31.409> during<00:01:31.619> your<00:01:31.740> practice

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the track or during your practice

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.999 
the track or during your practice
sessions<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> street<00:01:33.090> you'll<00:01:33.630> know

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
sessions out in the street you'll know

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.030 
sessions out in the street you'll know
to<00:01:35.009> listen<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.259> continue

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
to listen for this and if you continue

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
to listen for this and if you continue
this<00:01:38.189> practice<00:01:38.659> it'll<00:01:39.659> damage<00:01:39.869> your

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
this practice it'll damage your

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.499 
this practice it'll damage your
differential<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.100> soon<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:42.000> doing<00:01:42.390> it

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
differential very soon I'm doing it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:42.969 
differential very soon I'm doing it
right<00:01:42.630> now

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
right now

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.719 
right now
intentionally<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.310> I'm<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> be

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
intentionally because I'm going to be

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.639 
intentionally because I'm going to be
rebuilding<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.479> differential<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.409> soon<00:01:46.560> as

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
rebuilding this differential as soon as

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:58.320 
rebuilding this differential as soon as
I<00:01:46.770> stop<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.159> video<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.200> listen

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.010 

that's<00:01:59.330> what<00:01:59.540> you<00:01:59.750> don't<00:02:00.050> want<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.620> hear
