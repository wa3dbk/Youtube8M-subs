00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.940
 hello friends he talks to you again is that the leex that is one and this week another 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.949
 crépy pasta 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:09.889
 This one is better than the previous one 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.899
 subscribe and recommend my videos thanks xd 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.099
 worked as an audio director at nickelodeon interactive studios 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.630
 any day with hard work putting him alluded to some episodes 

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:28.539
 of all the nick cartoons came a subject that I had never seen 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.379
 before he told me he needed urgent to make his episode of the penguins of 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.060
 Madagascar 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.940
 that subject was not the creator of the penguins of madagascar, much less 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.800
 I know that because other times the creator personally gave them to me 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.580
 I told him he will wait his turn 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.360
 he went a little annoying without telling me how he wanted it or anything but 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.560
 There is the video 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.500
 that day end early because there were not many episodes and before putting 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 audio to the episode the subject decided to create it 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.320
 I regretted 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.200
 the video started normal with the common presentation that is with all the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.750
 only characters where King Julien enters the box contains organs 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.960
 hyperrealists immediately I thought this guy is a asshole 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.400
 how do you plan to do that with such a good caricature 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730
 but I decided to continue 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.150
 as I still did not put the audio and the video was not so creepy 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.189
 the chapter was titled the death of kovalsky 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.320
 rare title but I thought this is not my video so I will not question anymore 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.890
 the chapter begins in the penguin habitat where he dug stumps 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.050
 kiper and rich in the bunk 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.470
 Kovalsky was missing 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.330
 we entered the middle of the monterias there was marlin with the skipper 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.230
 kabul and rich 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.610
 Cape says something to ski but but as he still did not put the government 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.490
 I knew it was 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 I decided that I would put the audio but I could not 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.450
 I could not put a break then I decided to take it out and it worked 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.179
 I put the audio and dress it 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.539
 it was creepy 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.989
 the music did not appear just a voice saying 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.549
 we are all born to die 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.529
 at the time that out to talk tells skiing but this had to happen 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.559
 ever 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.760
 losing ski 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.520
 but her tears are very real and also the sound of her crying 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:41.709
 kowalski appears with bloody eyes telling him to dodge this is your fault 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.479
 and everyone started running 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:48.399
 kowalski started to chase everyone but focus now is to remove 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.189
 Kowalski reached the writer and slashed him violently 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.409
 the audio was super realistic and the kennel skiing blood disgusting 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.789
 and then kovalsky starts eating to dodge 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:06.819
 he removes the organs and puts them in a box 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.120
 a subject arrives and kovalsky tells him here is the product that I promised you 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.619
 and the video ends with the same box from the beginning 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:21.899
 I decided not to put the audi to find out a little more about the individual 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:23.479
 he brought it to me 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:27.239
 find out a little and it turns out he was a dangerous killer 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.669
 I never put the audio 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.669
 the subject never came back for his chapter 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:39.639
 I kept it for a while but in my house strange things happened since 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.499
 take me the video so I throw it away 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:46.629
 my children are fanatics of the penguins of Madagascar so never 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.649
 I'll tell you about that chapter 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:53.119
 and I will keep it as a horrible and chilling secrets 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.280
 his friend told him esx the leex that his I do not hope you liked 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.749
