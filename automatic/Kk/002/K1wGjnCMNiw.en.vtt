 and here are video tutorials again show how 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.240
 link your virtual hard disk 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.799
 or such a local disk and so where 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.960
 called lidian lyca to another 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.359

 and in general , we have a shelf 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.359
 as four bytes freedom of jesus and for 120 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.029

 and the drive besides this at night I own 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.140
 the disk and the memory of which appeared 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.690
 where absolutely someone will illuminate 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 that is, and both can expect 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.700
 drives it now help fear it 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.289
 6 gigabyte memory is taken from nowhere then 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:04.409
 whether it is not taken away from some kind of disk 86 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:07.590
 gigabytes of weaning even in general 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.710
 it how to create such a disk drive man 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.990
 help Vladivostok lucky I 'm going 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.750
 do this what freedom hang 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.750
 gigabytes what are you like what are we doing and 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 so go to the start of the auxiliary 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.450
 panels push the control panel further 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.990
 click was arranged to control this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 button 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 we have removed a category view 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 what are we looking for security systems 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.759
 crossing it further we find the point 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.180
 administration of such a wash 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.520
 a basket and here we have a way in this 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.350
 section of the item behind the formatting 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.299
 hard drive after someone switched ears 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.789
 we have all the watches all your disks that 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.569
 located in this on the inside too 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:18.299
 drive 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:21.489
 dice which was and disk 1 which I am trying 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:25.409
 here called stones called sk1 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:28.769
 so what we do is push action 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.209
 create a virtual hard disk and 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.700
 we choose the same position where we will save 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.409
 ie where there is put some how we 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.579

 tired 2 drenched error 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:41.979
 Climbs so I put 1 terabyte here 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:43.810
 thousands more rotate well how am i 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:47.379
 still and put the day terabyte because

 that i sent 2 my silk is all 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:58.229
 stop slave insert one gifts bytes 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:04:04.930
 that is, all up to 1024 gigabytes a lot 1 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:06.489

 there it is mendez here already given here 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:55.600
 size 100 watts a megabyte to form 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:55.600
 and we put it here is a label 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:59.080
