00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.109 
or whatever um but anyway so the thing
that<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.799> want<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> talk<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.909> video

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that I want to talk about in this video

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.760 
that I want to talk about in this video
is<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.860> map<00:01:34.860> remakes<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.560> there's

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
is a map remakes so I think that there's

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.270 
is a map remakes so I think that there's
two<00:01:38.220> different<00:01:38.460> um<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.869> classes<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.740> map

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
two different um like classes of map

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.270 
two different um like classes of map
remix<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> first<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.100> did

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
remix so the first one is what they did

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.899 
remix so the first one is what they did
for<00:01:44.310> modern<00:01:44.820> warfare<00:01:45.000> 2<00:01:45.420> um<00:01:46.520> like<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.759> map

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
for modern warfare 2 um like for the map

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.399 
for modern warfare 2 um like for the map
packs<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.360> least<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.320> crash<00:01:50.360> strike

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
packs at least like a crash strike

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
packs at least like a crash strike
vacant<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.619> there<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:54.030> other<00:01:54.180> map<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
vacant and there was some other map I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
vacant and there was some other map I
can't<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.740> remember<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.790> off<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> top

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
can't really remember on the off the top

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.410 
can't really remember on the off the top
of<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.420> head<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.829> those<00:01:58.829> were<00:01:59.070> exact<00:01:59.939> map

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
of my head but those were exact map

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.109 
of my head but those were exact map
remix<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.110> thought<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.729> what<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> mean<00:02:02.850> by<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
remix I thought and what I mean by that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.359 
remix I thought and what I mean by that
is<00:02:03.270> they<00:02:03.750> didn't<00:02:03.990> change<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:05.040> anything

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
is they didn't change really anything

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.459 
is they didn't change really anything
like<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.939> think<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.270> strike<00:02:06.659> they<00:02:06.869> opened<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like I think on strike they opened up a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.070 
like I think on strike they opened up a
door<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:08.129> something<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.239> mean<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.599> visuals

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
door or something and I mean the visuals

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080 
door or something and I mean the visuals
look<00:02:10.410> slightly<00:02:10.890> different<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
look slightly different but all the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.220 
look slightly different but all the
buildings<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.660> stuff<00:02:12.840> there

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
buildings and stuff there

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.960 
buildings and stuff there
the<00:02:13.319> same<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:13.980> shape<00:02:14.280> buildings<00:02:14.760> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the same like shape buildings and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.229 
the same like shape buildings and
whatnot<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:17.069> yeah<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.580> then<00:02:17.700> there's<00:02:18.090> a

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
whatnot so yeah and then there's a

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.170 
whatnot so yeah and then there's a
different<00:02:18.810> kind<00:02:19.049> of<00:02:19.319> map<00:02:19.530> remake<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.159> think<00:02:20.459> so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
different kind of map remake I think so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.789 
different kind of map remake I think so
if<00:02:21.510> you've<00:02:21.659> played<00:02:21.810> called<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.230> before<00:02:22.530> and

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
if you've played called it before and

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.619 
if you've played called it before and
you<00:02:22.890> had<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.069> variety<00:02:23.640> map<00:02:23.819> pack<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.480> would

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
you had the variety map pack you would

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.800 
you had the variety map pack you would
know<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.349> map<00:02:25.830> was<00:02:26.099> called<00:02:26.459> chinatown<00:02:27.269> now

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
know that a map was called chinatown now

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.190 
know that a map was called chinatown now

they<00:03:11.790> remade<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.109> black<00:03:13.980> ops<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.549> they

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
they remade it in black ops and they

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.360 
they remade it in black ops and they
made<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.060> hazard<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.170> as<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.620> tell<00:03:16.680> this

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
made it hazard but as you can tell this

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.190 
made it hazard but as you can tell this
looks<00:03:17.639> nothing<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.090> hazard<00:03:18.660> even<00:03:18.989> though<00:03:19.079> it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
looks nothing like hazard even though it

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.909 
looks nothing like hazard even though it
is<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.590> same<00:03:20.389> essentially<00:03:21.389> um<00:03:22.109> so<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.560> really

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
is the same essentially um so I really

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.589 
is the same essentially um so I really
like<00:03:23.099> those<00:03:23.340> kind<00:03:23.669> of<00:03:23.730> remakes<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.239> not<00:03:24.389> so

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
much the ones that they did for infinity

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.990 
much the ones that they did for infinity
ward's<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:28.349> or<00:03:28.560> what<00:03:28.950> am<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.130> saying<00:03:29.280> mono

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
for tues remakes there those were more

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.870 
for tues remakes there those were more
like<00:03:33.090> exact<00:03:33.750> remakes<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.799> exact<00:03:35.310> duplicate

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
like exact remakes like exact duplicate

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.780 
like exact remakes like exact duplicate
with<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.209> different<00:03:36.660> color<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.919> it<00:03:38.549> seemed

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
with a different color like it seemed

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.849 
with a different color like it seemed
like<00:03:39.209> bacon<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.750> cod4<00:03:40.139> it<00:03:40.319> was<00:03:40.440> like<00:03:40.590> kind<00:03:40.799> of

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
like bacon and cod4 it was like kind of

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.069 
like bacon and cod4 it was like kind of
a<00:03:40.950> green<00:03:41.250> color<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.849> then<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.630> seemed<00:03:42.870> like

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
a green color and then it seemed like

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.780 
a green color and then it seemed like
the<00:03:43.440> color<00:03:43.680> scheme<00:03:43.919> it<00:03:44.310> was<00:03:44.430> totally

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
the color scheme it was totally

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.280 
the color scheme it was totally
different<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.180> was<00:03:45.269> kind<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.510> like<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.959> don't

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
different it was kind of like I don't

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.050 
different it was kind of like I don't
know<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:46.500> orange<00:03:47.069> or<00:03:47.220> something<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.730> don't

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
know like orange or something I don't

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.360
