00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.059
 hi everyone tech guys don't make it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.870
 welcome the official decision and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.039
 bose quietcomfort 15 acoustic headphones not 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.859
 for serene 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.480
 first of all we would like to thank the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.880
 bose italian division that has 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.250
 provided to send us the sample from 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.050
 test and recession on our skin 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.689
 first let's talk about headphones 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.329
 these are non-wireless headphones ie 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.890
 not without wires that will therefore have the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.690
 need to be connected 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.579
 directly through a wire to the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.829
 multimedia reproducing device 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.700
 which can be tablet or smartphone 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 any other reader and though on 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 official website has been specified there are 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.640
 perfectly usable with all 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.860
 Android devices brands have been 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.140
 made specifically for iphone ipad 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.600
 and all apple devices 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.239
 it should be emphasized that after all our own 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 test all the features we're going to 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.549
 see are perfectly available and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.990
 can also be used for devices 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.689
 Android 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.540
 it must be said that they are defined as 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.180
 made especially for iphone and so on 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.040
 for a simple reason inside the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.759
 packaging you can find a groove 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 a cable that was made 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
 specifically for those devices that it is 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.270
 different from the cable we're going to see 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.799
 in our packaging anyway 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.570
 inside a normal package 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.460
 found in both cases 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.479
 of the box, however, we find the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 our headphones our headphones 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.590
 perfectly made with pavilions 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.369
 very wide very soft button for 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.340
 the ignition then we find the cable for the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.490
 device connection and of course 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.399
 all user manuals then 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 First let's start from the headphones 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.409
 headphones are features in that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.030
 allows complete soundproofing 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.560
 or the user when 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.990
 will listen to the music will be completely 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.270
 soundproofed by the outside world 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.730
 to do this, however, it is necessary 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.800
 insert a battery in a pavilion 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.690
 earphone in particular here 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.250
 find a flashlight that was 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.430
 previously inserted by us but that 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.550
 however found in the packaging of 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.750
 default the stack once I lose goes 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.820
 however inserted and then to reproduce 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.070
 the music will always be absolutely 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.500
 need to turn on the taxes I read the 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.970
 headphones when they turn on 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.590
 the headphones soundproofing is activated 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.630
 or the mechanism provides for a rumor 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.800
 in inverted commas that you 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.300
 will allow it to be completely 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.910
 soundproofed by the outside world and then 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.370
 once you activate the headphones you will need to 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.660
 use this cable you find 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.100
 naturally inside the package 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.900
 from here we have a part of the jack from 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.160
 connect the headphones from the other the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.660
 jack to connect to the device is 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.230
 always on this cable you will also find the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.660
 microphone the microphone will allow you to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.780
 talk to a user who will call you 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.850
 unfortunately on the android cable not 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.800
 button is not present 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.360
 for the volume for and to respond to 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.040
 calls remains that however for 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.680
 increase it lower the volume will be enough 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.690
 touch your android device e 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.600
 to answer the same way the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.690
 microphone works properly 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.790
 although not perfect in the sense that if 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.950
 breathe and indeed matt is definitely the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.840
 your interlocutor will hear with some 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.360
 problem but from our tests it turned out 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.830
 work perfectly beyond this 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.540
 so once inserted the stack lit 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.120
 the headphones now in the demo off but 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.550
 however they will turn on insert the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.340
 cable as you see it disappears perfectly 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.450
 the other club is inserted in the in the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.320
 manufacturer then it must be said that for 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.480
 listening to music will always be 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.730
 need to have turned on the headphones this 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.350
 because because otherwise the mechanism 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.070
 sound system does not work 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.590
 correctly 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.610
 in parallel 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.340
 instead you can still use the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.840
 soundproof headphones even without 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.479
 listening to music 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.540
 put on the headphones turn on the cav 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.800
 turn on the headphones and for example been 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.300
 reading a book you want if 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.130
 disturbed these must have 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.410
 perfectly from the outside world 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.620
 personal considerations the product 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.260
 is sold for 299.95 euros a 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.860
 really high price that could 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.050
 stop many users from buying 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.510
 actually we can tell you that these 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.970
 headphones are worth this price 300 euros 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.460
 they are many but that bosa quality is made 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.470
 really feel at the bass feel 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.160
 very well you have no problem 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:10.330
 not even in high sounds and so on 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.639
 so if you are passionate and want 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.530
 entrust you and you want to rely 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.580
 on the quality bosa know that this is 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.190
 the product for you 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.199
 of course if it was a product 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.639
 wireless or to use without the 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.830
 cable definitely would have acquired 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.900
 even more points and more users 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.490
 remains that I personally can 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.710
 recommend this product only if 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.300
 you are passionate about music and you have 300 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.090
 euros to spend otherwise you can 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.950
 also find other products at a price 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.800
 lower 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.510
 having said this our vote on these 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.200
 headphones can only be more than good 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.690
 we can give him an eight and a half with 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.300
 reserve or if they had devised a 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.510
 microphone a slightly different more 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.250
 beautiful and more performing certainly 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.570
 they would have done better 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.099
 having said that I thank you for 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.099
 attention to the next review
