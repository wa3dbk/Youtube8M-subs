to damage your scalp you're not digging

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.710 
to damage your scalp you're not digging
into<00:02:13.440> your<00:02:13.680> scalp<00:02:14.010> you're<00:02:14.640> simply<00:02:15.090> looking

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
into your scalp you're simply looking

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.380 
into your scalp you're simply looking
here<00:02:15.900> once<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.740> locate<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.340> hair<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:18.090> start

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
here once you locate the hair you start

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.970 
here once you locate the hair you start
pulling<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.990> through<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.530> need<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.830> be

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
pulling it through and you need to be

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.580 
pulling it through and you need to be
careful<00:02:20.550> not<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.820> make<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.600> holes<00:02:21.960> too<00:02:22.350> big

careful not to make your holes too big

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.700 
careful not to make your holes too big
because<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.760> lead<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.000> spotting<00:02:24.840> once

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
because that can lead to spotting once

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.010 
because that can lead to spotting once
you<00:02:25.860> get<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.220> hang<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.480> goes<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> lot

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
is just it slides through the cap

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.350 
is just it slides through the cap
because<00:05:17.590> I've<00:05:17.740> got<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.010> shine<00:05:18.310> product<00:05:18.790> on<00:05:19.180> it

a whole lot of slip and slide and it's

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.930 
a whole lot of slip and slide and it's
just<00:05:25.090> so<00:05:25.330> much<00:05:25.540> easier<00:05:25.870> and<00:05:26.430> for<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.550> small

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
just so much easier and for the small

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.260 
just so much easier and for the small
amount<00:05:28.090> of<00:05:29.400> highlights<00:05:30.400> that<00:05:30.610> I'm<00:05:30.760> going<00:05:31.120> to

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
bleach in a bottle it just doesn't work

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.180 
bleach in a bottle it just doesn't work
and<00:06:15.450> when<00:06:16.450> you<00:06:16.480> mix<00:06:16.840> it<00:06:17.080> up<00:06:17.230> I<00:06:17.440> compare<00:06:17.920> it<00:06:17.950> to

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
and when you mix it up I compare it to

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.000 
and when you mix it up I compare it to
pancake<00:06:21.190> batter<00:06:22.380> you<00:06:23.380> don't<00:06:23.560> want<00:06:23.710> to<00:06:23.770> be<00:06:23.890> it

batter you don't want it to be a cook

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.800 
batter you don't want it to be a cook
and<00:06:29.560> stick<00:06:29.950> with<00:06:30.160> cookie<00:06:30.520> batter<00:06:30.760> but<00:06:31.570> you

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
and stick with cookie batter but you

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.710 
and stick with cookie batter but you

thick and thin and you're just going to

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.839 
thick and thin and you're just going to
put<00:06:44.930> a<00:06:44.960> little<00:06:45.169> bit<00:06:45.409> in<00:06:45.560> a<00:06:45.770> flitch<00:06:46.159> endless

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
put a little bit in a flitch endless

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.369 
put a little bit in a flitch endless
bowl<00:06:47.210> and<00:06:47.690> mix<00:06:48.650> it<00:06:48.919> and<00:06:49.599> if<00:06:50.599> it's<00:06:50.780> too<00:06:51.020> thick

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 
bowl and mix it and if it's too thick

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.550 
bowl and mix it and if it's too thick
yeah<00:06:51.919> a<00:06:51.949> little<00:06:52.370> more<00:06:52.400> froth<00:06:52.909> and<00:06:53.720> you're<00:06:54.349> just

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
yeah a little more froth and you're just

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.550 
yeah a little more froth and you're just
going<00:06:54.740> to<00:06:54.830> keep<00:06:55.009> mixing<00:06:55.430> it<00:06:55.940> until<00:06:56.270> you<00:06:57.080> get<00:06:57.349> a

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
going to keep mixing it until you get a

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.920 
going to keep mixing it until you get a
consistency<00:06:58.310> that's<00:06:58.580> thick

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
consistency that's thick

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.100 
consistency that's thick

you know so that it doesn't drip but not
so<00:07:03.409> thick<00:07:03.710> that<00:07:03.740> it<00:07:04.340> has<00:07:04.610> globules<00:07:05.419> in<00:07:05.720> it<00:07:06.159> and

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
so thick that it has globules in it and

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.869 
so thick that it has globules in it and
I'm<00:07:07.849> going<00:07:08.090> to<00:07:08.120> just<00:07:08.360> continue<00:07:08.960> doing<00:07:09.169> that

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:09.879 
I'm going to just continue doing that

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:14.499 
I'm going to just continue doing that
until<00:07:10.879> the<00:07:11.120> mix<00:07:11.449> and<00:07:11.720> the<00:07:11.930> consistency<00:07:12.650> or<00:07:13.509> so

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.509 
until the mix and the consistency or so

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:24.250 
until the mix and the consistency or so
or<00:07:14.840> right<00:07:15.110> for<00:07:15.349> me

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.260
