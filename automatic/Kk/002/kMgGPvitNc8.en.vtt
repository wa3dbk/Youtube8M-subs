00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
charged we have our import that's just

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.429 
charged we have our import that's just
to<00:01:32.250> charge<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.790> battery<00:01:33.360> back<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.229> then

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
to charge the battery back up and then

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.289 
to charge the battery back up and then
as<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.189> two<00:01:35.310> USB<00:01:35.670> ports

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
as you see here we have two USB ports

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.149 
as you see here we have two USB ports
and<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:37.049> made<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.500> simple<00:01:37.979> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
and they made it really simple to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.080 
and they made it really simple to
identify<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:40.130> amp<00:01:41.130> output<00:01:41.549> which

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
identify you have a one amp output which

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
identify you have a one amp output which
is<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> black<00:01:42.570> port<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> single

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
is the black port with a single

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440 
is the black port with a single
lightning<00:01:43.890> bolt<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
lightning bolt here and then you have a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.580 
lightning bolt here and then you have a
2.1<00:01:46.110> amp<00:01:46.560> output<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:48.390> faster<00:01:48.810> charging<00:01:49.170> which

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
2.1 amp output for faster charging which

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.780 
2.1 amp output for faster charging which
is<00:01:49.740> symbolized<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> two<00:01:50.549> lightning

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
is symbolized with the two lightning

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.960 
is symbolized with the two lightning
bolts<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.299> well<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.590> blue<00:01:52.860> USB<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.790> real

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
bolts as well as a blue USB so it's real

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.789 
bolts as well as a blue USB so it's real
simple<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.750> know<00:01:54.960> you're<00:01:55.170> using<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> right

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
simple to know you're using the right

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.190 
simple to know you're using the right
plug<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> want<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> charge<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.600> device<00:01:57.899> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
plug if you want to charge a device that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.940 
plug if you want to charge a device that
uses<00:01:58.500> 2.1<00:01:59.369> or<00:01:59.640> use<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> rapid<00:02:00.630> charge

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
uses 2.1 or use like a rapid charge

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.100 
uses 2.1 or use like a rapid charge
rapid<00:02:01.950> charge<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.000> use<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.390> blue<00:02:03.570> port<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
rapid charge you use the blue port and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.380 
rapid charge you use the blue port and
the<00:02:04.680> black<00:02:04.860> ports<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.310> 1.0<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.149> great

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the black ports are 1.0 which is great

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.710 
the black ports are 1.0 which is great
for<00:02:06.659> some<00:02:07.439> older<00:02:07.649> devices<00:02:08.190> I'll<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.239> 1.0

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
for some older devices I'll use the 1.0

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.410 
for some older devices I'll use the 1.0
port<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.229> things<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.679> my<00:02:10.940> GoPro<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.180> things

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
port for things like my GoPro and things

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.600 
port for things like my GoPro and things
like<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:13.709> great<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.010> has<00:02:14.099> two

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
like that so it's great it has two

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.390 
like that so it's great it has two
be<00:02:14.760> charged<00:02:15.120> simultaneously<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:17.250> got

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
be charged simultaneously and you got

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.730 
be charged simultaneously and you got
those<00:02:17.550> nice<00:02:17.790> two<00:02:18.030> ports<00:02:18.420> there<00:02:18.660> now<00:02:19.380> one<00:02:19.620> thing

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
those nice two ports there now one thing

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.310 
those nice two ports there now one thing
I<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.010> about<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.580> size<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:22.080> thing

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
I like about it is the size this thing

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.070 
I like about it is the size this thing
is<00:02:22.440> 10,000<00:02:23.280> milliamps<00:02:23.760> well<00:02:24.510> right<00:02:24.720> here<00:02:24.990> we

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
is 10,000 milliamps well right here we

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.080 
is 10,000 milliamps well right here we
have<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.200> limeade<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.700> thing<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:29.090> 5,000

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
have a limeade and this thing is 5,000

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.870 
have a limeade and this thing is 5,000
milliamps<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.690> half<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.110> milliamps<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.790> if

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
milliamps so half the milliamps but if

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.470 
milliamps so half the milliamps but if
we<00:02:32.970> take<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.210> look<00:02:34.520> it's<00:02:35.520> not<00:02:35.790> all<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.330> much

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
we take a look it's not all that much

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.330 
we take a look it's not all that much
bigger<00:02:36.690> than<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> five<00:02:37.650> thousand<00:02:38.130> milliamp

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
bigger than the five thousand milliamp

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.300 
bigger than the five thousand milliamp
limeade<00:02:38.910> here<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.930> about<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.110> seven<00:02:41.040> eight

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
limeade here it's about a seven eight

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.240 
limeade here it's about a seven eight
centimeter<00:02:41.880> wider<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.540> maybe<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.590> centimeter

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
centimeter wider and maybe a centimeter

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.480 
centimeter wider and maybe a centimeter
and<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> half<00:02:44.400> two<00:02:45.360> centimeters<00:02:45.930> longer<00:02:46.490> really

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
and a half two centimeters longer really

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.640 
and a half two centimeters longer really
not<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.970> much<00:02:48.090> bigger<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:49.080> terms<00:02:49.380> of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
not that much bigger and in terms of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.900 
not that much bigger and in terms of
width<00:02:50.540> it's<00:02:51.540> pretty<00:02:51.780> much<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.140> same<00:02:52.170> width<00:02:52.910> so

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
width it's pretty much the same width so

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.510 
width it's pretty much the same width so
you're<00:02:54.060> getting<00:02:54.300> double<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> milliamps<00:02:55.520> for

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
you're getting double the milliamps for

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.850 
you're getting double the milliamps for
not<00:02:56.670> much<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.180> larger<00:02:57.570> size<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.770> that's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
not much of a larger size so that's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.580 
not much of a larger size so that's
pretty<00:02:59.160> neat<00:02:59.430> if<00:03:00.270> we<00:03:00.989> move<00:03:01.140> over<00:03:01.170> here<00:03:01.380> and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
pretty neat if we move over here and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.290 
pretty neat if we move over here and
just<00:03:01.800> compare<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.370> easyacc<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.090> have

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
just compare it to this easyacc I have

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.870 
just compare it to this easyacc I have
this<00:03:04.290> one<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.650> 12,000<00:03:05.250> milliamps<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.850> a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
this one is 12,000 milliamps it is a

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.630 
this one is 12,000 milliamps it is a
little<00:03:06.209> bit<00:03:06.390> more<00:03:06.570> capacity<00:03:07.220> but<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:08.459> look

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
little bit more capacity but if we look

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.690 
little bit more capacity but if we look
at<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.170> they're<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.260> exact<00:03:10.650> same<00:03:10.950> length

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.460 

they're<00:03:14.700> very<00:03:15.060> close<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.450> with<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.080> easyacc

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
they're very close and with the easyacc

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.970 
they're very close and with the easyacc
is<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.770> little<00:03:17.220> bit<00:03:17.340> wider<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:19.410> now<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.620> depth

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
is a little bit wider but now the depth

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.750 
is a little bit wider but now the depth
is<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:21.209> lot<00:03:21.510> different<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.500> easyacc<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.340> lot

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
is a lot different the easyacc is a lot

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.870 
is a lot different the easyacc is a lot
thicker<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:25.350> yes<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:25.799> 200<00:03:26.730> more

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
thicker so yes you have 200 more

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.740 
thicker so yes you have 200 more
milliamps<00:03:27.480> but<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.410> lot<00:03:28.620> thicker<00:03:29.750> so

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
milliamps but it's a lot thicker so

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.740 
milliamps but it's a lot thicker so
overall<00:03:31.019> for<00:03:31.140> what<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:33.150> power<00:03:33.390> add

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
overall for what it is this power add

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.100 
overall for what it is this power add
really<00:03:34.590> nice<00:03:34.769> finish<00:03:35.519> on<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.880> smooth<00:03:36.840> will

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
really nice finish on it smooth will

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.690 
really nice finish on it smooth will
slide<00:03:37.380> in<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.680> out<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:37.980> pocket<00:03:38.370> real<00:03:38.519> easy

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
slide in and out of a pocket real easy

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.690 
slide in and out of a pocket real easy
great<00:03:39.390> size<00:03:39.690> for<00:03:39.720> what<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.290> is

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
great size for what it is

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.280 
great size for what it is
10,000<00:03:41.700> milliamps<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.750> gonna<00:03:42.900> be<00:03:43.019> one<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.200> my

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
10,000 milliamps it's gonna be one of my

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.740 
10,000 milliamps it's gonna be one of my
go-to<00:03:43.560> battery<00:03:44.130> backups<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.820> like<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.600> finish

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
go-to battery backups I like the finish

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.750 
go-to battery backups I like the finish
on<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.560> size<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.190> for<00:03:47.489> how<00:03:47.610> much

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
on it I like the size of it for how much

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
on it I like the size of it for how much
power<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.209> get<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.600> overall<00:03:49.560> pretty<00:03:49.860> good

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
power you get and overall pretty good
