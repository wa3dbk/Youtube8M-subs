00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.860
 this hull is the high bank this 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.690
 black serial switch of which it exists 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.230
 in two colors this time it's the 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:35.250
 Black and the other that is their glacier 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.650
 so a black a white appreciates so 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.190
 we will start directly with 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.239
 boxing 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.239
 so it's gone 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.930
 so on the box we will observe 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.780
 a few things first of all 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.570
 that she protects against cuts 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.239
 the shocks the dust the debris and the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 scratches because in this patch have actually 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.420
 a self adhesive screen protector so 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.810
 we'll see that just after we 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.110
 have read to us as author this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.680
 series we also have the mark right here 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.539
 to orp 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.610
 so it's a very good mark for 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.100
 the hulls it's here at the time of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.710
 quality after installing the movie of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 protection we will put the hull in 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.380
 itself so in fact the first 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.380
 part we will take there the hull that is 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 rigid 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.229
 here is the first layer was put on 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.229
 will put the second Parisian 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.800
 here is the hull is completely installed 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.149
 the dead that the project a pea and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.180
 frankly it's worth it because 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.970
 this rating is really really good 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.780
 but maybe the phone by 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.660
 Shock report 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.110
 so in fact this rigid case justice 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.200
 yves robert it is solidifies the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.200
 phones absorbs shocks with 7 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.950
 so soft after we observe hip justice 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.659
 hop cash and a second page for 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:41.860
 protect and well that one protects and there the 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:44.290
 micro usb socket for charging and 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.980
 the jack just in raw so that 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.920
 protects from dust very well with 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.140
 these little robots justify what 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.710
 regards the firmest return 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.290
 ditto for homicide after that go know 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.569
 the flash lite rather classic 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.100
 the purpose the only small negative point 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.310
 that I can give to this quote it's 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.980
 that the buttons to the 9 meters invaded the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.900
 low volume buttons and too few are 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.940
 hard to support after putting 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.770
 nalco who can be seen that I support 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.590
 and really needs a lot of support 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.050
 our only point a negative point but 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.280
 good it's not that bad so that's it 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.959
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.940
 we are in a next video 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.450
 so I tell you next time 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.450
 See you 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.540
 what
