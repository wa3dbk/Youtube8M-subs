uh I reattached all the wires in my
truck<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.629> put<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.079> back<00:01:01.230> together

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
truck when I put it all back together

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.520 
truck when I put it all back together
and<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:05.689> there<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.900> dashboard<00:01:07.140> is

and as you can see there my dashboard is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:20.320 
and as you can see there my dashboard is
lit<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:14.930> there's<00:01:15.930> my<00:01:16.369> headlights<00:01:17.369> on

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:28.730 

low-beam<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:25.729> it's<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.360> wire<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
low-beam so it's not this wire that is

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
low-beam so it's not this wire that is
affecting<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:30.030> -<00:01:30.329> lights<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:32.329> or<00:01:33.329> your

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
headlights coming on so I would double

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.910 
headlights coming on so I would double
check<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.600> make<00:01:36.659> sure<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.320> main<00:01:37.619> plug

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
check and make sure that this main plug

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.880 
check and make sure that this main plug
right<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:40.049> tight<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.740> can

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.330 
right here is on as tight as you can
possibly<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.290> I<00:01:43.290> would<00:01:43.710> also<00:01:43.860> check

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
possibly get it and I would also check

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.639 
possibly get it and I would also check
on<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> back<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.810> instrument<00:01:46.350> panel

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
on the back of your instrument panel

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.389 
on the back of your instrument panel
here<00:01:46.829> there's<00:01:47.040> two<00:01:47.310> plugs<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.890> plug<00:01:49.890> into<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
here there's two plugs that plug into it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.550 
here there's two plugs that plug into it
whenever<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.970> reseat<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.689> instrument<00:01:52.259> panel

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
whenever you reseat the instrument panel

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
whenever you reseat the instrument panel
and<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.939> noticed<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.600> whenever<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.960> was

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and I noticed that whenever I was

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.569 
and I noticed that whenever I was
putting<00:01:55.470> mine<00:01:55.619> back<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.040> there's<00:01:56.250> nothing

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
putting mine back in there's nothing

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.660 
putting mine back in there's nothing
that<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:57.119> holds<00:01:57.479> them<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.689> place<00:01:58.670> they've

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that really holds them in place they've

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
that really holds them in place they've
got<00:01:59.820> some<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.240> lips<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.930> hold<00:02:01.140> them

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
got some little lips that hold them

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.709 
got some little lips that hold them
forward<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.460> they<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.880> wiggle<00:02:03.149> from<00:02:03.450> side<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
forward but they can wiggle from side to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.960 
forward but they can wiggle from side to
side<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> would<00:02:05.490> take<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.180> press<00:02:06.570> firmly<00:02:07.970> or

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
side so I would take and press firmly or

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.460 
side so I would take and press firmly or
I<00:02:09.030> would<00:02:09.450> take<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> instrument<00:02:10.050> panel<00:02:10.080> out

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
I would take the instrument panel out

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.010 
I would take the instrument panel out
and<00:02:10.709> make<00:02:11.610> sure<00:02:11.640> those<00:02:11.940> plugs<00:02:12.270> are<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
and make sure those plugs are in the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.510 
and make sure those plugs are in the
right<00:02:13.170> position

here<00:02:28.910> on<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:30.440> little<00:02:30.620> thing<00:02:30.980> right<00:02:31.910> here<00:02:32.210> so

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
here on this little thing right here so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.510 
here on this little thing right here so
whatever<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:35.210> would<00:02:35.660> imagine<00:02:36.080> if<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.310> had

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
whatever it is I would imagine if I had

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.430 
whatever it is I would imagine if I had
to<00:02:37.640> guess<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.690> right<00:02:38.930> here<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.230> probably

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
to guess this right here is probably

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.180 
to guess this right here is probably
just<00:02:39.860> loose<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.720> hope<00:02:42.710> you<00:02:42.860> can<00:02:42.950> get<00:02:43.070> it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
just loose so I hope you can get it

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.480 
just loose so I hope you can get it
figured<00:02:43.370> out<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.140> do<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.680> would

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
figured out and if you do I would

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.250 
figured out and if you do I would
appreciate<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:47.060> if<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.180> would<00:02:47.420> share<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.020> video

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260

or<00:02:48.620> something<00:02:49.330> showing<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.420> rest<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.900> us<00:02:51.580> what

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
the issue was so that if somebody else

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.110 
the issue was so that if somebody else
runs<00:02:54.410> into<00:02:54.740> it<00:02:54.890> they<00:02:55.430> can<00:02:55.610> fix<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:55.970> themselves

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
runs into it they can fix it themselves

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
grounding wire in there I need to tuck

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.810 
grounding wire in there I need to tuck
that<00:04:03.440> back<00:04:03.500> up<00:04:03.770> in<00:04:03.890> place<00:04:04.870> but<00:04:05.870> there's<00:04:06.140> a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
that back up in place but there's a

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.780 
that back up in place but there's a
there's<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.910> grounding<00:04:08.360> wire<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.780> there<00:04:09.790> that

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
there's a grounding wire in there that

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.790 
there's a grounding wire in there that
screws<00:04:11.150> into<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.660> metal<00:04:12.080> on<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.260> body<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.680> the

screws into the metal on the body of the
the<00:04:13.580> truck<00:04:13.850> down<00:04:14.150> under<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.540> carpeting<00:04:14.959> here

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
the truck down under the carpeting here

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.220 
the truck down under the carpeting here
there's<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.459> grounding<00:04:16.910> wire<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.450> smaller<00:04:17.900> one

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
there's a grounding wire a smaller one

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.909 
there's a grounding wire a smaller one
not<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.799> frame<00:04:19.010> either<00:04:19.850> over<00:04:20.450> here<00:04:20.900> or<00:04:21.890> I

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
not just the frame either over here or I

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.230 
not just the frame either over here or I
think<00:04:22.580> it's<00:04:22.910> over<00:04:23.120> there<00:04:24.880> might<00:04:25.880> be<00:04:25.910> one<00:04:26.120> on

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
think it's over there might be one on

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.190 
think it's over there might be one on
both<00:04:26.360> sides

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
both sides

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.900 
both sides
but<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> check<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.340> make<00:04:28.460> sure<00:04:28.640> that<00:04:28.790> you've

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
but a check and make sure that you've

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.040 
but a check and make sure that you've
got<00:04:29.030> all<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.300> your<00:04:29.390> grounding<00:04:29.840> wires

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
got all of your grounding wires

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.170 
got all of your grounding wires
reattached<00:04:30.860> your<00:04:31.130> grounding<00:04:31.460> wires<00:04:31.640> you'll

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
reattached your grounding wires you'll

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.890 
reattached your grounding wires you'll
recognize<00:04:32.690> them<00:04:32.930> because<00:04:33.020> it'll<00:04:33.920> be<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.130> wire

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
recognize them because it'll be a wire

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.630 
recognize them because it'll be a wire
with<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.080> end<00:04:36.230> of<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:36.620> we'll<00:04:37.100> just<00:04:37.130> have<00:04:37.490> like

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
with the end of it we'll just have like

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.670 
with the end of it we'll just have like
a<00:04:37.670> little<00:04:37.970> ring<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:39.020> instead<00:04:39.350> of<00:04:39.410> like<00:04:39.620> a

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
a little ring on it instead of like a

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.580 
a little ring on it instead of like a
plug<00:04:40.220> or<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.550> connector<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.120> some<00:04:41.330> sort<00:04:41.630> where

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
plug or a connector of some sort where

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.380 
plug or a connector of some sort where
it<00:04:42.890> would<00:04:43.100> have<00:04:43.190> been<00:04:43.340> screwed<00:04:43.760> into<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.180> body

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
it would have been screwed into the body

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.440 
it would have been screwed into the body
of<00:04:44.540> your<00:04:45.170> truck<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.970> is<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.270> ground

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
of your truck and that is the ground

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.140 
of your truck and that is the ground
wire<00:04:47.720> for<00:04:48.020> something<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:49.430> if<00:04:49.640> you<00:04:49.790> don't<00:04:49.970> have

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
wire for something and if you don't have

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.930 
wire for something and if you don't have
something<00:04:50.480> grounded<00:04:51.080> properly<00:04:51.730> then<00:04:52.730> it<00:04:52.850> will

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
something grounded properly then it will

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.600 
something grounded properly then it will
cause<00:04:53.090> it<00:04:53.120> not<00:04:53.390> to<00:04:53.450> function<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.710> in<00:04:55.310> addition

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
cause it not to function so in addition

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.070 
cause it not to function so in addition
to<00:04:55.820> making<00:04:56.000> sure<00:04:56.240> that<00:04:56.330> your<00:04:56.570> plugs<00:04:56.870> are

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
to making sure that your plugs are

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.230 
to making sure that your plugs are
actually<00:04:57.440> taught<00:04:57.680> make<00:04:58.580> sure<00:04:58.760> that<00:04:58.910> you<00:04:59.030> have

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
actually taught make sure that you have

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.820 
actually taught make sure that you have
all<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.450> your<00:04:59.660> grounding<00:05:00.170> bolts<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.620> stuff

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
all of your grounding bolts and stuff

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.470 
all of your grounding bolts and stuff
back<00:05:01.010> into<00:05:01.310> place<00:05:01.490> properly<00:05:03.100> so<00:05:04.100> yeah<00:05:04.760> just

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
back into place properly so yeah just

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.610 
back into place properly so yeah just
thought<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.660> would<00:05:05.780> throw<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.260> out<00:05:06.290> there

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
thought I would throw that out there

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.550 
thought I would throw that out there
you've<00:05:07.220> got<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.430> bolt<00:05:07.700> here<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.330> big<00:05:08.870> one<00:05:08.900> that

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
you've got a bolt here a big one that

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.010 
you've got a bolt here a big one that
attaches<00:05:09.890> to<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.250> skeleton<00:05:10.730> of<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:10.940> dash<00:05:11.420> one

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
attaches to the skeleton of the dash one

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.200 
attaches to the skeleton of the dash one
on<00:05:12.170> either<00:05:12.380> side<00:05:12.500> of<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.890> truck<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:13.400> you<00:05:14.030> also

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
on either side of the truck and you also

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.570 
on either side of the truck and you also
have<00:05:14.570> two<00:05:14.870> or<00:05:15.020> three<00:05:15.050> small<00:05:15.400> grounding<00:05:16.400> wires

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
have two or three small grounding wires

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.670 
have two or three small grounding wires
that<00:05:16.970> screw<00:05:17.270> into<00:05:17.570> either<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.020> skeleton<00:05:18.590> of
