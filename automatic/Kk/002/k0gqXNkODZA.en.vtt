00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.520 
first and first I'm going to take this
car<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:22.140> brush<00:02:22.769> out<00:02:23.129> any<00:02:23.459> flyaways<00:02:24.120> and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.830 

this<00:02:28.530> look<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.160> easy<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.970> make<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.480> think<00:02:30.750> it

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
this look is so easy to make I think it

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.080 
this look is so easy to make I think it
takes<00:02:31.080> me<00:02:31.319> about<00:02:31.349> two<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.190> three<00:02:32.220> minutes<00:02:32.670> so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
takes me about two to three minutes so

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.990 
takes me about two to three minutes so
it's<00:02:33.450> perfectly<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.549> tired<00:02:35.910> right<00:02:36.480> here

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
it's perfectly it just tired right here

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.339 
it's perfectly it just tired right here
with<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> small<00:02:39.989> time<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.370> I'll<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.150> tie<00:02:42.750> once

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
with a small time and I'll just tie once

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.420 
with a small time and I'll just tie once
as<00:02:44.299> these<00:02:45.299> are<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.780> small<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.190> easily

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
as these are so small and you can easily

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.259 
as these are so small and you can easily
break<00:02:47.940> them<00:02:48.239> if<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.780> tie<00:02:49.530> them<00:02:49.739> twice<00:02:50.269> three

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
break them if you tie them twice three

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.430 
break them if you tie them twice three
times<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.530> can<00:02:53.569> put<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:54.720> elastic<00:02:55.230> like

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
times so you can put this elastic like

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.869 
times so you can put this elastic like
this<00:02:55.790> or<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.900> say<00:02:58.230> ties<00:02:58.670> yeah

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
this or you say ties yeah

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.589 
this or you say ties yeah
so<00:03:00.709> in<00:03:01.709> Germany<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.400> him<00:03:02.610> then<00:03:02.790> might<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.150> call

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
so in Germany and him then might be call

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.259 
so in Germany and him then might be call
them<00:03:03.810> elastic<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.709> that's<00:03:05.069> why<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.340> saying

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
them elastic so that's why I'm saying

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.000 
them elastic so that's why I'm saying
that<00:03:06.450> all<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.900> time<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.379> I'm<00:03:07.440> taking<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
that all the time so I'm taking the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.030 
that all the time so I'm taking the
other<00:03:08.160> one<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> other<00:03:10.799> part<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.340> my<00:03:11.519> hair

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
other one to the other part of my hair

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.759 
other one to the other part of my hair
and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.940> I'm<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.840> smooth<00:03:16.290> out

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
and then I'm just going to smooth out

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:25.020 
and then I'm just going to smooth out
the<00:03:16.980> hair<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:18.109> put<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.560> almost<00:03:20.430> same<00:03:20.670> place

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.030 

just<00:03:25.330> take<00:03:25.690> me<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.140> little<00:03:26.470> bit

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.660 

then<00:03:31.790> I'm<00:03:32.120> going<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.780> take<00:03:33.049> my<00:03:33.260> comm<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.860> then

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
then I'm going to take my comm and then

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.750 
then I'm going to take my comm and then
I'm<00:03:34.819> just<00:03:34.849> going<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.510> lift<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:36.340> little<00:03:37.340> bit<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:37.730> I

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
I'm just going to lift a little bit so I

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.180 
I'm just going to lift a little bit so I
get<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.360> lot<00:03:38.569> more<00:03:38.599> will<00:03:38.959> you

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.270 

okay<00:03:46.060> maybe<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.810> too<00:03:47.050> much<00:03:47.320> but<00:03:47.710> um<00:03:47.950> you

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
okay maybe this is too much but um you

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.730 
okay maybe this is too much but um you
can<00:03:48.460> adjust<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.090> how<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.300> would<00:03:49.570> like<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:50.050> so

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
can adjust it how you would like it so

00:03:50.740 --> 00:04:01.170 
can adjust it how you would like it so
for<00:03:50.950> me<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> like<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.940> be<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.390> like<00:03:52.750> this

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.420 

so<00:04:01.900> now<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.230> have<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.739> where<00:04:03.069> we<00:04:03.220> will

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
so now you have this where we will

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.080 
so now you have this where we will
luminous<00:04:03.760> um<00:04:04.769> Dali<00:04:05.769> hair<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.579> top<00:04:06.849> and

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
luminous um Dali hair on the top and

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.300 
luminous um Dali hair on the top and
then<00:04:07.450> on<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.720> bottom<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.230> will<00:04:08.560> just<00:04:09.010> take<00:04:09.250> a

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
then on the bottom I will just take a

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.250 
then on the bottom I will just take a
piece<00:04:09.849> from<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:11.970> from<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.120> back<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.659> then<00:04:13.989> I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
piece from the from the back and then I

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.529 
piece from the from the back and then I
will<00:04:14.439> turn<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.950> around<00:04:15.189> the<00:04:16.120> tie<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.419> hide<00:04:16.810> it

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.260 

then<00:04:22.539> after<00:04:23.380> training<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.979> over<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.669> would<00:04:24.910> just

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
then after training it over I would just

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:33.330 
then after training it over I would just
take<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.810> bobby<00:04:26.050> pin<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.870> stick<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.680> in<00:04:32.919> there

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
take the bobby pin and stick it in there

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.600 
take the bobby pin and stick it in there
so<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:34.120> holds<00:04:34.330> very<00:04:34.780> greatly<00:04:35.199> I'm<00:04:35.949> going<00:04:36.400> to

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
so it holds very greatly I'm going to

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.820 
so it holds very greatly I'm going to
use<00:04:36.850> two<00:04:37.210> on<00:04:37.389> each<00:04:37.600> sides<00:04:37.960> because<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.470> have

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
use two on each sides because I have

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.570 
use two on each sides because I have
layers<00:04:39.250> in<00:04:39.460> my<00:04:39.490> hair<00:04:40.740> before<00:04:41.740> time<00:04:42.220> when<00:04:42.460> I

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
layers in my hair before time when I

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.730 
layers in my hair before time when I
didn't<00:04:42.910> have<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.360> layers<00:04:43.570> then<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.289> was<00:04:44.530> much

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
didn't have the layers then it was much

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.560 
didn't have the layers then it was much
easier<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.430> work<00:04:45.789> with<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.870> um<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:48.210> think<00:04:49.210> it's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
easier to work with but um I think it's

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.660 
easier to work with but um I think it's
okay

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.040 

then<00:04:57.670> I'm<00:04:57.910> going<00:04:58.150> to<00:04:58.240> do<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.600> same<00:04:58.780> on<00:04:58.960> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
then I'm going to do the same on the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.650 
then I'm going to do the same on the
other<00:04:59.080> side<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.860> it's<00:05:00.220> so<00:05:00.460> easy<00:05:00.730> um<00:05:01.330> it's

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
other side and it's so easy um it's

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.900 
other side and it's so easy um it's
easier<00:05:02.110> if<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.500> don't<00:05:02.650> have<00:05:02.980> layers<00:05:03.310> because

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
easier if you don't have layers because

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:23.740 
easier if you don't have layers because
then<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.630> fly<00:05:04.930> race<00:05:05.260> will<00:05:05.530> not<00:05:05.560> come<00:05:05.980> on

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:33.130 

so

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.430 

and<00:05:33.710> just<00:05:34.040> take<00:05:34.370> some<00:05:34.400> practice<00:05:34.910> to<00:05:35.510> put<00:05:36.200> these

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
and just take some practice to put these

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.720 
and just take some practice to put these
bobby<00:05:37.430> pins<00:05:37.820> in<00:05:38.060> because<00:05:38.570> um<00:05:39.430> they<00:05:40.430> can't

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
bobby pins in because um they can't

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.370 
bobby pins in because um they can't
sleep<00:05:41.000> in<00:05:41.270> Sudan<00:05:41.890> elastic<00:05:43.240> time<00:05:44.240> I'm<00:05:44.900> doing<00:05:45.260> it

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
sleep in Sudan elastic time I'm doing it

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.280
