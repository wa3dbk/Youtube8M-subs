00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
surveillance system I don't know it

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.230 
surveillance system I don't know it
seems<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.360> little<00:00:09.740> overwhelming<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.880> can't

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
seems a little overwhelming but I can't

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.180 
seems a little overwhelming but I can't
afford<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.570> lose<00:00:12.780> two<00:00:12.990> cases<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.559> inventory

again<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:15.020> little<00:00:16.020> peace<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.289> mind<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.460> too

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
again a little peace of mind is that too

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.540 
again a little peace of mind is that too
