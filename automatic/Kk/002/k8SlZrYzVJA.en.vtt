00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.410
 what do you need to do this DIY 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.570
 I have a coke bottle 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.920
 Tens of leaves would have had powder 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.560
 to be 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.400
 I have 50 milliliters of water around five 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.269
 so a 250 milliliter cola in minutes 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.900
 first of all, hammers crash 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.910
 cut open and with three points of the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.030
 flat invite cut the two points 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.219
 off and is in pretty soon then he 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.420
 soon, even when he is big, this is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.380
 portion of the bottle cutters woman 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 half out 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.719
 one cannot be exactly three to make us blue 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.219
 doing well through my intercepted 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.780
 girl with scissors 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.660
 afterwards this is properly cleaned inside 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 with a piece of paper and I speak the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.809
 inside of the bottle in my pan 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.610
 coaching or just a football boat 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.920
 little oil 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 so look in total at nine more valid tens 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.190
 9 sheets 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.530
 cut it small and put the water away on it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.910
 soak false light 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 and if it is known every 10 hours 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.979
 I prefer to do it with a pan of water 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.350
 and of low heat but I pass 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.540
 heat finally and do one small 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.490
 bit of coke when feeding 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.390
 will tienen is completely incorporated and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 a nice milf yes than our colette 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.900
 call them a glass 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.360
 grants cup of this easy she wins 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.939
 and we do slowly chill out ten 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.579
 add water with knowledge of each 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.960
 do soft drinks that you like yourself 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.520
 and every now and then we add the van 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.799
 we are going to do something dark here 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.240
 And then we're going to tell people about ten 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.880
 let them stand in your pocket for minutes 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.860
 skimmed off then I do 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 I put my bottle in a new order 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.100
 put the leaf and have two the circle 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.020
 encounter lesson further roll and I go 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.970
 briefly foam from my mixture 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.909
 scraping it does not necessarily have to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.930
 with it gives a nicer gimme on it 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.119
 end 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.799
 then pour it in and let's have it 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.899
 cool for about half an hour until it 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.860
 is actually well filled and that goes then 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.350
 in the fridge 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.959
 sometimes because oh damn what shapes 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.610
 fill it to little babies and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.200
 in addition to being in the fridge for about 4 hours 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.110
 this became the result 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.550
 he is super solid then loosen 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.430
 do you just go by basket we went 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.900
 to see passing by 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.730
 me if we were in the top was not 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.890
 good at spreading the door too 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.239
 broke 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.670
 what angles and lines I have in the end 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.959
 green can put each other 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.970
 women she was completely successful 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.530
 So more coline can do thicker ones 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.000
 low part is stone 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.459
 but is this really a solid can 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.410
 become completely liberated and awful 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.819
 nice but you can as I said with 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.319
 every soda do i have it here 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.670
 done with syrup 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.330
 you can do it with is what severn it needs 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.190
 do coke with cassis month and uh what is 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.599
 Always treat all actually think of you

 can use it to make your own choices 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.269
 to make 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.069
 this cube stays in the fridges 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.810
 a bowl for about a week or three and four 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.069
 good but as long as free to us not 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.420
