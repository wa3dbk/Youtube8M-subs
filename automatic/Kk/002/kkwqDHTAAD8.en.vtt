00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
regular basis because the cleats can

regular basis because the cleats can
move<00:00:34.170> we're<00:00:34.440> clipping<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.280> the

like well no wonder you're getting pain
in<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:53.910> left<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.539> leg<00:00:54.840> look<00:00:55.320> at

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
in your left in your right leg look at

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.069 
in your left in your right leg look at
the<00:00:55.559> cleat<00:00:55.800> compared<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the cleat compared to here I like to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.139 
the cleat compared to here I like to
have<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> cleat<00:00:58.680> move<00:00:59.010> back<00:00:59.370> along<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> shoe

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
have the cleat move back along the shoe

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 
have the cleat move back along the shoe
I<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.539> gives<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:00.960> more<00:01:00.989> power<00:01:01.460> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
I think it gives you a bit more power it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
I think it gives you a bit more power it
certainly<00:01:03.000> helps<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> stop<00:01:03.840> hot<00:01:04.080> foot<00:01:04.350> where

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
certainly helps to stop hot foot where

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
certainly helps to stop hot foot where
your<00:01:04.619> toes<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:04.890> numb<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> great

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
your toes go numb so this is a great

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.149 
your toes go numb so this is a great
starting<00:01:07.049> point<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.530> you're<00:01:07.680> unsure<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
starting point and if you're unsure of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.840 
starting point and if you're unsure of
where<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:09.180> put<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.479> cleats<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.590> lot<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
where to put your cleats and a lot of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
where to put your cleats and a lot of
riders<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.210> regardless<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.200> their<00:01:13.320> age<00:01:13.560> and

experience in the school move the cleat
back<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.799> try<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.460> start<00:01:17.880> off<00:01:17.970> with

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
back just try to that start off with

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.170 
back just try to that start off with
those<00:01:18.360> move<00:01:18.689> fully<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.470> centered<00:01:19.860> in

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
those move fully back and is centered in

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.899 
those move fully back and is centered in
the<00:01:21.180> shoe<00:01:21.890> when<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.009> go<00:01:23.130> through<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.759> fit

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the shoe when we go through the fit

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.249 
the shoe when we go through the fit
process<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.450> look<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> few<00:01:24.930> other<00:01:25.049> things

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
process we look at a few other things

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.140 
process we look at a few other things
but<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.240> like<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.600> always<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:28.590> check

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
but I like this but always just check

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
but I like this but always just check
your<00:01:30.150> cleats<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.540> make<00:01:30.750> sure<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.799> they're

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
your cleats and make sure that they're

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.490 
your cleats and make sure that they're
both<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.060> same<00:01:33.270> position<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
both in the same position and if you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.870 
both in the same position and if you
again<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.799> you're<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:34.979> sure<00:01:35.189> position<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.729> put

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
again if you're not sure position to put

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
again if you're not sure position to put
them<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.090> moving<00:01:36.299> back<00:01:36.590> okay

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
them in moving back okay

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.289 
them in moving back okay
good<00:01:38.009> starting<00:01:38.400> point<00:01:39.320> tip<00:01:40.320> number<00:01:40.500> two<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
good starting point tip number two is

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.300 
good starting point tip number two is
the<00:01:42.299> saddle<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.200> foundation<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> fit

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the saddle is the foundation of the fit

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.530 
the saddle is the foundation of the fit
so<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.240> important<00:01:46.040> when<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.759> either

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
so it's really important when you either

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.310 
so it's really important when you either
buy<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> bike<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.840> you're<00:01:51.840> looking<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.290> a

saddles<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:49.609> use<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.540> saddle<00:03:50.870> for

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
saddles and that you use the saddle for

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.449 
saddles and that you use the saddle for
a<00:03:51.109> period<00:03:51.379> of<00:03:51.439> time<00:03:51.620> before<00:03:51.949> you<00:03:52.009> have<00:03:52.069> to<00:03:52.310> make

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
a period of time before you have to make

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.780 
a period of time before you have to make
a<00:03:52.489> purchase<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.979> saddle<00:03:54.979> is<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.189> foundation

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
a purchase so saddle is the foundation

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.839 
a purchase so saddle is the foundation
and<00:03:55.879> number<00:03:56.180> three<00:03:56.509> and<00:03:57.400> I'm<00:03:58.400> going<00:03:58.609> to<00:03:58.669> do

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
and number three and I'm going to do

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.890

number<00:04:03.859> three<00:04:04.189> is<00:04:04.370> hands<00:04:05.150> higher<00:04:05.359> than<00:04:05.569> elbows

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
number three is hands higher than elbows

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.460 
number three is hands higher than elbows
to<00:04:06.560> me<00:04:06.739> it's<00:04:07.099> just<00:04:07.519> way<00:04:08.449> more<00:04:08.479> aerodynamic<00:04:09.319> and

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
to me it's just way more aerodynamic and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.740 
to me it's just way more aerodynamic and
it's<00:04:09.650> more<00:04:10.040> comfortable<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:11.359> what<00:04:11.509> do<00:04:11.569> I<00:04:11.629> mean

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
it's more comfortable so what do I mean

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.589 
it's more comfortable so what do I mean
by<00:04:11.810> hands<00:04:12.349> higher<00:04:12.650> than<00:04:12.829> elbows<00:04:13.129> well<00:04:13.599> they

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
by hands higher than elbows well they

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.089 
by hands higher than elbows well they
will<00:04:14.720> call<00:04:14.900> these<00:04:15.049> arm<00:04:15.229> pads<00:04:15.500> I<00:04:15.680> believe<00:04:15.979> they

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
will call these arm pads I believe they

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.469 
will call these arm pads I believe they
should<00:04:16.130> be<00:04:16.400> called<00:04:16.609> elbow<00:04:16.880> pads<00:04:17.120> because<00:04:17.299> your

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
should be called elbow pads because your

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.110 
should be called elbow pads because your
elbow<00:04:17.870> should<00:04:18.139> be<00:04:18.320> on<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.769> pad<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.250> this<00:04:20.000> is

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
elbow should be on the pad and this is

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.060 
elbow should be on the pad and this is
important<00:04:20.659> the<00:04:20.779> further<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.380> go<00:04:21.529> the<00:04:21.560> longer

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
important the further you go the longer

elbow<00:04:27.710> on<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.979> pad<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.550> have<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.360> sort<00:04:29.540> of

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
elbow on the pad and have that sort of

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.950 
elbow on the pad and have that sort of
90<00:04:30.139> degree<00:04:30.759> elbow<00:04:31.759> angles<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.300> your<00:04:32.449> skeletal

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
90 degree elbow angles so your skeletal

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.350 
90 degree elbow angles so your skeletal
is<00:04:33.050> supported<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.740> then<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.550> hand<00:04:34.820> comes<00:04:35.150> out

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
is supported and then the hand comes out

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.150 
is supported and then the hand comes out
to<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.720> end<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.110> extension<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:36.919> can

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
to the end of the extension so you can

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.659 
to the end of the extension so you can
see<00:04:37.370> naturally<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.810> hand<00:04:39.169> sits<00:04:39.800> higher<00:04:40.100> than

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
see naturally the hand sits higher than

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.570 
see naturally the hand sits higher than
the<00:04:40.850> elbow<00:04:41.470> what<00:04:42.470> does<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.620> mean<00:04:42.979> one<00:04:43.430> other

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
the elbow what does that mean one other

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.110 
the elbow what does that mean one other
one<00:04:43.759> is<00:04:43.910> comfortable<00:04:45.009> number<00:04:46.009> two<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.580> acts<00:04:46.880> as

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
one is comfortable number two it acts as

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.969 
one is comfortable number two it acts as
an<00:04:47.240> anchor<00:04:47.479> point<00:04:47.690> here<00:04:48.229> you<00:04:48.560> know<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.740> could

an anchor point here you know you could
be<00:04:49.100> in<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.220> pretty<00:04:49.460> aggressive<00:04:49.729> position<00:04:50.419> your

against the ski bend and also the hand

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.180 
against the ski bend and also the hand
will<00:05:05.539> break<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:06.020> wind<00:05:06.229> but<00:05:06.650> then<00:05:06.770> there's<00:05:06.979> no

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
will break the wind but then there's no

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.980 
will break the wind but then there's no
drag<00:05:07.550> along<00:05:07.699> the<00:05:07.820> forearm<00:05:08.330> because<00:05:08.510> it's<00:05:08.780> it's

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
bottle in here it's the first place you

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.950 
bottle in here it's the first place you
should<00:05:13.310> be<00:05:13.520> carrying<00:05:13.880> a<00:05:13.940> bottle<00:05:14.270> just<00:05:14.449> a

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
should be carrying a bottle just a

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.170 
should be carrying a bottle just a

standard horizontal drink bottle and it

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.560 
standard horizontal drink bottle and it
actually<00:05:17.330> makes<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:17.870> by<00:05:18.020> quicker<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.490> you<00:05:20.479> know

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
actually makes it by quicker so you know

other types of extension s spend

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.150 
other types of extension s spend
extension<00:05:26.720> that'll<00:05:27.349> still<00:05:27.590> allow<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:27.889> to<00:05:28.039> get

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
extension that'll still allow you to get

extension that'll still allow you to get
your<00:05:28.220> hands<00:05:28.610> higher<00:05:28.789> than<00:05:28.970> your<00:05:29.120> all<00:05:29.210> those

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
your hands higher than your all those

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.390 
your hands higher than your all those
but<00:05:29.539> it<00:05:29.630> doesn't<00:05:29.930> give<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.169> that<00:05:31.070> let

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
but it doesn't give you that that let

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.390 
but it doesn't give you that that let
place<00:05:31.639> to<00:05:31.880> rest<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.389> hands<00:05:32.630> okay

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
place to rest the hands okay

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.089 
place to rest the hands okay
so<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.060> like<00:05:35.419> these<00:05:35.630> but<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.199> know<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.740> they're

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
so I like these but you know and they're

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.730

not for everybody but uh certainly some

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.200 
not for everybody but uh certainly some
people<00:05:40.010> love<00:05:40.130> air<00:05:40.280> spins<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:40.760> I<00:05:40.789> have<00:05:40.880> nothing

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
people love air spins and I have nothing

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.180 
people love air spins and I have nothing
against<00:05:41.599> them<00:05:41.720> good<00:05:42.560> bars<00:05:44.199> I'm<00:05:45.199> not<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.590> fan<00:05:45.889> of

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
against them good bars I'm not a fan of

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.500 
against them good bars I'm not a fan of
the<00:05:46.789> straight<00:05:47.090> extension<00:05:47.690> because<00:05:48.590> this<00:05:48.770> this

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
the straight extension because this this

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.680 
the straight extension because this this
again<00:05:50.510> you<00:05:50.630> can<00:05:50.750> see<00:05:50.930> here<00:05:51.199> the<00:05:51.349> pad<00:05:52.360> now<00:05:53.360> sits

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
again you can see here the pad now sits

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.659 
again you can see here the pad now sits
higher<00:05:54.080> than<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.860> extension<00:05:55.400> so<00:05:55.550> I'm

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
higher than the extension so I'm

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.180 
higher than the extension so I'm
actually<00:05:55.820> having<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.330> turn<00:05:56.599> my<00:05:56.930> wrists<00:05:57.260> and

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
actually having to turn my wrists and

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.010 
actually having to turn my wrists and
that<00:05:58.580> can<00:05:58.760> cause<00:05:58.940> pain<00:05:59.240> in<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.539> wrist<00:05:59.659> and<00:05:59.900> in

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
that can cause pain in the wrist and in

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.230 
that can cause pain in the wrist and in
the<00:06:00.139> forearm<00:06:00.560> but<00:06:01.039> it<00:06:01.190> also<00:06:01.340> opens<00:06:01.970> up<00:06:02.090> the

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
the forearm but it also opens up the

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.360 
the forearm but it also opens up the
forearm<00:06:02.659> to<00:06:02.840> drag<00:06:03.139> you<00:06:03.590> create<00:06:03.919> drag<00:06:04.190> along

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
forearm to drag you create drag along

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.879 
forearm to drag you create drag along
man<00:06:04.639> it<00:06:04.760> slows<00:06:05.000> you<00:06:05.120> down<00:06:05.150> now<00:06:05.870> people<00:06:06.530> think<00:06:06.710> I

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
man it slows you down now people think I

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.270 
man it slows you down now people think I
what<00:06:07.789> difference<00:06:08.090> does<00:06:08.210> it<00:06:08.270> make<00:06:09.010> it<00:06:10.010> can't

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
what difference does it make it can't

two minutes really means to you but
again<00:06:27.830> I<00:06:28.070> think<00:06:28.099> that<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.940> primary<00:06:29.150> thing<00:06:29.510> so

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
again I think that the primary thing so

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.290 
again I think that the primary thing so
yes<00:06:29.900> aerodynamic<00:06:30.590> so<00:06:31.099> the<00:06:31.220> comfort<00:06:31.610> factor<00:06:31.789> so

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
yes aerodynamic so the comfort factor so

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.870 
yes aerodynamic so the comfort factor so
