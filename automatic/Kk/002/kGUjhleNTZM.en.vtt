00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619

with<00:00:58.739> how<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.010> performed<00:00:59.549> it<00:00:59.760> overall<00:01:00.269> I

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
with how we performed it overall I

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:01.729 
with how we performed it overall I
thought<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.750> were<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:00.960> bright<00:01:01.080> spots<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
thought there were some bright spots and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.320 
thought there were some bright spots and
I<00:01:01.860> thought<00:01:02.040> bars<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.549> beam<00:01:02.670> overall<00:01:03.119> we're

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
I thought bars and beam overall we're

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.030 
I thought bars and beam overall we're
pretty<00:01:03.479> good<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:03.900> vault<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.650> floor<00:01:04.680> were<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
pretty good but vault and floor were a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
pretty good but vault and floor were a
little<00:01:05.189> bit<00:01:05.280> disappointing<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:05.880> gave<00:01:06.030> away

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
little bit disappointing we gave away

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.570 
little bit disappointing we gave away
way<00:01:06.659> too<00:01:06.720> much<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.260> extra<00:01:07.710> steps<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.159> landings

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
way too much on extra steps on landings

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.219 
way too much on extra steps on landings
and<00:01:08.700> things<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.930> shouldn't<00:01:10.200> be

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and things that that we shouldn't be

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.719 
and things that that we shouldn't be
doing<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.500> time<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.920> year<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.369> mind<00:01:11.640> if

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
doing this time of year I don't mind if

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
doing this time of year I don't mind if
we<00:01:11.820> don't<00:01:11.909> stick<00:01:12.240> everything<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.380> can't

leaving that many tents out on the table

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
leaving that many tents out on the table
when<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.430> an<00:01:17.520> opportunity<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.210> get

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
on that vault it's a pretty good vault

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.510 
on that vault it's a pretty good vault
we<00:04:58.720> do<00:04:58.870> get<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.080> little<00:04:59.319> bit<00:04:59.830> elbow<00:05:00.190> there<00:05:00.400> on

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
we do get a little bit elbow there on

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.909 
we do get a little bit elbow there on
the<00:05:00.639> table<00:05:00.819> and<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:02.199> feet<00:05:02.440> need<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.770> get<00:05:02.889> a

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
the table and the feet need to get a

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.499 
the table and the feet need to get a
little<00:05:03.039> more<00:05:03.250> pointed<00:05:03.699> but<00:05:03.849> in<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.090> little<00:05:04.330> pike

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
little more pointed but in a little pike

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.089 
little more pointed but in a little pike
down<00:05:04.750> but<00:05:04.930> not<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.110> bad<00:05:05.379> ball<00:05:05.650> all<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:05.919> way

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
down but not a bad ball all the way

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.409 
down but not a bad ball all the way
around<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.639> think<00:05:06.849> she's<00:05:07.000> capable<00:05:07.180> of

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419
