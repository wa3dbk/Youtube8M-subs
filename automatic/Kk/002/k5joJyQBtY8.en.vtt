00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.620
 good evening well found in the living room 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.230
 aquatic of su english just dropped from 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.429
 from above it has reached the lower part of Rome 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.369
 of the podium 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.000
 we talk with a hustler immediately yes that is 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.730
 then first let a little before were i 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.710
 Pavesini then the shampoo but now I have 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.890

 super mario bros ambassador bets yes 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.089
 let's say it's not like it was done before 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:40.909
 green is not a betting campaign 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.580
 absolutely not is a campaign of 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:47.900
 responsibility for gambling 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.750
 in the sense that we say that the game 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.629
 the game exists there is no point in saying no 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.979
 needless to say contrary however like everything 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.110
 too much is said by us there 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.970
 casina valadier c a possible la 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.580

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.530
 initiative Monday Monday 15 in casina 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.360
 valadier press conference and then 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 when pilgrim lords move 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.509
 because today this morning to look at the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.789
 newspapers do not apply z without the 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.520
 courier I have a month that does not see 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:21.469
 nothing to those that are everywhere 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.210
 but if someone says that you don't 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.219
 speaks more than federica pilgrims to da 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.760
 happy and instead I 'm happy with 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.370
 feel 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.870
 mar hours in spain when it happened 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:37.700
 the crime is in Spain 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.640
 spain with typhoid contrary however 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.890
 no good guys finally arrived 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.080
 step by step the final after evening 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:53.540
 the things we have behind are isolated 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.160
 Also tt goodies appeal but the view 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.620
 it is therefore more or less always the same 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.370
 in short, that thing they were 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:05.390
 practically finished the highest lap 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.280
 but also roma rome rome rome i will love it 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.690
 ki moon of swimming and then there is the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.209
 murals not so bad that arrived 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.950
 hot that runs away anyway 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.329
 the most beautiful tub in the world is not there 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.819
 there is nothing to do 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.670
 this is the most beautiful tank in the world 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.980
 sirio from here ska you are a clamorous form 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.780
 first front back side to side six 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.349
 beautiful they say this cheap goes 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.900
 well it's not like they say these four 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.000
 you are not beautiful thanks race a little 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.580
 bianchina is still 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.160
 however we take more days in the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.130
 sense that you are not doing Rome's catwalk no 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.500
 catwalk not yet yet I have to say 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.530
 that I will not do it I will never do it 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.360
 at least for air member who someone 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.250
 he said, do the riccione catwalk then 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.000
 the bad guys c4 didn't look good as given 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.950
 absolute you will understand for the importance that a 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.380
 sometimes they have gone wrong sometimes 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.480
 this year they did not go very well there 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.660
 however, there were other problems too 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.570
 now not heard so many in the 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.090
 my career that sure if yes I enter 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.940
 the amount of curtains followed say that 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.280
 in evil it is enough if you talk about it then it goes 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.980
 well so next year the last note 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.500
 next year I think yes and then you know 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.900
 in life never say never but I think that 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.550
 for a sandra bet of those 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.440
 pilgrims who are coaches 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:38.350
 I would like to see here but I do n't say no 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.420
 honestly because anyway I think that 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.850
 I'll be pretty bad it's like 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.320
 coach why not found enough 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.320
 bad in my career 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.970
 the appropriate medium to some supertop 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.340
 grandfather who passed here and there but was 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.630
 a little sweeter so then later as it is 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.050
 last way, I made peace with 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.620
 but if not badly because he couldn't 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.080
 more ok, oh well it's clear we are 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.640
 responsible we spoke we are there 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.830
 we are clarified but I must say that you are 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.470
 slowly kicking him too and into 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.900
 sense that is understanding the climate succeed 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.780
 this is not so we talk so much about 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.540
 football but in fact you said well 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.250
 everything must be talked about if 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.300
 We have to have a bit of zest also 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.700
 because then also with us athletes 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.980
 honestly I'm used to always giving 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.720
 all 100 percent of messina 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.970
 workout though having someone out 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.400
 from the water that spurs you on the day that 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.010
 maybe you're dead and can give el 80 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.830
 he succeeds of the other 20 then 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:48.860
 in short, a point is important 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:51.560
 on a serene out a cone I have to say that if 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.900
 no I have to say that sometimes it's good for 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.240
 to disconnect at least to me is good to detach a 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.070
 a little bit from Italy, not that I weigh it 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.650
 but just change environment then 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.010
 we had a beautiful group of all 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.800
 boys was a collegiate in 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.020
 week and a half of pure effort however in 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.470
 all the senses also from the point of view 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:17.180
 contaldo food I 'm looking forward to 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.620
 eat my first pizza after 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:24.960
 connect to 6 for strength but also pizza 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.970
 but I go on the classic that is 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.610
 comfortable the buffalo mozzarella me it 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.380
 I enjoy if I immediately remember one thing 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.259
 than before the London Olympics 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.699
 tell me if I'm wrong you were noticing one 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.940
 morning you are training at 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.620
 the swimmers launched a lot arrives a 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.250
 epos or buffalo mozzarella board 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.639
 tub were for you but it's a world non 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.639
 certain lipstick and brought this they told me 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.830
 no she wants the buffalo mozzarella the 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.250
 president lisi my president 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.410
 he but he of high youth you like 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.020
 at the club there are mozzarella di 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:06.990
 very good buffalo we say you can also 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:10.560
 eat both want costume fitting and so 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.539
 everything must be dosed all rosÃ© at 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.190
 right point but in short, there is one 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.419
 buffalo mozzarella we are a 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.070
 Pilgrims balanced without the yes yes yes 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.159
 I think so from 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:27.060
 with age I will become more and more 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:29.550
 always growling you find well here it is already 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.130
 asked the question 50,000 times 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.720
 a future to think of coming to Rome e 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.259
 read since you are Roman of 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.650
 adoption 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.570
 I'm fine based on wet now with Rome 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.969
 your president even if he lunches 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.250
 he would like very much but there is even one 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:50.490
 this praise and family tradition are 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:51.030
 juventina therefore I will remain I will remain in 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.350
 that street 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:58.170
 good even if he pushes pushes 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.830
 no, there is proven evidence to prove this 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.230
 we are almost 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.720

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.090
 indication 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.880

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.850

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.220
