certainly<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.170> evening<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.340> will

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
certainly for this evening and it will

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.120 
certainly for this evening and it will
be<00:01:32.729> windy<00:01:32.939> too<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.659> wind<00:01:33.869> chills<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
be windy too so wind chills will be a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
be windy too so wind chills will be a
factor<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.090> let's<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.390> into<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> weekend

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
factor so let's get into the weekend

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.319 
factor so let's get into the weekend
here<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> focus<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
here and I'm going to focus more on the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
here and I'm going to focus more on the
Canadian<00:01:40.020> model<00:01:40.170> where<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> gym<00:01:40.829> model

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
Canadian model where the gym model

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.889 
Canadian model where the gym model
because<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> has<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.630> did

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
because I do think it has a it did

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.679 
because I do think it has a it did
really<00:01:43.049> well<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.590> last<00:01:43.799> system<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.280> had<00:01:44.689> over

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
really well the last system we had over

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.300 
really well the last system we had over
last<00:01:46.020> weekend<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.280> has

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
last weekend and I think this one has

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.429 
last weekend and I think this one has
probably<00:01:47.759> got<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> better<00:01:48.060> idea<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:49.079> becoming

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
probably got a better idea it's becoming

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.050 
probably got a better idea it's becoming
more<00:01:49.680> obvious<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.549> we're<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> have

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
more obvious that we're going to have

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.760 
more obvious that we're going to have
more<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> low<00:01:51.630> pressure<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.259> developing

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
more of a low pressure here developing

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.440 
more of a low pressure here developing
across<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.820> southern<00:01:53.970> part<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> United

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
across the southern part of the United

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.789 
across the southern part of the United
States<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
States it's going to be more the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.880 
States it's going to be more the
dominant<00:01:56.340> low<00:01:57.020> then<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.229> will<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.500> across

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
dominant low then we will have across

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.350 
dominant low then we will have across
the<00:01:58.950> northern<00:01:59.399> branch<00:01:59.610> features<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.240> know

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the northern branch features you know

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.490 
the northern branch features you know
for<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> while<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.990> were<00:02:01.049> thinking<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.409> would

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
for a while we were thinking we would

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
for a while we were thinking we would
have<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> low<00:02:01.920> up<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> Great<00:02:03.030> Lakes<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
have a low up in the Great Lakes that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
have a low up in the Great Lakes that
may<00:02:03.719> try<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> pull<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.740> develop<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.610> we

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
may try to pull in and develop what we

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.429 
may try to pull in and develop what we
call<00:02:05.729> double<00:02:06.299> area<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.570> low<00:02:06.689> pressure<00:02:06.719> across

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
call double area of low pressure across

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.380 
call double area of low pressure across
areas<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> great<00:02:08.610> lakes<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.060> northeast

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
areas of the great lakes and northeast

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.059 
areas of the great lakes and northeast
that<00:02:09.569> would<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.780> made<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.379> complicated<00:02:10.950> be

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that would have made the complicated be

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.640 
that would have made the complicated be
you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.940> difficult<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.930> forecast<00:02:13.140> for

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you know difficult for the forecast for

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.500 
you know difficult for the forecast for
complicated<00:02:14.189> in<00:02:14.340> finding<00:02:14.909> out<00:02:15.000> snow<00:02:15.329> amounts

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
complicated in finding out snow amounts

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.140 
complicated in finding out snow amounts
but<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.319> looks<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> main<00:02:17.040> low<00:02:17.250> as<00:02:17.519> it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
but this looks to be the main low as it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.149 
but this looks to be the main low as it
moves<00:02:18.329> on<00:02:18.480> through<00:02:18.689> so<00:02:19.079> couple<00:02:19.860> things<00:02:20.010> here

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
moves on through so couple things here

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.009 
moves on through so couple things here
first<00:02:20.459> off<00:02:20.909> we've<00:02:21.150> got<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.450> arctic<00:02:21.750> air<00:02:21.900> it's

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
first off we've got the arctic air it's

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.720 
first off we've got the arctic air it's
moving<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.379> tonight<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.950> will<00:02:23.099> still<00:02:23.430> be<00:02:23.700> here

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
moving in tonight it will still be here

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.780 
moving in tonight it will still be here
as<00:02:24.329> we<00:02:25.110> head<00:02:25.319> into<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> weekend<00:02:26.099> all<00:02:26.280> areas

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
as we head into the weekend all areas

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
as we head into the weekend all areas
north<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.120> east<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:27.480> low<00:02:27.689> still<00:02:28.079> very<00:02:28.349> cold

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
north and east that low still very cold

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.170 
north and east that low still very cold
so<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.489> factored<00:02:29.939> in<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
so that's going to be factored in the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.509 
so that's going to be factored in the
second<00:02:30.540> thing<00:02:30.689> is<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.470> snowpack<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.220> still

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
second thing is the snowpack is still

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.369 
second thing is the snowpack is still
there<00:02:32.760> mainly<00:02:33.090> across<00:02:33.390> donor<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.900> Kentucky

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
there mainly across donor in Kentucky

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.259 
there mainly across donor in Kentucky
and<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:35.010> good<00:02:35.159> chunk<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.459> Indiana<00:02:35.939> points

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
and a good chunk of Indiana points

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.210 
and a good chunk of Indiana points
northwards<00:02:36.689> so<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.049> will<00:02:37.230> also<00:02:37.769> lower

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
northwards so that will also lower

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.399 
northwards so that will also lower
temperatures<00:02:38.819> down<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.299> this<00:02:39.810> zone<00:02:40.109> more

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
temperatures down and this zone more

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.599 
temperatures down and this zone more

look<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.579> soundings<00:03:03.060> on<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.420> coming<00:03:03.689> up

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
look at the soundings on this coming up

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.780 
look at the soundings on this coming up
in<00:03:04.019> just<00:03:04.439> a<00:03:04.590> few<00:03:04.739> moments<00:03:04.889> now<00:03:05.280> put<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.579> in

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
in just a few moments now put that in

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.080 
in just a few moments now put that in
the<00:03:06.060> written<00:03:06.450> blog<00:03:06.750> more<00:03:07.019> than<00:03:07.170> anywhere<00:03:07.439> but

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
the written blog more than anywhere but

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.369 
the written blog more than anywhere but
well<00:03:09.090> that's<00:03:09.239> possible<00:03:09.689> that<00:03:09.840> freezing<00:03:10.230> rain

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
well that's possible that freezing rain

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.990 
well that's possible that freezing rain
here<00:03:10.560> i<00:03:10.590> think<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:10.920> may<00:03:11.040> be<00:03:11.069> more<00:03:11.370> snow<00:03:11.730> than

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
here i think it may be more snow than

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.940 
here i think it may be more snow than
freezing<00:03:12.629> rain<00:03:12.959> across<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.560> central

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
heavy snow breaking out and what we call

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.460 
heavy snow breaking out and what we call
the<00:03:18.120> deformation<00:03:18.629> zone<00:03:18.840> located<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.440> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
north side of the low that i think is

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.619 
north side of the low that i think is
likely<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.750> rain<00:03:22.290> there<00:03:22.560> off<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.370> south

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629

all<00:03:28.290> rain<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:29.250> system<00:03:29.669> now<00:03:29.849> looks<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.150> it's

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
all rain the system now looks like it's

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.199 
all rain the system now looks like it's
going<00:03:30.449> to<00:03:30.510> have<00:03:30.690> enough<00:03:31.079> of<00:03:31.199> a<00:03:31.319> subway<00:03:31.620> flow

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209

sunday<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:15.329> at<00:04:15.599> least<00:04:15.690> gives<00:04:15.930> us<00:04:16.049> an<00:04:16.139> idea<00:04:16.229> and

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
sunday so at least gives us an idea and

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.319 
sunday so at least gives us an idea and
you<00:04:16.680> see<00:04:16.829> it's<00:04:17.010> really<00:04:17.159> indicating<00:04:18.120> more<00:04:18.269> of

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
you see it's really indicating more of

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.810 
you see it's really indicating more of
an<00:04:18.419> issue<00:04:18.539> for<00:04:19.099> the<00:04:20.099> heavier<00:04:20.370> bands<00:04:20.579> of<00:04:20.729> snow

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
here locally with initial wave I think

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.470 
here locally with initial wave I think
that<00:04:24.960> looks<00:04:25.169> feasible<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.620> me<00:04:25.800> gfs<00:04:26.760> model

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
that looks feasible to me gfs model

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
not too far off of that idea again it's

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.160 
not too far off of that idea again it's
important<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.150> pay<00:04:30.360> attention<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:31.020> the

but<00:05:21.780> at<00:05:21.870> this<00:05:21.960> point<00:05:22.200> this<00:05:22.470> does<00:05:22.710> not<00:05:22.950> look<00:05:23.370> to

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
but at this point this does not look to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.970 
but at this point this does not look to
be<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.240> major<00:05:24.480> event<00:05:24.720> for<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.140> area<00:05:25.410> all<00:05:25.920> the

the<00:05:28.020> road<00:05:28.140> I<00:05:28.350> do<00:05:28.410> think<00:05:28.620> we're<00:05:28.710> going<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.890> warm

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
the road I do think we're going to warm

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.730 
the road I do think we're going to warm
things<00:05:29.250> up<00:05:29.520> as<00:05:29.790> we<00:05:30.510> head<00:05:30.690> into<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:31.200> early

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
things up as we head into the early

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
portions of the following week in fact

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.080 
portions of the following week in fact
we<00:05:33.930> could<00:05:34.050> even<00:05:34.260> see<00:05:34.500> 40s<00:05:34.980> climb<00:05:35.880> their<00:05:36.060> way

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
we could even see 40s climb their way

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.880 
we could even see 40s climb their way
well<00:05:36.450> into<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.780> Ohio<00:05:36.900> Valley<00:05:37.110> something<00:05:37.740> that

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
well into the Ohio Valley something that

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.830 
well into the Ohio Valley something that
will<00:05:38.040> feel<00:05:38.190> great<00:05:38.490> after<00:05:38.790> such<00:05:39.510> cold<00:05:39.750> weather

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
will feel great after such cold weather

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.070 
will feel great after such cold weather
but<00:05:40.590> look<00:05:40.740> at<00:05:40.860> this<00:05:41.040> Arctic<00:05:42.030> high<00:05:42.300> building<00:05:42.930> it

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
but look at this Arctic high building it

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.840 
but look at this Arctic high building it
this<00:05:43.230> is<00:05:43.380> tremendous<00:05:43.770> amount<00:05:44.310> of<00:05:44.400> cold<00:05:44.670> air

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
this is tremendous amount of cold air

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.970 
this is tremendous amount of cold air
that<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.630> coming<00:05:46.050> down<00:05:46.170> on<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.470> twentieth<00:05:46.860> and

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
that is coming down on the twentieth and

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.590 
that is coming down on the twentieth and
twenty-first<00:05:47.010> December<00:05:47.940> right<00:05:48.120> here<00:05:48.510> the

first day of winter and this is

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.160 
first day of winter and this is
interesting<00:05:51.240> because<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.690> way<00:05:51.780> things<00:05:51.840> are

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
interesting because the way things are

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.930 
interesting because the way things are
looking<00:05:52.200> as<00:05:52.620> we<00:05:52.770> head<00:05:52.980> into<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.280> first<00:05:53.640> a

couple days there the 21st 22nd
somewhere<00:05:56.730> on<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:56.850> range<00:05:57.420> we're<00:05:58.110> going<00:05:58.200> to

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
somewhere on that range we're going to

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.980 
somewhere on that range we're going to
have<00:05:58.410> a<00:05:58.440> 1033<00:05:59.190> high<00:05:59.580> that<00:06:00.420> is<00:06:00.540> going<00:06:00.690> to<00:06:00.750> build

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
have a 1033 high that is going to build

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.840 
have a 1033 high that is going to build
in<00:06:01.170> its<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.620> areas<00:06:02.190> of<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.370> central<00:06:02.670> part<00:06:02.820> of

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
do think we'll see what we call a

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.280 
do think we'll see what we call a
thumping<00:06:13.920> of<00:06:14.040> snow<00:06:14.310> as<00:06:14.610> we<00:06:14.670> head<00:06:15.360> into<00:06:15.690> time<00:06:15.960> so

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
thumping of snow as we head into time so

a struggle even so not too concerned
right<00:07:16.590> now<00:07:16.650> about<00:07:16.770> the<00:07:16.979> weekend<00:07:17.280> system<00:07:17.610> so

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:17.789 
right now about the weekend system so

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:19.430 
right now about the weekend system so
far<00:07:17.820> things<00:07:18.270> playing<00:07:18.599> out<00:07:18.750> to<00:07:18.900> where<00:07:19.020> we<00:07:19.349> got

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 
far things playing out to where we got

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.870 
far things playing out to where we got
really<00:07:19.650> good<00:07:19.830> confidence<00:07:20.310> is<00:07:20.460> the<00:07:20.490> way<00:07:20.699> it's

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
really good confidence is the way it's

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.980 
really good confidence is the way it's
going<00:07:20.970> to<00:07:21.060> happen<00:07:21.180> that<00:07:21.539> the<00:07:21.570> weather

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
going to happen that the weather

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.570 
going to happen that the weather
balloons<00:07:22.289> are<00:07:22.470> sampling<00:07:22.919> the<00:07:23.039> system<00:07:23.370> today

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
balloons are sampling the system today

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.629 
balloons are sampling the system today
so<00:07:24.479> the<00:07:24.720> model<00:07:24.900> runs<00:07:25.229> for<00:07:25.500> tonight<00:07:25.830> should

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 
so the model runs for tonight should

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:28.370 
so the model runs for tonight should
really<00:07:26.940> come<00:07:27.120> in<00:07:27.240> really<00:07:27.419> good<00:07:27.599> agreement<00:07:28.169> and

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
really come in really good agreement and

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.409 
really come in really good agreement and
I'll<00:07:28.470> be<00:07:28.620> make<00:07:29.039> sure<00:07:29.220> I<00:07:29.250> post<00:07:29.849> more<00:07:30.120> about<00:07:30.300> that

I'll be make sure I post more about that

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:32.300 
I'll be make sure I post more about that
