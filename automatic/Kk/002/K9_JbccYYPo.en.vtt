00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
weapon for me because majority of you

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.920 
weapon for me because majority of you
know<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.250> times<00:00:27.550> I'm<00:00:27.820> actually<00:00:28.000> fighting<00:00:28.449> is

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
know the times I'm actually fighting is

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.010 
know the times I'm actually fighting is
at<00:00:29.170> close<00:00:29.500> range<00:00:29.890> so<00:00:30.789> it's<00:00:31.600> a<00:00:31.750> shotgun

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
at close range so it's a shotgun

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.819 
at close range so it's a shotgun
obviously<00:00:32.980> it's<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.160> qbs<00:00:33.609> 09<00:00:34.539> and<00:00:34.930> my<00:00:35.710> own

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
obviously it's the qbs 09 and my own

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.979 
obviously it's the qbs 09 and my own
personal<00:00:36.250> preference<00:00:36.790> on<00:00:36.910> that<00:00:37.120> weapon<00:00:37.540> is<00:00:37.750> to

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
personal preference on that weapon is to

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.889 
personal preference on that weapon is to
have<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.290> coyote<00:00:38.770> red<00:00:39.160> dots<00:00:39.399> I<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:40.120> an

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
have the coyote red dots I and an

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.780 
have the coyote red dots I and an
accessory<00:00:41.649> doesn't<00:00:42.160> really<00:00:42.340> matter<00:00:42.520> now<00:00:42.640> the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
accessory doesn't really matter now the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.610 
accessory doesn't really matter now the
reason<00:00:42.970> I<00:00:43.180> want<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.480> coyote<00:00:43.930> red<00:00:44.140> dot<00:00:44.350> sight

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
reason I want the coyote red dot sight

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.560 
reason I want the coyote red dot sight
is<00:00:44.860> it<00:00:45.250> gives<00:00:45.460> you<00:00:45.610> much<00:00:45.850> more<00:00:45.880> peripheral

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
is it gives you much more peripheral

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.450 
is it gives you much more peripheral
vision<00:00:47.050> when<00:00:47.350> you're<00:00:47.530> aiming<00:00:47.829> down<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.040> site

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
vision when you're aiming down the site

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.880 
vision when you're aiming down the site
and<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:49.450> barrel<00:00:49.840> you're<00:00:50.110> gonna<00:00:50.260> want<00:00:50.559> to<00:00:50.710> have

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
and the barrel you're gonna want to have

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.920 
and the barrel you're gonna want to have
a<00:00:50.920> full<00:00:51.250> choke<00:00:51.670> because<00:00:52.300> it<00:00:52.420> tightens<00:00:52.870> the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
a full choke because it tightens the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.990 
a full choke because it tightens the
spread<00:00:53.410> of<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.620> bullets<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:54.460> therefore<00:00:54.880> if

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
spread of the bullets so therefore if

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.400 
spread of the bullets so therefore if
you've<00:00:55.120> got<00:00:55.329> good<00:00:55.570> aim<00:00:55.629> you<00:00:56.079> know<00:00:56.200> when<00:00:56.290> you're

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
you've got good aim you know when you're

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.319 
you've got good aim you know when you're
a<00:00:56.440> half<00:00:56.530> decent<00:00:56.890> player<00:00:57.340> you'll<00:00:57.910> be<00:00:58.090> able<00:00:58.180> to
