00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
modern warfare 3 when we had a elite

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.119 
modern warfare 3 when we had a elite
team<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.289> were<00:00:46.379> very<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.950> competitive

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
team and we were very very competitive

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.330 
team and we were very very competitive
especially<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> clan<00:00:48.300> ops<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:48.870> as

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
especially in the clan ops you know as

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.799 
especially in the clan ops you know as
Call<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> Duty<00:00:50.610> Elite<00:00:50.700> came<00:00:51.059> out<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.390> modern

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
Call of Duty Elite came out in modern

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
Call of Duty Elite came out in modern
warfare<00:00:51.930> 3<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.620> that's<00:00:53.370> basically<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:53.910> we

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
warfare 3 and that's basically how we

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
warfare 3 and that's basically how we
got<00:00:54.300> started<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.320> were<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> fourth<00:00:56.010> clan<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
got started we were the fourth clan I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.130 
got started we were the fourth clan I
believe<00:00:56.730> her<00:00:56.879> fifth<00:00:57.090> clan<00:00:57.300> maybe<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:58.020> hit

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
believe her fifth clan maybe to hit

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.750 
believe her fifth clan maybe to hit
level<00:00:58.289> 50<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.590> we<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.250> level<00:01:02.370> 32

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
level 50 and we actually got to level 32

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060 
level 50 and we actually got to level 32
just<00:01:03.210> by<00:01:03.329> people<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.010> were

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
just by people you know that were

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.179 
just by people you know that were
founders<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.580> stuff<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> yeah<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.070> were

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
founders and stuff and so yeah we were

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.570 
founders and stuff and so yeah we were
one<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> first<00:01:08.909> clans<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.540> hit<00:01:09.869> level<00:01:10.049> 50

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
one of the first clans to hit level 50

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.740 
one of the first clans to hit level 50
so<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> brought<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> lot<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
so you know that brought a lot of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.109 
so you know that brought a lot of
attention<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:14.159> were<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.670> second

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
attention in we were actually the second

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
attention in we were actually the second
most<00:01:15.299> sore<00:01:15.689> i<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:16.049> actually<00:01:16.200> third<00:01:16.740> most

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
most sore i think actually third most

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.410 
most sore i think actually third most
applied<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:19.340> 9,500

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
applied for with about 9,500

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.340 
applied for with about 9,500
applications<00:01:21.420> by<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> end<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.049> modern

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
applications by the end of modern

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.609 
applications by the end of modern
warfare<00:01:22.500> 3<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.850> including<00:01:24.619> um

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
warfare 3 and that's not including um

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
warfare 3 and that's not including um
you<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.220> ones<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.759> deleted<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.360> we

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you know the ones that we deleted so we

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690 
you know the ones that we deleted so we
probably<00:01:27.720> had<00:01:27.990> about<00:01:28.140> 16,000<00:01:29.130> applications

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
probably had about 16,000 applications

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.319 
probably had about 16,000 applications
over<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.329> modern<00:01:30.659> warfare<00:01:30.780> 3<00:01:31.369> period<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
over the modern warfare 3 period and you

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.149 
over the modern warfare 3 period and you
know<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.659> were<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:33.960> competitive<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.860> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
know we were really competitive and it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
know we were really competitive and it
started<00:01:35.460> off<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.060> playing<00:01:36.540> clan<00:01:36.780> ops

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
started off like just playing clan ops

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.469 
started off like just playing clan ops
casually<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.640> started<00:01:38.700> competing<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
casually and then we started competing a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.719 
casually and then we started competing a
little<00:01:39.659> more<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.770> got<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
little more and you know got up in the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.300 
little more and you know got up in the
ranks<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.840> lethal<00:01:43.439> energy<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> lethal

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
ranks with lethal energy and lethal

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.270 
ranks with lethal energy and lethal
gaming<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.439> well<00:01:46.439> actually<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:46.890> called

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
gaming and well actually was called

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.929 
gaming and well actually was called
lethal<00:01:47.970> energy<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.899> called<00:01:49.200> EMS<00:01:49.530> or<00:01:49.829> e<00:01:50.130> equals

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
lethal energy was called EMS or e equals

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.359 
lethal energy was called EMS or e equals
MC<00:01:51.000> squared<00:01:51.229> originally<00:01:52.229> um<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.340> know

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
MC squared originally um but you know

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.429 
MC squared originally um but you know
they<00:01:53.670> transport<00:01:54.240> him<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.689> lethal<00:01:55.020> energy

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
they transport him into lethal energy

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.069 
they transport him into lethal energy
and<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:55.829> they<00:01:55.979> combined<00:01:56.430> as<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:57.390> later

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and actually they combined as one later

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.060 
and actually they combined as one later
on<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.430> eventually<00:01:59.640> did<00:02:00.060> break<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.920> later<00:02:01.920> on

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
on and eventually did break up later on

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.280 
on and eventually did break up later on
but<00:02:02.250> anyways<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:03.240> competed<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.840> them<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
but anyways we competed with them and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.200 
but anyways we competed with them and
