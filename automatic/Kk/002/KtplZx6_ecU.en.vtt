which is a very nice steel not totally
state-of-the-art<00:00:27.029> anymore<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.170> still<00:00:28.890> very

studs<00:00:35.300> ambidextrous<00:00:36.300> thumb<00:00:36.329> studs<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> it's

studs ambidextrous thumb studs so it's

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.080 
studs ambidextrous thumb studs so it's
for<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> knife<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.770> opens<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.489> quickly<00:00:44.090> I've

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
for the knife it opens very quickly I've

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.590 
for the knife it opens very quickly I've
heard<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.309> blackened<00:00:47.309> version<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.570> be

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
heard that the blackened version can be

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.100 
heard that the blackened version can be
a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.230> harder<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.620> open<00:00:50.690> because<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
a little bit harder to open because the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.680 
a little bit harder to open because the
black<00:00:52.469> coating<00:00:52.980> kind<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.670> gets<00:00:54.539> into<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
black coating kind of gets into the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.709 
black coating kind of gets into the
bushings<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.840> stuff<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> makes<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:59.719> go

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
bushings and stuff and makes it not go

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.299 
bushings and stuff and makes it not go
as<00:01:00.870> smoothly<00:01:01.219> but<00:01:02.359> apparently<00:01:03.359> after<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
as smoothly but apparently after a

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.039 
as smoothly but apparently after a
little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.299> open<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.780> up

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
little bit of use you can open that up

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.460 
little bit of use you can open that up
and<00:01:07.560> clean<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.540> will<00:01:09.659> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and clean it out and then it will be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.219 
and clean it out and then it will be
just<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.830> quick<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.150> non-black<00:01:13.049> in

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
just as quick as the non-black in

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.800 
just as quick as the non-black in
version<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:18.390> works

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
version like I have here so it works

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.910 
version like I have here so it works
really<00:01:18.990> well

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
really well

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.030 
really well
a<00:01:20.030> beautiful<00:01:21.030> handle<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:22.650> made<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
a beautiful handle it's made with this

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.399 
a beautiful handle it's made with this
Laird<00:01:23.630> g10<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.170> as<00:01:28.280> they<00:01:29.280> mill<00:01:30.110> away<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
Laird g10 so as they mill away the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.200 
Laird g10 so as they mill away the
handle<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.310> these<00:01:32.430> nice<00:01:34.549> stripes<00:01:35.549> down

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
handle you get these nice stripes down

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.520 
handle you get these nice stripes down
the<00:01:36.869> ridges<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> almost<00:01:38.400> looks<00:01:38.729> like

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
the ridges and then it almost looks like

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.789 
the ridges and then it almost looks like
like<00:01:40.530> wood<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:42.079> surface<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:45.799> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
pocket clip is for tip up carry only but

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.230 
pocket clip is for tip up carry only but
it<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.439> switched<00:01:52.710> from<00:01:53.070> left<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:53.880> or

steel bar that goes across is held up to
the<00:02:14.680> top<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.280> spring<00:02:16.320> called<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.440> Omega

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.290 
the top with a spring called the Omega
spring<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.230> what<00:02:20.350> happens<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:20.920> as<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.460> swings

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300

spring so what happens is as this swings
open<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.250> back<00:02:24.490> end<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.270> blade

open the the back end of the blade

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.030 
open the the back end of the blade
pushes<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.710> spring<00:02:27.070> out<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.570> there's<00:02:28.570> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
pushes that spring out and there's a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.880 
pushes that spring out and there's a
flat<00:02:30.040> section<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.910> top<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.680> as<00:02:32.680> that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
flat section on the top there so as that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.760 
flat section on the top there so as that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
flat section moves get this focused

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.300 
flat section moves get this focused
there's<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.610> flat<00:02:39.820> section<00:02:40.090> moves<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:41.310> clears

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
there's a flat section moves and clears

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.540 
there's a flat section moves and clears
the<00:02:42.640> bottom<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> bar<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.950> bar<00:02:44.980> slides

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
the bottom of the bar the bar slides

the bottom of the bar the bar slides
I've<00:02:45.760> been<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:47.970> creates<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.060> really

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
I've been to that and creates a really

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.440 
I've been to that and creates a really
really<00:02:50.020> strong<00:02:52.110> lock<00:02:53.110> up<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.670> if<00:02:54.880> there's<00:02:55.060> no

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
really strong lock up so if there's no

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.620 
really strong lock up so if there's no
blade<00:02:55.840> play<00:02:55.870> left<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.620> right<00:02:56.740> or<00:02:56.860> up<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.100> down

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
blade play left to right or up and down

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.330 
blade play left to right or up and down
as<00:02:58.630> you'd<00:02:58.840> expect<00:02:59.230> from<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.500> bench<00:02:59.740> made<00:02:59.950> it's

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
as you'd expect from a bench made it's

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.260 
as you'd expect from a bench made it's
very<00:03:00.400> nice<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:03.280> yeah<00:03:03.400> overall<00:03:03.640> it's<00:03:04.030> just<00:03:04.090> a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
very nice so yeah overall it's just a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.230 
very nice so yeah overall it's just a
great<00:03:04.300> knife<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.410> little<00:03:05.950> bit<00:03:06.070> heavy<00:03:06.310> you

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
great knife it is a little bit heavy you

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.550 
great knife it is a little bit heavy you
can<00:03:07.360> see<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.690> they<00:03:07.810> don't<00:03:07.990> metal<00:03:08.380> out<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
can see that they don't metal out of the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.610 
can see that they don't metal out of the
liners<00:03:09.040> at<00:03:09.220> all

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
liners at all

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.199 
liners at all
so<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.980> think<00:03:12.520> it<00:03:12.730> weighs<00:03:13.380> almost<00:03:14.380> 5<00:03:15.040> ounces<00:03:15.489> 4.8

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
so I think it weighs almost 5 ounces 4.8

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.340 
so I think it weighs almost 5 ounces 4.8
ounce<00:03:16.540> as<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.870> think<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.720> overall<00:03:19.959> it's<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.290> a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
ounce as I think but overall it's just a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.290 
ounce as I think but overall it's just a
really<00:03:20.530> great<00:03:20.680> knife<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:25.030> size<00:03:25.239> comparison

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.350 

that's<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.570> rift<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.739> this<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.400> bench

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
that's the rift and this is the bench

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.600 
that's the rift and this is the bench
made<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.690> X<00:03:33.180> awesome<00:03:34.180> open<00:03:34.510> right<00:03:34.900> there<00:03:35.610> so

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
made of X awesome open right there so

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.840 
made of X awesome open right there so
the<00:03:37.180> VEX

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:49.130 

is<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.420> red<00:03:40.870> clasp-knife<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:42.820> can<00:03:42.970> see<00:03:47.130> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
is a red clasp-knife you can see the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:59.730 
is a red clasp-knife you can see the
rift<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.740> little<00:03:51.370> bit<00:03:51.520> longer<00:03:52.980> and

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.870 

oh<00:03:59.770> the<00:04:00.670> same<00:04:00.880> with<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:03.010> blade<00:04:03.250> itself<00:04:03.610> is<00:04:03.820> a

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
oh the same with the blade itself is a

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.050 
oh the same with the blade itself is a
little<00:04:04.120> bit<00:04:04.240> thicker<00:04:04.480> which<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.050> nice<00:04:06.060> just

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
little bit thicker which is nice just

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.080 
little bit thicker which is nice just
feels<00:04:07.420> real<00:04:07.600> solid<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.320> really<00:04:08.560> like<00:04:08.740> the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
feels real solid and I really like the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.110 
feels real solid and I really like the
look<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.240> this<00:04:10.420> reverse<00:04:10.810> tanto<00:04:11.760> blade<00:04:12.760> shape

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
look of this reverse tanto blade shape

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.170 
look of this reverse tanto blade shape
it's<00:04:13.600> just<00:04:13.750> really<00:04:13.870> cool<00:04:14.730> all<00:04:15.730> right<00:04:15.760> so

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
it's just really cool all right so

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.010 
it's just really cool all right so
that's<00:04:16.300> the<00:04:16.480> benchmade<00:04:17.440> rift<00:04:18.480> if<00:04:19.480> it's<00:04:19.810> all

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
that's the benchmade rift if it's all

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.690 
that's the benchmade rift if it's all
that<00:04:20.380> you're<00:04:20.470> carrying<00:04:20.710> it's<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.220> really

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
that you're carrying it's a really

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.720 
that you're carrying it's a really
really<00:04:21.970> great<00:04:22.120> strong<00:04:23.820> multi-purpose<00:04:24.960> EDC

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
really great strong multi-purpose EDC

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.200 
really great strong multi-purpose EDC
tactical<00:04:28.020> blade<00:04:29.020> if<00:04:29.200> it<00:04:29.320> should<00:04:29.440> come<00:04:29.620> today

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
tactical blade if it should come today

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.140 
tactical blade if it should come today
there's<00:04:31.210> no<00:04:31.360> jimping<00:04:31.810> but<00:04:32.170> I<00:04:32.410> mean<00:04:33.150> this

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
there's no jimping but I mean this

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.450 
there's no jimping but I mean this
little<00:04:34.480> thing<00:04:34.780> on<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.930> back<00:04:35.260> here<00:04:35.620> really

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
little thing on the back here really

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.820 
little thing on the back here really
locks<00:04:36.700> your<00:04:36.940> pinkie<00:04:37.300> in<00:04:37.390> pretty<00:04:37.660> well<00:04:37.830> so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
locks your pinkie in pretty well so

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.500 
locks your pinkie in pretty well so
don't<00:04:39.730> think<00:04:39.910> you're<00:04:40.090> gonna<00:04:40.180> have<00:04:40.330> any

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
don't think you're gonna have any

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.440 
don't think you're gonna have any
problems<00:04:40.870> with<00:04:41.020> slipping<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:43.210> that's<00:04:43.390> the

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
problems with slipping so that's the

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.050 
problems with slipping so that's the
benchmade<00:04:43.810> rift
