00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
kills champion so the plan against aggro

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.360 
kills champion so the plan against aggro
is<00:02:40.500> you're<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.650> boarding<00:02:41.040> out<00:02:41.160> eight

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
is you're just boarding out eight

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.770 
is you're just boarding out eight
counterspells<00:02:41.970> you're<00:02:42.120> boarding<00:02:42.300> out<00:02:42.450> for

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
counterspells you're boarding out for

dissipate and the gate and three mana
leaks<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.630> eight<00:02:45.720> slots<00:02:45.959> at

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
leaks so I like to have eight slots at

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.390 
leaks so I like to have eight slots at
least<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.590> kind<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.830> would<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.130> find<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
least I kind of would like to find a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.820 
least I kind of would like to find a
ninth<00:02:47.640> slot<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.140> could<00:02:49.350> board<00:02:49.560> out<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
ninth slot so I could board out the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.710 
ninth slot so I could board out the
fourth<00:02:50.610> mana<00:02:50.850> leak<00:02:51.060> because<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.390> really<00:02:51.570> don't

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
fourth mana leak because I really don't

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.090 
fourth mana leak because I really don't
like<00:02:51.750> counters<00:02:52.080> against<00:02:52.320> aggro<00:02:52.530> especially

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
like counters against aggro especially

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.090 
like counters against aggro especially
on<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> draw<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:55.290> i'm<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.650> sure<00:02:55.709> what<00:02:55.860> else<00:02:56.010> i

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
on the draw but i'm not sure what else i

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.800 
on the draw but i'm not sure what else i
could<00:02:56.160> cut<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.550> um<00:02:57.140> against<00:02:58.140> wolf<00:02:58.920> run<00:02:59.810> we

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
could cut out um against wolf run we

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.040 
could cut out um against wolf run we
have<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.290> flash<00:03:01.470> freezes<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.010> def<00:03:02.160> mark<00:03:02.430> and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
have the flash freezes and def mark and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.420 
have the flash freezes and def mark and
not<00:03:04.050> sure<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.380> want<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.620> board<00:03:04.800> anything

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
not sure if we want to board anything

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.860 
not sure if we want to board anything
else<00:03:05.550> against<00:03:05.910> them<00:03:06.030> or<00:03:06.150> not<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.300> guess<00:03:06.480> if<00:03:06.660> you

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
else against them or not I guess if you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.059 
else against them or not I guess if you
were<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.080> make<00:03:07.230> an<00:03:07.350> argument<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.830> could<00:03:07.920> argue

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
were to make an argument you could argue

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.500 
were to make an argument you could argue
doom<00:03:08.430> blade<00:03:08.550> but<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.850> lot<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.000> our<00:03:09.180> main<00:03:09.330> deck

doom blade but a lot of our main deck
cards<00:03:09.690> are<00:03:09.840> pretty<00:03:09.989> good<00:03:10.140> against<00:03:10.380> them<00:03:10.560> so

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
cards are pretty good against them so

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.199 
cards are pretty good against them so
it's<00:03:10.830> hard<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.100> find<00:03:11.190> room<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.459> board<00:03:11.700> board<00:03:12.090> in

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
it's hard to find room to board board in

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.780 
it's hard to find room to board board in
these<00:03:12.600> cards<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:16.069> then<00:03:17.069> against<00:03:17.340> control<00:03:17.670> we

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
there's not really a whole lot to talk

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.039 
there's not really a whole lot to talk
about<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.269> deck<00:03:30.420> everything's<00:03:30.840> pretty

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
about this deck everything's pretty

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.250 
about this deck everything's pretty
straightforward<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:33.110> guess<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.230> other

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
straightforward on it I guess the other

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.930 
straightforward on it I guess the other
thing<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.590> some<00:03:34.829> people<00:03:35.100> don't<00:03:35.250> have<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.670> I

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
thing that some people don't have is I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.259 
thing that some people don't have is I
have<00:03:37.160> two<00:03:38.160> ghosts<00:03:38.370> quarter<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.790> drown<00:03:39.030> yard

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
have two ghosts quarter to drown yard

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.120 
have two ghosts quarter to drown yard
here<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:40.320> ghost<00:03:40.500> coders<00:03:40.799> aren't<00:03:41.040> here

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130
