00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
nearly every day I do this so let's

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.740 
nearly every day I do this so let's
start<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:44.879> looking<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
start with looking at some of the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.060 
start with looking at some of the
exercises<00:00:46.140> first<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.640> first<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.300> is

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
exercises first the first one we do is

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.569 
exercises first the first one we do is
basically<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> chewing<00:00:50.760> exercise<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
basically like a chewing exercise and

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
basically like a chewing exercise and
I'll<00:00:53.579> show<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.820> side<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.170> can

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
I'll show you side on so that you can

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.529 
I'll show you side on so that you can
seal<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.129> more<00:00:56.280> easily<00:00:56.539> but

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
seal a little bit more easily but

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
seal a little bit more easily but
essentially<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.680> tip<00:00:58.949> your<00:00:58.980> head<00:00:59.430> back<00:00:59.699> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
essentially you tip your head back and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.110 
essentially you tip your head back and
then<00:01:01.289> chew<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:01.980> back<00:01:02.250> teeth<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
then chew with your back teeth so it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.920 
then chew with your back teeth so it
looks<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:09.750> should

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
looks a little bit like this you should

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.830 
looks a little bit like this you should
feel<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.979> jaw<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.240> part<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> your

feel it in your jaw and a part of your
neck<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:16.070> little<00:01:17.070> proviso<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.970> will<00:01:18.210> look<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
neck a little proviso you will look a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.890 
neck a little proviso you will look a
little<00:01:19.470> silly<00:01:19.740> doing<00:01:20.580> these<00:01:20.820> exercises<00:01:21.509> as

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
do find that they work the next exercise

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.609 
do find that they work the next exercise
that<00:01:28.770> we're<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:30.229> basically<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that we're going to do is basically a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.469 
that we're going to do is basically a
straight<00:01:32.070> masked<00:01:32.400> smile<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:34.229> pull<00:01:34.590> from

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
straight masked smile and we pull from

around your mouth to do this you should

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.289 
around your mouth to do this you should

feel the pull round here the next one is
to<00:02:18.260> tone<00:02:18.650> under<00:02:19.310> your<00:02:19.459> chin<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:22.250> easiest

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
to tone under your chin and the easiest

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.479 
to tone under your chin and the easiest
way<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.849> think<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.870> imagine<00:02:24.080> a

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
way to think of it is to imagine a

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.410 
way to think of it is to imagine a
spring<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.780> extends<00:02:27.319> from<00:02:27.650> onion<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
spring that extends from onion to the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.509 
spring that extends from onion to the
top<00:02:29.599> of<00:02:29.750> your<00:02:29.930> neck<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.410> you're<00:02:30.829> basically

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
top of your neck and you're basically

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.729 
top of your neck and you're basically
compressing<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.599> releasing<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.349> spring

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
compressing and releasing the spring

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.400 
compressing and releasing the spring
