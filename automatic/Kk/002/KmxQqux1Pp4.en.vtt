00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.690
 I do not like 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.250
 another great kid 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.700
 my name is from the website I'm going to present to 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.900
 But a tutorial is like extending 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.210
 the life of the works dem including 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.649
 tv channel saying that when only fury there 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.610
 there is no way 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.110
 here he has a way yes then here I go 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.730
 be showing you how it is 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.070
 simple and inexpensive to visit the farm 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.250
 act only we get more time here 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.520
 much longer with the material 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.890
 I bought here the super mano a visible 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.320
 are devillÃ© of the brand cheaper than 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.330
 I found 2 reais 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 if you did not find it to buy super bonder 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.630
 also that is very good you have to r $ 5 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.850
 exceeds the step you must do 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.780
 if you can say that you already have a piece of 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.740
 solo cut I cut the sole of sneakers 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.079
 old man I had 10 rollerblades 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.140
 never throw old sneakers that go 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.770
 enjoy everything and here gives a few pieces 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.189
 January wants to cut into one 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 little bits 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.390
 I'll be sticking to the almost punctured nail 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.119
 where the fury can see here I've already tested 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.640
 I already wore this sneaker, I'm already wearing it. 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.680
 more than a year is the use here is worth it 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.420
 He does not spend behind 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.899
 I 'm just going to do a maintenance and paste it 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.890
 the little pieces of soil in the serious themes 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:58.890
 I'll wait now will catch 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 vans or the old one will cut 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.460
 Just like I left here, it's ready to go. 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.460

 we cut the steering wheel tinga does not have a seal 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:22.680
 that since there are two more pieces 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.050
 so next step is very simple too 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.970
 You'll get your teams needing it. 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.180
 For roller coasters it's getting cassol 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:37.080

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:39.360
 little bits of you already cut through 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.720
 the adhesive glue because it is 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.670
 very strong around a bit in the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.180
 kind of will not press the hamas 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.720

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:32.350
 ancient spreads a little bit around 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.350
 obvious to what you're talking about 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.980
 the vestibular to paste 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.680
 will never be so 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.740
 also 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:14.000
 a day where it 's starting to feel good 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:17.000

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 i 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.260

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:41.780
 I'll put them all here, never jaime 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:44.530
 has made several more rumors 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.530
 is very little 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:55.259
 Let me know what I've already done. 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.740
 I verified to check whether the chaos both 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:01.050
 can be reinforcing by passing a 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:07.729
 bit around each operation 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.729
 just to guarantee even just to reinforce 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.669
 the bochum 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.790
 head 5 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.650
 tennis sole life logan 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.720
 and yet you can arrange to see what 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.540
 this is just not the original of the other 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.410
 You can send it to a legal shoe store. 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.870
 send with latex bed under which Amazon 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.290
 will charge you 50 pila also comes out a lot 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:55.000
 cheaper than buying a new 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.000
 Big hug for you is awesome.
