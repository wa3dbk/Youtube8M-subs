00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 paranormal reality 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.240
 what mysteries await us in the 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.330
 depths of the ocean where the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.810
 Sun rays have never come the world 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.599
 of darkness where there is still bubbling 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.180
 life where there are beings that we have never 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.390
 seen but from time to time they come out to 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.279
 the surface and when viewed have been 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.279
 become legends 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.329
 sea ​​monsters volume 3 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.520
 in tropical and subtropical seas 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.070
 a creature has been repeatedly seen 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.590
 marine that is especially distinguished 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:02.050
 by its multiple lateral fins and by 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.629
 have an armored or segmented body 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.240
 creatures like these are part of the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:12.280
 Malaysian folklore where it is known 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.740
 as top andrano or lord of evils and 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.950
 of vietnam where it is given the name of 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.950
 king 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.900
 the most well-known observation of these 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.370
 creatures was at the beginning of the century 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.040
 in front of chongqing 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.400
 a French protectorate at that time 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.290
 that had belonged to china the 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.930
 crew of several warships 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.070
 French people observed a large number of 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.020
 marine beasts with reptilian traits 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.590
 what made them more deserving of the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.049
 nickname of marine snakes 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.960
 creatures between 15 and 20 meters of 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.109
 length that by the descriptions 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.479
 they resembled crocodiles with fins maybe 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.079
 what those mariners observed was 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.100
 a group of gigantic mosasaurs 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.560
 marine lizards that possibly 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.229
 they survived the extinction of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.920
 dinosaurs and found in the warm 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.640
 waters of the equator the right habitat 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.640
 to perpetuate 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.840
 another the most unknown similar and of the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.560
 that is only known through 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.290
 of the stories of the sailors is the fish 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.060
 Centipede is told that sometimes 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.310
 appeared rising over the sea 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.019
 showing a kind of hair 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.019
 coming out of his face 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.500
 By way of antennas 100 feet 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.510
 land with a lobster tail already 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.090
 throughout his body a series of 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.090
 appendages used as oars 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.340
 perhaps what those ancient sailors 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.930
 described as centipede fish was a 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.629
 incredible like vile wolf of the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.150
 depths that in sight seems to be 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.870
 exactly like a land centipede 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.989
 but it is not and it is so big that they have 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.690
 found specimens over 4 meters 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.540
 in length 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.540
 of these animals very little is known 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:24.670
 barcap owling January 8, 1887 cape 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.670
 Roque Northeast Brazil 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.580
 it was good weather and clear the wind and the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.980
 sea were moderate in the water 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.320
 there were black spots and a 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.610
 whitish column that rose to 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.900
 about 35 meters high suddenly that 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.750
 pillar fell raising a big splash 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.320
 suddenly another similar one was lifted 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.050
 they rose and fell alternately 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.930
 approaching we saw that it was a 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.930
 sea monster a giant snake 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.659
 he kept curling himself still chacalote 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.060
 he writhed and squeezed the whale with 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.010
 great strength sank in every two 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.800
 minutes and then they excelled 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.700
 in a constant struggle 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.220
 there were two more whales 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.700
 they made the sea look like water 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.700
 boiling 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.930
 the strange event lasted approximately 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.449
 15 minutes until the creatures do not 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.150
 they came out again I felt a great 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:38.340
 chill go through my body 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.340
 I would write georg robot 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.960

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.689
 controversial and mysterious of the 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.529
 history of cryptozoology 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:57.209
 the photograph was taken by the Frenchman 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:05:00.849
