more battle hymns so that was like at
what<00:00:28.410> I'm<00:00:28.530> thinking<00:00:28.950> about<00:00:29.040> and<00:00:29.460> maybe<00:00:29.610> if<00:00:29.790> you

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
what I'm thinking about and maybe if you

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.299 
what I'm thinking about and maybe if you
guys<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.210> tinker<00:00:30.510> around<00:00:30.540> with<00:00:30.780> this<00:00:30.990> list<00:00:32.809> if

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
guys can tinker around with this list if

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.779 
guys can tinker around with this list if
we<00:00:35.309> go<00:00:35.520> empty<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> warrens<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:40.370> more<00:00:41.370> battle

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
we go empty the warrens and more battle

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.880 
we go empty the warrens and more battle
hymns<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.839> don't<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> new<00:00:43.559> Vegas

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
hymns so I don't like the new Vegas

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.430 
hymns so I don't like the new Vegas
elemental<00:00:44.429> it's<00:00:45.329> kind<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.719> weird<00:00:45.960> maybe<00:00:46.230> we'll

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
elemental it's kind of weird maybe we'll

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.989 
elemental it's kind of weird maybe we'll
keep<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> gunshots<00:00:47.550> were<00:00:47.699> okay

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
keep some of them the gunshots were okay

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:49.970 
keep some of them the gunshots were okay
though<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:49.019> some<00:00:49.319> sort<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> empty<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
though but some sort of empty the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.660 
though but some sort of empty the
warrens<00:00:50.159> could<00:00:50.519> go<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.170> as<00:00:52.170> well<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.249> more

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
warrens could go in and as well as more

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
warrens could go in and as well as more
battle<00:00:54.149> hymns<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.749> that<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.499> give<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:55.859> of

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
battle hymns and that can give more of

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.799 
battle hymns and that can give more of
this<00:00:56.039> token<00:00:56.399> strategy<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.179> the<00:00:57.210> hazer<00:00:57.479> age

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
this token strategy with the hazer age

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.649 
this token strategy with the hazer age
and<00:00:58.170> he's<00:00:58.679> a<00:00:58.710> rage<00:00:58.979> battle<00:00:59.640> him<00:00:59.819> babbling<00:01:00.479> just

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
and he's a rage battle him babbling just

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.360 
and he's a rage battle him babbling just
seems<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.050> good<00:01:01.319> card<00:01:01.589> there's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
seems like a really good card there's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.680 
seems like a really good card there's
not<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.519> lot<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> ways<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.909> get<00:01:03.269> card<00:01:03.510> advantage

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
not a lot of ways we get card advantage

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.160 
not a lot of ways we get card advantage
without<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.840> passing<00:01:06.840> flames

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
powerful with empty the warrens and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.950 
powerful with empty the warrens and
passing<00:01:14.399> lanes<00:01:14.579> I've<00:01:14.759> done<00:01:14.969> a<00:01:15.000> storm<00:01:15.780> back

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
passing lanes I've done a storm back

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380 
passing lanes I've done a storm back
with<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> past<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:18.030> quite

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
with it in the past but it can be quite

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.910 
with it in the past but it can be quite
like<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.079> have<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> use<00:01:19.350> cards<00:01:19.649> like<00:01:19.740> then

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
like you have to use cards like then

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.490 
like you have to use cards like then
dragon<00:01:20.399> fodder<00:01:20.750> dragon<00:01:21.750> fodder<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.170> really

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
dragon fodder dragon fodder is really

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.350 
dragon fodder dragon fodder is really
good<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.799> young<00:01:23.189> pyromancer<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.149> is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
good with young pyromancer and so is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.719 
good with young pyromancer and so is
dragon<00:01:25.049> fodder<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:25.860> crank<00:01:26.189> owes<00:01:26.340> command

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
dragon fodder and and crank owes command

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.300 
dragon fodder and and crank owes command
so<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.990> definitely<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.500> worth

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so that would definitely be worth

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.920 
so that would definitely be worth
looking<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:29.759> though<00:01:30.149> young<00:01:30.630> pyromancer

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
looking into though young pyromancer

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.160 
looking into though young pyromancer
Akron<00:01:31.649> Crusader<00:01:32.390> about<00:01:33.390> uh<00:01:33.799> battle<00:01:34.799> hymns

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
Akron Crusader about uh battle hymns

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.300 
Akron Crusader about uh battle hymns
Crusader<00:01:37.170> though<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.530> rough<00:01:37.770> at<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.070> point

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
Crusader though be rough at that point

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.620 
Crusader though be rough at that point
cuz<00:01:38.460> mutagenic<00:01:38.939> growth<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
cuz mutagenic growth would have to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.569 
cuz mutagenic growth would have to
target<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.109> and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:41.039> you<00:01:41.280> wouldn't<00:01:41.520> have

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
target it and then you wouldn't have

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.999 
target it and then you wouldn't have
much<00:01:41.909> else<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.359> target<00:01:42.840> besides<00:01:43.140> music<00:01:43.289> growth

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
much else to target besides music growth

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.670 
much else to target besides music growth
and<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.359> maybe<00:01:45.719> I<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.350> probably

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and so maybe I would just you probably

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
and so maybe I would just you probably

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
flames but you can net up a lot of mana

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.710 
flames but you can net up a lot of mana
with<00:04:07.769> reports<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.489> soul<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.880> akron<00:04:09.180> crusaders

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
with reports the soul in akron crusaders

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.620 
with reports the soul in akron crusaders
and<00:04:10.100> crowds<00:04:11.100> favors<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:12.709> there<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:14.630> then

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
and crowds favors so there is and then

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.120 
and crowds favors so there is and then
if<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.780> go<00:04:15.900> into<00:04:16.019> white<00:04:16.320> i<00:04:16.590> guess<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:17.040> have

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
if you go into white i guess we have

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.930 
if you go into white i guess we have
monastery<00:04:18.440> mentors<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:20.400> mentors<00:04:20.790> can

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
monastery mentors and the mentors can

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.880 
monastery mentors and the mentors can
also<00:04:21.090> gain<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.450> bunch<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.750> tokens<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.680> cool

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
also gain a bunch of tokens and the cool

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.180 
also gain a bunch of tokens and the cool
thing<00:04:22.919> about<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.370> monastery<00:04:23.820> mentors<00:04:24.330> is

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
thing about the monastery mentors is

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.610 
thing about the monastery mentors is
they<00:04:26.190> actually<00:04:26.669> have<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:27.180> pro<00:04:27.660> s<00:04:27.870> themselves

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
they actually have a pro s themselves

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.060 
they actually have a pro s themselves
and

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.770 

that<00:04:34.070> just<00:04:34.250> means<00:04:34.370> each<00:04:34.610> Creech<00:04:34.880> each<00:04:35.450> thing

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
that just means each Creech each thing

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.090 
that just means each Creech each thing
you<00:04:35.870> cast<00:04:36.170> or<00:04:36.350> get<00:04:36.500> bigger<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:36.890> bigger<00:04:36.920> and

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
you cast or get bigger and bigger and

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.900 
you cast or get bigger and bigger and
bigger<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:38.000> even<00:04:38.240> just<00:04:38.270> off<00:04:38.600> of<00:04:38.780> another<00:04:39.910> burst

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
bigger so even just off of another burst

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.730 
bigger so even just off of another burst
of<00:04:41.120> speed<00:04:41.270> they're<00:04:42.080> going<00:04:42.230> to<00:04:42.320> be<00:04:42.940> tutus<00:04:43.940> and

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
of speed they're going to be tutus and

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.870 
of speed they're going to be tutus and
possibly<00:04:45.740> get<00:04:45.950> like<00:04:46.130> crowds<00:04:46.400> favor<00:04:46.640> works

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
possibly get like crowds favor works

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.700 
possibly get like crowds favor works
just<00:04:47.000> better<00:04:47.240> than<00:04:47.360> crusader<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.680> a

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
just better than crusader so that is a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.840 
just better than crusader so that is a
route<00:04:49.190> we<00:04:49.370> cut<00:04:49.520> out<00:04:49.640> we<00:04:49.880> could<00:04:50.000> also<00:04:50.210> go<00:04:50.690> so

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
route we cut out we could also go so

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.660 
route we cut out we could also go so
very<00:04:52.850> very<00:04:52.940> fun<00:04:53.560> we'll<00:04:54.560> have<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.950> we'll<00:04:55.580> have

would<00:06:17.360> be<00:06:17.530> probably<00:06:18.530> too<00:06:18.830> hard<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.220> mean<00:06:19.370> that's

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
would be probably too hard I mean that's

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.220 
would be probably too hard I mean that's
what<00:06:19.700> with<00:06:19.910> mentored<00:06:20.360> be<00:06:20.540> a<00:06:20.570> lot<00:06:20.750> easier<00:06:20.780> to

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
get out and at that point I think that
