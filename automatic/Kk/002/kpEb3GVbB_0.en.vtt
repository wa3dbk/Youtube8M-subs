Susana<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:33.000> loved<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> trust<00:00:33.660> technique

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
Susana really loved the trust technique

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.160 
Susana really loved the trust technique
so<00:00:34.590> she's<00:00:34.800> come<00:00:35.070> over<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.550> us<00:00:35.670> straight<00:00:35.880> away

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
so she's come over to us straight away

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.049

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
but as you can see Sampson is still

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.959 
but as you can see Sampson is still
being<00:00:39.270> very<00:00:39.500> protective<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> he<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:41.820> be

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
being very protective and he would be

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.619 
being very protective and he would be
much<00:00:42.390> happier<00:00:42.860> if<00:00:43.860> they<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.550> both<00:00:44.969> walked

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
much happier if they just both walked

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
much happier if they just both walked
past<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> humans<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.980> didn't<00:00:47.370> pay<00:00:47.550> them<00:00:47.730> any

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
past the humans and didn't pay them any

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.500 
past the humans and didn't pay them any
attention

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.880 

unfortunately<00:00:51.510> Susanna's<00:00:52.079> not<00:00:52.289> having<00:00:52.649> any

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
unfortunately Susanna's not having any

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.700 
unfortunately Susanna's not having any
of<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> we've<00:00:54.570> been<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> really

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
of that so we've been put in a really

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.220 
of that so we've been put in a really
good<00:00:56.100> position<00:00:56.539> where<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.930> work<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.500> him

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
good position where we can work with him

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.860 
good position where we can work with him
the<00:01:01.230> trust<00:01:01.559> technique<00:01:02.210> reduces<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.510> thoughts

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the trust technique reduces the thoughts

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
the trust technique reduces the thoughts
of<00:01:04.229> animals<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> brings<00:01:05.250> him<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
peaceful state so yes that's eliminating

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.060 
peaceful state so yes that's eliminating
aggression<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:09.840> fear<00:01:11.299> we<00:01:12.299> require<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.860> we

closely<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:25.530> will<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.189> his<00:01:26.400> eyes<00:01:26.640> will

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
closely you will see that his eyes will

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.420 
closely you will see that his eyes will
start<00:01:27.180> getting<00:01:27.420> heavy<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.740> influence<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
start getting heavy as the influence of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.999 
start getting heavy as the influence of
the<00:01:29.579> trust<00:01:29.880> technique<00:01:30.329> affects<00:01:30.750> him<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.200> then

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the trust technique affects him and then

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.100 
the trust technique affects him and then
he'll<00:01:32.250> bring<00:01:32.579> his<00:01:32.850> attention<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.840> and

he'll bring his attention back up and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
he'll bring his attention back up and
then<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:34.860> again<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.270> repeats

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
then back down again and this repeats

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.710 
then back down again and this repeats
itself<00:01:37.290> until<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.520> bring<00:01:38.790> any<00:01:39.090> animal
