00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.540
 a professional but very simple game 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 that will make you pass as expert wizards or 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.570
 card wizards as they say in deck jargon 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 of cards the viewer is asked to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.300
 split the deck about half and each half 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.300
 to divide it in turn in half 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 in this way then the viewer 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.170
 cutting at random he cut to four 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.410
 this is this card 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:41.270
 we see that cards are an ace an ace 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:46.280
 fat is an ace then the viewer 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.280
 cuts to 4 ass 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.040
 very simple four axes of 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.350
 hidden at the top of the deck 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.410
 all here we ask the viewer to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.060
 divide the meta deck and any goal of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.100
 split the half and we keep an eye on it 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.760
 the bundle he has on the boards in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 this case we take the bunch 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 and move the first card forward e 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.790
 towards the fingers and we hold it from the corner 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.390
 we take the first card of another 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.190
 bunch and we put it under the first one 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.040
 that we have moved 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:34.110
 meanwhile we form a small fan the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.540
 third and fourth hour apparently 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.340
 teams love all the cards on the deck but 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.770
 actually we keep them separate from 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.250
 others with a separation held with 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.190
 pinkie 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.970
 I'll show you teams I love all the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.060
 cards but in reality the little finger holds 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.700
 these cards separate from the others 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.399
 immediately we turn the first 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.649
 let's get back on the deck apparently 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.380
 we put it on a bunch but in reality 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.780
 we take all the cards above the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.310
 separation 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.840
 in this way 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.840
 we support and immediately 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.120
 we spread the papers towards us this 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:19.770
 to give the sense of singularity to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.410
 card after which we turn the first card 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.680
 of the screed we have in hand doing 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.319
 the same movements as before 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.760
 we support we stretch towards us like this 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:36.080
 the third and finally we turn over 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.050
 the fourth and the bunch support it 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.959
 we extend towards us 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.950
 Now 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.700
 if you notice the exhibition I am 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.640
 party 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:55.340
 mixing the cards in this way in 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.370
 actually I performed a false mix 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.580
 which allowed me to keep on top 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.640
 the first cards then to hold over the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.799
 4 aces if you don't know how to do this 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:13.269
 mixture just enough to click here 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.269
 thank you very much and to the next magic
