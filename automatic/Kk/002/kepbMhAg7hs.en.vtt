during the meeting here that there seem

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.680 
during the meeting here that there seem
to<00:02:13.349> be<00:02:13.470> quite<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.950> few<00:02:14.250> nurses<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.569> are

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
to be quite a few nurses that really are

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.600 
to be quite a few nurses that really are
not<00:02:16.160> familiar<00:02:17.450> with<00:02:18.650> ccsvi<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.010> being<00:02:20.310> I

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
not familiar with ccsvi and being I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.660 
not familiar with ccsvi and being I
guess<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.510> figured<00:02:22.160> actually<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:23.550> that

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
guess I figured actually I think that

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.020 
guess I figured actually I think that
every

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
every

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.000 
every
should<00:02:24.300> know<00:02:24.450> about<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.930> maybe<00:02:25.770> that's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
should know about it maybe that's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.350 
should know about it maybe that's
because<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.550> kind<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.880> day-to-day<00:02:27.240> thing

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
because it's kind of a day-to-day thing

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.570 
because it's kind of a day-to-day thing
for<00:02:27.630> me<00:02:28.020> but<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.470> true<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:29.370> there's

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
for me but is that true that there's

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.300 
for me but is that true that there's
here<00:02:30.390> do<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.840> feel<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.290> you're<00:02:31.800> absolutely

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
here do you feel that you're absolutely

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.160 
here do you feel that you're absolutely
correct<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.270> that's<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> reasons

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
correct and that's one of the reasons

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.309 
correct and that's one of the reasons
why<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:34.830> wanted<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.190> be<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.790> at<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.870> meeting

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
quite well as time goes on you know

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.190 
quite well as time goes on you know
patients<00:04:56.190> may<00:04:56.340> have<00:04:56.580> possibly<00:04:57.270> exacerbation

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
patients may have possibly exacerbation

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.130 
patients may have possibly exacerbation
you<00:04:58.620> know<00:04:58.740> other<00:04:59.580> symptoms<00:05:00.150> from<00:05:00.360> emma's<00:05:00.780> and

you know other symptoms from emma's and

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.230 
you know other symptoms from emma's and
certainly<00:05:01.890> this<00:05:02.130> is<00:05:02.340> not<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.940> cure<00:05:03.740> it's<00:05:05.240> you

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
certainly this is not a cure it's you

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.850 
certainly this is not a cure it's you
know<00:05:06.390> working<00:05:07.280> with<00:05:08.280> patients<00:05:09.180> and<00:05:09.860> it's

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
know working with patients and it's

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.760 
know working with patients and it's
again<00:05:11.730> not<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:11.940> cure<00:05:12.240> but<00:05:12.270> just<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.500> help<00:05:13.590> with

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
again not a cure but just to help with

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.240 
again not a cure but just to help with
the<00:05:13.910> systemic<00:05:14.910> relief<00:05:15.210> exactly<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.250> and

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
the systemic relief exactly and and

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.550 
the systemic relief exactly and and
actually<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:18.840> know<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:18.990> were<00:05:19.170> talking<00:05:19.500> about

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
actually you know you were talking about

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.610 
actually you know you were talking about
their<00:05:20.010> relapsing<00:05:20.850> remitting<00:05:20.930> our<00:05:21.930> patients

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
their relapsing remitting our patients

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.170 
their relapsing remitting our patients
and<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.830> think<00:05:23.040> it's<00:05:23.190> important<00:05:23.850> for<00:05:23.970> everybody

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
and I think it's important for everybody

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.780 
and I think it's important for everybody
for<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.170> nurses<00:05:25.380> here<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.310> start<00:05:26.670> to

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
for the nurses here to start to

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.510 
for the nurses here to start to
understand<00:05:27.270> too<00:05:27.510> that<00:05:27.710> because<00:05:28.710> that<00:05:28.920> phase

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
understand too that because that phase

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.170 
understand too that because that phase
of<00:05:30.030> MS<00:05:30.720> but<00:05:31.350> somebody<00:05:31.650> could<00:05:31.830> have<00:05:32.180> an

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
of MS but somebody could have an

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.560 
of MS but somebody could have an
exacerbation<00:05:33.810> crew<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:35.240> then<00:05:36.240> it<00:05:36.390> goes<00:05:36.540> away

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
exacerbation crew and then it goes away

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.630 
exacerbation crew and then it goes away
and<00:05:37.020> they<00:05:37.140> may<00:05:37.290> not<00:05:37.470> have<00:05:37.710> another<00:05:38.010> one<00:05:38.250> but

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
and they may not have another one but

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.420 
and they may not have another one but
what<00:05:39.330> you're<00:05:39.510> treating<00:05:39.960> here<00:05:40.140> with<00:05:40.290> CCSVI<00:05:40.920> is

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
what you're treating here with CCSVI is

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.210 
what you're treating here with CCSVI is
really<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.300> autonomic<00:05:42.860> symptoms<00:05:43.860> and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
really the autonomic symptoms and

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.240 
really the autonomic symptoms and
there's<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:46.200> know<00:05:46.350> like<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.830> were<00:05:46.920> talking

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
to bladder control that karate um heat

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.580 
to bladder control that karate um heat
sensitivity<00:05:50.580> and<00:05:50.970> there's<00:05:51.930> no<00:05:52.140> drug<00:05:52.440> out

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
sensitivity and there's no drug out

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.740 
sensitivity and there's no drug out
there<00:05:52.800> right<00:05:52.980> now<00:05:53.010> that<00:05:53.580> i<00:05:53.820> think<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.630> is

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750
