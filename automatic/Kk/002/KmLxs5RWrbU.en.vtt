00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
other I'm just doing them all at once

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.980 
other I'm just doing them all at once
now<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> other<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.659> glue

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
now with the other two I'm gonna glue

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690

them together and pop out the pieces

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.359 
them together and pop out the pieces
also<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.509> could<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.350> put<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.710> four<00:01:17.159> together

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
also I could have put all four together

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.950 
also I could have put all four together
but<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.759> thought<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.150> might<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> tricky

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
but I thought it might be kind of tricky

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
but I thought it might be kind of tricky
to<00:01:19.200> push<00:01:19.560> through<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:19.890> four<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.610> with

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to push through all four of them with

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520 
to push through all four of them with
those<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.180> holes<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.990> might<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.380> worked

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
those little holes it might have worked

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
those little holes it might have worked
but<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.009> wouldn't<00:01:23.280> want<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.759> sure<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.240> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
but I wouldn't want it to be sure so I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.780 
but I wouldn't want it to be sure so I
just<00:01:24.540> did<00:01:24.780> -<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.860> -<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:26.640> gonna

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
just did - and then - and then I'm gonna

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.429 
just did - and then - and then I'm gonna
go<00:01:26.970> ahead<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.240> glue<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.900> four<00:01:28.229> together

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
go ahead and glue at the four together

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.609 
go ahead and glue at the four together
so<00:01:28.829> basically<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.640> went<00:01:30.299> from<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.810> thin<00:01:31.140> die<00:01:31.320> cut

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
so basically I went from a thin die cut

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.440 
so basically I went from a thin die cut
and<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.100> built<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and I built it up so that it's like a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.390 
and I built it up so that it's like a
thick<00:01:33.869> embellishment<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.040> four

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
thick embellishment because it's four

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.550 
thick embellishment because it's four
pieces<00:01:35.700> thick<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:37.110> makes<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
pieces thick it really makes a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.380 
pieces thick it really makes a
difference<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.729> turning<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.210> die

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
difference in kind of turning your die

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
difference in kind of turning your die
cut<00:01:39.659> into<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> peak<00:01:40.200> from<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.500> piece<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> paper

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
cut into a peak from a piece of paper

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.240 
cut into a peak from a piece of paper
into<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.700> standalone<00:01:42.540> embellishment<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:44.040> for

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
into a standalone embellishment now for

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.310 
into a standalone embellishment now for
my<00:01:44.369> design<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.909> decided<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.509> cut<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.899> guy<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
my design I decided to cut this guy in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200 
my design I decided to cut this guy in
half<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.399> using<00:01:47.640> some<00:01:48.060> good

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
half so I'm just using some good

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.149 
half so I'm just using some good
scissors<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.960> cut<00:01:49.200> straight<00:01:49.649> across<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
scissors just to cut straight across the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.800 
scissors just to cut straight across the
center<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.880> really<00:01:51.210> doesn't<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> be

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
center it really doesn't have to be

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.719 
center it really doesn't have to be
perfect<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.530> we're<00:01:52.710> gonna<00:01:52.799> add<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.520> this

here I have my gold I don't use my

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.880 
here I have my gold I don't use my
as<00:02:13.780> much<00:02:13.930> that's<00:02:14.140> why<00:02:14.320> it's<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.530> its<00:02:14.680> original

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
as much that's why it's in its original

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.430 
as much that's why it's in its original
container<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.450> have<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.630> little<00:02:16.930> spoon<00:02:17.260> I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
container and I have a little spoon I

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.870 
container and I have a little spoon I
think<00:02:17.710> those<00:02:17.860> little<00:02:17.980> spoons<00:02:18.340> really<00:02:18.730> make<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
think those little spoons really make a

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.880 
think those little spoons really make a
big<00:02:19.120> difference<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.600> not<00:02:20.110> using<00:02:20.560> as<00:02:20.710> much

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
big difference and not using as much

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.310 
big difference and not using as much

to cover the sides as much as I can it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.400 
to cover the sides as much as I can it
really<00:02:33.280> doesn't<00:02:33.700> need<00:02:33.820> to<00:02:33.970> be<00:02:34.090> perfect<00:02:34.410> now

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
really doesn't need to be perfect now

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.560 
really doesn't need to be perfect now
once<00:02:35.680> I've<00:02:35.860> covered<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.340> entirely<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
could adhere this to a piece of scrap

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.660 
could adhere this to a piece of scrap
paper<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.230> go<00:02:44.980> from<00:02:45.190> there<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.580> think

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
some of it gets on the back that's fine

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.480 
some of it gets on the back that's fine
it<00:02:53.290> doesn't<00:02:53.590> bother<00:02:53.650> me<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> bit<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.340> that

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
it doesn't bother me a bit and that

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.770 
it doesn't bother me a bit and that
helps<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.030> make<00:02:55.150> sure<00:02:55.300> that<00:02:55.450> some<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.720> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
helps to make sure that some of the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.360 
helps to make sure that some of the
embossing<00:02:55.960> powder<00:02:56.290> gets<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.740> sides<00:02:57.040> of

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
embossing powder gets on the sides of

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.370 
embossing powder gets on the sides of
the<00:02:57.900> embellishment<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.020> we've<00:02:59.110> created

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
the embellishment that we've created

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.040 
the embellishment that we've created
here<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.460> I'm<00:03:00.520> using<00:03:00.730> my<00:03:01.150> hero<00:03:01.420> arts<00:03:01.690> heat<00:03:01.870> gun

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
here so I'm using my hero arts heat gun

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.560 
here so I'm using my hero arts heat gun
to<00:03:02.230> melt<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.830> away<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.430> you'll<00:03:03.880> see<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.360> it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
to melt this away and you'll see that it

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.990 
to melt this away and you'll see that it
looks<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.990> lovely<00:03:05.350> silver<00:03:05.680> at<00:03:05.890> first<00:03:06.220> but<00:03:06.940> I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
looks a lovely silver at first but I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.660 
looks a lovely silver at first but I
wanted<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.570> really<00:03:08.200> make<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:08.800> look<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.430> an

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
wanted to really make this look like an

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.460 
wanted to really make this look like an
embellishment<00:03:10.420> as<00:03:10.660> opposed<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.020> just<00:03:11.170> paper

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
embellishment as opposed to just paper

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.930 
embellishment as opposed to just paper
covered<00:03:11.860> with<00:03:11.980> embossing<00:03:12.250> powder<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.790> want

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
covered with embossing powder so I want

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.420 
covered with embossing powder so I want
to<00:03:12.970> put<00:03:13.120> more<00:03:13.390> embossing<00:03:13.840> powder<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.620> so

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
to put more embossing powder on it so

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.670 
to put more embossing powder on it so
what<00:03:15.580> I'm<00:03:15.670> gonna<00:03:15.790> do<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.210> add<00:03:16.870> another<00:03:17.320> layer

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
what I'm gonna do is add another layer

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.230 
what I'm gonna do is add another layer
now<00:03:18.250> there<00:03:18.400> are<00:03:18.490> two<00:03:18.640> ways<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:18.970> could<00:03:19.090> do<00:03:19.210> this

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
now there are two ways you could do this

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.850 
now there are two ways you could do this
you<00:03:19.480> could<00:03:19.540> let<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:19.900> cool<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.380> dip<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.740> back

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
you could let this cool and dip it back

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.400 
you could let this cool and dip it back
on<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.640> your<00:03:21.820> Versamark<00:03:22.300> ink<00:03:22.420> pad<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.930> then

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
on to your Versamark ink pad and then

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.410 
on to your Versamark ink pad and then
add<00:03:23.590> more<00:03:23.770> embossing<00:03:24.010> powder<00:03:24.430> but<00:03:25.120> another

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
add more embossing powder but another

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.330 
add more embossing powder but another
trick<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.230> get<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.500> really<00:03:26.770> hot<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.310> that

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
trick is is to get it really hot so that

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.730 
trick is is to get it really hot so that
that<00:03:27.640> powder<00:03:27.910> on<00:03:28.270> your<00:03:28.570> medallion<00:03:29.050> is<00:03:29.170> very

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
that powder on your medallion is very

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.290 
that powder on your medallion is very
hot<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.130> then<00:03:30.280> dip<00:03:30.520> it<00:03:30.670> back<00:03:30.700> in<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.090> powder

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
hot and then dip it back in the powder

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.600 
hot and then dip it back in the powder
and<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:32.140> hot<00:03:32.380> embossing<00:03:32.770> powder<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.280> melted

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
and the hot embossing powder the melted

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.520 
and the hot embossing powder the melted
embossing<00:03:33.850> powder<00:03:34.120> will<00:03:34.360> stick<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:35.020> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
embossing powder will stick to the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.810 
embossing powder will stick to the
additional<00:03:35.920> embossing<00:03:36.160> powder<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.580> put<00:03:36.610> on

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
additional embossing powder you put on

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.360 
additional embossing powder you put on
so<00:03:37.390> now<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.540> have<00:03:37.810> two<00:03:38.110> layers<00:03:38.440> here<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.010> I'm

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
so now I have two layers here and I'm

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.740 
so now I have two layers here and I'm
gonna<00:03:39.520> go<00:03:39.760> ahead<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:39.970> do<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> little<00:03:40.390> bit<00:03:40.540> more

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
gonna go ahead and do a little bit more

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.750 
gonna go ahead and do a little bit more
on<00:03:40.870> some<00:03:40.900> parts<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.530> you<00:03:41.860> can<00:03:42.040> see<00:03:42.340> that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
on some parts and you can see that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.880 
on some parts and you can see that
you're<00:03:43.150> starting<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.690> really<00:03:43.960> cover<00:03:44.500> all<00:03:44.650> of

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
you're starting to really cover all of

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.250 
you're starting to really cover all of
that<00:03:45.250> layered<00:03:45.610> die<00:03:45.880> cut<00:03:46.150> piece<00:03:46.360> with<00:03:46.990> the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
that layered die cut piece with the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.140 
that layered die cut piece with the
metal<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.740> it<00:03:47.860> really<00:03:48.070> looks<00:03:48.340> quite<00:03:48.640> cool<00:03:48.880> so

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
metal and it really looks quite cool so

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.990 
metal and it really looks quite cool so
now<00:03:49.990> I<00:03:50.020> have<00:03:50.500> my<00:03:50.650> silver<00:03:50.980> done<00:03:51.130> I'm<00:03:51.430> gonna<00:03:51.760> heat

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
now I have my silver done I'm gonna heat

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.970 
now I have my silver done I'm gonna heat
it<00:03:52.030> up<00:03:52.210> so<00:03:52.420> it's<00:03:52.540> nice<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.930> hot<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.200> quickly

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
it up so it's nice and hot and quickly

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.160 
it up so it's nice and hot and quickly
sprinkle<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:54.970> some<00:03:55.240> gold<00:03:55.450> powder<00:03:55.780> just<00:03:56.050> a

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
sprinkle on some gold powder just a

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.210 
sprinkle on some gold powder just a
little<00:03:56.410> bit<00:03:56.530> here<00:03:56.800> and<00:03:56.890> there

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
little bit here and there

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.430 
little bit here and there
and<00:03:57.310> then<00:03:57.910> heat<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.270> up<00:03:58.330> again<00:03:58.510> again<00:03:59.110> if<00:03:59.290> you

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
and then heat it up again again if you

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.560 
and then heat it up again again if you
don't<00:03:59.620> want<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.490> worry<00:04:00.790> about<00:04:00.910> moving<00:04:01.270> fast

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
don't want to worry about moving fast

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.910 
don't want to worry about moving fast
enough<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.990> add<00:04:02.110> powder<00:04:02.380> while<00:04:02.650> it's<00:04:02.740> still

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
enough to add powder while it's still

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.590 
enough to add powder while it's still
hot<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:03.340> could<00:04:03.730> let<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:03.880> cool<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.300> put<00:04:04.510> on

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
hot you could let it cool and put on

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.960 
hot you could let it cool and put on
more<00:04:04.900> Versamark<00:04:05.470> ink<00:04:05.590> instead<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.760> there<00:04:06.880> you

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
more Versamark ink instead so there you

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.910 
more Versamark ink instead so there you
can<00:04:07.090> see<00:04:07.270> there's<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.510> mix<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:08.110> gold<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.530> silver

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
can see there's a mix of gold and silver

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.010 
can see there's a mix of gold and silver
on<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.490> once<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.120> cools<00:04:10.390> it<00:04:10.600> looks<00:04:10.810> like<00:04:10.990> a

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
on it and once it cools it looks like a

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.380 
on it and once it cools it looks like a
great<00:04:11.380> standalone<00:04:11.950> embellishment<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:13.300> now

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
great standalone embellishment so now

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.430 
great standalone embellishment so now
I'm<00:04:13.450> gonna<00:04:13.570> do<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.780> same<00:04:13.870> thing<00:04:14.230> with<00:04:14.350> the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
I'm gonna do the same thing with the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
I'm gonna do the same thing with the
other<00:04:14.500> half<00:04:14.590> I'm<00:04:14.860> gonna<00:04:14.950> go<00:04:15.100> ahead<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.340> show

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
focusing on this intricate die cut

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.330 
focusing on this intricate die cut
and<00:04:27.759> again<00:04:28.270> at<00:04:28.449> first<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:29.320> has<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.620> light<00:04:30.100> layer

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
and again at first it has a light layer

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.159 
and again at first it has a light layer
of<00:04:30.400> silver<00:04:31.030> which<00:04:31.419> really<00:04:31.660> doesn't<00:04:32.050> do<00:04:32.139> a

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
of silver which really doesn't do a

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.629 
of silver which really doesn't do a
whole<00:04:32.289> lot<00:04:32.470> it's<00:04:32.800> when<00:04:33.009> you<00:04:33.130> add<00:04:33.310> the

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
whole lot it's when you add the

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.550 
whole lot it's when you add the
additional<00:04:34.210> layers<00:04:34.479> that<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:34.930> really<00:04:35.169> starts

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
additional layers that it really starts

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.010 
additional layers that it really starts
to<00:04:35.800> look<00:04:36.160> like<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.699> really<00:04:37.000> cool<00:04:37.120> embellishment

this pattern will kind of pour over the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.350 
this pattern will kind of pour over the
edges<00:04:50.350> so<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.949> edges<00:04:51.400> look<00:04:51.669> nice<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.090> smooth
