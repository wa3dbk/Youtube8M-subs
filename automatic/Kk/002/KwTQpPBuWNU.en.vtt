00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
way there'd be like videos every day and

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.200 
way there'd be like videos every day and
I'd<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:26.980> getting<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.280> bunch<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.670> use<00:02:27.910> but<00:02:28.150> I

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
I'd be getting a bunch of use but I

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.570 
I'd be getting a bunch of use but I
don't<00:02:28.450> want<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.750> force<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.470> don't<00:02:30.370> want<00:02:30.490> to

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
don't want to force I don't want to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.610

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.370 
like three thirty in the morning and so
I<00:02:39.340> feel<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.300> would<00:02:40.420> be<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> good<00:02:40.810> way<00:02:40.870> to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
I feel like this would be a good way to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.610 
I feel like this would be a good way to
give<00:02:42.070> me<00:02:42.340> some<00:02:42.670> like<00:02:42.850> filler<00:02:43.180> days<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.900> on<00:02:44.320> top

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
give me some like filler days and on top

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.610 
give me some like filler days and on top
of<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.860> I'd<00:02:45.250> be<00:02:45.670> playing<00:02:45.910> Wow<00:02:46.330> like<00:02:47.290> every

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
of that I'd be playing Wow like every

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.950 
of that I'd be playing Wow like every
day<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.280> I'd<00:02:48.400> be<00:02:48.550> getting<00:02:48.730> more<00:02:49.030> video<00:02:49.420> ideas

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
day and I'd be getting more video ideas

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.410 
day and I'd be getting more video ideas
and<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.740> glad<00:02:51.040> comes<00:02:51.340> full<00:02:51.700> circle<00:02:51.730> and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and it just glad comes full circle and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.540 
and it just glad comes full circle and
then<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.630> get<00:02:52.930> more<00:02:53.290> machine<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.710> ideas<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.430> I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
then I get more machine of ideas and I

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.730 
then I get more machine of ideas and I
play<00:02:54.820> well<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.330> it's<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.930> little<00:02:56.170> grand<00:02:56.440> old

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
play well and it's a little grand old

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.480 
play well and it's a little grand old
time<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.760> uh<00:02:58.770> it's<00:02:59.770> probably<00:03:00.100> gonna<00:03:00.220> take<00:03:00.310> a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
time so uh it's probably gonna take a

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.310 
time so uh it's probably gonna take a
long<00:03:00.730> time<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.060> get<00:03:01.240> to<00:03:01.300> nine<00:03:01.600> be<00:03:01.780> on<00:03:01.930> top<00:03:02.140> of

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
long time to get to nine be on top of

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.640 
long time to get to nine be on top of
that<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.040> maybe<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:03.910> should<00:03:04.240> edit<00:03:04.480> parts<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.530> it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
that so maybe I should edit parts of it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.440 
that so maybe I should edit parts of it
but<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.190> don't<00:03:06.340> really<00:03:06.460> want<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.850> edit<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.240> maybe

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
but I don't really want to edit it maybe

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.700 
but I don't really want to edit it maybe
I<00:03:07.510> can<00:03:07.690> make<00:03:07.720> one<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.020> those<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.260> can<00:03:08.470> make<00:03:08.560> it

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
I can make one of those I can make it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.230 
I can make one of those I can make it
like<00:03:08.800> a<00:03:08.830> pokey<00:03:09.310> bond<00:03:09.490> let's<00:03:09.760> play<00:03:10.000> where<00:03:10.210> I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
like a pokey bond let's play where I

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.880 
like a pokey bond let's play where I
make<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.630> those<00:03:10.690> cool<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.230> ice<00:03:11.440> or

make one of those cool you ice or
whatever<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.340> in<00:03:12.520> Photoshop<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:14.230> think<00:03:15.160> it'd

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
whatever it is in Photoshop I think it'd

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.760 
whatever it is in Photoshop I think it'd
be<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.400> fun<00:03:15.610> idea<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.210> comment<00:03:16.510> below<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.590> tell
