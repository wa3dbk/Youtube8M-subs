00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.250
 here 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.849
 Hi there, this video is for those who love 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.830
 save money and bother 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.020
 at the same time today I will show you how 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.250
 make a muzzle with your own hands using 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.329
 construction silicone sealant 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.149
 silicone sealant for sale 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.719
 almost everywhere looking for material 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.300
 you should have no problems 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.610
 that is, it is very affordable including 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.140
 at a price which is several times less than 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.480
 purchased silicones 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.300
 or special polymer clay for 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.030
 making molds these mods can 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.850
 bake along with the clay it is very 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.219
 you will agree, I will do it today 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.969
 muzzles here from these rather large ones 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.399
 seashells 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.060
 you can take any items with 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.040
 which are planning to make an imprint 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.490
 my spring purchase for creativity i 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.400
 I showed you the silicone under it and I will 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.430
 use it now acid 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.330
 gray silicone it withstands 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.710
 temperature up to 200 degrees Celsius 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.130
 I took the gray color just for 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.350
 variety for such packaging silicone 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.800
 you will need a release gun 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.460
 which you will greatly facilitate the work he 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.950
 also quite quite inexpensive and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.250
 the required ingredient is starch 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.580
 potato 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.460
 or corn doesn't matter he is worth a penny 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.820
 as a replacement for the collapse of mana, you can take talc 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.920
 but it is expensive for such work flour 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.030
 better not to use it has more 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.040
 coarse than starch and talc 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.770
 wear gloves otherwise hands 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.440
 will be in silicone can take a spoon 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.730
 rag and wet wipes to quickly 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.220
 clean the surface 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.519
 until the silicone froze to do it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.580
 easy start dress up work 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:16.450
 gloves and sprinkle surface for 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.099
 work now we take silicone and cut off with 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.860
 screw the tip of the nozzle and 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:28.170
 refill silicone release gun 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.600
 we begin to compress the handle and is injected 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.360
 tank pressure 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.710
 silicone is squeezed out 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.710
 the right amount of silicone 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.740
 stop the flow with a special button 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.840
 on the gun which will relieve pressure 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.230
 then pour the starch into the silicone 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.410
 the proportion of one to one may be not less 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.870
 1 to one and a half if you do less then 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.830
 will stick to hands and silicone will not 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.100
 keep fit 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.590
 he will be very very soft to work 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.280
 silicone, preferably up to 30 degrees of heat 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.590
 but unfortunately I have now 35 and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.010
 it will freeze very quickly 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.980
 I will try to work as quickly as possible 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.670
 further carefully and knead 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.670
 silicone dough by hand 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.209
 make a lump otlipa hand 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.170
 take the item with which we will do 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.500
 cast and tear off the desired size lump 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.570
 a little bit more than the subject itself 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.840
 sprinkle a lump on all sides doing 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:00.130
 thick cake and press the subject into 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.130
 Silicone strictly down 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.260
 the edges of the silicone tighten the edges of the subject 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.750
 the upper part of the young should be flat 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.940
 so that you can later cut 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.610
 excess material with a knife straight from 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.590
 surface young 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.370
 form a beautiful tank and leave it on 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.220
 24 hours to set the next mole 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.910
 we do the same for everyone 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.430
 fashion re-knead fresh dough so 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:37.040
 how silicone freezes in just 10 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.040
 minutes and begins to exfoliate strongly 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:44.839
 one day we take out items from 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.819
 molds 

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:51.059
 wash them with water and can use 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.639
 young they are completely frozen can 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:55.919
 do both raw casts and bake in 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.529
 the oven along with polymer clay 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.159
 Such mods are very well conveyed. 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.839
 the texture of objects is very small 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:06.479
 is cheap available in 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:09.569
 making only minus 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.509
 a little dirty and making requires 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:16.529
 preparation and the subsequent cleaning of the remains 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:19.439
 starch and silicone from the table I'm from 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:21.749
 I'm printing a cast from this shell for this 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.270
 mouth need to grease with talcum powder using 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:27.449
 brush and press the polymer clay 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:32.569
 top stretch to the brim and well 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.569
 rinse to print better printed 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.510
 put in the oven right with clay and 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:46.320
 bake you can take out the cast and bake 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:49.200
 without the mole, what do you want here is such a shell 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.930
 it turned out imprinted even tiny 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.650
 flaws and chips that were on the present 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.440
 seashells 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.110
 so if you don't have the opportunity 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.260
 buy a clay mole maker or silicone for 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.890
 Moldov take the usual building 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.900
 silicone sealant 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.240
 just be sure to read on 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.600
 packaging to withstand high 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.430
 baking temperature 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.660
 Thank you all for watching and before new 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.660
 bye for now 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.539
 but
