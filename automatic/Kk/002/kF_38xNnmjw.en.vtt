00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
though because I really like to not go

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.000 
though because I really like to not go

didn't make sense it it sometimes it's
always<00:05:46.820> too<00:05:47.270> much<00:05:47.449> but<00:05:47.930> that's<00:05:48.139> right<00:05:48.340> you

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
color when you don't have samples but I

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.730 
color when you don't have samples but I
did<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.400> pretty<00:06:22.639> good<00:06:22.820> job<00:06:22.880> since

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
did a pretty good job since

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.120 
did a pretty good job since
I<00:06:23.770> used<00:06:24.250> c3<00:06:25.240> and<00:06:25.509> the<00:06:25.630> true<00:06:25.870> match<00:06:26.080> color<00:06:26.470> also

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130
