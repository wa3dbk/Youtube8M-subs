00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.970
 this vehicle is a modern submarine 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.880
 tourism that sails through the waters of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.640
 the Canary Islands although separated by 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.980
 more than 150 years of history has a lot 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.779
 in common with the two fictional ones the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.280
 submarines invented by narcís 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.860
 monturiol 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.020
 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.000
 construction of fish in the museum 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.220
 maritime of Barcelona became a 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.590
 exhibition dedicated to the famous inventor 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.680
 Catalan 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.440
 for many centuries the sea has generated 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.910
 terror and fascination but he has always 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.870
 there have been daring who have loved 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.870
 immerse in it 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.199
 formerly the sea monsters 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.190
 occupied an important place in the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.190
 imagination of the people 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.360
 but the restlessness of the human spirit 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.520
 He made them develop 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.040
 techniques that allowed working under the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.040
 water for short periods of time 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.090
 so the primitive equipment appeared 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.729
 of divers and strange gadgets that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.270
 often ended up producing the death of 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.270
 its occupants 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.470
 with all these precedents after 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.049
 observe the risks that the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.270
 coral fishermen of cadaqués narcís 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.100
 monturiol set out to build a 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.790
 device that allowed to navigate ' 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.890
 submerged and with total security 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.450
 counting on the collaboration of 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.700
 engineers and scientists 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.770
 monturiol was able to determine the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.410
 basic functions that a 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.060
 submarine and to build a device that 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.100
 I would fulfill them 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.100
 it was an extraordinary challenge 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.720
 of the effort of the whole team in 1858 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:05.130
 the fish was born and later in 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.130
 1864 the fish 2 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.250
 technical advances and innovations 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.950
 that incorporated the fish 2 were from 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.870
 great importance for your time one of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.000
 the most prominent was the introduction 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.190
 of the steam engine to move the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.950
 propeller and that the ship will move 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.200
 the submarine was carrying two machines 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.150
 steam one of six horses that alone 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.400
 allowed to navigate the surface of the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.590
 sea ​​since steam was produced by 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.410
 the combustion of coal what generated 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.530
 carbon dioxide which had to be 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.410
 evacuated to the outside the other engine was 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.780
 of two horses served to navigate in 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.790
 immersion since steam was achieved 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.530
 by chemical reactions that 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.710
 allowed to boil the water of the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.730
 boiler and that also gave off oxygen 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.890
 which could be breathed from this 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.960
 way the ship could be a long time 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.300
 submerged 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.490
 this was the best technology that 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.860
 monturiol could use in his ship 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.380
 several years after the development of 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.330
 fishy 2 machines were invented 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.560
 high-power electric 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.560
 internal combustion engines 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.040
 years later in 1888 isaac pear 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.570
 presented his submarine in which he had in 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.570
 account for monturiol studies 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.260
 the modern submarines are still 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.510
 many of the principles discovered 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.069
 by narcís monturiol a genius 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.069
 unknown to many people 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.090
 ah 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.090
