00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.650
 my hefty in general, here we go 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.420

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:20.939

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:27.119

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.149
 I think you have any questions why here 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.629
 these doors are worth 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.410

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.789
 when you go down something happens 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.910
 like this here you get up and the elevator left 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.960

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.899

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.180

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.549
