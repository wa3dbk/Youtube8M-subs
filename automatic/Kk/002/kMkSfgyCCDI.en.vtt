you get a low tire because you'd rather

know that you have a low tire by the

possibly having to replace that tire so

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.659 
possibly having to replace that tire so
we're<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.200> tell<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:46.980> truck<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.610> we

we're going to tell this truck that we

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.250 
we're going to tell this truck that we
just<00:04:47.850> rotated<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.360> tire<00:04:48.540> so<00:04:48.780> knows<00:04:49.020> what

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
just rotated the tire so knows what

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.770 
just rotated the tire so knows what
sensors<00:04:49.710> in<00:04:49.860> one<00:04:49.979> location<00:04:50.340> so<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:51.390> give<00:04:51.540> a<00:04:51.600> key

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
sensors in one location so I give a key

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.480 
sensors in one location so I give a key
on<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.440> then<00:04:53.100> hit<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.520> hazard<00:04:53.910> six<00:04:54.210> times

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.480 

that<00:04:59.490> horn<00:05:00.090> honk<00:05:00.389> signifies<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.830> TPMS

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
that horn honk signifies that the TPMS

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.280 
that horn honk signifies that the TPMS
system<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.419> learned<00:05:03.630> Mountain<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.080> says

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
system is in learned Mountain it says

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.100 
system is in learned Mountain it says
right<00:05:04.530> here<00:05:04.560> train<00:05:05.490> left<00:05:05.790> front<00:05:06.030> tire<00:05:06.090> now<00:05:07.050> the

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
right here train left front tire now the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.100 
right here train left front tire now the
way<00:05:07.320> we<00:05:07.500> train<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:08.100> is<00:05:08.600> we<00:05:09.600> let<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.930> air<00:05:10.080> out

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
way we train that is we let the air out

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.230 
way we train that is we let the air out
of<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.500> tire<00:05:10.740> until<00:05:11.100> we<00:05:11.400> hear<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.610> horn<00:05:11.729> honk

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
of the tire until we hear the horn honk

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:25.050 
of the tire until we hear the horn honk
so<00:05:12.900> we'll<00:05:12.990> start<00:05:13.229> on<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.410> left<00:05:13.530> front

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.700 

I<00:05:27.330> just<00:05:28.330> used<00:05:28.540> a<00:05:28.630> tire<00:05:28.810> truck<00:05:29.110> for<00:05:29.290> putting<00:05:29.530> air

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
I just used a tire truck for putting air

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:40.649 
I just used a tire truck for putting air
in<00:05:29.889> with<00:05:30.220> no<00:05:30.400> hose

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.179 

that<00:05:41.659> shows<00:05:41.929> that<00:05:41.959> micro<00:05:42.499> tires<00:05:42.770> can<00:05:43.069> learn

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:45.189 
that shows that micro tires can learn

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.609 
that shows that micro tires can learn
follow<00:05:46.189> around<00:05:46.429> the<00:05:46.729> truck<00:05:46.999> clockwise<00:05:47.619> says

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:48.619 
follow around the truck clockwise says

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:58.660 
follow around the truck clockwise says
I'm<00:05:48.830> use<00:05:49.039> McCluster<00:05:49.569> train<00:05:50.569> right<00:05:50.839> front<00:05:51.139> tire

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.090 

just<00:05:59.670> follow<00:05:59.850> around<00:06:00.240> clockwise<00:06:00.830> until<00:06:01.830> we've

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
just follow around clockwise until we've

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:43.200 
just follow around clockwise until we've
done<00:06:02.280> all<00:06:02.430> four

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.040 

you<00:06:44.210> see<00:06:44.420> on<00:06:44.600> the<00:06:44.720> instrument<00:06:45.110> cluster

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
you see on the instrument cluster

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.790 
you see on the instrument cluster
training<00:06:48.050> complete<00:06:49.000> that<00:06:50.000> shows<00:06:50.300> we're<00:06:50.480> done

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
training complete that shows we're done

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.620 
training complete that shows we're done
so<00:06:51.800> now<00:06:51.980> feel<00:06:52.250> free<00:06:52.490> to<00:06:52.520> cycle<00:06:53.150> the<00:06:53.240> ignition

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
so now feel free to cycle the ignition

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.780 
so now feel free to cycle the ignition
off<00:06:53.750> and<00:06:54.410> we're<00:06:55.070> going<00:06:55.220> to<00:06:55.310> set<00:06:55.490> the<00:06:55.580> tire

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790 
off and we're going to set the tire

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.210 
off and we're going to set the tire
pressure<00:06:56.090> to<00:06:56.810> what<00:06:56.990> the<00:06:57.200> tire<00:06:57.650> label<00:06:58.070> right

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
pressure to what the tire label right

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.390 
pressure to what the tire label right

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.950 
here on the driver's rear door a lot of
cars<00:07:01.640> will<00:07:01.820> have<00:07:01.940> the<00:07:02.090> same<00:07:02.300> sticker<00:07:02.600> further

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
cars will have the same sticker further

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.900 
cars will have the same sticker further
down<00:07:03.140> on<00:07:03.170> the<00:07:03.320> door<00:07:03.530> jamb<00:07:03.830> which<00:07:04.610> on<00:07:04.790> this

down on the door jamb which on this

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.950 
down on the door jamb which on this
truck<00:07:05.210> is<00:07:06.190> 35<00:07:07.190> psi<00:07:07.670> so<00:07:07.970> reset<00:07:08.360> those<00:07:08.540> pressures

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
truck is 35 psi so reset those pressures

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.980 
truck is 35 psi so reset those pressures
and<00:07:09.560> we're<00:07:09.710> good<00:07:09.830> to<00:07:09.860> go
