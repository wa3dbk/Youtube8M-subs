all<00:00:01.410> right<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:02.070> we're<00:00:02.250> gonna<00:00:02.340> be<00:00:02.429> making<00:00:02.550> a

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
all right today we're gonna be making a

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.380 
all right today we're gonna be making a
giant<00:00:03.179> slingshot<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:04.290> our<00:00:04.500> picture<00:00:05.210> and<00:00:06.210> you

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
giant slingshot for our picture and you

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.459 
giant slingshot for our picture and you
have<00:00:06.540> some<00:00:06.859> 3-inch<00:00:07.859> pipe<00:00:08.130> here<00:00:08.460> we've<00:00:09.059> cut

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
have some 3-inch pipe here we've cut

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.499 
have some 3-inch pipe here we've cut
four<00:00:10.469> foot<00:00:10.769> long<00:00:11.429> each<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.849> those<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.389> need

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
four foot long each of those you need

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.950 
four foot long each of those you need
three<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.750> those<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.780> some<00:00:15.780> little

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
three of those and we have some little

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.260 
three of those and we have some little
couplings<00:00:16.470> here<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.100> cut<00:00:17.340> these

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
couplings here that we have cut these

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.679 
couplings here that we have cut these
are<00:00:18.570> three<00:00:19.320> inches<00:00:19.619> each<00:00:19.859> as<00:00:20.279> well<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:21.449> have

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
are three inches each as well we have

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.740 
are three inches each as well we have
our<00:00:21.720> twenty-two<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.560> half<00:00:22.590> angle<00:00:23.750> pipe

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
our twenty-two and a half angle pipe

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.740 
our twenty-two and a half angle pipe
they're<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.670> 45<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:26.970> two<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> those<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
they're a 45 we have two of those and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900 
they're a 45 we have two of those and
then<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> team<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.490> we'll<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.670> putting

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
then we have a team so we'll be putting

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.070 
then we have a team so we'll be putting
those<00:00:29.970> together<00:00:30.150> you'll<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:30.810> how<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> all

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
those together you'll see how it all

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.630 
those together you'll see how it all
comes<00:00:31.140> out<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.219> exploded<00:00:35.219> view<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
comes out so this is a exploded view of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.720 
comes out so this is a exploded view of
how<00:00:35.760> each<00:00:36.030> piece<00:00:36.809> will<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.170> together<00:00:37.550> you<00:00:38.550> see

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
how each piece will go together you see

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.720 
how each piece will go together you see
the<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.090> individual<00:00:39.690> pieces<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.730> we'll

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the little individual pieces there we'll

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.549 
the little individual pieces there we'll
glue<00:00:41.969> them<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.180> together<00:00:42.360> we'll<00:00:43.230> make<00:00:43.350> us<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
glue them all together we'll make us a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.369 
glue them all together we'll make us a
slingshot<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.670> will<00:00:45.480> Loomis<00:00:45.899> some<00:00:46.200> rubber

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
slingshot and will Loomis some rubber

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.889 
slingshot and will Loomis some rubber
bands<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.489> make<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.820> actual<00:00:48.120> slingshot<00:00:48.660> part

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
bands to make the actual slingshot part

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.600 
bands to make the actual slingshot part
of<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.649> probably<00:00:50.039> use<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.399> duct

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of it and probably use a little duct

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:49.940 
of it and probably use a little duct
tape<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.969> well

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.730 

so<00:01:50.950> again<00:01:51.189> we<00:01:51.340> use<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:51.789> extreme<00:01:52.450> file<00:01:53.140> bands

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
so again we use this extreme file bands

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.770 
so again we use this extreme file bands
and<00:01:54.360> we've<00:01:55.360> made<00:01:55.539> four<00:01:56.369> separate<00:01:57.369> strings<00:01:58.270> of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
and we've made four separate strings of

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.270 
and we've made four separate strings of
these<00:01:58.990> bands<00:01:59.229> each<00:01:59.470> one<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.799> these<00:01:59.890> strands

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
these bands each one of these strands

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.149 
these bands each one of these strands
loom<00:02:00.700> together<00:02:01.030> with<00:02:01.240> 20<00:02:01.630> rubber<00:02:02.619> bands<00:02:02.890> each

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
loom together with 20 rubber bands each

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.190 
loom together with 20 rubber bands each
and<00:02:03.549> so<00:02:03.819> you<00:02:03.909> can<00:02:04.149> just<00:02:04.329> adjust<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.780> based<00:02:04.990> on

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
and so you can just adjust that based on

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.350 
and so you can just adjust that based on
how<00:02:05.349> tight<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.740> want<00:02:05.979> it<00:02:06.099> or<00:02:06.220> how<00:02:06.250> far<00:02:07.209> back

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
how tight you want it or how far back

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.059 
how tight you want it or how far back
you<00:02:07.420> want<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.869> stretch<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:08.860> we've<00:02:09.039> just

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
you want it to stretch and we've just

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.309 
you want it to stretch and we've just
slipped<00:02:09.519> them<00:02:09.640> over<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:09.970> edge<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.509> we're

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
slipped them over the edge and we're

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.360 
slipped them over the edge and we're
going<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.470> make<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.620> little<00:02:11.769> pad<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.040> them<00:02:12.250> with

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
going to make a little pad in them with

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.550 
going to make a little pad in them with
in<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.640> middle<00:02:12.910> with<00:02:13.630> some<00:02:13.840> duct<00:02:14.080> tape<00:02:17.760> pad<00:02:19.560> in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
in the middle with some duct tape pad in

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.470 
in the middle with some duct tape pad in
the<00:02:20.709> center<00:02:21.130> we're<00:02:21.670> gonna<00:02:21.760> use<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.209> to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the center we're gonna use this to

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:47.380 
the center we're gonna use this to
launch<00:02:22.769> t-shirts<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:37.450> little<00:02:37.630> square

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.510 

which<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.540> turned<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.960> over<00:02:49.130> you're<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.280> exact

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
which I turned it over you're the exact

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.870 
which I turned it over you're the exact
same<00:02:50.730> square<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.270> back<00:02:52.700> we're<00:02:53.700> gonna

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
same square on the back we're gonna

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.100 
same square on the back we're gonna
leave<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.680> middle<00:02:56.070> part<00:02:56.490> open<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.020> we

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
leave the middle part open so that we

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.190 
leave the middle part open so that we
could<00:02:58.320> have<00:02:59.030> something<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.210> pull<00:03:00.810> through<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
could have something to pull through the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.590 
could have something to pull through the
center<00:03:02.450> connect<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.600> on<00:03:03.750> top<00:03:03.990> if<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.260> need<00:03:04.440> to
