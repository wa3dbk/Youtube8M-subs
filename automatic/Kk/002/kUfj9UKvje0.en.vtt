 g manitoba flour 200 g of potatoes 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:56.839
 boil and crush 100 ml of milk 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.839
 warm 15 grams of brewer's yeast 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:11.200
 the peel of a grated orange a 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 pinch of salt and sugar for 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 to decorate 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 start by dissolving the yeast 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:30.670
 in warm milk then add 90 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.020
 grams of flour taken from the total for 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.020
 prepare a slight bow 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.450
 which will cover with film and I will leave 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.450
 rest until it becomes swollen 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.570
 I join the eggs 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:01.140
 a pinch of salt sugar 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.220
 and 300 grams of flour taken from the total 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.620
 I let the dough string together well 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.790
 add the mashed potatoes a 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.790
 room temperature 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.930
 and the remaining flour 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.239
 then add the butter 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.689
 and the orange peel 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:14.600
 and lets be stranded in the dough once 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.950
 that choro will be beautiful and elastic 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.950
 I let it rest until it is doubled 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.410
 then the reverse on the table 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:31.820
 lightly floured and after a couple of 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:36.370
 folds of folds taking a flap e 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.370
 pulling it gently towards the center 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:49.580
 completed this operation reverse the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.580
 ball and covers with film 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.489
 after about an hour it will be doubled and 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.909
 therefore the reverse side of will be very soft 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.909
 new 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.830
 lightly sprinkle with the flour and the 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.970
 I lay at a thickness of one centimeter 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.970
 and a half or so 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.280
 with a large biscuit cutter revenue i 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.280
 circles 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:32.620
 and with a smaller one I get the hole 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.560
 central and position on squares of 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.640
 baking paper this way will be more 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.060
 easy to maneuver them to fry them will have to 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:47.020
 still to limit 30 40 minutes until 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.790
 will become beautiful border between the 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.660
 ingredients do not name oil for 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.640
 to fry 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.550
 obviously I will advise you 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:05:01.690
 I let the peanut oil slip 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:05.500
 in hot oil but not hot not 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:10.540
 as soon as they finish inflating the turns e 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.840
 I bring them to gilding after having them 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.130
 dry with kitchen paper 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.130
 I pass it in sugar
