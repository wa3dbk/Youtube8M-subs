 let's start girls as a first step let's go 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.320
 to paint our nails in this color 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.910
 pale rosy 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 we will apply the layers that are 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.840
 necessary until those results are obtained 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 desired step number 2 we will use 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.390
 alcohol a piece of newspaper and what 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.189
 let's dip inside after about 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.350
 seconds let's take out the piece of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.120
 newspaper to apply it in our 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.429
 nail 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.710
 in this way they will be marked 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:43.260
 letters on the nail 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.390
 we arrived like 30 seconds and then 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.019
 we remove the paper the letters already 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.570
 they were marked step number 2 we are 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.620
 ready to make the roses using 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.159
 this orange color and a thin brush 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.720
 let's continue making the roses 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.540
 let's apply some paint on the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.700
 top in this way forming 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.509
 like a little circles but not very 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.970
 full we're going to do four in a 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.370
 coordination forming as a he 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.200
 if you notice that in the second nail I have 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.700
 left the back ones a bit swept by 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.830
 that apply the brightness in a way 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.460
 inadequate be very careful when you 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.670
 go to do 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.340
 false number 4 we will use paint 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.160
 white to shape the rose of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.000
 this way making some small stripes 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.520
 around the circles 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.830
