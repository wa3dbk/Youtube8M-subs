00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.439
 Happy happy to be here 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.960
 all of his colleagues are involved 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.300
 concentrated and with the christmas of the teacher 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.730
 what is winning not winning all matches 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 and we are focused on 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.590
 in qualifying I can not say that we have 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.270
 changed in many ways the truth 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.640
 that when you arrive at your house you are already a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.340
 person who recognizes you are already a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 public figure and as such it has to be 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 the example with society and many 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.800
 we already executed and different no longer 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.660
 it's high level competition but when 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.860
 comes the attention also comes the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 pressure but obviously we already have 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 the rod is high we have it here 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.579
 so I can come down from that I do not think 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.579
 be pressure well but a motivation 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.960
 extra we like you can see it in the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.609
 complicate them here can do more 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.160
 closed with security go do not golea 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.219
 to you and the teams also worked 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.420
 They are already investing everything because 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.949
 just as they grow what we are 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.490
 growing up today Mexico has earned the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.740
 respect in minors 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.900
 I believe that if not the truth that I have not 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.510
 done good papers we really lack 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.510
 we need everything to get more titles 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.580
 but we have two in the seven sub-20 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.070
 a third place but ours with 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.770
 we do not put that us first 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.440
 qualify worldwide and then see the most 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.660
 there but our goal is going 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.640
 that the child is not qualified because I can 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.800
 say that we obviously have an advantage 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.220
 be local with your people is of 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.440
 full 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.840
 hopefully it will fill then that you 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.330
 benefits everyone from one of the two 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.100
 rivals of the group we know very little that 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.040
 It is curacao, of course, you are already 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.210
 they will know something else if obviously the first 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.210
 crusaders match 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.530
 as you all know it is a colony 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.950
 Dutch, many players have been 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.869
 played talking 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.119
 and I think several players there are 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.439
 in Creole 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.479
 we have seen that several players are 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.729
 playing in that is seen in lai exams 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.399
 basic then how do I think it goes 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.830
 to be difficult so no it is not it is a 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.300
 difficult place that football has but 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.360
 we are also seeing things well 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.340
 then it will be a nice match 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.380
 good but to get the victory that is 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.880
 what we finally care about chicken 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.950
 Thank you again for these minutes 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.599
 already learning Turkish 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.819
 Well, I can tell you that first 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.260
 we thought the premundial and then we thought 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.170
 really consecutive is qualified 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.739
 global and we want we want this without 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.230
 learn Turkish then learn 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.940
 how is the city ​​of istanbul or all 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.519
 turkey then it 's something we want 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.690
 know and is the main objective that 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.690
 is qualified worldwide
