00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.119
 new video in android trend of 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.640
 Android itself and good the subject of which 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.160
 go win today is the technology of 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.800
 android 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.620
 it adapts very very badly for people 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.780
 older does not know how to use it well the buttons do not 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.540
 they are able to get it right I do not know 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.940
 for my mother because she has a phone 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.940
 android very similar to this one of this 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.070
 size and it does not do very well with the theme 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.960
 of the buttons and others and for that I bring 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.420
 today a very special video of a launcher 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.130
 I liked it a lot and it came out very 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 resultÃ³n is this from here pic launcher 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.150
 and what he's going to do is make it all very 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.250
 big very easy for older people and 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.230
 others in one I even quite like 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.970
 here you are going to see 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.780
 it has more or less this presentation 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.300
 of the battery the coverage the now well 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.080
 contacts and everything else comes out there 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.410
 they come great things was phenomenal 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.100
 well I do not have it by default it was 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.350
 great here to take photos called 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.450
 here for applications messages from 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.540
 gallery and what else is it enough 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.150
 cool here in the is to call us 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.760
 after several social of all marque 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.350
 The favorite number add contacts or 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.600
 my contacts for example if I have here 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.570
 to dial the number because at least I have 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.150
 a few quite considerable numbers 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.250
 and very very favored then for that to 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.020
 older people and others and good and who 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.270
 you like it also because not having this is 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.160
 the announcement of the day I say good not 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.320
 You saw a lot evidently did not see much 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.750
 but it is useful for what I said 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.030
 I for the elderly and others who do not know 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.160
 want to complicate a lot that is not very 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.610
 well such to learn now all the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.340
 topic 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.440
 android, this is very simple, 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.610
 here the phone messages gallery photos 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.170
 applications and emergency calls and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.520
 what I like is the theme of the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.520
 coverage and the battery that you know well 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.750
 ie big is phenomenal already know 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.790
 If you want to buy a phone to your 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.210
 mother for the other birthday then 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.370
 they have the perfect excuse now with this 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.950
 with this lounge the launcher that is that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.310
 it becomes very uncomfortable for people 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.510
 greater 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.510
 here we have preferences 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.939
 run the configuration wizard 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.409
 that when he starts it then be a 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.950
 assistant very similar like this 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.200
 select Spanish language at the size of the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.239
 text about determined huge huge and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.909
 you see it then if as I had it 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.849
 I was in huge and how is that come 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:01.730
 huge aspect I have put dark came 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.459
 clear predetermined in clear there is 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.250
 let's go ahead let's finish the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.140
 call stories I do not know what is here 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.720

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.080
 has a button or menu I want to show the 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.750
 link of the application list for 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.260
 access if clear is the button that you have 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.480
 seen below 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.489
 keep in mind that you can upload themes and 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.950
 preferences packages so so so so 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.680
 so so 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.360
 and then the normal menu would be this 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.940
 have is pretty good that if I like it 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.099

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.549
 then it is possible to see to see to see if 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.290
 we can configure it so that it does not 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.290

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.100
 so you can see there 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.270
 there you are seeing that I'm going to 60 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.539
