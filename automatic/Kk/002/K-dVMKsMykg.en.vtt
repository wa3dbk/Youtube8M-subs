00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:09.643
Sometimes I just can't help it

00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:15.657
Your touch, your smile, your scent

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:19.285
I'm crazy for your love

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:23.008
Think I'm in love

00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:28.323
I'm in love

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:33.099
Think I'm in love Think I'm in love

00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:36.990
What did you just do to me?

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.120
I used to be normal, but where did I go?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.744
When you asked me to hold onto you

00:00:43.864 --> 00:00:48.327
I keep getting confused, spinning round and round

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:51.907
Why do you keep burning up my heart?

00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:56.608
Why do you keep preventing me from doing anything?

00:00:56.728 --> 00:01:01.812
You're driving me crazy, crazy for love

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.825
I have fallen deeply for you

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:10.321
Each day, it's getting more dangerous

00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:14.097
Think I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

00:01:14.217 --> 00:01:18.292
I don't know if you’re poison or love

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:25.425
Think I'm in love Think I'm in love Ye~

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.501
I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:33.396
I don't know if this is love or unhappiness

00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:37.565
What did you just do to me? My head hurts

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:40.962
Guess you played around a bit, you shake me up

00:01:41.082 --> 00:01:44.653
You push then pull me back, you push then pull me back

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:48.534
It hurts, I'm in love

00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:51.832
Why do you keep burning up my heart?

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:56.643
Why do you keep preventing me from doing anything?

00:01:56.763 --> 00:02:01.811
You're driving me crazy, crazy for love

00:02:03.487 --> 00:02:07.140

Each day, it's getting more dangerous

00:02:10.486 --> 00:02:14.362
Think I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:18.261
I don't know if you’re poison or love

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:25.336
Think I'm in love Think I'm in love Ye~

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:28.488
I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:33.406
I don't know if this is love or unhappiness

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.742
The more I know you, the more I fall into you

00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:40.152
As if I can catch you, when I grab it, the dream disappears

00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:46.715
It's clear that you're dangerous, I can't stop

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.799
I have fallen deeply for you

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.355

Think I'm in love Think I'm in love Ye~

00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:14.745
I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:18.226
I don't know if this is love or unhappiness

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:21.188
I can't see anything else but you

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:24.824
The more I fall for you, the more dangerous you get

00:03:24.944 --> 00:03:28.285
I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:34.163
