00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
done but when you hear six weeks may be

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.170 
done but when you hear six weeks may be
ready<00:00:46.739> before<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> end<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> season<00:00:47.760> what

does<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.300> tell<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.690> about<00:00:48.780> where<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
does that tell you about where the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
does that tell you about where the
injury<00:00:49.410> occurred<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.460> means<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.000> me<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> he

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
injury occurred it means to me that he

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.600 
injury occurred it means to me that he
has<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> broken<00:00:52.289> bone<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.800> most<00:00:53.010> likely<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
has a broken bone and most likely the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.569 
has a broken bone and most likely the
bone<00:00:53.899> fragments<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.050> separated<00:00:55.579> hairline

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
bone fragments have separated hairline

fractures<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.989> typically<00:00:58.379> heal<00:00:58.680> in

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
fractures really can typically heal in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.250 
fractures really can typically heal in
about<00:00:58.949> four<00:00:59.370> weeks<00:00:59.449> when<00:01:00.449> you're<00:01:00.570> talking<00:01:00.960> six

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
about four weeks when you're talking six

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.290 
about four weeks when you're talking six
weeks<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.770> most<00:01:01.980> commonly<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> broken<00:01:03.120> bone

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
weeks it's most commonly a broken bone

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
weeks it's most commonly a broken bone
in<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.229> fracture<00:01:04.530> fragments<00:01:04.949> have

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
in which the fracture fragments have

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.910 
in which the fracture fragments have
separated<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.150> shifted<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.590> me<00:01:07.740> means

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
separated or shifted so this to me means

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980 
separated or shifted so this to me means
that<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> significant<00:01:09.060> bony<00:01:09.330> fracture

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that he had normally in surgeries like

that he had normally in surgeries like
that<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.640> looking<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.210> terms<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that what are we looking at in terms of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.080 
that what are we looking at in terms of
how<00:02:01.320> long<00:02:01.530> he<00:02:01.649> has<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> cast<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
how long he has a cast on and the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.120 
how long he has a cast on and the
challenge<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.750> rehabbing<00:02:04.380> once<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> cast<00:02:04.979> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
challenge of rehabbing once that cast is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.499 
challenge of rehabbing once that cast is
up<00:02:05.310> particularly<00:02:05.640> at<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.880> position<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.390> he

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
up particularly at the position that he

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
up particularly at the position that he
plays<00:02:06.750> yeah<00:02:07.049> well<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> problem<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
plays yeah well that's the problem this

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.729 
plays yeah well that's the problem this
is<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> thumb<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.599> throwing<00:02:10.080> athletes<00:02:10.229> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
is the thumb of a throwing athletes and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.300 
is the thumb of a throwing athletes and
that's

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that's

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.790 
that's
the<00:02:11.430> difficulty<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.530> approximately<00:02:13.530> six

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the difficulty is approximately six

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100 
the difficulty is approximately six
weeks<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> bones<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.880> mend<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.810> then<00:02:15.990> he

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
weeks for the bones to mend but then he

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.050 
weeks for the bones to mend but then he
has<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.410> get<00:02:16.560> back<00:02:16.620> his<00:02:17.040> mobility<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.880> his

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
has to get back his mobility in his

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.300 
has to get back his mobility in his
function<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.690> his<00:02:18.810> strength<00:02:19.170> he<00:02:19.890> has<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.190> have

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
function and his strength he has to have

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.090 
function and his strength he has to have
enough<00:02:20.550> mobility<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.510> place<00:02:21.780> his<00:02:22.020> thumb<00:02:22.350> away

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
enough mobility to place his thumb away

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.980 
enough mobility to place his thumb away
from<00:02:23.340> his<00:02:23.460> hand<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.940> encircle<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.600> football

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
from his hand to encircle the football

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.110 
from his hand to encircle the football
and<00:02:25.380> then<00:02:25.740> he<00:02:25.860> has<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.130> get<00:02:26.250> back<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.700> throwing

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and then he has to get back to throwing

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.699 
and then he has to get back to throwing
without<00:02:27.240> pain<00:02:27.690> he<00:02:27.930> needs<00:02:28.110> strength

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
without pain he needs strength

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.699 
without pain he needs strength
he's<00:02:29.040> got<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.450> reestablish<00:02:30.450> his<00:02:30.959> mechanics<00:02:31.560> of

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
he's got to reestablish his mechanics of

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.190 
he's got to reestablish his mechanics of
throwing<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.670> six<00:02:33.209> weeks<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> bone<00:02:33.990> to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
throwing so six weeks for the bone to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.260 
throwing so six weeks for the bone to
heal<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:34.890> we're<00:02:35.040> probably<00:02:35.340> talking<00:02:35.820> closer

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
heal but we're probably talking closer

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.480 
heal but we're probably talking closer
to<00:02:36.510> seven<00:02:36.870> or<00:02:36.990> eight<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.380> return<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.860> play<00:02:38.070> all

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
to seven or eight for return to play all

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.830 
to seven or eight for return to play all
