 for ovens are extremely toxic

 this means taking a lot of

 risks just to keep the oven 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 clean we live in times in which to be

 ecological has become a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 fundamental need to get rid of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 all those harmful chemicals 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.239
 that we use in daily life is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.219
 mandatory for all to keep the oven 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.750
 Clean is vital for the dishes that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.789
 we cook inside leave 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.730
 delicious and the whole kitchen smells great 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.650
 the process will be divided into two parts 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 first we will clean the whole part 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.210
 inside the oven itself for later 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.750
 the window prepares what we're going to do first 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.170
 to need water bottle with spray or 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.610
 atomizer a rag a baking 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.460
 sodium vinegar a small bowl gloves 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.830
 Optional cleaning cleans first in 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.440
 the internal part of the oven removes 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.450
 oven racks mix well medium 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.090
 cup of baking soda with a little 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.159
 of water in the bowl adds little by little 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.930
 water until you get a paste for 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.270
 Easily spread on the parts of the oven 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.950
 who need cleaning as much as 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.649
 advisable is to clean the oven 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.450
 completely use the gloves to 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.149
 Protect your hands from fat or 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.679
 more dirty parts of the furnace extends the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.590
 pasta through the inside of the oven 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.810
 especially for the dirtiest areas the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.630
 Baking soda will turn colored 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.659
 brownish when you rub it let it sit 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.030
 overnight bicarbonate 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.369
 sodium needs to work at least 12 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.800
 hours continued the next day 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.959
 after letting it sit overnight 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.850
 12 hours with a damp cloth and remove 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.410
 as much dry pasta as possible 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.750
 The cleaner I leave it 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.060
 better with a little bit of vinegar and the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.830
 bottle with spray or spray and spray 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.650
 the surfaces where they will be seeing 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.870
 remains of the bicarbonate paste 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.180
 vinegar reacts with the bicarbonate and 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.880
 makes a clean foam mixture 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.950
 foamy with a damp cloth sprinkles with 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.690
 vinegar the surfaces where they will go 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.660
 seeing remains of baking soda 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.770
 until the oven is well cleaned in 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.380
 end of the oven at low temperature 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.710
 for 15 to 20 minutes to be 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.710
 dry well 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.830
 clean the window we will use the same 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.569
 baking soda and water that we have 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.110
 made to clean the inside of the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.989
 oven applies the paste in the window leaves 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.239
 rest for at least 30 minutes with 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.940
 a rag removes the bicarbonate paste 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.250
 and clean the window the final result 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.660
 it's really amazing when I 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.660
 try you will not stop using it 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.630
 clean or pollute we smell clean 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.130
