the air wave pant it is the new match

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.080 
the air wave pant it is the new match
for<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:23.869> Revit<00:00:24.230> air<00:00:24.349> wave<00:00:24.680> jacket<00:00:25.250> now<00:00:25.610> the

for the Revit air wave jacket now the
air<00:00:26.300> wave<00:00:26.540> jacket<00:00:27.080> is<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:27.200> replacement<00:00:27.560> for<00:00:27.800> the

Revit air jacket the air wave pants

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.330 
Revit air jacket the air wave pants
match<00:00:29.990> it<00:00:30.170> perfectly<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:30.949> there<00:00:31.250> are<00:00:31.310> a

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
match it perfectly and there are a

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.830 
match it perfectly and there are a
replacement<00:00:31.699> for<00:00:32.029> what<00:00:32.180> we<00:00:32.300> could<00:00:32.419> Center<00:00:32.720> the

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
replacement for what we could Center the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.080 
replacement for what we could Center the
rotor<00:00:33.110> pant<00:00:33.470> it's<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:34.010> single<00:00:34.400> season<00:00:34.610> actually

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
rotor pant it's a single season actually

rotor pant it's a single season actually
you<00:00:35.150> know<00:00:35.239> what<00:00:35.330> I'm<00:00:35.449> going<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.629> refine<00:00:35.960> that

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
you know what I'm going to refine that

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.229 
you know what I'm going to refine that
I'd<00:00:36.470> say<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:36.830> about<00:00:36.890> a<00:00:37.010> two<00:00:37.250> season<00:00:37.489> pant<00:00:37.850> so

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
I'd say it's about a two season pant so

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.790 
I'd say it's about a two season pant so
it's<00:00:38.390> going<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:38.570> work<00:00:38.720> beautifully<00:00:39.110> well<00:00:39.590> with

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
it's going to work beautifully well with

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.170 
it's going to work beautifully well with
the<00:00:39.920> amount<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:40.250> mesh<00:00:40.519> that<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:40.730> see<00:00:41.000> in

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
the amount of mesh that you see in

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.270 
the amount of mesh that you see in
summertime<00:00:42.050> riding<00:00:42.440> conditions<00:00:42.590> you'll

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
summertime riding conditions you'll

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.740 
summertime riding conditions you'll
probably<00:00:43.580> get<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.090> latter<00:00:44.300> half<00:00:44.570> of<00:00:44.629> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
probably get the latter half of the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.420 
probably get the latter half of the
spring<00:00:45.019> and<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.320> early<00:00:45.649> fall<00:00:45.890> depending<00:00:46.100> on

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
spring and the early fall depending on

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.040 
spring and the early fall depending on
your<00:00:46.520> temperature<00:00:46.940> tolerance<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.480> depending

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
your temperature tolerance and depending

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.360 
your temperature tolerance and depending
on<00:00:48.110> what<00:00:48.320> base<00:00:48.500> or<00:00:48.710> mid<00:00:48.860> layers<00:00:49.040> you<00:00:49.219> wear

on what base or mid layers you wear

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.010 
on what base or mid layers you wear
underneath<00:00:49.640> there<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.329> no<00:00:50.480> liner<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.899> this

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
underneath there is no liner to this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.290 
underneath there is no liner to this

construction<00:00:53.540> with<00:00:54.290> you<00:00:54.530> can<00:00:54.649> see<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.890> silver

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
construction with you can see the silver

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.670 
construction with you can see the silver
are<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.879> new<00:00:56.090> style<00:00:56.420> air<00:00:56.600> wave<00:00:56.870> mesh<00:00:57.200> panels

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
are the new style air wave mesh panels

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.440 
are the new style air wave mesh panels
they're<00:00:58.010> going<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.190> flow<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:58.370> ton<00:00:58.700> of<00:00:58.730> air<00:00:59.090> and

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
they're going to flow a ton of air and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.850 
they're going to flow a ton of air and
actually<00:00:59.899> in<00:00:59.989> my<00:01:00.140> opinion<00:01:00.469> there's<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.680> black

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
actually in my opinion there's a black

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.709 
actually in my opinion there's a black
version<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.489> anthracite<00:01:02.030> silver<00:01:02.390> which

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
version and this anthracite silver which

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.109 
version and this anthracite silver which
has<00:01:02.899> a<00:01:02.930> really<00:01:03.350> nice<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:04.190> know<00:01:04.309> sport<00:01:04.729> touring

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
but they put it on the inside of the leg

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.009 
but they put it on the inside of the leg
and<00:02:08.929> what<00:02:09.079> that<00:02:09.259> does<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:10.329> it's<00:02:11.329> a<00:02:11.480> preference

thing<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.799> our<00:02:12.920> opinion<00:02:13.070> it's<00:02:13.579> a<00:02:13.670> safer

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
thing but in our opinion it's a safer

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.940 
thing but in our opinion it's a safer
garment<00:02:14.630> because<00:02:14.750> you're<00:02:15.019> taking<00:02:15.170> an<00:02:15.530> area<00:02:15.860> of

garment because you're taking an area of
weakness<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.820> seam<00:02:17.120> because<00:02:17.450> zippers<00:02:17.900> can

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
weakness and a seam because zippers can

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.750 
weakness and a seam because zippers can
explode<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.590> you're<00:02:18.920> moving<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.310> away<00:02:19.400> from
