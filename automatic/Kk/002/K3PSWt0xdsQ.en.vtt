would get the positive material on the
men's<00:03:47.930> size<00:03:48.140> this<00:03:48.830> actually<00:03:49.640> feels<00:03:49.880> like

almost<00:03:50.330> like<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.810> leather<00:03:51.230> but<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.040> still<00:03:52.250> gives

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
almost like a leather but it still gives

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.280 
almost like a leather but it still gives
you<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:52.820> it's<00:03:53.030> still<00:03:53.239> shiny<00:03:53.570> it's<00:03:54.110> still

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290

like a almost like a shiny silver not
too<00:03:56.510> shiny<00:03:56.720> like<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.080> said<00:03:57.320> but<00:03:57.590> it's<00:03:57.709> still

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
too shiny like I said but it's still

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.190 
too shiny like I said but it's still
like<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.100> shiny<00:03:58.459> silver<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.690> upper<00:04:00.019> there

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
like a shiny silver on the upper there

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.690 
like a shiny silver on the upper there
where<00:04:00.440> normally<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:01.040> would<00:04:01.190> get<00:04:01.310> positive

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
where normally you would get positive

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.330 
where normally you would get positive
material<00:04:01.850> on<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.299> mid<00:04:02.510> size<00:04:02.750> so<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.860> that<00:04:04.190> is

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
material on the mid size so and that is

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
material on the mid size so and that is
that<00:04:04.640> is<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.209> same<00:04:05.450> on<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.900> 7<00:04:06.320> and<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.769> 3<00:04:07.360> so

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
that is the same on the 7 and the 3 so

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.150 
that is the same on the 7 and the 3 so
those<00:04:08.630> are<00:04:08.840> some<00:04:08.959> differences<00:04:09.440> between<00:04:09.500> a

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
those are some differences between a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.710 
those are some differences between a
