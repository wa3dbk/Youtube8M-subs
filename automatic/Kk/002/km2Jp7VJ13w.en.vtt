is that after we speak at length about a
student's<00:02:38.510> piece<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.500> ask<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.610> student<00:02:41.090> if

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150

there's<00:02:41.330> anything<00:02:41.629> they<00:02:41.930> did<00:02:42.140> not<00:02:42.349> get<00:02:42.680> from
