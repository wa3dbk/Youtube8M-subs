know about the Astro tech ax 30 is that
there<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.200> hybrid<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.920> am<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.549> sense<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
there are a hybrid I am in a sense that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.969 
there are a hybrid I am in a sense that
they<00:01:09.600> incorporate<00:01:10.110> balanced<00:01:10.530> armature

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
they incorporate balanced armature

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.940 
they incorporate balanced armature
drivers<00:01:11.189> along<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.360> dynamic<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
drivers along with a dynamic one that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.609 
drivers along with a dynamic one that
could<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.570> good<00:01:15.570> depending<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
could be good depending on what it is
