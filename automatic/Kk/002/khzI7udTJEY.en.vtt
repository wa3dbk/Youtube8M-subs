sitting inside the main one what this

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.170 
sitting inside the main one what this
means<00:05:05.360> is<00:05:05.660> that<00:05:05.690> 2.0<00:05:06.530> is<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.040> only<00:05:07.280> orchestral

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
means is that 2.0 is the only orchestral
