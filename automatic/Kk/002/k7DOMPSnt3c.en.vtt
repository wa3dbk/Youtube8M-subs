00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Now, nail disease pro 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.569
 by itself this is sick nail 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.820
 often it is a symptom of common 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.420
 diseases remember agate kristi she 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.250
 described 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.910
 gray nails as in symptoms of poisoning 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 arsenic her mercury therefore options 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 very, very much here you are in the front row 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.289
 distributed the club and those who wish 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.170
 examine their nails 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.430
 onigiri waited for the start of the transfer because 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.800
 that but for this it is not normal 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.529
 ok i'm probably professionally on 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.380
 it will not answer that is specifically 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.380
 a trained doctor inside his guest irina 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.110
 because we start with a review or 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:51.320
 Immediately from the patient is not easy from the patient 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:54.110
 where is he patient of svetlana smirnova 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.489
 1 1 but it tells 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.329
 show here thin and brittle nails 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.570
 impossible to do a manicure 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.920
 because no varnish holds and in 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.080
 principle, together with the nails all 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.750
 falls off you can ask a question 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.360
 Svetlana long ago you have such problems with 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.220
 nails after giving birth on 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.810
 say that svetlana's nails are of course very 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 well- groomed ie with such 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.729
 brittleness of the corner you can see that there is 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.030
 tendency to bundle let's so 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.190
 the task given your nails let's see 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.470
 we will give an overview and your problem modify 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.710
 there its at the end let's we start with 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.080
 reasons because the reason may be 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.119
 viruses and bacteria and fungi are standard 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.220
 what often happens but behind this often 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.020
 lies and the tumor and not only 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.689
 benign and it could be 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.579
 carcinoma and cancer may be more formidable 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.770
 melanoma tumor everyone heard about her 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.049
 classic nail damage 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.549
 quarreling and some drugs too 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.000
 may cause certain changes 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.640
 nail me as a therapist interested 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.970
 manifestation of nails as a manifestation 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.369
 systemic diseases so here we are sometimes 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.399
 see the nails like that and he and 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.920
 called yellow nail syndrome it 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.620
 It seems to someone smoked fingers for 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.950
 this lies in lung disease sinusitis 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.090
 lymphedema and is simply hereditary 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.340
 predisposed drumsticks 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.110
 look you probably have it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.209
 can not say anything through 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.920
 it really got nails but 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.019
 when we went through tv syndrome institute 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.180
 we are all fond of paired fingers 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.920
 each other playing nokia drum sticks 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.870
 we had one really guy 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.470
 warriors healthy but he had sticks 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.690
 here we are from here because of us 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.459
 it can be like nothing 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.299
 Naturally about the convention of drop and 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.950
 pulmonary heart disease cirrhosis 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.109
 intestinal inflammation diseases of the stomach 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.290
 thyroid disease requests 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.480
 exactly half interesting half 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.239
 from translation from english so there so 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.680
 Tarasov and is called this typically 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:09.299
 for kidney disease and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.129
 logically at heart even difficult here 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.409
 there is not very visible on the screen as nails 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.890
 spoons it is real spoons they are concave 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.900
 inside 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.000
 This is a classic look to this consequence of what 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.790
 this with iron deficiency is often possible 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.040
 see how the nails split it too 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.590
 can with a lack of iron can with 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.120
 thyroid disease doctor 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.790
 come here spike to tell what will happen on 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.790
 the screen is interesting 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.519
 this is something that probably relates more to 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.709
 we have a cardiologist when this 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.720
 cross bar often in people 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.410
 who lead a heart attack or stroke during 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.110
 time of cardiovascular accidents and 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.970
 nail growth stops then him 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.700
 lucky he would survive the genus on his nails 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.430
 went to grow can be transferred very often 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.010
 That's the kind of thing the doctors confuse fungi and 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.380
 Facebook is ready for the patient to go 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.510
 tests nothing later 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.489
 all this cpa is worth a good cardiologist 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.099
 knows that in three or four months it is 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.980
 will leave and makes no problems out 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.690
 of that struck that point on the heart 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.670
 thing for heart on first 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:18.310
 next classic nail lesion all 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.799
 lose that is if there were such 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.340
 poured on the nails should immediately go to 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.020
 to the doctor 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.200
 because most often it happens 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.389
 manifest nothing but nothing anywhere 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.430
 never appear nails are affected and 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.090
 the patient, for example, is worried about pain 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.490
 joints 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.919
 then the doctor will certainly say before the start 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.280
 psoriasis will do research understand 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.940
 here 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.889
 this is melanoma here it is 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.350
 probably people of a dark man like 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.740
 minimum but basically it could be three 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.440
 things it can be a fungus it can 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.380
 but be so plural of you but it 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.650
 just like melanoma, itâ€™s rather 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.930
 all because of the roller does not touch 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.090
 lead apples from someone and you will see 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.940
 sometime under the black spot 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.360
 dark spot or white like here with 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.750
 transition to the roller in most cases 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.520
 can be said that the forecast is not very 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.580
 favorable but I understand that with 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:24.710
 pictures all someone know themselves rather 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:27.500
 their nails no yes and thank God behavior 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.930
 doctor that there is nothing special or 5 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.520
 nameplate 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.380
 Still, I would still plate 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.060
 it looked like everything talked about 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.190
 thyroid disease and annoyance 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.410
 iron so you need to check where 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.180
 not just iron it's me still in and says 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.270
 it is iron reserves checked 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.060
 transferrin and thyroid hormones 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.130
 here these two things do if there or 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.680
 there to detect and pathology i think 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.630
 iron deficiency you will then i 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.000
 you are dirty about inheritance 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.840
 iron but then we have a reason 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.780
 see as an example of how theoretical 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.820
 knowledge helped at least one person 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.450
 the rest I understand Novki healthy 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.450
 Well, thank God 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.320
 so that the rest of the body you were also 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.020
 great how are your nails and your nails 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.950
 always showed great condition 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.950
 your health
