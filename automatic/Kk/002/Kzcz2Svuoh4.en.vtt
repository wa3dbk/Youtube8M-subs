00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.150
 hey people what's going on here is again 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.619
 curious are welcome to 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.449
 another episode of the black ops 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.789
 tips and tricks in today's episode 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.189
 I compare for you the 1 94 and 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.470
 this khd n94 will be very difficult three 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.689
 switched namely only from level 55 so 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.430
 the last level the sgh will too 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.210
 Released relatively late namely 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.460
 level 40 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.590
 in my estimation, the 194th 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.600
 used quite often while the sgh 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.010
 actually hardly used and therefore 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.610
 I was interested in which of the two 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.920
 Weapons actually better is so come 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.199
 Now we are to precision so the 1 490 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.760
 but you're pretty precise from that 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.690
 not the most accurate one for now either 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.840
 I have ever seen 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.579
 This is something compared to 1 490 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.680
 not much more precise but something 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.690
 she moves less up and for that 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.210
 a little more to the side but altogether 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.010
 better off the hip are both weapons 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.440
 like all storm rifles actually very much 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.670
 imprecise 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.500
 So now we come to the comparison table 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.970
 the firing rate is with both weapons 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.560
 Glide, however, I still have to 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.960
 say that the first two shots of the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.360
 14 90 celebrated with 900 shot per minute 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.820
 and then the firing rate could be 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.470
 then 600 rounds per minute is this 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.240
 Two shots do not bring so much now 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.290
 because the first two shots mostly eh 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.420
 not to be met 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.730
 Precision is good for both 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.010
 but it's a little better already 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.600
 then loading time is the 1 94 pretty 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.760
 funny, she has a reload 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.470
 time to 2 3 9 seconds at one 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.810
 magazine which is not completely empty yet 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.000
 that with good and one after charging 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.380
 from 3,12 seconds at a complete 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.510
 empty magazine and that is again 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.310
 bad so you should take care that 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.140
 she does not empty the magazine shoots the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.730
 sgh are both better 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.250
 namely as a reload time from 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.200
 2 34 seconds to come magazine what else 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.630
 not completely empty and a share 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.400
 from 29 5 seconds when completely empty 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.990
 magazine so now we come to the well 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.100
 main point of the two namely the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.830
 they are hurting 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.960
 Specializing in the damage of one 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.270
 for 90 is relatively high namely 40 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.770
 percent in 24 percent though that is 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.500
 no better than the offices and the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.470
 For example, before the council of 720 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.510
 is and yes so that's good now 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.330
 not so perfect i had a something 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.900
 higher harm namely 45 percent 24 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.300
 percent 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 and also a higher range that 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.780
 means that the three shot within reach 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.230
 for example, at the sga has clear 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.080
 higher 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.390
 at the 194 the magazine biggest parties 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.920
 equal to 30 shot as mine 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.290
 conclusion is that this year already 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.090
 much better than 490 years 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.280
 surprised me because many also for 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.220
 those taken at 94 at prestigious turks 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.930
 but actually the a94 has no 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.849
 point in which she is clearly superior 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.290
 be the margin higher harm a 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.360
 higher range and higher 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.010
 has precision and therefore I would you 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.690
 mostly recommend with the skat too 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.769
 play so that's it for today 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.769
 video 30
