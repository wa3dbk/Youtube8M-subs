00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.019
 fifth part of our finity photo 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 tutorials and I have a picture here 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.120
 from my last holiday inserted in 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 the program and the level here 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.630
 I 'll take this lock 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.650
 away so I just too 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.170
 can edit 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.609
 and you can still look at these pictures 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.820
 make some improvements 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.800
 First of all you have up here 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.150
 automatic correction filter for 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.369
 example I can do an automatic here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.550
 make tonal correction when I do that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.440
 then you hardly see the change 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.059
 because the iphones and with the iphone is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.649
 this picture has been done pretty well 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.960
 make good shots but you have 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.870
 seen few colors were a bit darker 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 we can do that again here 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.070
 automatic contrast correction 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.480
 So there are only small ones here 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.100
 corrections also the color correction 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 we can still apply 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.899
 a little more careful I would be with 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.340
 the automatic white balance for you 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.079
 can look now if I have the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.110
 User what happens we have one 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.360
 relatively yellowish tone in there indeed 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.850
 This is also the best of the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.880
 mood on the spot was but the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.950
 white balance just needs a white 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.330
 Worth and if we have this cloth here 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.580
 then he has the right to know 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.159
 but that was more like a storm 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 So to the white balance we can in 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.810
 another tutorial something again 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.430
 do 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.540
 I take that back again 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 step with command z again 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.070
 I would recommend you 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 only these three filters first on 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.439
 choose and with the automatic 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.850
 white balance something to be careful so 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.229
 then we can do more 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 make improvements if we times 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.189
 then click on the clip below 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.960
 also new levels of adjustment and if I am 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.310
 then click on it, for example on 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 brightness and contrast 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.509
 then you will see a level over here 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.310
 is added to the picture and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.110
 in fact I can now here 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.369
 I change the brightness of the picture 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.530
 I have to take care of that a little bit 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.149
 that I do not do that too much but 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 I can still see some of the picture here 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.189
 bring out and the picture shows brighter 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 then you can do it yourself 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.130
 to adjust 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.899
 the beautiful is when we have this one 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.459
 Click away effect again then we can 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.810
 I turn off at the same level 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.849
 turn off and then you will see that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.330
 original image and now the improved 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.740
 and it is 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.200
 a significant improvement too 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.720
 but the beautiful is just 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.610
 that these levels are quasi produced 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.780
 on which these filters are located and the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.930
 So you can go back anytime 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.750
 switch off and thus the picture very nice 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.160
 I influence according to his wishes 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.420
 show you something else and you 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.980
 You can try it yourself under 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.650
 the flat there are lots of 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.910
 different filters you can see this here 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.900
 just a little bit 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.760
 play around 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.650
 they are really exciting 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.570
 Sometimes stories can be told too 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.130
 the pictures with it we very much adjust 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.560
 Can on some of these things later 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.730
 I'll go back too, but I want to 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.950
 Show you something else, namely 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.900
 here are live filter levels and there are 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.670
 even more exciting things here 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.459
 for example, there is one here 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.900
 TiefenunschÃ¤rfe the chance to times 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.120
 I click on it then you see 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.860
 here a white price and I can 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.580
 manipulate with these touches here 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.920
 I can make it an ellipse, for example 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.840
 and the iphone camera you do not have 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.580
 really a depth of field in it 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.490
 So what is in the background here 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.550
 this is just as sharp as the barrel in the 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.180
 the reason is that 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.590
 Mirror-reflex cameras, for example, not 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.900
 they have such a deep blur in it 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.610
 and thus the pictures always work 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.200
 I would be a little fancier 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.180
 say now and that can but here 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.769
 catch up with this filter 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.660
 apply and below in these 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.459
 settings increase the radius and you 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.769
 Look any strength here must be 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.090
 a little bit high it starts that the 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.470
 background if you look a bit 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.760
 otherwise we can not go overboard 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.830
 So you can still really see here 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.209
 nothing counts down a bit 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.760
 that maybe we will see that then 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.790
 can and you're pretty much here 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.870
 to choose big value 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.459
 Now I also know it does not work 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.110
 i have the deep filter namely 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.420
 actually set on the effect so 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.739
 that will not work and you 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.390
 See if I open this up 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.860
 So I see, I have a depth of field 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.180
 put on a filter and that 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.290
 naturally stupid are that you can do 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.570
 I do not need that because of that 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.430
 this level here and the 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.950
 depth of field filter I'm doing here 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.970
 out there trying nothing to look for 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.769
 Of course we will be here on the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.080
 background so choose that always 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.670
 important to select the level on the 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.840
 should be held and the effect 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.070
 now have the background level and 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.010
 Now here we go again to the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.780
 level live filter level and get us 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.800
 the depth of focus here again purely 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.659
 and I have to do it all again 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.580
 So here is an ellipse times 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.349
 on it move the whole effect here 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.360
 a bit in this direction and 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.370
 now if we change the radius and 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.900
 hopefully see something and you see 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.879
 how it starts and creates here 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.409
 it's going to be slow here so so 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.270
 The sheep area is here in the 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.039
 center point and runs backwards 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.389
 the picture out of focus I can do that 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.430
 but sometimes not exaggerating 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.430
 Now a little and click that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.590
 directly to the side or confirm the 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.860
 filter times and you see what effect 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.599
 arises arises the edges are now 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.639
 out of focus and I can with this effect 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.569
 and you see that is below the level of me 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.520
 So you can always do it again 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.710
 select and manipulate 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.509
 I have to click on this icon here 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.370
 not on the idea but on it 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.870
 it was double click and then I can 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.849
 can not manipulate the 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.650
 of course to any point 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.710
 I can put that in size 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.139
 change in a kind of ibsen 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.569
 For example, you can use the 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.860
 focus on the areas that set me 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.360
 So, if I'm in here, it's important 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.849
 this area in focus and the 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.240
 guide the observer with his gaze 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.740
 want 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.509
 then I put this in this plane 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.880
 We can also go here 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.430
 So how fast should that determine 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.199
 I can run out the back 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.909
 small very small area then take 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.069
 you just see it down there the area 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.750
 sharply drawn so it really can 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.969
 nice to play around with and which is effect 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.729
 but very nice because you just this 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:49.029
 blur the SLR cameras have 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.380
 subsequently can bring in so that you 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.500
 can you look under the levels 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.159
 you will find many others here 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.650
 effects so there really is 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:01.779
 a few other things with them 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.750
 some should just play around 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:06.699
 things are a bit funny 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.779
 such as objective distortions 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.610
 then maybe you will see it first 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.849
 nothing at all but here you can do such a thing 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.469
 bullseye effect this on pictures 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.349
 It does not look really nice to apply 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.599
 That's what he is when you have small details 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.729
 Edit times, for example, wants to 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:24.279
 If you want to make something bigger then you can 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.840
 you can apply such effects 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.759
 he does not want to vote for that and that's why 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.930
 we also leave them here and we 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.849
 I could look again 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.259
 here are a few other effects 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.039
 I'll see if I can do that now 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.560
 find here 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.100
 there is still somewhere 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.150
 I do not realize that right now 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.130
 sometimes you have to be here too 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.830
 looking for a bit to find this yourself 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.530
 but I do not find him then I will 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.100
 that in the other tutorial edit the 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.050
 we have to do a little bit too 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.820
 prepare for the whole but I gave 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.220
 there was a distortion filter with the 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.340
 I can forgive these pictures I find 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.450
 but not him at the moment is still one 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.460
 bit hidden in this whole 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.290
 program but I recommend you here 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.300
 is through the same with these two 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.660
 to play around with them so they are 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.190
 really impressive and 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.620
 possible great effects in your photos 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.419
 and you will be with many of these effects 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.220
 Here is really the last of their 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.930
 can take pictures and remember 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.729
 you can contact her anytime here with the 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.320
 the list back to the beginning 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.520
 and now you see that was mine 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.950
 original pictures if I am now 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.020
 to the very bottom is how guilty that 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.790
 could rescue and adapt roof 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.990
 that should be the fifth part 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.790
 have been many thanks for your 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.160
 Great comments I 'll try my best 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.960
 courses that we always continue 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.270
 There is no end to it 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.550
 not planned any of the courses 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.260
 such a final cut or is the photo 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.770
 or find your designer is phasing out 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.960
 allow 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.370
 because whenever an update comes, there is 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 also probably new features and 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.030
 always then we also want to 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.470
 always come in when I do new things 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.450
 I would like to introduce you to her 

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.380
 That's why these parts actually become 

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.000
 always continued 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.500
 Unfortunately, I can not tell you when 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.940
 they continue because that depends 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.229
 a little bit from when I got something 

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.760
 I learned something new when I got something new 

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.380
 have worked out for myself and 

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.700
 maybe when new features in the 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.020
 program for disposal so make a 

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.820
 have a little patience and so you 

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.840
 I do not miss anything 

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.970
 to subscribe to 

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.430
 then you are always up to date 

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.910
 stood by what we show here and 

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.650
 show 

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.690
 I wish you continued fun with it 

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.669
 woven and thanks again to the 

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:21.150
