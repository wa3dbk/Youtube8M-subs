feeling like we know we're getting more

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.160 
feeling like we know we're getting more
energized<00:01:10.250> that's<00:01:11.180> full<00:01:11.420> level<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:11.840> next<00:01:12.080> when

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
energized that's full level so next when

I<00:01:12.200> press<00:01:12.470> these<00:01:12.619> 16<00:01:13.100> levels<00:01:13.280> button<00:01:13.729> right

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
I press these 16 levels button right

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.840 
I press these 16 levels button right
here<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.299> now

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
here and now

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.469 
here and now
last<00:01:16.850> drum<00:01:17.060> semi-hit<00:01:17.540> I<00:01:19.210> piss<00:01:20.210> on<00:01:20.240> all<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
last drum semi-hit I piss on all the

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.980 
last drum semi-hit I piss on all the
pads<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:21.490> little<00:01:22.490> bit<00:01:22.580> more<00:01:22.790> here<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.869> we'll

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
pads a little bit more here and we'll

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.190 
pads a little bit more here and we'll
show<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.170> more<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.710> here<00:01:25.400> at<00:01:25.549> 16<00:01:25.909> levels

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
show you more of it here at 16 levels

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.810 
show you more of it here at 16 levels
this<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.500> softest<00:01:27.979> sound<00:01:28.189> it's<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.640> last

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
this is the softest sound it's the last

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.370 
this is the softest sound it's the last
one

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
one

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:48.370 
one
so<00:01:33.909> about<00:01:34.909> 16<00:01:35.329> levels<00:01:35.479> now<00:01:47.079> it's<00:01:48.079> on<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.229> same

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
so about 16 levels now it's on the same

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.740 
so about 16 levels now it's on the same
pretty<00:01:48.560> much<00:01:48.619> right<00:01:48.860> let's<00:01:49.640> go<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:49.909> sound<00:01:50.240> is

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
pretty much right let's go that sound is

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.270 
pretty much right let's go that sound is
this<00:01:50.869> one<00:01:51.110> level<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.799> got<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.009> be<00:01:52.070> aware<00:01:52.130> of

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
this one level so you got to be aware of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.370 
this one level so you got to be aware of
it<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.880> may<00:01:53.000> hit<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.180> sound<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.079> want<00:01:54.290> to

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
it you may hit a sound and you want to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.620 
it you may hit a sound and you want to
be<00:01:54.439> 16<00:01:54.770> levels<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.579> that<00:01:55.759> sound<00:01:56.119> may<00:01:56.270> have<00:01:56.420> no

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
be 16 levels but that sound may have no

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.870 
be 16 levels but that sound may have no
levels<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.049> me<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.259> one<00:01:57.590> sample<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.369> there's

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
levels to me this one sample and there's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.480 
levels to me this one sample and there's
no<00:01:59.030> actual<00:01:59.450> way<00:01:59.869> to<00:02:00.170> provide<00:02:00.680> dynamics<00:02:01.219> to<00:02:01.369> or

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
no actual way to provide dynamics to or

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.249 
no actual way to provide dynamics to or
through<00:02:01.640> MIDI<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.719> it's<00:02:02.840> important<00:02:03.229> to

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
through MIDI and it's important to

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.510 
through MIDI and it's important to
realize<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.500> with<00:02:03.829> some<00:02:04.009> sounds<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.399> may

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
realize that with some sounds you may

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.730 
realize that with some sounds you may
have<00:02:04.759> in<00:02:04.909> your<00:02:05.000> system<00:02:05.240> set<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.810> way<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.590> I'll

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
have in your system set that way so I'll

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.560 
have in your system set that way so I'll
be<00:02:06.950> sure<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.280> understand<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:07.939> as<00:02:08.090> well<00:02:08.239> also

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
be sure to understand that as well also

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.839 
be sure to understand that as well also
so<00:02:09.290> that's<00:02:09.350> 16<00:02:09.829> levels<00:02:10.040> now<00:02:10.310> before<00:02:10.579> I<00:02:10.610> showed

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
so that's 16 levels now before I showed

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.630 
so that's 16 levels now before I showed
you<00:02:10.970> full<00:02:11.180> level<00:02:11.540> before

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.080 

that's<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> sound<00:02:16.000> go<00:02:16.150> here<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:18.280> much<00:02:18.580> liar<00:02:18.850> at

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
that's a sound go here it's much liar at

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.330 
that's a sound go here it's much liar at
full<00:02:19.420> level<00:02:19.870> without<00:02:20.500> full<00:02:20.680> lil<00:02:20.770> erotic<00:02:21.040> with

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
full level without full lil erotic with

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.210 
full level without full lil erotic with
willful<00:02:21.670> level<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:21.970> slaughter<00:02:22.240> without<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:23.220> it

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
willful level of slaughter without it it

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.430 
willful level of slaughter without it it
is<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.520> that's<00:02:25.330> important<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.110> realize<00:02:26.410> that

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
is it that's important to realize that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.190 
is it that's important to realize that
too<00:02:26.800> that's<00:02:27.340> how<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:27.940> use<00:02:28.120> full<00:02:28.420> level<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.840> 16

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
too that's how you use full level and 16

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.380 
too that's how you use full level and 16
level<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.680> our<00:02:30.070> MPD<00:02:30.700> 32

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.390 

so<00:02:35.930> I'm<00:02:36.050> gonna<00:02:36.140> communicate<00:02:36.590> with<00:02:36.770> my<00:02:36.950> reason

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
so I'm gonna communicate with my reason

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.580 
so I'm gonna communicate with my reason
software<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:37.910> set<00:02:38.090> up<00:02:38.120> two<00:02:38.300> MIDI<00:02:38.510> here<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.050> can<00:02:39.500> go

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
that's what six back there so I can

are control numbers the control numbers

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.699 
are control numbers the control numbers
correspond<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.750> control<00:03:42.170> numbers<00:03:42.470> for

correspond to control numbers for

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.920 
correspond to control numbers for
reasons<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.970> that's<00:03:44.060> why<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.209> have<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.390> preset

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
reasons and that's why I have the preset

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.259 
reasons and that's why I have the preset
the<00:03:45.380> preset<00:03:45.860> has<00:03:45.980> all<00:03:46.250> these<00:03:46.430> control<00:03:46.940> numbers

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
the preset has all these control numbers

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.850 
the preset has all these control numbers
that<00:03:47.360> correspond<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.650> certain<00:03:49.780> devices

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
that correspond to the certain devices

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.470 
that correspond to the certain devices
within<00:03:51.860> reasons<00:03:52.459> for<00:03:52.610> example<00:03:53.090> this<00:03:53.239> is<00:03:53.390> the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
within reasons for example this is the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.600 
within reasons for example this is the
mixer<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:54.320> your<00:03:54.470> faders<00:03:55.010> correspond<00:03:55.519> to

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
mixer and so your faders correspond to

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.900 
mixer and so your faders correspond to
the<00:03:55.730> mixer<00:03:56.060> now<00:03:56.239> if<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.810> go<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:56.989> Bank<00:03:57.910> control

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
the mixer now if I go to Bank control

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.320 
the mixer now if I go to Bank control
Bank<00:03:59.180> B<00:04:00.280> now<00:04:01.280> I<00:04:01.310> have<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.640> rest<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.090> favor

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
Bank B now I have the rest of the favor

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.000 
Bank B now I have the rest of the favor
see<00:04:02.570> this<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:03.430> can<00:04:04.430> control<00:04:04.700> those<00:04:04.850> as<00:04:05.030> well<00:04:06.010> I'm

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
see this I can control those as well I'm

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.960 
see this I can control those as well I'm
stirring<00:04:07.190> something<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.640> would<00:04:07.730> have<00:04:07.850> to

not a fader one actually I'm gonna go to

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.550 
not a fader one actually I'm gonna go to

now here's my control change I'm gonna

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.150 
now here's my control change I'm gonna
go<00:04:17.840> ahead<00:04:17.900> after<00:04:18.169> touch<00:04:18.500> plus<00:04:18.680> after<00:04:18.979> touch

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
go ahead after touch plus after touch

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.849 
go ahead after touch plus after touch
now<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.090> after<00:04:20.209> touch<00:04:20.510> I'm<00:04:21.080> gonna<00:04:21.380> set<00:04:21.680> this

now and after touch I'm gonna set this

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.030 
now and after touch I'm gonna set this
up<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.370> say<00:04:22.640> B<00:04:24.430> 39<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.990> make<00:04:27.229> this<00:04:27.470> come<00:04:27.830> down

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
up to say B 39 and make this come down

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.350 
up to say B 39 and make this come down
to<00:04:28.190> about<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.370> hundred<00:04:31.060> now<00:04:32.260> I'll<00:04:33.260> answer<00:04:33.500> that

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
to about a hundred now I'll answer that

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.190 
to about a hundred now I'll answer that
and<00:04:35.360> we'll<00:04:35.479> see<00:04:35.570> how<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.750> works<00:04:35.930> would<00:04:36.140> be

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
and we'll see how that works would be

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.770 
and we'll see how that works would be
fader<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:37.100> now<00:04:37.810> I'm<00:04:38.810> gonna<00:04:39.020> set<00:04:39.260> my<00:04:40.780> after

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
fader so now I'm gonna set my after

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.760 
fader so now I'm gonna set my after
touch<00:04:42.610> for<00:04:43.610> specific<00:04:44.270> parameters<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.530> now

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
touch for specific parameters and now

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
end see it comes here and stops so you

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.180 
end see it comes here and stops so you
gotta<00:05:01.599> realize<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:02.020> when<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:02.680> are<00:05:02.710> setting

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
gotta realize that when you are setting

gotta realize that when you are setting
your<00:05:03.250> parameters<00:05:03.819> be<00:05:04.000> careful<00:05:04.710> some<00:05:05.710> won't

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
your parameters be careful some won't

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.100 
your parameters be careful some won't
move<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:06.699> got<00:05:06.819> to<00:05:06.849> know<00:05:07.000> what<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.539> after<00:05:07.930> touch

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
move so got to know what the after touch

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.950 
move so got to know what the after touch
will<00:05:08.289> do<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.650> fader<00:05:09.009> or<00:05:10.000> what<00:05:10.509> will<00:05:10.599> do<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:10.930> a
