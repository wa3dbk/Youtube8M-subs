this is what tapioca looks like and the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.060 
this is what tapioca looks like and the
base<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> root<00:00:21.570> system<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.199> lot<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.769> fine

many different things to it but that's
the<00:00:34.680> tapioca<00:00:35.390> plant<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.550> carefully

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the tapioca plant and you can carefully

dig down there extract those tubers and
still<00:00:43.980> leave<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.190> plant<00:00:44.520> alive<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.390> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
still leave the plant alive because you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.790 
still leave the plant alive because you
leave<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.050> rest<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.289> its<00:00:46.440> root<00:00:46.739> system

leave all the rest of its root system

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.590 
leave all the rest of its root system
intact<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:49.520> this<00:00:50.520> loses<00:00:50.850> its<00:00:51.000> leaves<00:00:51.239> here

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
intact and this loses its leaves here

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
intact and this loses its leaves here
during<00:00:52.500> winter<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> doesn't<00:00:53.610> like

plant there's enough to supply your
mineral<00:01:15.150> needs<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.170> day<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.939> don't<00:01:18.540> know

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
mineral needs for a day so I don't know

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.030 
mineral needs for a day so I don't know
if<00:01:18.780> that's<00:01:18.930> true<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
this plant is very mineral richness so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.850 
this plant is very mineral richness so
it's<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.600> one<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> ones<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.590> use

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
nourishment it's called dandelion and so

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450 
nourishment it's called dandelion and so
that's<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> look<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.250> something

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so here we have a dandelion plant and if

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
non-heme that's plan sources of iron but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.250 
non-heme that's plan sources of iron but
you<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.930> always<00:02:34.109> combine<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.560> with<00:02:36.260> other

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
you can always combine it with other

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.839 
you can always combine it with other
fruits<00:02:37.769> as<00:02:37.950> well<00:02:38.689> so<00:02:40.549> excellent<00:02:41.549> source<00:02:41.730> of

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
fruits as well so excellent source of

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.550 
fruits as well so excellent source of
iron<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.209> contains<00:02:42.540> chromium<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.290> also<00:02:43.439> a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
iron it contains chromium it's also a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.039 
iron it contains chromium it's also a
source<00:02:43.829> of<00:02:43.950> selenium<00:02:44.459> your<00:02:45.239> anti-cancer

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
source of selenium your anti-cancer

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.009 
source of selenium your anti-cancer
antioxidant<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:48.090> also<00:02:48.209> contains<00:02:48.629> your<00:02:48.780> normal

mineral sodium potassium calcium

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.559 
mineral sodium potassium calcium
magnesium<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.940> think<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.239> even<00:02:54.329> got

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
magnesium and I think it's even got

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.479 
magnesium and I think it's even got
boron<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.139> it<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:55.680> I'll<00:02:55.799> have<00:02:56.040> it'll<00:02:56.370> have

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
boron in it but I'll have it'll have

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.770 
boron in it but I'll have it'll have
heaps<00:02:56.760> heaps<00:02:56.909> more<00:02:57.299> than<00:02:57.420> that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
heaps heaps more than that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.449 
heaps heaps more than that
so<00:02:58.170> it's<00:02:58.290> really<00:02:58.470> really<00:02:58.650> nutritious<00:02:59.189> plant

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
so it's really really nutritious plant

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.330 
so it's really really nutritious plant
right<00:03:00.030> even<00:03:00.269> contains<00:03:00.569> silicon<00:03:01.049> so<00:03:01.950> silica

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
right even contains silicon so silica

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.949 
right even contains silicon so silica
for<00:03:02.519> keeping<00:03:02.819> your<00:03:02.909> hair<00:03:03.120> nails<00:03:03.389> and<00:03:03.720> skin

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
for keeping your hair nails and skin

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.569 
for keeping your hair nails and skin
healthy<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.650> really<00:03:04.889> great<00:03:05.189> source<00:03:05.459> of

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
healthy so it's really great source of

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.129 
healthy so it's really great source of
minerals<00:03:05.879> but<00:03:06.269> they'll<00:03:06.420> grow<00:03:06.569> in<00:03:06.689> almost<00:03:06.930> any

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
minerals but they'll grow in almost any

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.649 
minerals but they'll grow in almost any
condition<00:03:07.970> here's<00:03:08.970> another<00:03:09.120> one<00:03:09.299> over<00:03:09.480> here

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
Katsuya and you can see its leaves are

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.800 
Katsuya and you can see its leaves are
so<00:04:01.680> pointy<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.370> they<00:04:02.760> also<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.209> very<00:04:03.510> fine

fur<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.010> leaves<00:04:05.190> I'll<00:04:05.430> see<00:04:05.549> if<00:04:05.639> I<00:04:05.699> can<00:04:05.849> zoom

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
fur on the leaves I'll see if I can zoom

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.040 
fur on the leaves I'll see if I can zoom
in<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.540> show<00:04:07.349> you

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.360

I feel very closely you'll see little

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.479 
I feel very closely you'll see little
hairs<00:04:15.790> on<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.270> leaf<00:04:16.530> now<00:04:17.530> these<00:04:17.680> are<00:04:17.980> absent

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
dandelion and the flowers on flat weed

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.750 
dandelion and the flowers on flat weed
also<00:04:31.470> they<00:04:32.470> have<00:04:32.680> multiple<00:04:33.100> flowers<00:04:33.310> per

also they have multiple flowers per

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.240 
also they have multiple flowers per

horses have eaten these and they

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.740 
horses have eaten these and they
survived<00:04:45.100> but<00:04:45.550> they<00:04:45.670> don't<00:04:45.850> thrive<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.540> what

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
survived but they don't thrive and what

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.610 
survived but they don't thrive and what
ends<00:04:47.020> up<00:04:47.110> happening<00:04:47.440> is<00:04:47.980> they<00:04:48.580> start<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:48.910> have

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
ends up happening is they start to have

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.870 
ends up happening is they start to have
muscle<00:04:50.620> cramps<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.100> spasms<00:04:51.160> there's

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
muscle cramps and spasms there's

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.270 
muscle cramps and spasms there's
something<00:04:52.120> that<00:04:52.650> so<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.740> kidneys<00:04:54.100> have

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
something that so the kidneys have

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.830 
something that so the kidneys have
difficulty<00:04:54.790> in<00:04:56.640> disposing<00:04:57.640> of<00:04:57.850> some<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.780> the

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
difficulty in disposing of some of the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.860 
difficulty in disposing of some of the
compounds<00:04:59.350> that<00:04:59.410> are<00:04:59.560> in<00:04:59.650> this<00:04:59.800> type<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.870> plant

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
compounds that are in this type of plant

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.400 
compounds that are in this type of plant
so<00:05:02.800> this<00:05:02.890> is<00:05:03.040> called<00:05:03.250> Katzie<00:05:03.670> or<00:05:03.910> flat<00:05:04.150> weed

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
so this is called Katzie or flat weed

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.320 
so this is called Katzie or flat weed
multiple<00:05:05.410> flowers<00:05:05.830> per<00:05:06.250> store<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.820> this

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
multiple flowers per store and this

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.850 
multiple flowers per store and this
leaves<00:05:07.570> are<00:05:07.750> completely<00:05:08.110> different<00:05:08.290> hairy

leaves are completely different hairy
leaves<00:05:09.130> not<00:05:09.820> pointing<00:05:11.820> so<00:05:12.820> here<00:05:13.030> we<00:05:13.150> are

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
leaves not pointing so here we are

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.390 
leaves not pointing so here we are
looking<00:05:13.510> down<00:05:13.960> on<00:05:14.260> some<00:05:14.470> more<00:05:14.590> dandelion<00:05:15.130> and

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
looking down on some more dandelion and

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.120 
looking down on some more dandelion and
got<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.790> bit<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:16.090> parsley<00:05:16.510> mixed<00:05:16.840> in<00:05:16.990> here<00:05:17.140> but

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
got a bit of parsley mixed in here but

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.840 
got a bit of parsley mixed in here but
if<00:05:18.220> I<00:05:18.310> get<00:05:18.460> in<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.610> little<00:05:18.730> bit<00:05:18.910> closer<00:05:20.700> you<00:05:21.700> can

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
if I get in a little bit closer you can

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.700 
if I get in a little bit closer you can
see<00:05:22.060> it's<00:05:22.210> quite<00:05:22.390> lush<00:05:22.750> that<00:05:23.140> leaves<00:05:23.380> a<00:05:23.560> very

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
see it's quite lush that leaves a very

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.560 
see it's quite lush that leaves a very
lush<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.310> robust<00:05:24.880> because<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:25.210> area<00:05:25.450> of<00:05:25.510> the

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
lush and robust because this area of the

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.880 
lush and robust because this area of the
garden<00:05:25.690> gets<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:25.990> lot<00:05:26.110> more<00:05:26.140> water<00:05:26.530> than<00:05:26.770> the

across just here here's a related plant
this<00:05:42.730> is<00:05:42.880> called<00:05:43.090> dandelion<00:05:43.600> chicory<00:05:44.020> CELTA

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
this is called dandelion chicory CELTA

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.500 
this is called dandelion chicory CELTA
chicory<00:05:44.950> plant<00:05:45.220> cross<00:05:45.460> with<00:05:45.670> dandelion<00:05:46.210> and

it flowers like a chicory plant but its

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.750 
it flowers like a chicory plant but its
leaves<00:05:49.510> look<00:05:49.750> a<00:05:49.870> lot<00:05:50.020> like<00:05:50.170> a<00:05:50.230> dandelion<00:05:50.760> but

leaves look a lot like a dandelion but

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.160 
leaves look a lot like a dandelion but
this<00:05:51.910> is<00:05:52.030> more<00:05:52.180> upright<00:05:52.480> again<00:05:52.870> and<00:05:53.020> grows

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
this is more upright again and grows

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.040 
this is more upright again and grows
much<00:05:53.410> larger<00:05:53.800> so<00:05:53.919> here's<00:05:54.130> an<00:05:54.250> example<00:05:54.340> of<00:05:55.050> two

much larger so here's an example of two

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.020 
much larger so here's an example of two
stems<00:05:56.410> these<00:05:56.770> are<00:05:56.890> about<00:05:57.130> to<00:05:57.340> flower<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:57.970> they

stems these are about to flower and they

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.980 
stems these are about to flower and they
have<00:05:58.180> that<00:05:58.300> awesome
