00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.620
 that carlo ancelotti speaks clearly is something 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.450
 Demonstrating in every press conference or 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.460
 interview that leaves several headlines for 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.170
 press conference also and the previous one 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 Real Madrid match in Elche was not 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.619
 an eye exception with the team 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
 Elche in his return to the first 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.480
 Although I have not yet been able to win 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.800
 confidence and especially at the beginning of 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.700
 matches for which the own 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.530
 Ancelotti asks for much more intensity 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.350
 we have to be careful with this 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.270
 party because we have already had the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.270
 vila-real experience where we left 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.700
 played a very difficult match and I think that 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.430
 tomorrow it will be the same we are are teams 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.120
 that I am very excited that they have won 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.890
 the league last year I think in this 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.470
 moment to play against Madrid for 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.090
 they are a great motivation we need 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.050
 start the game with different 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.560
 intensity with different 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.560
 for all intensity 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.629
 because the parties that we have started 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.290
 we have always had problem after 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.290
 that the party 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.930
 two minutes after minutes the team 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.550
 does better 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.050
 even with some point in the debit the 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.780
 balance of this start of the season is 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.950
 good in a team that for ancelotti goes 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.440
 to more improving I do not see it improving 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.979
 happy about the work because he sees a 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.979
 team what 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.000
 he wants to improve them in training 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.000
 they are professionals 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:48.130
 I think we played we played good 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:51.610
 party not with much continuity 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.520
 I think this is the things we have 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.049
 to improve now the meeting in the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.729
 martínez valero ancelotti recovers 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.530
 effective especially in defense between 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.570
 them for the return of the French 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.969
 competition increases in the center 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.500
 the rear is something that makes the 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.210
 Real Madrid coach 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.310
 the morning 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.800
 we recover barán we recover 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.180
 concentrate that are available now 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.180
 I will see they are going to play 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.049
 or less at the beginning of the game 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.450
 the most important thing that all the two 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:30.540
 recovering very well 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.540
 I think they will make a great talent 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.720
 we are very lucky 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.069
 to see this player because it is the future 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.159
 Real Madrid is hard to say 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.420
 especially if you have pp also 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.420
 nacho is doing very well 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.700
 the holder the holder with is difficult to 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.960
 say the name of the owner in another 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.040
 field position 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.540
 and is that Carlos has clear 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.950
 whoever is best at all times to 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.569
 just as you know who is the coach 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.849
 who must adapt to his players 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.040
 although he wanted to remember with amazement the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.840
 curious case of a team that ended 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.640
 marking the counterattack luck of the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.370
 football that seemed to have veto does not 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.430
 so much 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.390
 it's not easy to say it I think that always a 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 coach has to adapt to the no 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.750
 I say so much even to the style 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.160
 characteristic of the players then 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.830
 I think it is 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.200
 has to be more coach than you 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.860
 you have to apply naturally a 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.350
 coach has a game idea 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.390
 that you need pro for the team 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:50.430
 considering taking into account the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.850
 the characteristics of the players 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.190
 it was surprising then surprising to see the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.400
 match of ray valley in barcelona 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.950
 dial in counterattack and to finish 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.170
 one of the possible similarities of this 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.640
 match chelotti you can find her 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.270
 point although obviously let it be 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.100
 zinedine the one who gives the verdict 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.100
 it is true has a lot 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.190
 It is very close to mobility aids 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.250
 with mentality I think that this is a 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.090
 question that 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.120
 we have to ask tirán can 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.480
 respond better than me and I've 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.480
 asked 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:41.020
 if so says not yet more it may be that 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.020
 in the future it will be very close
