00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.850 

now<00:01:43.330> this<00:01:43.480> one<00:01:43.660> we<00:01:43.720> do<00:01:43.840> in<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.080> job<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.770> don't

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
now this one we do in this job you don't

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.280 
now this one we do in this job you don't
want<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.130> steering<00:01:45.400> wheel<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.790> spin<00:01:46.290> freely

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
want the steering wheel to spin freely

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.610 
want the steering wheel to spin freely
once<00:01:47.710> it's<00:01:47.950> loose<00:01:48.610> from<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.180> stream<00:01:52.620> gear

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
once it's loose from the stream gear

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.650 
once it's loose from the stream gear
down<00:01:54.340> below<00:01:54.670> because<00:01:55.090> we've<00:01:55.330> got<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> lot<00:01:55.540> of

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
down below because we've got a lot of

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.970 
down below because we've got a lot of
wires<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:55.930> stuff<00:01:56.200> going<00:01:56.410> through<00:01:56.650> here<00:01:56.860> and

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
wires and stuff going through here and

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.680 
wires and stuff going through here and
they<00:01:57.100> only<00:01:57.220> go<00:01:57.910> so<00:01:58.150> far

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
they only go so far

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.640 
they only go so far
they're<00:01:59.470> on<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.680> coil<00:02:00.390> Blakeley<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:02.500> you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
they're on a coil Blakeley and if you

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.170 
they're on a coil Blakeley and if you
keep<00:02:02.860> spinning<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.370> they<00:02:03.640> will<00:02:03.820> break<00:02:04.000> the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
keep spinning it they will break the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.660 
keep spinning it they will break the
wire<00:02:04.300> so<00:02:04.690> try<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.050> keep<00:02:05.200> this<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.650> one<00:02:06.460> position

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
wire so try to keep this in one position

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.150 
wire so try to keep this in one position
as<00:02:07.030> much<00:02:07.210> as<00:02:07.330> possible<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.830> should<00:02:09.070> be

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
as much as possible and you should be

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.380 
as much as possible and you should be
okay<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.890> we<00:02:11.950> pulled<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.340> out<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:13.090> shaft

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
okay so we pulled that out of the shaft

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.630 
okay so we pulled that out of the shaft
and<00:02:13.780> slip<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> shaft<00:02:14.920> down<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.190> went<00:02:15.430> down

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
and slip the shaft down I went down

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.449 
and slip the shaft down I went down
pretty<00:02:15.850> easy<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.800> we'll<00:02:17.980> see<00:02:18.130> how<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.220> can

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
pretty easy so we'll see how we can

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.740 
pretty easy so we'll see how we can
disconnect<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:19.000> from<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.150> other<00:02:19.330> side<00:02:21.750> all

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
disconnect it from the other side all

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.000 
disconnect it from the other side all
right<00:02:22.990> when<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.200> did<00:02:23.290> those<00:02:23.530> issues<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
right when I did those issues the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.000 
right when I did those issues the
players<00:02:24.330> grabbed<00:02:25.330> here<00:02:25.600> below<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.200> lump

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.530 

like<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.550> then<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.670> used<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.060> hammer<00:02:31.270> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
like that and then I used a hammer and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.720 
like that and then I used a hammer and
tapped<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:32.080> it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
tapped on it

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.440 
tapped on it
George's<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.820> firewall<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.450> all<00:02:35.200> came<00:02:35.470> apart

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
George's the firewall and all came apart

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.729 
George's the firewall and all came apart
you<00:02:37.450> just<00:02:37.660> pull<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:37.989> right<00:02:38.110> through<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
you just pull this right through on the

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:54.789 
you just pull this right through on the
inside

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.600 

that's<00:02:55.799> what<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.069> did<00:02:59.000> hold<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.269> from<00:03:00.510> here

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
that's what I did hold it up from here

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.860 
that's what I did hold it up from here
so<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.640> guess<00:03:02.940> reverse<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.360> procedure<00:03:03.659> to

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
so I guess reverse the procedure to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
so I guess reverse the procedure to
install<00:03:04.110> stick<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> same<00:03:05.099> hole

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
install stick it in the same hole

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.270 
install stick it in the same hole
tighten<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.069> down<00:03:08.099> I<00:03:09.860> can<00:03:10.860> see<00:03:11.010> there's<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
tighten it down I can see there's a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.820 
tighten it down I can see there's a
little<00:03:11.459> Ridge<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.530> didn't<00:03:13.739> have

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
little Ridge on this and I didn't have

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.990 
little Ridge on this and I didn't have
to<00:03:13.980> use<00:03:14.129> my<00:03:15.170> wrench<00:03:16.170> again

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
to use my wrench again

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.930 
to use my wrench again
this<00:03:18.890> put<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.430> then<00:03:20.670> use<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
this put it on there and then use the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.710 
this put it on there and then use the
hammer<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.360> bang<00:03:21.720> banged<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.800> down<00:03:22.980> into<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
hammer and bang banged it down into the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.160 
hammer and bang banged it down into the
other<00:03:24.720> piece<00:03:25.020> there<00:03:25.400> was<00:03:26.400> enough<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:27.140> fill<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
other piece there was enough to fill the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.699 
other piece there was enough to fill the
hole<00:03:28.350> lined<00:03:28.590> up

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
hole lined up

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.280 
hole lined up
once<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.430> got<00:03:31.700> T<00:03:32.569> started<00:03:33.079> in<00:03:33.200> them<00:03:33.379> as

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
once I got T started in them as

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.710 
once I got T started in them as
turn<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.010> up<00:03:35.129> and<00:03:35.250> turn<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.489> wheel<00:03:35.640> and

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
turn it up and turn the wheel and

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.820 
turn it up and turn the wheel and
all<00:03:36.930> lined<00:03:37.290> up<00:03:38.420> tighten<00:03:39.420> up<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> bolts<00:03:39.870> and

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
all lined up tighten up the bolts and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.480 
all lined up tighten up the bolts and
we're<00:03:40.950> done<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.460> take<00:03:41.790> care<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.120> clunking
