00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.930
 calculate the product of the matrices 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:10.170
 that appear on the screen, let's observe that 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.120
 we have a matrix that has a row 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.380
 and three columns and here we have a 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.320
 matrix that has three rows 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.060
 and two columns the number of columns of 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.670
 the first one matches the number of 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.590
 rows of the second then this that 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.550
 product can be made and the result 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.320
 it will be a matrix one by two and one row and 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.710
 two columns 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.600
 possibly here and another one here then let's go 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.300
 to see what this element is 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.360
 first row first column and this 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.370
 would be first row second column then 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.329
 this would multiply the first row 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.560
 for the first column 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.500
 first row 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.880
 for the first column this is two more 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.250
 for three 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.250
 about 3 for 2 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.210
 + 1 x 0 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 this is equal 2 by 36 plus minus 3 by 2 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.940
 6 6 + 0 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.940
 660 that is zero 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.420
 we have done this and now first row 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.780
 for second column first row 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.860
 for second column then we will have 2 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.860
 for 1 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.600
 more minus 3 x minus 2 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.600
 more one by one 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.640
 this would be two for one is two plus minus 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.990
 three for minus 26 plus one for one that is 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.100
 12 + 6 819 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.140
 09 this is the result of multiplying 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.510
 both matrices are going to leave with this 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.610
 a little cleaner so many things that 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.470
 we have put here in blue and so it is 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.470
 this better good that would come 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.560
 since we have this here we are not going to 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.240
 clean more then when multiplying 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.750
 these two matrices the result is 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.910
 get the matrix row a matrix one 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.910
 by two with elements 0 and 9
