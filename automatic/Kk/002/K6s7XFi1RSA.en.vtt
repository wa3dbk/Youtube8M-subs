00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.110
 and pistol of the apostle Saint Paul to the 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.980
 Roman Romans Chapter 15 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:14.930
 we are really strong 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.349
 we must bear the weakness that 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.660
 we do not have that strength and do not look 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.660
 our own liking 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.610
 that each one look for what pleases his 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.070
 neighbor helping him to grow in good 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.130
 the same Christ did not do what he 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.720
 liked as the writing says 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.520
 the insults of those who insulted you 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.640
 they fell on me 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.890
 all those prophetic scriptures are 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.059
 they wrote for teaching our 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.540
 so that persevering and having the 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.500
 comfort of the scriptures do not miss us 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.580
 the hope 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 that god from whom all 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:10.010
 perseverance and consolation grant them 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.420
 also to all live in good agreement 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.960
 according to the spirit of christ jesus 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:24.330
 then you with the same heart and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.690
 a single voice will praise goodbye father of 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.170
 our lord jesus christ 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:35.170
 welcome one another as Christ the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.159
 welcomed for the glory of God 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.249
 understand me 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.270
 Christ put himself at the service of the people 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:48.820
 Jewish to fulfill the promises made to 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.880
 his parents because God is faithful 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.340
 and the other peoples 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.110
 those will thank God for their 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.020
 mercy says it writing 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.550
 that's why I will bless you among the nations 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.759
 and I will praise your name and also rejoice 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.950
 pagan nations together with the people of 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.700
 God 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.580
 and again sing to the Lord all 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:24.110
 peoples and praise all the nations 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.720
 Isaiah in turn says a 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.850
 descendant of hesse and will rise 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.400
 to guide the nations 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.300
 in the will 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.540
 there is your hope 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.030
 the god of all hope fills them with 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.990
 joy and peace 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.470
 in the way of faith and grow in 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.430
 you hope for the power of the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.430
 Holy Spirit 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.250
 I'm personally convinced brothers 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.590
 that you are also full of 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.349
 goodwill 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.200
 filled with all knowledge and that are 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:14.680
 able to admonish each other 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.819
 however, I dared to speak with them 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.019
 frankness to remind you of some things 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.420
 I do it with the authority that God gave me 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.810
 when he made me the minister of Christ 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.790
 Jesus among the heathen nations for the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.239
 sacred office of the gospel of God 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.280
 to make those nations an offering 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.060
 nice to god sanctified by the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.060
 holy spirit 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.750
 that's why in the things of God I have the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.319
 pride that can be had in Christ 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.720
 Jesus but I would not dare to talk about 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.800
 something other than what Christ has 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.330
 fact 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.780
 using me 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.990
 so that the pagans receive my faith 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.410
 words and my works 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.510
 with a lot of miracles and wonders and 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.959
 the power of the holy spirit 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.390
 from Jerusalem to the lyrical by 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:20.090
 everywhere has spread the good 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.040
 new of christ but I have been careful 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.710
 and from this I honor myself 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.800
 of not preaching in places where you already 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.069
 I knew Christ 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.460
 and not build on foundations 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:37.789
 agents guide me through writing what 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.050
 will see those who had not been 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.980
 announced will be known by those who swim 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.010
 they had heard 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.169
 that job had me so busy that I did not 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.870
 I could reach you 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:57.610
 but as I have wanted for several 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.760
 years and now there is no place for me in 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.230
 those regions 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.100
 I will do it when I go to Spain ' 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.830
 but go through where you and see them 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.030
 and when you have fully enjoyed 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.570
 your company will help me to continue traveling 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.570
 over there 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.860
 now I'm going to jerusalem to attend 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.280
 to that community 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.439
 because in Macedonia and here they already thought 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.110
 well do a collection in favor of the 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:34.620
 poor of the Jerusalem community 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.729
 they wanted to do it and in fact they were in 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.279
 debt to them 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:43.389
 Well, if they have participated in the goods 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:46.129
 spirituals of the Jews is just that 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:48.619
 Serve them materially 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.660
 when you have fulfilled this assignment and 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:55.860
 delivered the aid received 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.520
 I will go to Spain going through where 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:03.680
 you and I know very well that I will get where 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.949
 you with all the blessing of Christ 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.419
 but I beg you brothers in the name of 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:13.030
 christ jesus our lord and love 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:16.960
 fruit of the spirit 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:21.160
 that pray to God for me fight with me 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.080
 begging for me so I can escape from 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.810
 the enemies of the faith in Judea 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.790
 and for those in the community to receive 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:34.990
 with pleasure the help that I bring 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:39.860
 so I will come with joy where you and 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:45.759
 if God wants to rest in your company 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.759
 the god of peace be with you amen
