it's<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> good<00:01:14.610> diet<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.509> not<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> best

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it's a good diet but it's not the best

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.850 
it's a good diet but it's not the best
for<00:01:16.320> us<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.610> equate<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.759> cancer<00:01:18.240> carbs<00:01:18.860> that's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
for us and equate in cancer carbs that's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
for us and equate in cancer carbs that's
too<00:01:20.250> much<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> reach<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.689> look<00:01:21.840> at

too much of a reach but when you look at
