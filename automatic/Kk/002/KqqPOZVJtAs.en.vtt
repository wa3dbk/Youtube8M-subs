00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.330
 go nickel 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.640
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.350
 new video on gta 5 so a video 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.230
 information about the next patch 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.119
 so surely the patch 1.17 that pat 1.18 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 we are not really sure about the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.210
 Duke is which it will appear but 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.520
 I still prefer you show it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 so that you are aware 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.890
 so I still prefer to tell you 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.390
 directly at the beginning of the video 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.190
 when we make videos like that the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.360
 excess videos hypothesis so that's 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 information that can be found 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 on forums we do not know if it's true 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.180
 we do not know if it's wrong for me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.829
 in any case a lot of information that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960
 I found these are re issued by the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.789
 then we will take for example the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.489
 smoke from the tires the windows tinted there 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 planes there are also the dup stasys the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.789
 had I even pulled out the price of 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.050
 planes in advance or through screens 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.340
 it was not me who had fun going 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.989
 in the game codes I'm not enough 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.859
 stuck for that I found that on 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.090
 forums so as I tell you to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.610
 every time I put you often so 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.869
 forum links in the description 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.369
 so is proud I came across 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.439
 screen that as soon as they are still 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.790
 pretty interesting I had already stumbled upon 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.040
 these screens are a little while 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.330
 I had not really paid attention there 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.159
 did not really trust so 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.229
 at this screen is actually on fallen 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.369
 on yesterday so they republished is in 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.290
 did I realize that there is 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.850
 already there are dependent two months ago this 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.799
 screen was there with the same icons 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.330
 on the screen is actually there was 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.009
 already the thermal pitcher who appeared 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.630
 in anyway not a month so that's me 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.740
 it made me a little weird so I 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.909
 am i started a little bit to do 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.200
 trust to this screen I'm going to you 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.909
 immediately put under eyes 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.470
 case you can see all the weapons of 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.670
 famous dlc we could have so there 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.380
 thomson of the valentine's day 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.820
 the thermal launcher of independence 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.710
 day and many more 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 and so here we can see two gifts that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.340
 are not out yet it's the little one 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.320
 red guide at the bottom left and the species 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 of small banks right next so 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.890
 two new weapons a priori months the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.939
 little guen makes me think a little because 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.840
 it's a red color so we could 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.700
 to say what is a red gun 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.140
 does not exist and in fact so it's me 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.610
 answer mostly think of a gun 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.869
 in which launch flares 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.040
 so I have not if you see small 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.810
 rockets that you can shoot a single 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.250
 ball in the air and in fact it's a 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.969
 rocket that I will have a message 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.000
 warning 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.560
 so it could stick and so often 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.069
 these weapons there are usually in 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.569
 plastic and more 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.769
 these are some weapons with receding 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.269
 weird colors whatever we recognize 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.499
 although it's not a real gun and 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.659
 that for example konÃ© that comes out in 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.799
 a situation we will say of distress 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.359
 ball but in fact he has no fear 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.829
 that it is worth 2 inches offering a ball 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.079
 in the head and that's fine we're going 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.849
 throw a rocket in the air so that's it 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.260
 could it stick and just to 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.889
 side so we see a kind of two 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.359
 sticky tapes 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.400
 so that's not allowed to pass four 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.170
 as we can already have on gta it's 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.310
 it shows that it's different and so 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.299
 me it makes me think actually I have not 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.939
 if you see the two small boats 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.989
 which are vertical the parallel part that 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.099
 actually think of little things 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.749
 for hanging on a wall 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.430
 does that mean it's 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.780
 bombs with which we can by 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.980
 example blow up a safe or 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.269
 something like that during a robbery 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.949
 as I tell you I put it between 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.879
 parentheses that's really what 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.680
 comes the head that's what I think 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.449
 to have this screen is not sure that it 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.250
 will be that afterwards but in any case I 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:59.620
 you share my ideas maybe that's 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.419
 will be a kind of two little bombs to 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.280
 so stick on a front door for 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.930
 a robbery a trade or or the trunk 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.010
 strong and then for example if you 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.329
 get out you launch a small rocket 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.010
 illuminating hard so that your friends 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.209
 benchmarks or I do not know at all 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.609
 commenting on what you are doing 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.599
 think of these screens anyway that's it 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.549
 would be really interesting to find 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.439
 new weapons we did not have with 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.569
 the dlc so the dlc just out 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.849
 aviation we just had parachutes 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.859
 so it would not hurt to approach the 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.060
 novelty at the level of weapons and that's it 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.620
 we come to the end of this video so 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.659
 information in parentheses 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.220
 assumptions about the point 17 or even 1.18 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.259
 as I wanted to say we do not know for 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.519
 which patch these weapons will be reserved 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.049
 so it's really only hypotheses 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.699
 in any case weather reviews what 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.259
 you think do not hesitate either to the 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.489
 pillay chain if it gets over is to 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.049
 subscribe if it's not already done 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.579
 I will leave you in these pictures 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.579
 tweetie good game and you have everyone 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 Oh 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.900
 by the air
