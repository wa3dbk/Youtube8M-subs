it in play there are loads of levels

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.789 
it in play there are loads of levels
there's<00:01:13.020> also<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> randomly<00:01:13.770> generated

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
there's also a randomly generated

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.940 
there's also a randomly generated
endless<00:01:14.670> mode<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.350> all<00:01:16.350> sorts<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.799> good<00:01:16.920> stuff

endless mode and all sorts of good stuff
like<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.610> one's<00:01:17.759> coming<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.000> iOS<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
like that that one's coming to iOS and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
like that that one's coming to iOS and
Android<00:01:18.450> soon<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.850> tilted<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.659> which<00:01:22.020> has

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
Android soon this is tilted on which has

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.560 
Android soon this is tilted on which has
some<00:01:23.070> common<00:01:23.430> ground<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:24.060> super<00:01:24.390> hexagon

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
some common ground with super hexagon

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.390 
some common ground with super hexagon
yes<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.799> super<00:01:26.250> difficult

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
yes you know it's it's super difficult

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.910 
yes you know it's it's super difficult
are<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.240> first<00:01:27.420> difficulty<00:01:27.990> mode<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.439> hard

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
are the first difficulty mode is hard

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.530 
are the first difficulty mode is hard
and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> only<00:01:29.549> gets<00:01:29.790> harder<00:01:29.850> from<00:01:30.180> there

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and then it only gets harder from there

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.030 
and then it only gets harder from there
and<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.200> obviously<00:01:31.439> named<00:01:31.680> after<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and it's obviously named after a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.270 
and it's obviously named after a
geometric<00:01:32.369> shape<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.100> same

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
geometric shape but this one is the same

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.069 
geometric shape but this one is the same
geometric<00:01:35.700> shape<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.600> no<00:01:36.750> clone

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
geometric shape but this is no clone

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.870 
geometric shape but this is no clone
instead<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.560> about<00:01:37.740> tilting<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.430> ball<00:01:38.640> around

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
instead it's about tilting a ball around

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.539 
instead it's about tilting a ball around
to<00:01:39.450> maneuver<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> across<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.100> hexagonal

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
to maneuver it across these hexagonal

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.850 
to maneuver it across these hexagonal
platforms<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.350> each<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.740> these

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
platforms and then on each of these

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.920 
platforms and then on each of these
six-sided<00:01:44.490> steps<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.360> want<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> hit<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
six-sided steps you want to hit this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.230 
six-sided steps you want to hit this
cube<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.740> reveal<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> next<00:01:47.640> platform<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
cube to reveal the next platform and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
then roll it onto that there are

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
then roll it onto that there are

obstacles there are holes there are

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
obstacles there are holes there are
things<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.140> knock<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.500> off<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.979> your

things right and knock you off and your
platform<00:01:54.030> will<00:01:54.240> disappear<00:01:54.720> after<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> few

platform will disappear after a few

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.770 
platform will disappear after a few
seconds<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.619> you've<00:01:55.740> got<00:01:55.770> keep<00:01:56.100> moving<00:01:56.790> your

very difficult very hard gay this was

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.680 
very difficult very hard gay this was
out<00:02:11.730> real<00:02:11.910> soon<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.300> gonna<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.510> super

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.520 
addictive
and<00:02:13.700> then<00:02:14.360> finally<00:02:14.540> we've<00:02:14.840> got<00:02:15.019> this<00:02:15.140> clever

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and then finally we've got this clever

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.649 
and then finally we've got this clever
mashup<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.220> an<00:02:16.370> RPG<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.209> slot<00:02:17.629> machine

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
mashup of an RPG and a slot machine

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.509 
mashup of an RPG and a slot machine
which<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.379> called<00:02:18.590> at<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.920> moment<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.400> a

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
which is called at the moment this is a

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.479 
which is called at the moment this is a
tentative<00:02:19.819> name<00:02:20.090> slots<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:21.019> far<00:02:21.290> water<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.340> the

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
tentative name slots of far water so the

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.089 
tentative name slots of far water so the
idea<00:02:22.579> is<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:23.090> pull<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> handle<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.799> get<00:02:24.920> some

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
idea is you pull the handle you get some

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.399 
idea is you pull the handle you get some
random<00:02:25.400> items<00:02:25.760> like<00:02:26.030> swords<00:02:26.510> hearts<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.110> gems

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
random items like swords hearts and gems

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.259 
random items like swords hearts and gems
and<00:02:27.709> then<00:02:28.250> when<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.549> whole<00:02:28.700> grid<00:02:28.939> is<00:02:29.030> filled

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
and then when the whole grid is filled

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.589 
and then when the whole grid is filled
up<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:30.079> want<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.560> turn<00:02:30.980> nearby<00:02:31.730> items<00:02:32.209> into

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
up you want to turn nearby items into

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.380 
up you want to turn nearby items into
attacks<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.620> spells<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.189> heels<00:02:34.579> and<00:02:34.819> things

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
attacks and spells and heels and things

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.960 
attacks and spells and heels and things
like<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.599> that<00:02:36.530> sounds<00:02:36.799> kind<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.010> random<00:02:37.519> but

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
like that that sounds kind of random but

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.309 
like that that sounds kind of random but
there<00:02:38.180> are<00:02:38.359> there's<00:02:38.780> more<00:02:38.930> depth<00:02:39.140> than

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
there are there's more depth than

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.770 
there are there's more depth than
strategy<00:02:39.799> than<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.129> there<00:02:40.370> are<00:02:40.519> re<00:02:41.359> spins

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
strategy than that there are re spins

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.809 
strategy than that there are re spins
and<00:02:42.079> holds<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.739> special<00:02:43.099> items<00:02:43.400> things<00:02:43.640> like

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
and holds and special items things like

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.009 
and holds and special items things like
that<00:02:43.939> this<00:02:44.120> was<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.299> little<00:02:44.540> bit<00:02:44.629> early<00:02:44.989> so

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
that this was a little bit early so

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.780 
that this was a little bit early so
we'll<00:02:45.409> see<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.620> too<00:02:45.739> we'll<00:02:46.099> see<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.280> evolve<00:02:46.579> as

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
we'll see it too we'll see it evolve as

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.699 
we'll see it too we'll see it evolve as
the<00:02:47.299> game<00:02:47.450> goes<00:02:47.659> on<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.109> really<00:02:48.470> do<00:02:48.560> like
