00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
i'm using OPI strawberry margarita

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.170 
i'm using OPI strawberry margarita
alpine<00:00:28.760> snow<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:30.650> with<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.250> glitter<00:00:31.519> I<00:00:31.910> used

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
alpine snow and with the glitter I used

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.540 
alpine snow and with the glitter I used
the<00:00:32.390> Sephora<00:00:32.810> by<00:00:32.900> OPI<00:00:33.020> brand<00:00:33.740> they<00:00:34.400> have<00:00:34.520> a

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
the Sephora by OPI brand they have a

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.920

bunch<00:00:34.700> of<00:00:34.790> different<00:00:35.060> colors<00:00:35.330> and<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:35.719> think

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
bunch of different colors and I think

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.840 
bunch of different colors and I think
overall<00:00:36.170> there's<00:00:36.649> litter<00:00:36.860> works<00:00:37.550> pretty<00:00:37.730> well

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
overall there's litter works pretty well

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.729 
overall there's litter works pretty well
for<00:00:37.969> this<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.930> you're<00:00:39.230> also<00:00:39.320> gonna<00:00:39.440> need<00:00:39.530> to

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
for this and you're also gonna need to

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.860 
for this and you're also gonna need to
thick<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.370> that's<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:40.610> I<00:00:40.790> already<00:00:41.600> painted

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
thick and that's it I already painted

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.500 
thick and that's it I already painted
the<00:00:42.170> base<00:00:42.379> colors<00:00:42.829> on<00:00:43.039> all<00:00:43.219> my<00:00:43.370> nails<00:00:43.550> and

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
you're gonna get a piece of oil or paper

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.150 
you're gonna get a piece of oil or paper
I<00:00:47.420> like<00:00:47.719> using<00:00:47.870> foil<00:00:48.199> just<00:00:48.440> because<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:49.010> keeps

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
I like using foil just because it keeps

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.529 
I like using foil just because it keeps
the<00:00:49.340> nail<00:00:49.489> polish<00:00:49.760> from<00:00:49.820> drying<00:00:50.090> out<00:00:50.300> and

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
the nail polish from drying out and

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.619 
the nail polish from drying out and
you're<00:00:51.260> going<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.440> get<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.590> toothpick<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.629> I'm

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
you're going to get a toothpick and I'm

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.209 
you're going to get a toothpick and I'm
going<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.840> start<00:00:54.020> off<00:00:54.140> doing<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.559> gradient<00:00:55.039> on

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
going to start off doing a gradient on

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.610 
going to start off doing a gradient on
this<00:00:55.940> now<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:56.870> I'm<00:00:56.930> going<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.079> use<00:00:57.170> both<00:00:57.440> of

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
this now so I'm going to use both of

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.799
