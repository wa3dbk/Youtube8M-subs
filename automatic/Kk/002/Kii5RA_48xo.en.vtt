cool<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.380> really<00:01:30.190> good<00:01:30.370> idea<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.960> actually<00:01:31.960> put

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
cool a really good idea to actually put

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.870 
cool a really good idea to actually put
a<00:01:32.380> zombies<00:01:32.740> map<00:01:32.950> on<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.160> boat<00:01:33.430> because<00:01:33.730> who

would<00:01:34.030> actually<00:01:34.390> like<00:01:34.510> thought<00:01:34.930> of<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.230> like

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
would actually like thought of that like

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.620 
would actually like thought of that like
maybe<00:01:35.770> Trek<00:01:36.190> but<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.600> really<00:01:38.110> cool<00:01:39.630> feel

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
maybe Trek but it is a really cool feel

maybe Trek but it is a really cool feel
factor<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.230> that<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.680> also<00:01:42.070> now<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.700> we're

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850

zombies<00:02:07.720> mess<00:02:08.229> but<00:02:08.440> as<00:02:08.590> we<00:02:08.800> know<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:10.030> X's<00:02:10.330> on

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
zombies mess but as we know the X's on

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.330 
zombies mess but as we know the X's on
these<00:02:10.599> maps<00:02:10.780> are<00:02:10.929> supposed<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.590> be<00:02:11.709> modern<00:02:12.069> so

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
these maps are supposed to be modern so

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.410 
these maps are supposed to be modern so
it<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:13.030> cool<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.050> sense<00:02:14.440> but<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:16.060> zombie

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
it is cool in that sense but the zombie

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.390 
it is cool in that sense but the zombie
feel<00:02:16.569> factor<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.140> great<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.800> map<00:02:17.980> because

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
feel factor is great in this map because

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490 
feel factor is great in this map because
there's<00:02:18.909> really<00:02:19.180> dark<00:02:19.599> parts<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.349> there's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
there's really dark parts and there's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.179 
there's really dark parts and there's
really<00:02:20.709> good<00:02:20.829> spots<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.459> train<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:23.129> also<00:02:24.129> you

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
really good spots to train and also you

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.039 
really good spots to train and also you
can<00:02:24.400> tell<00:02:24.610> they<00:02:24.730> fix<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.299> zombies<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> little

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
can tell they fix the zombies a little

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.470 
can tell they fix the zombies a little
bit<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.439> they<00:02:26.650> don't<00:02:26.829> jump<00:02:27.370> at<00:02:27.579> you<00:02:27.610> as<00:02:28.150> much

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
bit like they don't jump at you as much

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.809 
bit like they don't jump at you as much
and<00:02:28.840> like<00:02:29.019> they<00:02:29.470> still<00:02:29.739> do<00:02:29.950> occasionally<00:02:30.700> and

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
and like they still do occasionally and

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.699 
and like they still do occasionally and
stuff<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.209> but<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.629> definitely<00:02:32.230> noticed

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
stuff like that but I definitely noticed

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.289 
stuff like that but I definitely noticed
that<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:32.950> zombies<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.459> calmed<00:02:33.970> down<00:02:34.239> a

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
that the zombies have calmed down a

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.210 
that the zombies have calmed down a
little<00:02:34.569> bit<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.140> can't<00:02:35.439> really<00:02:35.530> catch<00:02:35.829> up<00:02:36.040> to

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
little bit and can't really catch up to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.059 
little bit and can't really catch up to
you<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.579> that's<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:37.780> nice<00:02:38.079> that<00:02:38.739> makes<00:02:38.920> a

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
you and that's really nice that makes a

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.190 
you and that's really nice that makes a
lot<00:02:39.189> easier<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.700> train<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.390> they<00:02:40.569> also<00:02:40.750> gave

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
lot easier to train and they also gave

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.110 
lot easier to train and they also gave
you<00:02:41.379> a<00:02:41.409> couple<00:02:41.859> nice<00:02:42.010> areas<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.549> train<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:42.970> can

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
you a couple nice areas to train you can

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.210 
you a couple nice areas to train you can

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
moon pool which I'm doing or which I did

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.759 
moon pool which I'm doing or which I did
earlier<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.909> video<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.599> there's<00:02:50.590> pretty

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
earlier in this video and there's pretty

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.330 
earlier in this video and there's pretty
much<00:02:50.889> just<00:02:51.579> pretty<00:02:52.329> good<00:02:52.810> places<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.950> train

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
much just pretty good places to train

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.240 
much just pretty good places to train
and<00:02:54.609> I<00:02:54.639> really<00:02:54.879> like<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.319> also<00:02:56.319> what<00:02:56.980> else

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
and I really like that also what else

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.750 
and I really like that also what else
they<00:02:57.549> did<00:02:57.790> they<00:02:57.970> put<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.359> a<00:02:58.540> couple<00:02:59.290> new<00:02:59.760> new

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
they did they put in a couple new new

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.759 
they did they put in a couple new new
ideas<00:03:01.269> that<00:03:01.510> have<00:03:01.720> never<00:03:02.200> been<00:03:02.560> like

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
ideas that have never been like

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.530 
ideas that have never been like
incorporated<00:03:03.519> with<00:03:03.639> zombies<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.329> I<00:03:04.389> thought

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
incorporated with zombies and I thought

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.819 
incorporated with zombies and I thought
that<00:03:04.659> was<00:03:04.750> kind<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.959> cool<00:03:05.019> there's<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.560> bomb

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
that was kind of cool there's the bomb

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.119 
that was kind of cool there's the bomb
like<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:07.239> person<00:03:07.720> who<00:03:07.959> planted<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.769> bomb<00:03:08.799> and

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
like the person who planted the bomb and

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.500 
like the person who planted the bomb and
you<00:03:09.220> had<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.459> go<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.609> fuse<00:03:09.909> a<00:03:09.939> bomb<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.480> I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
you had to go to fuse a bomb so I

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.000 
you had to go to fuse a bomb so I
thought<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.780> first<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.470> all<00:03:11.590> was<00:03:11.769> pretty

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
thought that first of all was pretty

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.640 
thought that first of all was pretty
cool<00:03:12.189> and<00:03:13.180> then<00:03:13.750> there's<00:03:13.930> also<00:03:14.079> like<00:03:14.439> this

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
cool and then there's also like this

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.509 
cool and then there's also like this
weird<00:03:15.040> drone<00:03:15.549> thing<00:03:15.939> and<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.450> holds<00:03:16.659> like<00:03:16.959> a

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
weird drone thing and it holds like a

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.220 
weird drone thing and it holds like a
perk<00:03:18.519> in<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.849> or<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.030> power<00:03:19.329> up<00:03:19.599> in<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.109> I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
perk in it or a power up in it and I

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.839 
perk in it or a power up in it and I
don't<00:03:20.409> even<00:03:20.500> know<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:20.799> kind<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.340> confused<00:03:21.730> me

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
don't even know that kind of confused me

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.309 
don't even know that kind of confused me
I<00:03:21.879> didn't<00:03:22.090> know<00:03:22.150> what<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.269> do<00:03:22.449> with<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.900> just

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
I didn't know what to do with it I just

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.780 
I didn't know what to do with it I just
started<00:03:23.560> shooting<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:24.129> a<00:03:24.190> bunch<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.549> some

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
started shooting it a bunch and some

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.539 
started shooting it a bunch and some
weird<00:03:25.030> stuff<00:03:25.299> came<00:03:25.569> out<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.220> yeah<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:27.459> I'm<00:03:27.519> not

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
weird stuff came out and yeah so I'm not

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.220 
weird stuff came out and yeah so I'm not
too<00:03:27.730> sure<00:03:28.000> about<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.329> but<00:03:28.389> it<00:03:28.599> is<00:03:28.720> new<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.139> it

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
too sure about that but it is new and it

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.379 
too sure about that but it is new and it
was<00:03:29.379> cool<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.889> I<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.129> that<00:03:30.190> also<00:03:30.940> another

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
was cool and I like that also another

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.740 
was cool and I like that also another
new<00:03:31.750> thing<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:32.410> one<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.519> care<00:03:34.299> packages

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
new thing is one of the care packages

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.770 
new thing is one of the care packages
that<00:03:35.230> come<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.680> on<00:03:35.949> it<00:03:36.730> gives<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.120> Sentinel

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
that come in on it gives you Sentinel

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780 
that come in on it gives you Sentinel
back<00:03:38.049> up<00:03:38.319> so<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:38.739> kind<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.099> brings<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.760> back

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
back up so that kind of brings it back

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.830 
back up so that kind of brings it back
to<00:03:40.359> like<00:03:41.699> survival<00:03:42.699> where<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.299> can<00:03:43.480> get<00:03:43.659> like

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
to like survival where you can get like

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.319 
to like survival where you can get like
backups<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.310> other<00:03:45.579> people<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.209> it's

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
backups and like other people so it's

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.629 
backups and like other people so it's
basically<00:03:46.510> computer<00:03:47.349> operated<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.250> players

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
basically computer operated like players

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.390 
basically computer operated like players
and<00:03:49.120> they<00:03:49.329> just<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:50.169> think<00:03:50.799> you<00:03:50.859> get<00:03:50.979> like<00:03:51.129> five

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
and they just I think you get like five

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.369 
and they just I think you get like five
or<00:03:51.760> four<00:03:52.000> or<00:03:52.090> five<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.299> them<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.659> they<00:03:53.199> just

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
or four or five of them and they just

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.140 
or four or five of them and they just
come<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:53.799> they<00:03:53.949> start<00:03:54.280> shooting<00:03:54.340> away<00:03:54.760> and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
come in and they start shooting away and

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.210 
come in and they start shooting away and
they<00:03:55.209> start<00:03:55.479> killing<00:03:55.629> zombies<00:03:56.199> and<00:03:56.440> they<00:03:56.470> last

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
they start killing zombies and they last

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.009 
they start killing zombies and they last
a<00:03:57.430> little<00:03:57.579> bit<00:03:57.699> not<00:03:57.970> too<00:03:58.000> long<00:03:58.329> obviously<00:03:58.840> but

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
a little bit not too long obviously but

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.330 
a little bit not too long obviously but
it<00:03:59.139> does<00:03:59.409> help<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.829> I<00:03:59.889> thought<00:04:00.040> that<00:04:00.099> was

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
it does help and I thought that was

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.800 
it does help and I thought that was
pretty<00:04:00.430> cool<00:04:00.699> that<00:04:00.879> they<00:04:01.000> incorporated<00:04:01.659> that

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
pretty cool that they incorporated that

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.830 
pretty cool that they incorporated that
into<00:04:01.870> zombies<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.919> one<00:04:03.819> more<00:04:04.030> thing<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.540> they

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
into zombies and one more thing is they

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.710 
into zombies and one more thing is they
added<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.349> new<00:04:05.530> power<00:04:05.799> up<00:04:06.099> it<00:04:06.340> was<00:04:06.579> the<00:04:06.879> infinite

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
added a new power up it was the infinite

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.619 
added a new power up it was the infinite
ammo<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:09.370> was<00:04:09.579> really<00:04:10.329> cool<00:04:10.569> really

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
ammo and that was really cool really

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.219 
ammo and that was really cool really
great<00:04:11.590> idea<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:13.000> basically<00:04:13.239> could<00:04:13.690> just<00:04:13.900> fire

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
great idea you basically could just fire

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.430 
great idea you basically could just fire
forever<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:16.000> that's<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.599> really<00:04:16.930> cool<00:04:17.260> power

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
forever and that's a really cool power

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.920 
forever and that's a really cool power
up<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.889> me<00:04:18.070> I've<00:04:18.609> been<00:04:18.729> waiting<00:04:19.000> for<00:04:19.239> that

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
up to me I've been waiting for that

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.689 
up to me I've been waiting for that
because<00:04:20.380> there<00:04:20.530> hasn't<00:04:20.680> really<00:04:20.889> been<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.370> thing

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
because there hasn't really been a thing

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.170 
because there hasn't really been a thing
like<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.560> when<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.800> saw<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.100> and<00:04:24.580> started

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
like it so when I saw that and started

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.670 
like it so when I saw that and started
shooting<00:04:25.449> away<00:04:25.870> it<00:04:26.050> just<00:04:26.080> felt<00:04:26.470> awesome

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
shooting away it just felt awesome

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.140 
shooting away it just felt awesome
because<00:04:27.009> you<00:04:27.250> don't<00:04:27.400> even<00:04:27.520> have<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.729> reload

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
because you don't even have to reload

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.240 
because you don't even have to reload
you<00:04:28.270> can<00:04:28.419> just<00:04:28.600> shoot<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.250> thousand

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
you can just shoot like a thousand

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.310 
you can just shoot like a thousand
bullets<00:04:30.639> after<00:04:30.940> bullets<00:04:31.479> after<00:04:31.660> bullets<00:04:32.169> you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
bullets after bullets after bullets you

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.020 
bullets after bullets after bullets you
really<00:04:32.530> don't<00:04:32.710> have<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.860> do<00:04:33.039> anything<00:04:33.310> so<00:04:33.789> I

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
really don't have to do anything so I

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.830 
really don't have to do anything so I
thought<00:04:34.539> that<00:04:34.720> was<00:04:34.810> a<00:04:34.870> really<00:04:34.900> cool<00:04:35.380> perk<00:04:35.650> and

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
thought that was a really cool perk and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.170 
thought that was a really cool perk and
or<00:04:37.840> sorry<00:04:38.470> so<00:04:38.889> I'm<00:04:39.039> saying<00:04:39.340> Perkins<00:04:39.789> that's<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
or sorry so I'm saying Perkins that's a

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.270 
or sorry so I'm saying Perkins that's a
really<00:04:40.419> cool<00:04:40.570> power<00:04:40.750> up<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.560> think<00:04:42.160> the

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
really cool power up and I think the

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.010 
really cool power up and I think the
only<00:04:42.460> thing<00:04:42.639> that<00:04:43.000> really<00:04:43.150> disappointed<00:04:43.990> me

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
only thing that really disappointed me

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.770 
only thing that really disappointed me
in<00:04:44.169> this<00:04:44.440> map<00:04:44.650> is<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.280> fact<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.880> it's<00:04:46.630> a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
in this map is the fact and it's a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.110 
in this map is the fact and it's a
little<00:04:46.930> bit<00:04:47.199> small<00:04:47.620> it's<00:04:48.009> not<00:04:48.220> huge<00:04:48.729> it's

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
little bit small it's not huge it's

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.310 
little bit small it's not huge it's
really<00:04:49.419> easy<00:04:49.600> to<00:04:49.750> find<00:04:49.990> your<00:04:50.169> way<00:04:50.289> around

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
really easy to find your way around

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.990 
really easy to find your way around
which<00:04:50.740> is<00:04:50.889> kind<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.190> annoying<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.699> I<00:04:51.729> kind<00:04:51.970> of

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
which is kind of annoying and I kind of

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.490 
which is kind of annoying and I kind of
do<00:04:52.180> like<00:04:52.300> bigger<00:04:52.570> maths<00:04:52.870> because<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.470> just

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
do like bigger maths because that just

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.800 
do like bigger maths because that just
gives<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:53.979> lot<00:04:54.160> more<00:04:54.220> to<00:04:54.580> do<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:54.759> stuff<00:04:55.180> but

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
gives you a lot more to do and stuff but

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.659 
gives you a lot more to do and stuff but
the<00:04:55.960> other<00:04:56.139> thing<00:04:56.289> that<00:04:56.349> could<00:04:56.680> kind<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.460> made

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
the other thing that could kind of made

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.170 
the other thing that could kind of made
me<00:04:57.849> let<00:04:58.030> mad<00:04:58.330> is<00:04:59.220> they<00:05:00.220> just<00:05:00.370> didn't<00:05:00.820> have<00:05:00.970> any

zombies<00:05:37.229> because<00:05:38.229> those<00:05:38.500> guns<00:05:38.710> are<00:05:38.860> actually

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
zombies because those guns are actually

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.460 
zombies because those guns are actually
good<00:05:39.370> like<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.970> don't<00:05:40.750> know<00:05:40.900> I<00:05:40.960> can't<00:05:41.199> think<00:05:41.349> of

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
good like I don't know I can't think of

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.080 
good like I don't know I can't think of
the<00:05:41.500> one<00:05:41.710> off<00:05:41.830> I<00:05:42.099> can't<00:05:42.460> think<00:05:42.580> of<00:05:42.699> one<00:05:42.820> off<00:05:42.970> the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
the one off I can't think of one off the

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.879 
the one off I can't think of one off the
top<00:05:43.240> of<00:05:43.300> my<00:05:43.419> head<00:05:43.479> but<00:05:43.840> adding<00:05:44.229> a<00:05:44.320> multi-player

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
top of my head but adding a multi-player

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.439 
top of my head but adding a multi-player
gun<00:05:45.099> would<00:05:45.280> make<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:45.639> so<00:05:45.669> much<00:05:45.909> better<00:05:46.060> because

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
gun would make it so much better because

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:47.790 
gun would make it so much better because
these<00:05:46.720> guns<00:05:46.990> are<00:05:47.110> actually<00:05:47.470> getting<00:05:47.590> pretty

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
these guns are actually getting pretty

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.100 
these guns are actually getting pretty
boring<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.310> use<00:05:48.610> because<00:05:49.360> first<00:05:49.870> of<00:05:49.960> all<00:05:50.080> I

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
boring to use because first of all I

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.110 
boring to use because first of all I
don't<00:05:50.409> even<00:05:50.500> like<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.070> paycheck<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:51.789> amelie

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
don't even like the paycheck and amelie

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.999 
don't even like the paycheck and amelie
they're<00:05:52.419> really<00:05:52.750> not<00:05:52.990> even<00:05:53.199> good<00:05:53.530> guns<00:05:53.770> the

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
they're really not even good guns the

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.040 
they're really not even good guns the
damage<00:05:54.460> is<00:05:54.610> low<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:55.060> really<00:05:55.419> heavy<00:05:55.630> weight

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
damage is low the really heavy weight

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.110 
damage is low the really heavy weight
and<00:05:56.320> like<00:05:56.949> I<00:05:57.070> get<00:05:57.280> out<00:05:57.430> of<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.580> box<00:05:57.789> and<00:05:58.000> I'm

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
and like I get out of the box and I'm

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.969 
and like I get out of the box and I'm
just<00:05:58.300> not<00:05:58.449> even<00:05:58.750> happy<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.229> get<00:05:59.349> it<00:05:59.530> so<00:05:59.770> there's

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
just not even happy to get it so there's

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.790 
just not even happy to get it so there's
really<00:06:00.159> not<00:06:01.090> a<00:06:01.150> lot<00:06:01.389> of<00:06:01.599> good<00:06:01.720> guns<00:06:02.289> to<00:06:02.560> choose

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
really not a lot of good guns to choose

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.370 
really not a lot of good guns to choose
from<00:06:03.039> I<00:06:03.490> actually<00:06:03.940> found<00:06:04.210> out<00:06:04.419> that<00:06:04.570> wall<00:06:05.020> guns

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
from I actually found out that wall guns

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.010 
from I actually found out that wall guns
are<00:06:05.770> even<00:06:06.759> like<00:06:06.940> pretty<00:06:07.150> much<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.509> same<00:06:07.720> oh

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
are even like pretty much the same oh

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.110 
are even like pretty much the same oh
and<00:06:08.740> one<00:06:08.919> more<00:06:08.949> thing<00:06:09.130> they<00:06:09.430> incorporated<00:06:09.970> the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
and one more thing they incorporated the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.719 
and one more thing they incorporated the
snap<00:06:10.360> our<00:06:10.919> teleportation<00:06:11.919> stuff<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.550> there's

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
snap our teleportation stuff and there's

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.790 
snap our teleportation stuff and there's
little<00:06:13.030> like<00:06:13.210> tunnels<00:06:13.960> we<00:06:14.080> can<00:06:14.320> teleport<00:06:14.680> from

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
little like tunnels we can teleport from

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.510 
little like tunnels we can teleport from
one<00:06:15.099> app

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
one app

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.059 
one app
one<00:06:15.879> end<00:06:16.240> of<00:06:16.449> the<00:06:16.509> map<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.259> other<00:06:17.410> there's

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
one end of the map to the other there's

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.129 
one end of the map to the other there's
also<00:06:18.280> this<00:06:18.669> thing<00:06:18.729> called<00:06:19.139> teleportation

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
also this thing called teleportation

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.809 
also this thing called teleportation
grenades<00:06:20.620> and<00:06:20.919> I<00:06:21.009> haven't<00:06:21.280> tried<00:06:21.490> them<00:06:21.669> out

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
grenades and I haven't tried them out

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:24.420 
grenades and I haven't tried them out
yet<00:06:21.879> but<00:06:22.270> I'm<00:06:22.840> guessing<00:06:23.500> you<00:06:23.770> throw<00:06:24.129> them<00:06:24.190> and

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
yet but I'm guessing you throw them and

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.219 
yet but I'm guessing you throw them and
wherever<00:06:24.580> you<00:06:24.759> throw<00:06:25.000> me<00:06:25.210> like<00:06:25.389> teleported<00:06:26.050> so

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
wherever you throw me like teleported so

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.930 
wherever you throw me like teleported so
I<00:06:26.259> actually<00:06:26.500> think<00:06:26.740> that's<00:06:26.979> pretty<00:06:27.220> cool<00:06:27.400> the

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
I actually think that's pretty cool the

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.230 
I actually think that's pretty cool the
grenade<00:06:28.270> part<00:06:28.539> at<00:06:28.659> least<00:06:28.690> maybe<00:06:29.110> not<00:06:29.409> the

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
grenade part at least maybe not the

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.999 
grenade part at least maybe not the
other<00:06:31.240> part<00:06:31.629> with<00:06:31.960> the<00:06:32.080> teleportation<00:06:32.620> but

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.009 
other part with the teleportation but

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:34.830 
other part with the teleportation but
that's<00:06:33.250> maybe<00:06:33.520> like<00:06:33.729> a<00:06:33.759> way<00:06:34.000> to<00:06:34.060> escape<00:06:34.389> like

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
that's maybe like a way to escape like

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.559 
that's maybe like a way to escape like
in<00:06:35.169> juries<00:06:35.889> where<00:06:36.400> they<00:06:36.550> had<00:06:36.669> the<00:06:36.849> teleporters

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569 
in juries where they had the teleporters

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.390 
in juries where they had the teleporters
so<00:06:38.139> that<00:06:38.259> is<00:06:38.379> kind<00:06:38.590> of<00:06:38.710> cool<00:06:38.860> and<00:06:39.069> especially

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
so that is kind of cool and especially

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.520 
so that is kind of cool and especially
teleportation<00:06:40.330> grenades<00:06:40.629> but<00:06:41.199> yeah<00:06:41.379> guys

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530
