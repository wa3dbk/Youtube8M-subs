less frustrating those who are new to

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.470 
less frustrating those who are new to
knitting<00:00:25.990> on<00:00:26.200> two<00:00:26.470> circulars<00:00:27.040> you<00:00:27.760> might

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
knitting on two circulars you might

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.830 
knitting on two circulars you might
prefer<00:00:29.010> needles<00:00:30.010> like<00:00:30.310> I've<00:00:30.579> got<00:00:30.880> here<00:00:31.480> that

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
prefer needles like I've got here that

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.750 
prefer needles like I've got here that
are<00:00:32.110> of<00:00:32.259> two<00:00:32.590> different<00:00:32.890> lengths<00:00:33.430> I've<00:00:33.579> got

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
are of two different lengths I've got

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.520 
are of two different lengths I've got
one<00:00:34.030> 16<00:00:34.810> inch<00:00:35.050> needle<00:00:35.470> in<00:00:35.680> one<00:00:36.340> 20<00:00:36.820> inch<00:00:37.000> needle

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
one 16 inch needle in one 20 inch needle

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.250 
one 16 inch needle in one 20 inch needle
makes<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.680> easier<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.040> just<00:00:39.190> keep<00:00:39.520> track<00:00:39.820> of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
makes it easier to just keep track of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
makes it easier to just keep track of
which<00:00:41.260> needle<00:00:42.220> end<00:00:42.520> belongs<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.420> which<00:00:43.630> cable

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
which needle end belongs to which cable

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.370 
which needle end belongs to which cable
so<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:45.399> take<00:00:45.760> your<00:00:45.940> two<00:00:46.180> needles<00:00:47.020> and<00:00:47.290> it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
so you take your two needles and it

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.900 
so you take your two needles and it
doesn't<00:00:47.710> matter<00:00:47.920> whether<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.490> use<00:00:48.520> the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
doesn't matter whether you use the

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.600 
doesn't matter whether you use the
shorter<00:00:49.300> one<00:00:49.540> or<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.050> longer<00:00:50.440> one<00:00:50.650> but<00:00:51.430> you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
shorter one or the longer one but you

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.450 
shorter one or the longer one but you
align<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.330> tips<00:00:52.630> like<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:54.040> you<00:00:54.220> hold

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
align the tips like this and you hold

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.030 
align the tips like this and you hold
them<00:00:54.610> in<00:00:54.730> your<00:00:54.850> left<00:00:55.030> hand<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:56.590> you<00:00:56.710> take<00:00:56.920> the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
them in your left hand then you take the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.460 
them in your left hand then you take the
end<00:00:57.220> of<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:57.730> yarn<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.780> pass<00:00:59.020> it<00:00:59.260> between

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
end of the yarn and you pass it between

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.060 
end of the yarn and you pass it between
the<00:01:00.100> two<00:01:00.130> needles<00:01:00.700> with<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.540> tail<00:01:01.890> coming<00:01:02.890> out

the stitches are on the cable and both
ends<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.930> needle<00:02:42.230> are<00:02:42.470> hanging<00:02:42.860> down<00:02:43.269> now

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
ends of the needle are hanging down now

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.080 
ends of the needle are hanging down now
you'll<00:02:45.019> want<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.319> take<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.620> other<00:02:45.860> end<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.879> the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
you'll want to take the other end of the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.970 
you'll want to take the other end of the
top<00:02:47.360> needle<00:02:47.810> here<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:49.510> we'll<00:02:50.510> knit<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.620> first

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
top needle here and we'll knit the first

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:01.589 
top needle here and we'll knit the first
three<00:02:52.579> loops<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.810> are<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.319> top<00:02:54.860> needle

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:17.619 

so<00:03:02.599> we've<00:03:02.750> got<00:03:03.549> one<00:03:09.069> two<00:03:10.069> three<00:03:16.329> now<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.390> see

we<00:03:17.750> have<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.959> couple<00:03:18.319> extra<00:03:18.560> loops<00:03:19.129> on<00:03:19.459> there

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
we have a couple extra loops on there

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.690 
we have a couple extra loops on there
just<00:03:20.690> go<00:03:20.959> ahead<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:21.650> let<00:03:21.859> them<00:03:22.040> fall<00:03:22.370> right

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
just go ahead and let them fall right

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.069 
just go ahead and let them fall right
off<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:26.319> let<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:27.530> tail<00:03:28.359> just<00:03:29.359> hang<00:03:29.750> there

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
off and let this tail just hang there

loop<00:04:16.760> of<00:04:17.000> these<00:04:17.329> three<00:04:17.900> stitches<00:04:18.700> one<00:04:20.440> two

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
loop of these three stitches one two

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.300 
loop of these three stitches one two
three<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.320> doesn't<00:04:24.620> matter<00:04:24.770> if<00:04:25.099> you're<00:04:25.280> a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
three and it doesn't matter if you're a

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.040 
three and it doesn't matter if you're a
thrower<00:04:25.610> like<00:04:25.729> I<00:04:26.060> am<00:04:26.210> or<00:04:26.599> if<00:04:26.870> you're<00:04:27.020> a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
thrower like I am or if you're a

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.409 
thrower like I am or if you're a
continental<00:04:27.710> knitter<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:28.760> works<00:04:29.030> either<00:04:29.300> way

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
continental knitter it works either way

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.490 
continental knitter it works either way
now<00:04:30.289> to<00:04:30.349> finish<00:04:30.650> up<00:04:32.050> we're<00:04:33.050> going<00:04:33.139> to<00:04:33.199> knit

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
now to finish up we're going to knit

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.680 
now to finish up we're going to knit
across<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:34.099> first<00:04:34.430> needle<00:04:34.789> one<00:04:35.060> more<00:04:35.330> time

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
across that first needle one more time

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.230 
across that first needle one more time
just<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.919> have<00:04:37.159> enough<00:04:37.610> fabric<00:04:37.880> to

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
just so that you have enough fabric to

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.910 
just so that you have enough fabric to
perform

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
perform

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.670 
perform
the<00:04:39.420> necessary<00:04:40.420> increases<00:04:43.020> for<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.110> toe<00:04:44.320> if

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
the necessary increases for the toe if

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.320 
the necessary increases for the toe if
you<00:04:44.830> start<00:04:45.100> right<00:04:45.250> now<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.730> gets<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:46.090> little

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
you start right now it gets a little

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.900 
you start right now it gets a little
tight<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.200> little<00:04:47.470> wonky<00:04:47.710> so<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:48.700> good<00:04:48.880> to

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
tight and a little wonky so it's good to

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.000 
tight and a little wonky so it's good to
knit<00:04:49.240> one<00:04:49.420> and<00:04:49.450> a<00:04:49.630> half<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:50.440> also<00:04:50.590> see<00:04:50.980> that

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
knit one and a half you also see that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.950 
knit one and a half you also see that
there's<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.610> loop<00:04:51.910> right<00:04:52.150> here<00:04:52.390> that's<00:04:52.660> kind

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
there's this loop right here that's kind

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.100 
there's this loop right here that's kind
of<00:04:53.110> sloppy<00:04:54.040> that's<00:04:54.790> from<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.180> tail<00:04:55.540> just<00:04:55.960> go

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
of sloppy that's from this tail just go

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.660 
of sloppy that's from this tail just go
ahead<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.470> give<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:56.770> slight<00:04:57.100> tug<00:04:57.400> don't

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
ahead and give that a slight tug don't

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.450 
ahead and give that a slight tug don't
over<00:04:58.030> tug<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.480> want<00:04:58.660> it<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:58.900> match<00:04:59.220> the<00:05:00.220> gauge

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
over tug you want it to match the gauge

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.930 
over tug you want it to match the gauge
of<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.210> other<00:05:01.360> stuff<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:03.070> you<00:05:03.460> may<00:05:03.640> need<00:05:03.790> to

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
of the other stuff and you may need to
