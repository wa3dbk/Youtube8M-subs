demands<00:00:35.780> for<00:00:36.079> this<00:00:36.260> frame<00:00:36.559> were<00:00:36.860> really

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
demands for this frame were really

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.990 
demands for this frame were really
climbing<00:00:38.380> mountains<00:00:39.380> deep<00:00:39.770> snow

so<00:00:41.510> we've<00:00:41.690> taken<00:00:41.960> some<00:00:42.680> of<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:42.980> functions<00:00:43.610> out

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
so we've taken some of the functions out

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.940

that<00:00:44.450> we<00:00:44.630> would<00:00:44.780> normally<00:00:44.989> have<00:00:45.260> in<00:00:45.410> our<00:00:45.649> trail
