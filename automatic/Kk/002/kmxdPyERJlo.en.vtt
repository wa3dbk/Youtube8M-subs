 you're tweeting but let's start 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.040
 with the theme of today everything started 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.750
 when the professor of integral calculus 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.240
 he told us today I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.850
 very complex integrals that 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.100
 they are going to see until the university and that 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.860
 only those who are going to study 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.180
 physics or mathematics as such so the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.259
 version that I'm going to teach you now is going to 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.820
 be line and at that moment 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.590
 I knew that was the subject of which 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.289
 we had to talk about today 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.670
 light products and diets in case 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.550
 my professor of integral calculus 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.979
 laziness jacobo wong a lot today in me 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.899
 there are all light products for 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.319
 all and imagine until there are the 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.580
 calzones light or the thongs by 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.619
 regular light products go 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.690
 focused on making you lose weight but 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.729
 let me inform you that they are not miraculous 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.770
 It also depends on what you decide 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.140
 do for you if you fight and what 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.810
 they want to see are tips then on 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.920
 the TV and watch the commercials of taking 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.710
 more water group 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.330
 so much attentive if yes because then so 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.090
 regular it happens that they go to the tacos and 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.979
 something like this happens but it's four tacos 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.840
 of your dog you give me eight shepherd's tacos 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.260
 German 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.950
 and a light soda is that I'm on a diet 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:22.170
 and I tell you good from something to nothing nothing I 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.750
 that's why I'm in the kiwi diet as 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.940
 everything except kiwi but good sometimes I 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.950
 I think about the diets that they contain 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.850
 as salads but but imagine the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.020
 cows eat grass like you do not have 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.780
 idea and how are they 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.540
 the cows not like that is that better not you 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.460
 eat the herbs smoke fabrics but good 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.500
 finally you decide to make a diet and 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.540
 Well, whether you see the doctor or 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.600
 one that you download online or any 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.700
 thing starts to leave breakfast yogurt 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.950
 with apple food a breast of 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.470
 roasted pterodactyl breast results 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.100
 that they give you very rare products that 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.590
 your life you will find then and 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.860
 then why solution do we go for 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.320
 the miraculous products that according to this 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.120
 you already eat it and all that and you go to 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.040
 go down though really who says that 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.440
 this is fat how all the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.160
 commercials that advertise those products 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.250
 you're fat tired of those pounds of 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.140
 however you no longer closes the pants up 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.120
 the scale is hidden from you so you do not 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.640
 pairs on her as she buys 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.140
 morelia not the fungus that is going to make you 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.360
 get off 58 kilos in less than 3 minutes 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.520
 imagine how many things to bring that 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.500
 mushroom by l 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.830
 goal these products I do not think that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.740
 work and then what better to decide 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.540
 for starting a diet or because it was like 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.410
 the arm of all to start a 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.290
 diet they tell you if they go I start and it's not 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.810
 that today is Friday today is already from pozole 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.690
 better Monday on Monday we started the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.420
 diet vale falls on mondays to start 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.090
 diets I want to see you and then search 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.410
 Another way to lose weight faster 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.410
 are the products for sports 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.560
 miraculous with the new flip-flops 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.380
 chakwal in just walks will suffice with that 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.780
 you walk 8 kilometers a day to one 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.910
 speed as if you were running 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.170
 only that so simple just walk 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.900
 afterwards and it turns out that just by walking 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.000
 you will lose weight but how much do you have 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.250
 to walk because I say with any 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.580
 shoe has chancla huarache or barefoot 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.889
 you're going to lose weight if you walk that 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.349
 there's also the brooch that I think 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.039
 The main function of the baker is not the 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:52.740
 to lose weight but to loosen up 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.500
 you should eat it then if you lose weight 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.060
 way or with three kilos of 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.430
 pumpkin that's good about this already 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.889
 you lowered your three kilos is not be vest 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.770
 with your hand what you are going to say goes out 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.840
 fundamental or night gone my best advice 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.219
 is take your time and leave the ends of 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.770
 week to run if you can not 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:13.590
 midweek or tailor a few crunches 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.940
 something more you fit not as it should 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.889
 be king there are not some we have 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.159
 tried everything and nothing else we do not go down 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.590
 of weight and what we do to blame 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.889
 our metabolism is that no way or 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.599
 I'm wide-bony I'm from bone 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.879
 wide then that's why I can not 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.199
 come down after all I think everyone 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.440
 we know what fattens and the first thing 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.599
 Fat if it tastes fat if you do not have 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.460
 taste you can eat it without any problem 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.199
 I'll teach you something else if you 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.340
 fattening and up to nine months will go 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.360
 to see 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.939
 and no no 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.889
 And if you have a few extra pounds, 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.389
 worry has its advantages 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.460
 I say if you want to get a tattoo 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.560
 more body where tattooing is you if 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.439
 you want to tattoo a trailer without 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.569
 problems by pause trailer here not you 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:02.439
 you have to worry about the belt at 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.509
 end is not seen and a point that I would like 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:07.569
 touch is the fast food fast 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.400
 food usually all it fattens 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.919
 because it has a lot of fat but also 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.259
 there are salad bars that 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.779
 they are very good and you can 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.340
 try a salad and everything though to 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.719
 those of the fast food do not leave you neither 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.039
 even think what you're going to 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.449
 ask good afternoon friends 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.629
 welcome to the donalds burger in which you 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.969
 we can help yes very good afternoon 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.409
 how much does a hamburger cost? 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.819
 the super combos that cost 39 pesos 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.039
 each one but if you want it with potatoes and 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.389
 soda will cost you 69 pesos now 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.099
 that yes it is the number 2 as it costs you 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.300
 45 pesos but if you want it with potatoes or 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.400
 soda can change the potatoes by 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.340
 onion rings and they will cost you 68 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.750
 massive weights and up north china 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.570
 Thank you very much but 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.160
 how much does a hamburger alone cost? 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.390
 burger alone costs 17 pesos but if 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.070
 you want it with potatoes and soda you're going to 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.300
 cost in 39 pesos but if you ask for it 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:59.169
 the comfortable of today will cost you 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:01.069
 only 25 pesos plus iva a hamburger 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.479
 then a simple hamburger is 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:05.080
 well for 19 pesos more we can add 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.080
 potatoes and soda 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.789
 then you have two very good reasons 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:13.340
 not to buy in fast foods or 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:16.260
 fast food and I've also run into several 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.830
