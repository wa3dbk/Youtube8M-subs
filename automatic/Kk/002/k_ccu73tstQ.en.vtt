 his frame is made of aluminum 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.240
 alloy brand 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.240
 6061 this stuff is pretty light 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.340
 the bike weighs about 16 kilograms and 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.920
 besides steady corrosion 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.040
 what is important for the Russian climate floor 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.240
 neco integrated steering wheel 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.240
 allows you to understate the center of gravity 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.050
 improve handling and aerodynamics 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.250
 bicycle 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.620

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.590

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.390
 switch shimano black 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.680
 provide the rider to choose from 21 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.500
 speed transmission 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.390
 by the way shift knob shifters 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:52.490
 shimano altus ef51 cartridge order 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.490
 gkb 910 brakes at my apache 20 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 disc mechanical from tektro novela 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.270
 wheels with double rims with a diameter of 26 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.270
 inches 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.270
 completely tired of these characteristics though 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.670
 have a ride in the park and relax 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.760
 you are still looking how to choose 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.850
 on the growth of the mountain urban or highway 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.850
 bicycle 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.060
 here you just measure your 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.810
 height and see what size and you 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.210
 will fit if your height is indicated immediately in 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.550
 two lines then I advise you to pay 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.590
 attention to availability 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.690
 depreciation seatpost 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.240
 if he is, then you will not be able to limit 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.500
 lowering the seat means better to choose 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.500
 smaller frame 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.080
 the figure is of course good but the most 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.470
 the main thing when choosing a bike is just 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.750
 sit on it is very important to 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.730
 distance between you and the top tube 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.420
 there was not less than 10 centimeters besides 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.209
 of this 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.190
 notice the position of your legs 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.620
 when you sit on the bike 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.470
 if the toe is set on the pedal 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.170
 which is in the down position to 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.630
 the leg should be slightly bent if 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.630
 toe pry pedal from the bottom then leg 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.220
 It should be fully extended all 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.290
 it is very important to install a saddle 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.360
 parallel to the surface of the earth by the way 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.540
 since this bike is for active 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.540
 ride his seat is narrow and hard 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.390
 had a good day my indian is not 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.670
 disappoint while sheâ€™s skating 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.640
 I had time to take a break from routine and recharge 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.100
 positive for the whole work week so 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.620
 friends reach your bikes soon 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.080

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.910
