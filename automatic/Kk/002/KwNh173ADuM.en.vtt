transit just so you know is in the
tunnels<00:06:16.300> or<00:06:16.569> the<00:06:17.110> diner<00:06:17.379> the<00:06:17.949> diner<00:06:18.189> is<00:06:18.370> my

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
tunnels or the diner the diner is my

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.939 
tunnels or the diner the diner is my
main<00:06:19.060> spot<00:06:19.389> where<00:06:19.779> I<00:06:19.810> run<00:06:20.110> around<00:06:20.229> and<00:06:20.710> the

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
main spot where I run around and the

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:22.589 
main spot where I run around and the
Gibbs<00:06:21.189> if<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:21.759> don't<00:06:21.939> know<00:06:22.000> what<00:06:22.149> Gibbs<00:06:22.389> are

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
Gibbs if you don't know what Gibbs are

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.809 
Gibbs if you don't know what Gibbs are
that's<00:06:23.110> how<00:06:23.319> many<00:06:23.500> hits<00:06:23.889> from<00:06:24.219> zombies<00:06:24.639> you've

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
that's how many hits from zombies you've

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.300 
that's how many hits from zombies you've
had<00:06:25.029> so<00:06:25.839> there<00:06:25.990> you<00:06:26.110> go<00:06:26.199> guys<00:06:26.409> that's<00:06:26.469> the<00:06:26.979> main

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
had so there you go guys that's the main

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.219 
had so there you go guys that's the main
thing<00:06:27.610> and<00:06:27.819> the<00:06:28.180> ranking<00:06:28.539> system<00:06:28.569> works<00:06:29.080> by

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
thing and the ranking system works by

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.589 
thing and the ranking system works by
from<00:06:29.529> kills<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:30.190> downs

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
from kills to downs

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.730 
from kills to downs
and<00:06:31.689> just<00:06:32.559> say<00:06:32.679> no<00:06:32.710> my<00:06:33.099> ratio<00:06:33.849> is<00:06:34.029> is<00:06:34.270> 121<00:06:35.259> so

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
and just say no my ratio is is 121 so

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.399 
and just say no my ratio is is 121 so
basically<00:06:36.399> for<00:06:36.849> kills<00:06:37.119> and<00:06:37.389> you<00:06:37.539> didn't<00:06:37.929> for

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
basically for kills and you didn't for

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.600 
basically for kills and you didn't for
me<00:06:38.589> I<00:06:38.619> would<00:06:38.860> do<00:06:38.979> nine<00:06:39.159> thousand<00:06:39.580> three

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
me I would do nine thousand three

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.149 
me I would do nine thousand three
hundred<00:06:39.789> and<00:06:40.089> three<00:06:40.499> divided<00:06:41.499> by<00:06:41.529> sixty

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:42.159 
hundred and three divided by sixty

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.119 
hundred and three divided by sixty
seventy<00:06:43.149> six<00:06:43.449> and<00:06:43.659> I<00:06:43.839> would<00:06:43.990> give<00:06:44.229> you<00:06:44.409> a<00:06:44.679> ratio

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
seventy six and I would give you a ratio

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:47.579 
seventy six and I would give you a ratio
so<00:06:45.429> always<00:06:45.610> do<00:06:45.879> the<00:06:46.419> amount<00:06:46.629> of<00:06:46.719> kills<00:06:47.020> you<00:06:47.139> got

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:47.589 
so always do the amount of kills you got

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.949 
so always do the amount of kills you got
so<00:06:47.919> put<00:06:48.189> in<00:06:48.399> the<00:06:48.610> number<00:06:48.939> of<00:06:48.969> kills<00:06:49.270> got<00:06:49.569> then

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:49.959 
so put in the number of kills got then

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.409 
so put in the number of kills got then
divide<00:06:50.409> it<00:06:50.439> by<00:06:50.740> the<00:06:51.189> number<00:06:51.399> of<00:06:51.639> downs<00:06:51.969> and

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
divide it by the number of downs and

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.839 
divide it by the number of downs and
then<00:06:53.139> you'll<00:06:53.319> get<00:06:53.499> your<00:06:53.679> k/d<00:06:53.919> ratio<00:06:54.069> if<00:06:54.669> you

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
then you'll get your k/d ratio if you

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.739 
then you'll get your k/d ratio if you
have<00:06:54.969> it<00:06:55.119> over<00:06:56.429> 150<00:06:57.429> or<00:06:57.610> 200<00:06:58.270> you<00:06:58.389> will<00:06:58.569> get<00:06:58.689> the

00:06:58.739 --> 00:06:58.749 
have it over 150 or 200 you will get the

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:00.239 
have it over 150 or 200 you will get the
shotguns<00:06:59.169> if<00:06:59.319> you<00:06:59.469> have<00:06:59.589> it<00:06:59.770> over<00:06:59.949> a<00:07:00.159> hundred

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:00.249 
shotguns if you have it over a hundred

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:03.839 
shotguns if you have it over a hundred

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
and seven you will get the knife if you

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.029 
and seven you will get the knife if you
have<00:07:04.089> it<00:07:04.270> over<00:07:04.509> fifty<00:07:04.990> you'll<00:07:05.199> get<00:07:05.349> the<00:07:05.529> skull
