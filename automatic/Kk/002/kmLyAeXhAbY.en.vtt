Protoss his at enemies kinky when
playing<00:00:19.650> as<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.400> blue<00:00:20.820> zerg<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
playing as the blue zerg and this is the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.599 
playing as the blue zerg and this is the
close<00:00:22.199> by<00:00:22.410> air<00:00:22.590> positions<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.460> is

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
close by air positions and this is

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.529 
close by air positions and this is
actually<00:00:23.789> game<00:00:24.330> 2<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:25.430> PPG<00:00:26.430> bubbles<00:00:26.849> vs<00:00:27.150> kinky

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
actually game 2 of PPG bubbles vs kinky

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.439 
actually game 2 of PPG bubbles vs kinky
they<00:00:27.750> were<00:00:27.869> matched<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.939> back<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.060> back<00:00:30.240> on

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
they were matched can back to back on

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.659 
they were matched can back to back on
ladder<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.830> after<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> game<00:00:32.460> 2

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
ladder and so this is after the game 2

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
ladder and so this is after the game 2
and<00:00:32.850> if<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:32.969> guys<00:00:33.180> haven't<00:00:33.450> seen<00:00:33.570> game<00:00:33.899> 1<00:00:34.110> i'll

and if you guys haven't seen game 1 i'll

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.380 
and if you guys haven't seen game 1 i'll
put<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> link<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> description<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.210> an

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
put a link in the description and an

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
put a link in the description and an
annotation<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:36.899> about<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.770> go<00:00:38.219> check

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
annotation right about now so go check

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
annotation right about now so go check
it<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.879> pretty<00:00:39.210> funny<00:00:39.450> anyway<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.110> this

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it out it's pretty funny anyway so this

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.130 
it out it's pretty funny anyway so this
is<00:00:40.410> game<00:00:40.710> 2<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> PPG<00:00:42.629> bubbles<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.020> now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
is game 2 and so PPG bubbles right now

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
is game 2 and so PPG bubbles right now
putting<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.920> 9<00:00:44.280> pylon<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.700> his<00:00:45.030> mate<00:00:45.210> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
putting down a 9 pylon and his mate and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.190 
putting down a 9 pylon and his mate and
it<00:00:45.570> looks<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.140> stinky<00:00:46.680> Hopi<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:48.200> 7

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it looks like stinky Hopi going for a 7

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.100 
it looks like stinky Hopi going for a 7
cool<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.360> might<00:00:51.629> build<00:00:51.930> off

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
cool and so this this might build off

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.430 
cool and so this this might build off
off<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.280> game<00:00:53.520> 1<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.440> stinky

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
off a little bit of game 1 and stinky

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
off a little bit of game 1 and stinky
may<00:00:55.800> wanted<00:00:56.250> may<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.670> wanted<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.120> actually

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
may wanted may have wanted to actually

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.930 
may wanted may have wanted to actually
hard<00:00:57.840> counter<00:00:58.170> PPG<00:00:58.859> bubbles<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.430> cannon<00:00:59.760> build

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
hard counter PPG bubbles as cannon build

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
hard counter PPG bubbles as cannon build

off<00:01:06.540> entirely<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.290> stinky<00:01:07.650> I'm<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
off entirely so stinky I'm not going to

off entirely so stinky I'm not going to
be<00:01:08.340> scouting<00:01:08.729> about<00:01:09.510> half<00:01:09.750> way<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.260> pulls

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
be scouting about half way when it pulls

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.170 
be scouting about half way when it pulls
on<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> very<00:01:11.220> important<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.880> very

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
on this is very important this is very

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.570 
on this is very important this is very
important<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> actually<00:01:13.200> find<00:01:13.740> out<00:01:13.920> where<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
important to actually find out where the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.920 
important to actually find out where the
opponent<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.390> send<00:01:15.630> your<00:01:15.689> links

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
opponent is so you can send your links

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.120 
opponent is so you can send your links
in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.080> direct<00:01:16.320> or<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:16.979> direction

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
in the direct or in the right direction

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.120 
in the direct or in the right direction
and<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.299> map<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.380> never<00:01:19.530> spun<00:01:19.799> close

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and on this map you can never spun close

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
and on this map you can never spun close
fun<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.640> usually<00:01:21.000> people<00:01:21.270> always<00:01:21.509> check<00:01:22.110> cross

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
fun so usually people always check cross

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.010 
fun so usually people always check cross
and<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:23.400> close<00:01:23.790> by<00:01:24.000> air<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> does<00:01:24.840> look

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
and then close by air and it does look

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.830 
and then close by air and it does look
like<00:01:25.170> PPG<00:01:25.560> bubbles<00:01:25.890> has<00:01:26.580> no<00:01:26.970> gateway<00:01:27.330> yet<00:01:27.540> it's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
like PPG bubbles has no gateway yet it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.690 
like PPG bubbles has no gateway yet it's
already<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.200> 14<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> apply<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.460> looks<00:01:29.640> like

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
already at 14 to apply so it looks like

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.740 
already at 14 to apply so it looks like
he's<00:01:29.939> gonna<00:01:30.119> go<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.829> 14<00:01:31.829> Nexus<00:01:32.310> before<00:01:33.299> Galen

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
he's gonna go for 14 Nexus before Galen

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.039 
he's gonna go for 14 Nexus before Galen
this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> extremely<00:01:34.950> risky<00:01:35.400> against<00:01:36.390> any<00:01:36.689> kind

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
this is extremely risky against any kind

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.950 
this is extremely risky against any kind
of<00:01:37.229> aggressive<00:01:37.500> opening<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.570> one<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> six

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
of aggressive opening and one of the six

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
of aggressive opening and one of the six
or<00:01:40.140> seven<00:01:40.560> pools<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> most

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
or seven pools actually one of the most

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.789 
or seven pools actually one of the most
aggressive<00:01:41.759> openings<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> became<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.619> we're

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
aggressive openings it became so we're

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.560 
aggressive openings it became so we're
gonna<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.100> how<00:01:44.280> PPG<00:01:44.700> bubbles<00:01:45.030> does<00:01:45.329> actually

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
gonna see how PPG bubbles does actually

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
gonna see how PPG bubbles does actually
hold<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.200> he's<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.530> 200<00:01:47.009> minerals<00:01:47.399> right

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
hold this up he's at 200 minerals right

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
hold this up he's at 200 minerals right
now<00:01:47.640> he<00:01:48.060> still<00:01:48.360> hasn't<00:01:48.509> put<00:01:48.780> down<00:01:48.899> any<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.500> of

now he still hasn't put down any kind of
gateway<00:01:49.829> or<00:01:50.369> Nexus<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.320> right<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.490> stinky

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
gateway or Nexus and right now stinky

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.789 
gateway or Nexus and right now stinky
actually<00:01:53.880> has<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.329> cross<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:55.140> scouted<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
actually has this cross or scouted the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.859 
actually has this cross or scouted the
cross<00:01:56.070> position<00:01:56.549> sorry<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> he<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.659> moving

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
cross position sorry and he is moving

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
cross position sorry and he is moving
down<00:01:58.079> into<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.500> closer<00:01:58.710> he<00:01:59.009> knows<00:01:59.130> exactly

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
down into the closer he knows exactly

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.280 
down into the closer he knows exactly
where<00:01:59.880> PPG<00:02:00.210> bubbles<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.840> he<00:02:01.170> actually

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
where PPG bubbles is and he actually

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.810 
where PPG bubbles is and he actually
Scouts<00:02:01.649> us<00:02:01.799> piling<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> ground<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
Scouts us piling on the ground and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
Scouts us piling on the ground and
there's<00:02:02.969> no<00:02:03.210> gateway<00:02:03.540> no<00:02:03.750> fortune<00:02:04.140> cannon<00:02:04.439> now

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
there's no gateway no fortune cannon now

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.730 
there's no gateway no fortune cannon now
what<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.009> gonna<00:02:05.100> say<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.399> stinky<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
what this is gonna say to stinky is that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.839 
what this is gonna say to stinky is that
PPG<00:02:07.740> bubbles<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> gonna<00:02:08.459> actually<00:02:08.640> be

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
PPG bubbles is gonna actually be

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.969 
PPG bubbles is gonna actually be
expanding<00:02:09.599> at<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> low<00:02:10.259> ground<00:02:10.470> that's<00:02:10.830> why

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
expanding at the low ground that's why

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.120 
expanding at the low ground that's why
the<00:02:11.039> pylon<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.580> exposed

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
the pylon is exposed

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.070 
the pylon is exposed
obviously<00:02:12.460> and<00:02:13.120> thus<00:02:13.240> kinky<00:02:13.570> actually<00:02:13.930> gives

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
obviously and thus kinky actually gives

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.050 
obviously and thus kinky actually gives

bubbles doesn't have a gateway he's got

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.880 
bubbles doesn't have a gateway he's got
500<00:02:25.570> minutes<00:02:25.690> he<00:02:25.960> just<00:02:26.350> saw<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.560> drone

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
500 minutes he just saw the drone

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.590 
500 minutes he just saw the drone
actually<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.730> joint<00:02:27.940> actually<00:02:28.180> blocked<00:02:28.420> his

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
actually the joint actually blocked his

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.510 
actually the joint actually blocked his
natural<00:02:29.020> from<00:02:29.230> putting<00:02:29.710> down<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.040> Nexus<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
natural from putting down the Nexus and

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.160 
natural from putting down the Nexus and
so<00:02:30.880> he<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.390> started<00:02:31.570> his<00:02:31.720> forward<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.110> a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
so he just started his forward to a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.560 
so he just started his forward to a
six-link<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.860> his<00:02:32.980> face<00:02:33.130> pulling<00:02:33.790> out<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.940> huge

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
six-link in his face pulling out a huge

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.720 
six-link in his face pulling out a huge
number<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.870> SC<00:02:35.170> fees<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.220> basically<00:02:36.370> a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
number of SC fees so this is basically a

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.320 
number of SC fees so this is basically a
six<00:02:37.090> pool<00:02:37.330> or<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.660> seven<00:02:38.170> pool<00:02:38.350> versus<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.330> 15

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
six pool or a seven pool versus a 15

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the probes that actually walk through

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.510 
the probes that actually walk through
the<00:02:43.930> zerglings<00:02:44.200> that's<00:02:44.500> very<00:02:44.860> very<00:02:45.070> important

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
the zerglings that's very very important

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520 
the zerglings that's very very important
you<00:02:45.940> want<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.180> get<00:02:46.300> maximal<00:02:46.900> surface<00:02:47.230> area

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
you want to get maximal surface area

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.590 
you want to get maximal surface area
when<00:02:47.980> there's<00:02:48.160> early<00:02:48.490> ling<00:02:49.030> aggression<00:02:49.480> and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
when there's early ling aggression and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.150 
when there's early ling aggression and
what<00:02:50.020> he<00:02:50.170> did<00:02:50.290> was<00:02:50.350> he<00:02:50.500> actually<00:02:50.680> right-click

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
what he did was he actually right-click

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.180 
what he did was he actually right-click
the<00:02:51.190> minerals<00:02:51.670> there<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.950> probes

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
the minerals there and so the probes

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.620 
the minerals there and so the probes
could<00:02:54.400> walk<00:02:54.610> through<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.120> then<00:02:55.180> right<00:02:55.480> as

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
could walk through and then right as

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.570 
could walk through and then right as
they<00:02:55.810> were<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.530> middle<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.010> he

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
they were in the middle of it he

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.490 
they were in the middle of it he
attacked<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.300> as<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.690> can<00:02:58.810> see<00:02:58.840> he<00:02:59.170> selected

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
attacked and as you can see he selected

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.620 
attacked and as you can see he selected
a<00:02:59.650> part<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.340> his<00:03:00.490> probes<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.940> other<00:03:01.060> section

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
a part of his probes the other section

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.480 
a part of his probes the other section
of<00:03:01.780> his<00:03:01.900> probes<00:03:02.140> on<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.470> 18<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:02.950> he

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
of his probes on the 18 and he

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.100 
of his probes on the 18 and he
controlled<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.120> part<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.390> his<00:03:04.510> probe<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.900> use

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
controlled a part of his probe to use

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.960 
controlled a part of his probe to use
those<00:03:05.350> probes<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.920> blank<00:03:06.400> because<00:03:06.550> if<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.820> have

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
those probes a blank because if you have

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.020 
those probes a blank because if you have
every<00:03:07.240> single<00:03:07.420> probe<00:03:07.750> on<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.140> same<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:09.030> control

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
every single probe on the same a control

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.370 
every single probe on the same a control
group<00:03:10.120> they'll<00:03:10.390> be<00:03:10.570> moving<00:03:10.690> at<00:03:10.990> once<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.290> it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
group they'll be moving at once and it

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.690 
group they'll be moving at once and it
won't<00:03:11.500> really<00:03:11.650> accomplish<00:03:12.100> anything<00:03:12.190> but<00:03:12.610> if

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
won't really accomplish anything but if

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.670 
won't really accomplish anything but if
you<00:03:12.820> can<00:03:12.970> cut<00:03:13.180> off<00:03:13.210> movement<00:03:13.660> from<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.320> zerg

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
you can cut off movement from the zerg

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800 
you can cut off movement from the zerg
so<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.220> can<00:03:15.460> flank<00:03:15.910> them<00:03:16.000> from<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.390> sides<00:03:16.570> get

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
so you can flank them from the sides get

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.390 
so you can flank them from the sides get
a<00:03:16.840> complete<00:03:17.200> surround<00:03:17.440> because<00:03:17.710> the<00:03:18.010> workers

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
a complete surround because the workers

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.130 
a complete surround because the workers
ironically<00:03:18.940> are<00:03:19.300> better<00:03:19.600> than<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.870> zerglings

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
ironically are better than the zerglings

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.750 
ironically are better than the zerglings
in<00:03:20.380> combat<00:03:20.770> just<00:03:20.980> because<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.610> many

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
in combat just because you have so many

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.390 
in combat just because you have so many
and<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.590> flanking<00:03:23.590> tech<00:03:23.770> that<00:03:24.010> he<00:03:24.100> did<00:03:24.280> you

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
and that flanking tech that he did you

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.430 
and that flanking tech that he did you
can<00:03:24.550> see<00:03:24.730> he's<00:03:24.880> constantly<00:03:25.330> moving<00:03:26.170> his

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
can see he's constantly moving his

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.560 
can see he's constantly moving his
workers<00:03:26.770> in<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.160> then<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.150> mineral

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
workers in and then with the mineral

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.540 
workers in and then with the mineral
walk<00:03:28.870> tool<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.470> then<00:03:29.590> just<00:03:29.830> attacking<00:03:30.280> and

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
walk tool and then just attacking and

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.070 
walk tool and then just attacking and
allows<00:03:30.790> all<00:03:30.970> those<00:03:31.210> workers<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.660> attack<00:03:31.870> at

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
allows all those workers to attack at

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.660 
allows all those workers to attack at
once<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.440> he<00:03:32.770> actually<00:03:32.920> delayed<00:03:33.340> long<00:03:33.640> enough

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
once and he actually delayed long enough

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.850 
once and he actually delayed long enough
to<00:03:34.120> actually<00:03:34.270> get<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.780> photon<00:03:35.200> cannon<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.680> his

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
to actually get a photon cannon in his

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.920 
to actually get a photon cannon in his
face<00:03:36.040> unfortunately<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.850> don't<00:03:37.360> think<00:03:37.750> that

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
face unfortunately I don't think that

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.180 
face unfortunately I don't think that
photon<00:03:38.290> cannon<00:03:38.530> will<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.770> able<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:38.920> reach<00:03:39.070> out

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
photon cannon will be able to reach out

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.740 
photon cannon will be able to reach out
surfing<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:39.640> he<00:03:39.820> may<00:03:40.000> have<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.330> put<00:03:40.480> on<00:03:40.600> his

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
surfing so he may have to put on his

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.530 
surfing so he may have to put on his
second<00:03:41.110> one<00:03:41.260> there's<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.310> photon<00:03:42.700> cannon<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.180> do

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
second one there's a photon cannon I do

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.240 
second one there's a photon cannon I do
you<00:03:43.720> think<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.080> photon<00:03:44.410> cannon<00:03:44.709> has<00:03:44.890> range

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
you think that photon cannon has range

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.940 
you think that photon cannon has range
to<00:03:45.400> protect<00:03:45.730> his<00:03:46.209> photon<00:03:46.959> cannon<00:03:47.290> buddy<00:03:47.500> and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
to protect his photon cannon buddy and

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.290 
to protect his photon cannon buddy and
if<00:03:48.070> we<00:03:48.100> take<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.310> look<00:03:48.400> at<00:03:48.670> this<00:03:48.760> workspace<00:03:49.000> he's

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
if we take a look at this workspace he's

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.960 
if we take a look at this workspace he's
done<00:03:49.630> for<00:03:50.200> harvesters<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.490> think<00:03:51.730> he<00:03:51.850> is

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
done for harvesters and I think he is

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.120 
done for harvesters and I think he is
cuz<00:03:52.209> he<00:03:52.330> brought<00:03:52.570> those<00:03:52.720> initial<00:03:53.170> initial

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
cuz he brought those initial initial

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.280 
cuz he brought those initial initial
drums<00:03:54.580> with<00:03:54.790> him<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.180> actually

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
drums with him to actually

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.319 
drums with him to actually
put<00:03:56.890> on<00:03:56.980> more<00:03:57.250> pressure<00:03:57.489> in<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.700> beating<00:03:58.000> so

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
put on more pressure in the beating so

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.089 
put on more pressure in the beating so
it<00:03:58.390> does<00:03:58.569> look<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.019> second<00:03:59.409> can<00:03:59.590> it's

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
it does look like the second can it's

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.349 
it does look like the second can it's
having<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.370> little<00:04:00.579> bit<00:04:00.700> more<00:04:00.819> difficult<00:04:01.030> time

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
having a little bit more difficult time

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.240 
having a little bit more difficult time
going<00:04:01.599> up<00:04:01.840> right<00:04:01.870> now<00:04:02.109> but<00:04:02.349> there<00:04:02.469> are<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.709> large

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
going up right now but there are a large

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.709 
going up right now but there are a large
number<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.640> zerglings<00:04:03.969> on<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.390> field<00:04:04.599> right

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:04.719 
number of zerglings on the field right

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.630 
number of zerglings on the field right
now<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.049> more<00:04:05.290> are<00:04:05.439> being<00:04:05.469> rally<00:04:05.829> but<00:04:06.400> once

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
now and more are being rally but once

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.099 
now and more are being rally but once
you<00:04:06.760> get<00:04:06.879> a<00:04:06.939> few<00:04:07.000> photon<00:04:07.450> cannons<00:04:07.719> up<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.989> is

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
you get a few photon cannons up it is

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.500 
you get a few photon cannons up it is
extremely<00:04:08.739> difficult<00:04:08.950> for<00:04:09.340> zerg<00:04:09.730> player<00:04:09.819> to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
extremely difficult for zerg player to

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.839 
extremely difficult for zerg player to
actually<00:04:10.930> break<00:04:11.200> with<00:04:11.530> non<00:04:12.099> speedlings<00:04:12.609> and

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
actually break with non speedlings and

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.880 
actually break with non speedlings and
so<00:04:13.180> we<00:04:13.720> have<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.049> photon<00:04:14.379> cannon<00:04:14.680> shooting

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
so we have the photon cannon shooting

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.069 
so we have the photon cannon shooting
away<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.849> last<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.359> circles<00:04:16.690> haven't

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
away and the last of the circles haven't

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.509 
away and the last of the circles haven't
cleaned<00:04:17.259> up<00:04:17.350> but<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.620> second<00:04:18.070> for<00:04:18.220> dark<00:04:18.370> and

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
cleaned up but that second for dark and

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.620 
cleaned up but that second for dark and
it<00:04:18.579> has<00:04:18.729> only<00:04:20.519> 49<00:04:21.519> live<00:04:21.759> maps<00:04:22.030> are<00:04:22.210> not<00:04:22.449> for

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
it has only 49 live maps are not for

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.300 
it has only 49 live maps are not for
work<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:22.960> putting<00:04:23.590> down<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.800> cyber<00:04:24.009> Corps<00:04:24.190> now

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
work and putting down a cyber Corps now

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.950 
work and putting down a cyber Corps now
what<00:04:24.490> he<00:04:24.610> did<00:04:24.639> here<00:04:25.060> was<00:04:25.090> very<00:04:25.509> smart<00:04:25.780> he

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
what he did here was very smart he

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.870 
what he did here was very smart he
actually<00:04:26.110> puts<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.650> pylon<00:04:27.039> in<00:04:27.340> a<00:04:27.430> cyber<00:04:27.610> Corps

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
actually puts a pylon in a cyber Corps

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.760 
actually puts a pylon in a cyber Corps
just<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.449> reduce<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.840> surface<00:04:29.020> area<00:04:29.289> around

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
just to reduce the surface area around

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.140 
just to reduce the surface area around
the<00:04:29.949> photon<00:04:30.250> cannon<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:30.699> that<00:04:30.849> makes<00:04:31.060> it

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
the photon cannon so that makes it

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.120 
the photon cannon so that makes it
harder<00:04:31.389> to<00:04:31.419> kill<00:04:31.630> but<00:04:32.169> sadly<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.830> photon

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
harder to kill but sadly the photon

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.450 
harder to kill but sadly the photon
cannon<00:04:33.430> did<00:04:33.580> go<00:04:33.699> down<00:04:34.229> however<00:04:35.229> he<00:04:36.039> does<00:04:36.220> have

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
cannon did go down however he does have

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.300 
cannon did go down however he does have
the<00:04:36.870> he<00:04:37.870> does<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.229> enough<00:04:38.650> workers<00:04:38.949> that<00:04:39.250> he

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
the he does have enough workers that he

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.909 
the he does have enough workers that he
can<00:04:39.460> just<00:04:39.490> ward<00:04:39.940> away<00:04:40.349> small<00:04:41.349> numbers<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.680> sort

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
can just ward away small numbers of sort

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.450 
can just ward away small numbers of sort
of<00:04:41.979> things<00:04:42.099> as<00:04:42.280> long<00:04:42.520> as<00:04:42.759> skanky<00:04:43.449> keep<00:04:43.780> sending

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
of things as long as skanky keep sending

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.310 
of things as long as skanky keep sending
right<00:04:45.460> now<00:04:45.610> stinky<00:04:46.060> actually<00:04:46.389> says<00:04:46.660> never

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
right now stinky actually says never

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.610 
right now stinky actually says never
seen<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.740> lucky<00:04:48.400> guy<00:04:48.729> at<00:04:48.970> least<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.449> game<00:04:49.690> so

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
seen a lucky guy at least the game so

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.510 
seen a lucky guy at least the game so
this<00:04:50.979> is<00:04:51.130> pretty<00:04:51.370> funny<00:04:51.699> considering<00:04:52.229> he<00:04:53.520> PPG

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
this is pretty funny considering he PPG

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.939 
this is pretty funny considering he PPG
bubbles<00:04:54.910> actually<00:04:55.300> did<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:55.720> worst<00:04:56.590> possible

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
bubbles actually did the worst possible
