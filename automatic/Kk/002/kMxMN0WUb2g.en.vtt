which<00:01:23.460> makes<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:23.910> harder<00:01:24.120> now<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.660> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
which makes it much harder now if you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.240 
which makes it much harder now if you
had<00:01:24.840> 28<00:01:25.140> supermodels<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.800> might<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> lot

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
had 28 supermodels it might be a lot

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.920 
had 28 supermodels it might be a lot
easier<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> pull<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:26.820> because<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.900> know

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
easier to pull off because you know

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
easier to pull off because you know
they're<00:01:28.260> so<00:01:28.530> used<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.010> but<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.400> quite

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
they're so used to it but it was quite

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.130 
they're so used to it but it was quite
interesting<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.060> try<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.420> make<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.570> work<00:01:30.690> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
interesting to try and make it work and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.810 
interesting to try and make it work and
it's<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.070> picture<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:34.760> think<00:01:35.760> it
