 if you have a number that has lasted 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.409

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.340
 they will ask you two or three numbers 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.410
 telephone calls that you have called 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.840
 often they have them registered 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.380
 on the switch in the database of the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.150
 company 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.560

 the company verifies still in the base of 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.560
 data associated with that identification number 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.380

 activated unwittingly to our 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.840

 then go to the company to make the claim 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.260
 if it is a number that you have used 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.629
 for a long time as we had planned 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.310

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.290
 name we invite the companies of 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.329

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.889
 greater effort to guide their 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.829
