00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.269
 the cartridge contains three chambers 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.400
 separate containing a sponge one 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.610
 for the color there is one for magenta 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.490
 and one for the yellow the sponge holds 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.760
 the ink the places to insert 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.039
 the reloading needle is therefore three 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.859
 for each color with a pointed object 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.349
 like the tip of a scissors make a 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 small hole on the side of the cartridge a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.660
 depending on the color you need 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.230
 recharge in this position they have 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.750
 yellow and magenta 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.059
 insert lake of the refill and inject 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.980
 the ink very slowly in the four 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.730
 corresponding to the color you want 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.739
 in this case reload the yellow not 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.210
 inject too much ink because 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.809
 drummers cause problems to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.649
 printer is often sufficient 34 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.660
 milliliters close the refill hole 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.969
 with a little tape 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.969
 or with a drop of silicone glue 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.160
 clean the nozzles with a soft cloth 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.470
 moistened with water, replace the cartridge 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.680
 printer wi fi some print of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.850
 test 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.370
 charging is completed another way 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.740
 to recharge and enlarging the holes of 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.230
 ventilation that are under the label but 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.210
 since they are precisely ventilation holes 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.680
 and they must let in only a certain amount 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.640
 amount of air 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.950
 I think it is better to make a suitable oven 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.170
 to determine if a cartridge stops 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.630
 it has been rechargeable for a long time or not 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.450
 use this method to take a 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.490
 paper towel fold it a couple of 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.140
 times and then catch it against the birds 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.170
 if i teach that leaves on the napkin e 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.790
 then probably adjust the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.759
 cartridge not augelli clogged for gaza 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.560
 give the message of empty cartridges 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.369
 press and hold for about 5 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.040
 seconds 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.899
 the paper advance rate in some 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.060
 however, models must be kept pressed 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.780
 even for a minute until you do 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.840
 hear a click 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.970
 at this point the cartridge though 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.620
 will be reported as empty will continue to 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.620
 print until there is ink 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.910
 the printer has an internal memory that 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.860
 record the serial number of the cartridges 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.450
 so it is normal for the cartridge to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.540
 you just reloaded to be elected as 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.980
 empty even though the memory is full 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.459
 record only the last four 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.709
 ammunition 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.380
 so if he entered four different ones 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.450
 even empty cartridges one after the other and 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.150
 right after the one you just e 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.980
 recharged the printer should 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.980
 acknowledge accepting it as full
