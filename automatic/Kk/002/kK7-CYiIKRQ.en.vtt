strange let's go on to the other parts

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
strange let's go on to the other parts
of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> hardware<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.190> iphone<00:00:35.550> 5<00:00:35.969> now

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
of the hardware the iphone 5 now

of the hardware the iphone 5 now
features<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.870> HD<00:00:37.320> 720p<00:00:38.100> centered<00:00:38.640> FaceTime

camera and let's go ahead and compare

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.660 
camera and let's go ahead and compare
this<00:00:41.550> thickness<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> iPhone<00:00:43.530> 5<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.100> said

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
this thickness so the iPhone 5 is said

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.880 
this thickness so the iPhone 5 is said
to<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.850> eighteen<00:00:45.420> percent<00:00:45.629> thinner<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.350> just

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to be eighteen percent thinner at just

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.529 
to be eighteen percent thinner at just
seven<00:00:47.160> point<00:00:47.340> six<00:00:47.550> millimeters<00:00:48.120> compared<00:00:48.450> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
seven point six millimeters compared to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.600 
seven point six millimeters compared to
the<00:00:48.629> iphone<00:00:48.750> 4s<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.190> notice<00:00:50.370> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the iphone 4s and you can notice that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
the iphone 4s and you can notice that
there<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.969> difference<00:00:51.690> right<00:00:52.500> off<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.680> bat

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
there is a difference right off the bat

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.790 
there is a difference right off the bat
is<00:00:53.219> also<00:00:53.879> twenty<00:00:54.120> percent<00:00:54.360> lighter<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.960> from

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
is also twenty percent lighter and from

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
is also twenty percent lighter and from
picking<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.489> feels<00:00:56.820> much<00:00:57.180> lighter<00:00:57.480> than

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
picking up it feels much lighter than

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
picking up it feels much lighter than
the<00:00:57.840> iphone<00:00:58.140> 4s<00:00:58.590> believe<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.309> maybe

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the iphone 4s believe it or not maybe

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.670 
the iphone 4s believe it or not maybe
because<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.510> thinner<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.500> weight

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
because it's just thinner and the weight

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
because it's just thinner and the weight
makes<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.489> feel<00:01:02.640> overall<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> smaller

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
makes it just feel overall a smaller

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
makes it just feel overall a smaller
device<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.019> i<00:01:04.049> definitely<00:01:04.290> think<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.799> feels

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
device but i definitely think it feels

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.310 
device but i definitely think it feels
very<00:01:05.129> very<00:01:05.670> great<00:01:05.939> my<00:01:06.150> hand<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.110> definitely

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
very very great my hand and I definitely

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.880 
very very great my hand and I definitely
enjoy<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> new<00:01:08.189> hardware<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> iphone<00:01:09.270> 5

about<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.759> i<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.360> does<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
about but i do think it does have a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
about but i do think it does have a
little<00:01:39.960> bit<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.290> faster<00:01:40.740> transfer<00:01:41.070> speed

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
little bit of a faster transfer speed

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.039 
little bit of a faster transfer speed
not<00:01:41.700> too<00:01:41.939> much<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.329> difference<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:42.780> there

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
not too much of a difference but there

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.539 
not too much of a difference but there
definitely<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.619> something<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.430> would

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
definitely is something that you would

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.100 
definitely is something that you would
notice<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:45.119> you're<00:01:45.240> transferring<00:01:45.840> your

for<00:03:09.540> 1639<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.250> give<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.460> an<00:03:11.550> idea<00:03:11.610> i

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
for 1639 but just to give you an idea i

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.640 
for 1639 but just to give you an idea i
should<00:03:12.120> get<00:03:12.270> somewhere<00:03:12.540> around<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.780> 1600s

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650

4s<00:03:24.390> comes<00:03:24.630> out<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.020> score<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.380> we<00:03:25.470> also

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
4s comes out with the score that we also

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.960 
4s comes out with the score that we also
should<00:03:25.950> be<00:03:26.070> seeing<00:03:26.280> somewhere<00:03:26.670> around<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
should be seeing somewhere around the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.030 
should be seeing somewhere around the
600<00:03:27.510> range<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.530> definitely<00:03:28.740> see<00:03:29.010> a

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
600 range so you definitely see a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.380 
600 range so you definitely see a
difference<00:03:29.100> in<00:03:29.550> terms<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.970> score<00:03:30.360> here

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
difference in terms of the score here

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.260 
difference in terms of the score here
iPhone<00:03:31.140> 5<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.590> definitely<00:03:32.130> um<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.700> little<00:03:33.120> bit

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
iPhone 5 is definitely um a little bit

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.760 
iPhone 5 is definitely um a little bit
faster<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.720> iphone<00:03:33.990> 4s<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.380> wouldn't<00:03:34.680> say

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
faster in the iphone 4s I wouldn't say

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.290 
faster in the iphone 4s I wouldn't say
it's<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.950> huge<00:03:35.220> difference<00:03:35.640> when<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.940> test<00:03:36.180> it

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
it's a huge difference when you test it

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.630 
it's a huge difference when you test it
out<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.170> iphone<00:03:37.440> 5<00:03:37.650> does<00:03:37.980> overall<00:03:38.340> seems

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
out but the iphone 5 does overall seems

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.900 
out but the iphone 5 does overall seems
snappier<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.240> all<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.340> let's<00:03:41.640> just<00:03:41.760> go

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
snappier and all that so let's just go

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.390 
snappier and all that so let's just go
ahead<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.150> show<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.600> guys<00:03:42.720> um<00:03:43.340> kind<00:03:44.340> of

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
ahead and show you guys um kind of

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.770 
ahead and show you guys um kind of
scrolling<00:03:44.910> around<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.510> wouldn't<00:03:45.690> really

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
scrolling around you wouldn't really

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.930 
scrolling around you wouldn't really
notice<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.140> difference<00:03:46.170> but<00:03:46.800> iphone<00:03:47.250> 5<00:03:47.670> just

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
notice the difference but iphone 5 just

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.670 
notice the difference but iphone 5 just
overall<00:03:48.330> like<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.630> said<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.170> feels<00:03:49.380> snappier

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
overall like I said it feels snappier

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.680 
overall like I said it feels snappier

whatnot and when you're using Safari the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.820 
whatnot and when you're using Safari the
speeds<00:03:56.760> were<00:03:57.180> pretty<00:03:57.660> close<00:03:57.959> but<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.500> iphone

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
speeds were pretty close but the iphone

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.100 
speeds were pretty close but the iphone
5<00:03:59.100> does<00:03:59.310> also<00:03:59.490> get<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.850> edge<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.990> new

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
5 does also get the edge the new

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.050 
5 does also get the edge the new
processor<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.740> apple<00:04:02.070> a6<00:04:02.220> chip<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:02.850> said<00:04:03.030> to

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
processor the apple a6 chip is said to

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.759 
processor the apple a6 chip is said to
be<00:04:03.150> two<00:04:03.420> times<00:04:03.600> faster<00:04:03.959> than<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.110> iphone<00:04:04.380> 4s

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
be two times faster than the iphone 4s

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.199 
be two times faster than the iphone 4s
in<00:04:04.950> terms<00:04:05.100> of<00:04:05.220> graphics<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.880> speed

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
in terms of graphics and speed

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.479 
in terms of graphics and speed
performance<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:07.290> let's<00:04:07.650> go<00:04:07.830> ahead<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.070> first

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
performance so let's go ahead and first

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.330 
performance so let's go ahead and first
off<00:04:08.760> start<00:04:09.090> with<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.390> Wi-Fi<00:04:09.780> speed<00:04:10.200> test<00:04:10.500> so

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
off start with the Wi-Fi speed test so

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.340 
off start with the Wi-Fi speed test so
let's<00:04:11.580> start<00:04:11.790> out<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.030> iphone<00:04:12.510> 5<00:04:12.780> first

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.630 

so<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.500> download<00:04:16.830> speed<00:04:16.919> gets<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.370> pretty

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
so the download speed gets a pretty

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.759 
so the download speed gets a pretty
solid<00:04:17.880> score<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.269> 35<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.019> get<00:04:19.169> anywhere<00:04:19.620> between

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
solid score of 35 I get anywhere between

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.240 
solid score of 35 I get anywhere between
33<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.549> 42<00:04:21.269> on<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.570> iphone<00:04:21.900> 5<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.500> upload

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
33 and 42 on the iphone 5 and upload

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.460 
33 and 42 on the iphone 5 and upload
speed<00:04:23.430> usually<00:04:23.700> stays<00:04:23.910> constant<00:04:24.390> around<00:04:25.140> five

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470

device pretty much and the ping at 16
millisecond<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:31.890> definitely<00:04:32.280> very<00:04:32.310> very<00:04:32.610> good

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
millisecond is definitely very very good

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.570 
millisecond is definitely very very good
so<00:04:34.229> let's<00:04:34.410> go<00:04:34.590> ahead<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.830> jump<00:04:35.220> onto<00:04:35.430> the

so let's go ahead and jump onto the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.580 
so let's go ahead and jump onto the
iphone<00:04:36.030> 4s<00:04:41.360> ping<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.450> 19<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.050> pretty<00:04:43.350> close

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
iphone 4s ping of 19 it's pretty close

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.350 
iphone 4s ping of 19 it's pretty close
overall<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.220> won't<00:04:44.400> really<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:45.150> ping

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
overall you won't really the ping

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.550 
overall you won't really the ping
doesn't<00:04:45.600> really<00:04:45.750> matter<00:04:45.930> especially<00:04:46.200> at

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
doesn't really matter especially at

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.620 
doesn't really matter especially at
three<00:04:46.890> milliseconds<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:48.270> download

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
three milliseconds and the download

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.240 
three milliseconds and the download
speed<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:49.020> typically<00:04:49.470> get<00:04:49.680> somewhere<00:04:50.010> between

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
speed I typically get somewhere between

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.380 
speed I typically get somewhere between
15<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:50.850> 18<00:04:51.210> on<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.630> iPhone<00:04:52.320> 4<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.280> 4s<00:04:53.669> so

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
15 and 18 on the iPhone 4 and the 4s so

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.460 
15 and 18 on the iPhone 4 and the 4s so
that's<00:04:54.660> about<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.930> speed<00:04:55.110> we<00:04:55.229> should<00:04:55.380> be

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
that's about the speed we should be

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.020 
that's about the speed we should be
seeing<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.830> upload<00:04:56.130> speed<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.490> faster<00:04:56.940> than

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
seeing the upload speed is faster than

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.570 
seeing the upload speed is faster than
the<00:04:57.120> iphone<00:04:57.419> 4s<00:04:57.870> pretty<00:04:58.620> close<00:04:58.860> again<00:04:59.280> usually

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
the iphone 4s pretty close again usually

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.050 
the iphone 4s pretty close again usually
I<00:04:59.760> get<00:04:59.910> a<00:04:59.970> cap<00:05:00.540> around<00:05:00.930> five<00:05:01.229> so<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.700> can<00:05:02.850> see

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
I get a cap around five so you can see

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.000 
I get a cap around five so you can see
from<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.419> evidence<00:05:03.810> here<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.260> iPhone<00:05:04.650> 5<00:05:04.979> is

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
from the evidence here the iPhone 5 is

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.980 
from the evidence here the iPhone 5 is
nearly<00:05:05.640> double<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.150> speed<00:05:06.479> in<00:05:06.630> terms<00:05:06.810> of<00:05:06.900> the

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
nearly double the speed in terms of the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.420 
nearly double the speed in terms of the
Wi-Fi<00:05:07.349> compared<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.130> iphone<00:05:08.250> 4s

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
Wi-Fi compared to the iphone 4s

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.210 
Wi-Fi compared to the iphone 4s
so<00:05:10.060> now<00:05:10.930> that<00:05:11.170> we<00:05:11.230> got<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.470> statistic<00:05:12.010> let's

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
so now that we got the statistic let's

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.040 
so now that we got the statistic let's
go<00:05:12.370> ahead<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.790> check<00:05:12.970> out<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.300> Wi-Fi<00:05:13.660> speeds

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
go ahead and check out the Wi-Fi speeds

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.940 
go ahead and check out the Wi-Fi speeds
on<00:05:14.260> either<00:05:14.530> device<00:05:16.470> so<00:05:17.470> i<00:05:17.500> have<00:05:17.710> already

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
on either device so i have already

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.240 
on either device so i have already
cleared<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.340> history<00:05:18.520> here<00:05:19.920> let's<00:05:20.920> go<00:05:21.070> ahead

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
cleared the history here let's go ahead

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.530 
cleared the history here let's go ahead
and<00:05:21.400> just<00:05:21.550> some<00:05:21.790> search<00:05:22.450> something<00:05:24.480> okay<00:05:25.480> so

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
and just some search something okay so

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.070 
and just some search something okay so
three<00:05:25.990> two<00:05:26.620> one<00:05:27.250> go<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:30.750> there<00:05:31.750> you<00:05:31.900> can<00:05:32.050> see

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
three two one go and there you can see

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.380 
three two one go and there you can see
the<00:05:32.380> iphone<00:05:32.680> 5<00:05:32.950> did<00:05:33.250> beat<00:05:33.430> out<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.700> iphone<00:05:34.000> 4s

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
the iphone 5 did beat out the iphone 4s

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.360 
the iphone 5 did beat out the iphone 4s
again<00:05:35.020> not<00:05:35.410> too<00:05:35.590> much<00:05:35.710> of<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.920> difference<00:05:36.250> but

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
again not too much of a difference but

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.590 
again not too much of a difference but
let's<00:05:36.550> go<00:05:36.670> ahead<00:05:36.790> and<00:05:36.880> open<00:05:37.030> up<00:05:37.240> apple's

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
let's go ahead and open up apple's

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:46.140 
let's go ahead and open up apple's
website<00:05:38.280> three<00:05:39.280> two<00:05:39.820> one<00:05:40.360> go<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:45.060> there<00:05:46.060> you

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
website three two one go and there you

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.000 
website three two one go and there you
go<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:46.510> once<00:05:46.690> again<00:05:46.840> not<00:05:47.470> really<00:05:47.680> surprised

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
go so once again not really surprised

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.770 
go so once again not really surprised
Apple<00:05:48.550> did<00:05:48.730> say<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:48.970> get<00:05:49.210> about<00:05:49.360> two<00:05:49.600> times

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
Apple did say you get about two times

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.080 
Apple did say you get about two times
faster<00:05:50.260> speeds<00:05:50.560> on<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.740> iphone<00:05:51.190> 5<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:51.550> up<00:05:51.970> to

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
faster speeds on the iphone 5 and up to

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.530 
faster speeds on the iphone 5 and up to
150<00:05:52.690> megabytes<00:05:52.960> download<00:05:53.880> so<00:05:54.880> i<00:05:55.150> think<00:05:55.390> the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
150 megabytes download so i think the

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.510 
150 megabytes download so i think the
iphone<00:05:55.810> 4s<00:05:56.050> is<00:05:56.200> still<00:05:56.470> very<00:05:56.710> very<00:05:56.860> fast<00:05:57.280> at

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
iphone 4s is still very very fast at

least compared to the iphone 4 which is

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.110 
least compared to the iphone 4 which is
still<00:05:59.320> fast<00:05:59.650> but<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.250> iphone<00:06:00.610> 4s<00:06:00.910> and<00:06:01.030> the

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
still fast but the iphone 4s and the

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.910 
still fast but the iphone 4s and the
iphone<00:06:01.390> 5<00:06:01.660> are<00:06:01.900> pretty<00:06:02.140> close<00:06:02.410> in<00:06:02.590> terms<00:06:02.770> of
