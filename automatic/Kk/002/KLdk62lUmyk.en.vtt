00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to put a little more detail into your

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
to put a little more detail into your
campaigns<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.329> sounds<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> little

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
campaigns I know it sounds a little

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.630 
campaigns I know it sounds a little
intimidating<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:52.920> impossible

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
intimidating but it's not impossible

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.490 
intimidating but it's not impossible
essentially<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.539> need<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> give<00:00:55.110> them<00:00:55.260> more

essentially just need to give them more

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.430 
essentially just need to give them more
ideas<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.699> focus<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.840> if

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
ideas in which to focus on all right if

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
scenarios bigger right allow for some

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.500 
scenarios bigger right allow for some
more<00:01:04.170> generic<00:01:04.680> open<00:01:05.280> established<00:01:05.820> choices

really that's all right they need that
details<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> focus<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.560> doesn't<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
details to focus on so it doesn't so it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.120 
details to focus on so it doesn't so it
doesn't<00:01:42.540> lend<00:01:42.750> them<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> more<00:01:43.470> distraction

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
doesn't lend them to more distraction

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.469 
doesn't lend them to more distraction
because<00:01:44.280> they're<00:01:44.579> getting<00:01:44.820> bored<00:01:45.090> because

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
because they're getting bored because

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.149 
because they're getting bored because
they<00:01:45.600> feel<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.470> can't<00:01:46.770> participate

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
they feel like they can't participate

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.969 
they feel like they can't participate
because<00:01:47.670> you've<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.689> you've<00:01:48.990> scaled<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
because you've you all you've scaled the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.639 
because you've you all you've scaled the
scenario<00:01:50.490> down<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.090> small<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.229> big<00:01:52.409> thing

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
scenario down to small and the big thing

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.770 
scenario down to small and the big thing
to<00:01:52.770> keep<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.100> mind<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.240> nearly

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to keep in mind is is that it is nearly

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.499 
to keep in mind is is that it is nearly
impossible<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> players<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> not<00:01:56.850> split

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
impossible for the players to not split

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.050 
impossible for the players to not split
up<00:01:57.780> at<00:01:58.049> some<00:01:58.380> point<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.130> larger<00:01:59.610> campaign

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
up at some point in a larger campaign

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990 
up at some point in a larger campaign
it's<00:02:00.540> almost<00:02:01.200> always<00:02:01.590> bound<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> happen<00:02:02.520> but

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it's almost always bound to happen but

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.109 
it's almost always bound to happen but
again<00:02:03.119> that's<00:02:03.750> fine<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.860> key<00:02:05.250> goal<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.880> there

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
again that's fine the key goal in there

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.029 
again that's fine the key goal in there
is<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.659> spend<00:02:06.840> equal<00:02:07.049> time<00:02:07.229> between<00:02:07.680> your

group<00:02:40.349> B<00:02:40.620> has<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> lot<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.489> stuff<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.940> think

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
group B has a lot of stuff to think

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.089 
group B has a lot of stuff to think
about<00:02:42.420> as<00:02:42.659> far<00:02:43.079> as<00:02:43.260> where<00:02:43.500> they're<00:02:43.739> at<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
about as far as where they're at and

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.710 
about as far as where they're at and
what<00:02:44.280> they<00:02:44.400> choices<00:02:44.940> they<00:02:45.120> need<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.390> make<00:02:45.569> as

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
what they choices they need to make as

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.599 
what they choices they need to make as
well<00:02:45.870> -<00:02:46.109> don't<00:02:46.410> make<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.620> easy<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:46.890> them<00:02:47.190> you

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
well - don't make it easy for them you

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.460 
well - don't make it easy for them you
know<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.000> especially<00:02:48.120> if<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:49.049> gonna<00:02:49.170> have

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
know and especially if you're gonna have

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.259 
know and especially if you're gonna have
to<00:02:49.560> divide<00:02:49.829> your<00:02:50.040> attention<00:02:50.099> give<00:02:51.000> them<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
to divide your attention give them a

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.759 
to divide your attention give them a
lots<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.660> stuff<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.900> think<00:02:52.140> about<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.620> that

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
lots of stuff to think about so that

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.830 
lots of stuff to think about so that
when<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.129> move<00:02:53.670> over<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.390> next<00:02:54.569> group

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
when you move over to the next group

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390 
when you move over to the next group
you're<00:02:55.019> like<00:02:55.109> okay<00:02:55.349> what's<00:02:55.859> happening<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
you're like okay what's happening and

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.920 
you're like okay what's happening and
they<00:02:56.879> can<00:02:57.030> launch<00:02:57.299> right<00:02:57.540> into<00:02:57.599> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
they can launch right into the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.050 
they can launch right into the
decision-making<00:02:58.560> ability<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.280> shame<00:02:59.879> on

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
decision-making ability and shame on

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.309 
decision-making ability and shame on
them<00:03:00.209> if<00:03:00.329> they<00:03:00.420> haven't<00:03:00.750> had<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> chance<00:03:01.140> to

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
them if they haven't had a chance to

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.770 
them if they haven't had a chance to
think<00:03:01.470> about<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:02.099> know<00:03:02.420> that's<00:03:03.420> pretty

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
think about it you know that's pretty

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.920 
think about it you know that's pretty
much<00:03:03.959> what<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.260> comes<00:03:04.409> down<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.359> I<00:03:06.359> hope

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
much what it comes down to so I hope

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.780 
much what it comes down to so I hope
that's<00:03:07.200> helpful<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.859> then<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.489> gives<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
that's helpful and then that gives a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.599 
that's helpful and then that gives a
little<00:03:08.909> bit<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.980> little<00:03:10.980> bit<00:03:11.069> more<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.400> work
