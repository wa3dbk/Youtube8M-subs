getting all the glory so I was like well

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.170 
getting all the glory so I was like well
I'd<00:04:03.000> rather<00:04:03.239> save<00:04:03.830> lightning<00:04:04.830> helix<00:04:05.180> for

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
I'd rather save lightning helix for

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.420 
I'd rather save lightning helix for
something<00:04:06.510> else<00:04:06.660> use<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.560> call<00:04:07.739> glory<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.280> get

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
something else use the call glory to get

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.340 
something else use the call glory to get
two<00:04:08.640> things<00:04:08.850> done<00:04:09.000> here<00:04:09.300> one<00:04:09.570> if<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.930> kills<00:04:10.110> guy

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
two things done here one if it kills guy

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.680 
two things done here one if it kills guy
and<00:04:10.739> two<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.670> get<00:04:11.790> some<00:04:11.910> damage<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:12.330> rooms

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
and two is to get some damage to rooms

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.270 
and two is to get some damage to rooms
to<00:04:12.989> damage<00:04:13.320> through<00:04:13.440> either<00:04:13.620> way<00:04:13.920> his<00:04:14.100> guy

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
to damage through either way his guy

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.780 
to damage through either way his guy
would<00:04:14.459> die<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:15.150> i<00:04:15.209> would<00:04:15.360> get<00:04:16.609> extra<00:04:17.609> damage

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
would die and i would get extra damage

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.810 
would die and i would get extra damage
through<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:19.500> difference<00:04:19.890> is<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.100> lightning

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
through the difference is that lightning

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.130 
through the difference is that lightning
helix<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.180> more<00:04:21.330> versatile<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:21.840> i<00:04:21.870> want<00:04:22.049> to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
helix is more versatile so i want to

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.620 
helix is more versatile so i want to
leave<00:04:22.289> it<00:04:22.410> open<00:04:22.680> for<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.919> later<00:04:23.130> threats<00:04:23.630> now

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
leave it open for a later threats now

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.090 
leave it open for a later threats now

follow footsteps but the sword of fire

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.040 
follow footsteps but the sword of fire
and<00:06:05.340> ice<00:06:05.460> grants<00:06:06.150> protection<00:06:06.570> from<00:06:06.630> red<00:06:06.870> and

blue so if i had equipped it to the
other<00:06:09.270> guy<00:06:09.600> it<00:06:10.350> would<00:06:10.800> have<00:06:10.890> caused<00:06:11.010> the

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
other guy it would have caused the

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.430 
other guy it would have caused the
enchantment<00:06:11.610> to<00:06:11.669> fall<00:06:11.820> off<00:06:11.940> because

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
enchantment to fall off because

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.900 
enchantment to fall off because
protection<00:06:13.440> causes<00:06:14.130> enchantments<00:06:14.640> to<00:06:14.700> fall

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
protection causes enchantments to fall

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.270 
protection causes enchantments to fall
off<00:06:15.120> so<00:06:15.810> instead<00:06:16.200> i'm<00:06:16.410> forced<00:06:16.770> us<00:06:16.860> to<00:06:16.890> kill<00:06:17.130> my

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
off so instead i'm forced us to kill my

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.120 
off so instead i'm forced us to kill my
own<00:06:17.310> guy<00:06:17.640> and<00:06:18.000> even<00:06:18.600> now<00:06:18.990> even<00:06:19.530> if<00:06:19.620> i<00:06:19.740> had<00:06:19.890> still

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130
