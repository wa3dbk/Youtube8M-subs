on my computer that's gone properly now
computer<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:57.350> obviously<00:02:58.350> it's<00:02:58.560> quite

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
computer and obviously it's quite

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.170 
computer and obviously it's quite
similar<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.550> other<00:02:59.730> editions<00:03:00.090> of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
similar to the all the other editions of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.020 
similar to the all the other editions of
Windows<00:03:00.980> see<00:03:03.170> my<00:03:04.170> documents<00:03:04.860> our<00:03:05.250> pictures<00:03:05.790> of

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
Windows see my documents our pictures of

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.320 
Windows see my documents our pictures of
cinmarc<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.110> only<00:03:07.760> really<00:03:08.760> supported<00:03:09.180> one

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
cinmarc it only really supported one

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.640 
cinmarc it only really supported one
user<00:03:09.540> because<00:03:11.150> well<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:13.140> could<00:03:13.290> add<00:03:13.410> other

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
user because well you could add other

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.860 
user because well you could add other
users<00:03:13.769> by<00:03:14.310> creating<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.330> new<00:03:15.420> user<00:03:15.630> name<00:03:15.720> here

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
users by creating a new user name here

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.340 
users by creating a new user name here
but<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:17.370> way<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:18.450> stored<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.230> My

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
but the way that it it's stored the My

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.620 
but the way that it it's stored the My
Documents<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.920> such<00:03:20.160> only<00:03:21.120> really<00:03:21.450> worked

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
Documents and such only really worked

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.300 
Documents and such only really worked
for<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:21.959> user<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.850> that's<00:03:23.850> that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
for one user so that's that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.530 
for one user so that's that
obviously<00:03:26.310> we've<00:03:26.640> got<00:03:26.670> Outlook<00:03:27.299> Express

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
obviously we've got Outlook Express

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.069 
obviously we've got Outlook Express
which<00:03:28.109> was<00:03:28.319> Elvis<00:03:28.950> best<00:03:31.459> 5mm<00:03:33.079> obviously

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
which was Elvis best 5mm obviously

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.849 
which was Elvis best 5mm obviously
there's<00:03:34.829> default<00:03:35.250> email<00:03:35.959> okay<00:03:39.530> let's<00:03:40.530> see<00:03:40.769> if

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
there's default email okay let's see if

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:51.110 
there's default email okay let's see if
we<00:03:40.980> have<00:03:41.010> test<00:03:41.459> manager<00:03:48.680> no<00:03:49.680> we<00:03:49.889> don't<00:03:50.120> let's

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
we have test manager no we don't let's

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.080 
we have test manager no we don't let's
just<00:03:51.299> try<00:03:51.480> pressing<00:03:51.750> control<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.950> escape<00:03:53.340> no

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
just try pressing control and escape no

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.690 
just try pressing control and escape no
that's<00:03:54.239> perfectly<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.950> no<00:03:56.099> we<00:03:56.219> do<00:03:56.370> not<00:03:56.489> have<00:03:56.639> a

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
that's perfectly so no we do not have a

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.449 
that's perfectly so no we do not have a
test<00:03:56.909> manager<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:57.389> Windows<00:03:57.510> 98<00:03:58.310> which<00:03:59.310> is

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
test manager in Windows 98 which is

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.159 
test manager in Windows 98 which is
people<00:03:59.639> that<00:03:59.879> down<00:04:00.030> actually<00:04:00.419> really<00:04:00.689> thought

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
people that down actually really thought

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.360 
people that down actually really thought
it<00:04:01.319> would<00:04:01.439> go<00:04:01.560> back<00:04:02.159> a<00:04:02.189> bit<00:04:02.280> further<00:04:02.870> way<00:04:04.370> um

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
it would go back a bit further way um

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.589 
it would go back a bit further way um
online<00:04:06.260> services<00:04:07.260> what<00:04:07.439> we<00:04:07.560> got<00:04:07.680> in<00:04:07.769> there

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
online services what we got in there

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.659 
online services what we got in there
CompuServe<00:04:10.280> UK<00:04:11.689> give<00:04:12.689> that<00:04:13.340> why<00:04:14.340> not<00:04:14.519> let's

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
CompuServe UK give that why not let's

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.060 
CompuServe UK give that why not let's
install<00:04:14.939> CompuServe<00:04:16.639> now<00:04:17.639> windows<00:04:17.910> 98<00:04:18.209> was<00:04:18.449> a

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
install CompuServe now windows 98 was a

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.600 
install CompuServe now windows 98 was a
bugger<00:04:20.930> for<00:04:22.160> wanting<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.190> restart<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
bugger for wanting to restart the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.830 
bugger for wanting to restart the
computer<00:04:23.639> every<00:04:24.419> two<00:04:24.720> seconds<00:04:25.250> now<00:04:26.250> as<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:27.660> yet

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
computer every two seconds now as of yet

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.409 
computer every two seconds now as of yet
it<00:04:27.960> hasn't<00:04:28.110> be<00:04:28.229> started<00:04:28.620> obviously<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:30.330> I'm

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
it hasn't be started obviously but I'm

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.000 
it hasn't be started obviously but I'm
guessing<00:04:30.630> if<00:04:30.960> it's<00:04:31.169> installed<00:04:31.530> this<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.830> will

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
guessing if it's installed this it will

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:42.600 
guessing if it's installed this it will
sowhat's<00:04:32.520> way<00:04:32.760> for<00:04:32.940> this

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.980 

so<00:04:42.940> it's<00:04:43.060> taking<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.390> while<00:04:43.450> because

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
so it's taking a while because

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.230 
so it's taking a while because
chuckling<00:04:44.230> a<00:04:44.320> fast<00:04:44.850> operating<00:04:45.850> system<00:04:46.120> this

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
chuckling a fast operating system this

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.100 
chuckling a fast operating system this
here<00:04:46.630> we<00:04:46.750> go

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
here we go

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.270 
here we go
obviously<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.860> old<00:04:48.490> sort<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.240> install<00:04:49.570> wizard

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
obviously the old sort of install wizard

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.330 
obviously the old sort of install wizard
you<00:04:51.280> have<00:04:51.490> here<00:04:52.260> let's<00:04:53.260> install<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.860> Express

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
you have here let's install the Express

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.030 
you have here let's install the Express
they<00:04:55.270> gave<00:04:55.420> you<00:04:55.480> can<00:04:55.600> see<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.170> disk<00:04:56.770> and

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
they gave you can see the the disk and

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.790 
they gave you can see the the disk and
everything<00:04:57.460> going<00:04:57.700> mad<00:04:58.260> which<00:04:59.260> is<00:04:59.290> quite<00:04:59.560> cool

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
everything going mad which is quite cool

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.580 
everything going mad which is quite cool

creating a 32-bit virtual key if you

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.100 
creating a 32-bit virtual key if you
pick<00:05:12.430> well<00:05:12.640> let's<00:05:12.790> go<00:05:12.940> around<00:05:13.120> some<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.960> other

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110
