 Uh also with regard to operability take control in a small volume 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.839
 I've put a lot of effort into making it stand out. 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.680
 I was able to feel the orcs writing. 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:14.500
 The bulk of the bull is different from the Alpha 7r 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:17.020

 It is made of plastic material attached 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.410
 And all plastic material, but the uh off buyers

 All the dials are all missed as a result of correction When I put it in a bag like this

 There is a very solid improvement man in the form of not returning , 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.220
 Although the diamond is lighter than the shake , 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:48.260
 The stage is configured to be transparent in setting up the stage 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:52.070

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.940
 Two batteries are installed at the same time 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:45.580
 Because it is such a class that can sell sound , the part about the height is somewhat 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.580
 I can understand the features that are considered together considering battery rule thumb.
