Chromebook now if you're like me and you
do<00:00:23.090> a<00:00:23.120> lot<00:00:23.390> of<00:00:23.420> publishing<00:00:23.870> online<00:00:24.170> I<00:00:24.680> do<00:00:24.890> a<00:00:25.010> lot

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
do a lot of publishing online I do a lot

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.120 
do a lot of publishing online I do a lot
of<00:00:25.250> blogging<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:26.120> whatnot<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.130> sometimes

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
of blogging and whatnot and sometimes

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.480 
of blogging and whatnot and sometimes
it's<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.240> much<00:00:29.450> easier<00:00:29.990> if<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:30.560> have<00:00:30.710> a<00:00:30.740> stream

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
it's so much easier if I have a stream

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.540 
it's so much easier if I have a stream
of<00:00:31.640> thought<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.379> dictate<00:00:33.379> it<00:00:33.559> to<00:00:33.739> just<00:00:34.160> say<00:00:34.370> it

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
of thought to dictate it to just say it

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.880 
of thought to dictate it to just say it
because<00:00:34.879> you<00:00:35.000> can<00:00:35.180> speak<00:00:35.539> so<00:00:36.170> much<00:00:36.320> faster

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
because you can speak so much faster

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.770 
because you can speak so much faster
then<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:37.610> can't<00:00:37.910> type<00:00:39.280> so<00:00:40.280> I<00:00:40.700> just<00:00:41.480> wanted<00:00:41.690> to

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
then you can't type so I just wanted to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.139 
then you can't type so I just wanted to
show<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:42.079> a<00:00:42.500> little<00:00:42.860> shortcut<00:00:43.250> little<00:00:44.030> way

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
show you a a little shortcut little way

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.450
