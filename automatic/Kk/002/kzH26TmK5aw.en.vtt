00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
tell the story that they want to hear

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.979 
tell the story that they want to hear
they<00:00:50.070> discard<00:00:50.640> those<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.480> keep<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

others<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.739> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> customized

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
others it's kind of a customized

religion<00:00:54.809> within<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.199> religion<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.370> think

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
religion within a religion and I think

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.060 
religion within a religion and I think
that<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.719> better<00:00:58.050> served<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.710> step

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that they would be better served to step

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.630 
that they would be better served to step
back<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.699> look<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.270> entire<00:01:01.100> message<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
back and look at the entire message and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
back and look at the entire message and
say<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.780> message<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
say what is this message and that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.480 
say what is this message and that
probably<00:01:05.489> brings<00:01:05.850> me<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.740> 22<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> nun<00:01:07.950> site<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
probably brings me to 22 a nun site that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
probably brings me to 22 a nun site that
I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:08.909> help<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.750> Christians

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I think would help a lot of Christians

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.609 
I think would help a lot of Christians
but<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.100> very<00:01:11.130> disturbing<00:01:12.619> now

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
but it's going to be very disturbing now

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.940 
but it's going to be very disturbing now
if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:15.000> look<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> Bible<00:01:16.229> entirety

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
if you look at the Bible entirety

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.760 
if you look at the Bible entirety
Christians<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.729> been<00:01:18.119> told<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.530> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
Christians have been told that this is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.219 
Christians have been told that this is
their<00:01:19.950> religion<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> mic<00:01:21.630> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
their religion and this is the mic so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.789 
their religion and this is the mic so
they<00:01:23.009> read<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.150> study<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.810> discuss<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
they read and study and discuss that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.880 
they read and study and discuss that
entire<00:01:26.220> book<00:01:26.720> but<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.619> two

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
entire book but it's really in two

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.160 
entire book but it's really in two
halves<00:01:29.250> isn't<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.180> an<00:01:30.360> Old<00:01:30.540> Testament

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
halves isn't there is an Old Testament

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.630 
halves isn't there is an Old Testament
in<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.350> New<00:01:31.500> Testament<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.490> they

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
in a New Testament I think that they

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.109 
in a New Testament I think that they
should<00:01:32.670> look<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.070> from<00:01:35.070> afar<00:01:35.490> just

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
should look at that and from afar just

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.719 
should look at that and from afar just
to<00:01:36.240> ask<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> simple<00:01:36.990> question<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
to ask the simple question what is the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.940 
to ask the simple question what is the
message<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> New<00:01:39.659> Testament<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
message of the New Testament what is the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.249 
message of the New Testament what is the
message<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> old<00:01:41.729> test<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.110> in

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
message of the old test and I think in

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.490 
message of the old test and I think in
doing<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:43.979> will<00:01:44.130> come<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:45.500> understand

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
doing so they will come to understand

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.399 
doing so they will come to understand
something<00:01:46.860> very<00:01:47.280> profound<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
something very profound and I think that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.679 
something very profound and I think that
they<00:01:49.560> will<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.610> message<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
they will see that the message in the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.219 
they will see that the message in the
New<00:01:51.869> Testament<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> message<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.869> Christ

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
New Testament is the message of Christ

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.480 
New Testament is the message of Christ
which<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:57.290> unconditional<00:01:58.290> love<00:01:58.500> compassion

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
which is unconditional love compassion

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.709 
which is unconditional love compassion
even<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> point<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.290> he<00:02:02.070> says<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.850> give<00:02:03.570> you

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
even to the point of he says I give you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.380 
even to the point of he says I give you
only<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.350> command<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.729> too

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
only one command which is too

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.559 
only one command which is too
love<00:02:07.050> others<00:02:07.440> as<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.860> love<00:02:08.069> yourself<00:02:08.330> he<00:02:09.330> also

in and so this is repeated several times

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.539 
in and so this is repeated several times
are<00:03:50.519> out<00:03:50.640> there<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.410> think<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.650> people

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
are out there and I I think that people

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.960 
are out there and I I think that people
would<00:03:53.579> be<00:03:54.420> better<00:03:54.690> served<00:03:55.730> looking<00:03:56.730> at<00:03:56.850> that

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
would be better served looking at that

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.759 
would be better served looking at that
message<00:03:57.360> because<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.870> not<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.230> message<00:03:58.560> i'm

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
message because it's not the message i'm

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.979 
message because it's not the message i'm
hearing<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.310> reading<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.600> new<00:04:00.750> testament

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
hearing and reading in the new testament

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.810 
hearing and reading in the new testament
is<00:04:01.410> something<00:04:01.860> completely<00:04:02.010> different<00:04:02.640> i

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
is something completely different i

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.250 
is something completely different i
think<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.359> opposite<00:04:03.750> now<00:04:03.900> there's<00:04:04.109> one

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
think it's the opposite now there's one

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.460 
think it's the opposite now there's one
other<00:04:04.320> point<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.829> I<00:04:05.280> think<00:04:06.170> profound<00:04:07.170> and

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
other point that I think profound and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.610 
other point that I think profound and
that<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.600> Christians<00:04:09.600> have<00:04:09.660> been<00:04:10.049> good<00:04:10.410> weed

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
that is Christians have been good weed

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.610 
that is Christians have been good weed
into<00:04:10.859> thinking<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.670> is<00:04:12.030> there

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
into thinking that that is there

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.940 
into thinking that that is there
the<00:04:13.040> entirety<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:14.239> Bible<00:04:14.799> when<00:04:15.799> in

actuality it is two religions put in
together<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.590> Christianity<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.889> new

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
together it is Christianity in the new

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.800 
together it is Christianity in the new
traumatic<00:04:22.460> Testament<00:04:23.060> that's<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.600> message

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810

you have what you have the Torah and so

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.500 
you have what you have the Torah and so
people<00:04:51.520> especially<00:04:52.520> Americans<00:04:53.330> are

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
people especially Americans are

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.790 
people especially Americans are
completely<00:04:54.760> misguided<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:57.410> think<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
completely misguided and I think the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.670 
completely misguided and I think the
reasons<00:04:58.130> why<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:59.389> Catholic<00:04:59.930> Church<00:05:00.199> put<00:05:00.590> them

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
reasons why the Catholic Church put them

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.650 
reasons why the Catholic Church put them
together<00:05:00.919> is<00:05:01.310> actually<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.970> give<00:05:02.180> credibility

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
together is actually to give credibility

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.770 
together is actually to give credibility
to<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.380> new<00:05:03.530> religion<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.610> Christianity<00:05:05.000> as<00:05:05.750> a

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
to the new religion of Christianity as a

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.100 
to the new religion of Christianity as a
came<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:07.310> evolve<00:05:07.760> they<00:05:08.030> said<00:05:08.240> well<00:05:08.449> look<00:05:08.600> we<00:05:08.780> r

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
came to evolve they said well look we r

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.129 
came to evolve they said well look we r
brand<00:05:09.380> new<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:10.190> would<00:05:10.340> be<00:05:10.490> great<00:05:10.699> to<00:05:11.539> have<00:05:12.110> a

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
brand new it would be great to have a

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.200 
brand new it would be great to have a
little<00:05:12.500> history<00:05:12.800> behind<00:05:13.010> us<00:05:13.280> so<00:05:13.490> they<00:05:13.669> married

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
little history behind us so they married

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.670 
little history behind us so they married
too<00:05:14.630> well<00:05:15.669> they're<00:05:16.669> not<00:05:16.700> really<00:05:17.120> compatible

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
too well they're not really compatible

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.320 
too well they're not really compatible
that<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.860> know<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.190> there<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.880> message<00:05:20.300> is

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
that you know that there the message is

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.680 
that you know that there the message is
completely<00:05:21.200> different<00:05:21.349> and<00:05:21.680> I<00:05:21.830> think<00:05:22.690> the

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
completely different and I think the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.780 
completely different and I think the
purpose<00:05:24.169> is<00:05:24.500> completely<00:05:25.220> different

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
purpose is completely different

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.950 
purpose is completely different
and<00:05:26.300> when<00:05:26.600> we<00:05:26.750> go<00:05:26.990> a<00:05:27.350> little<00:05:27.650> deeper<00:05:27.890> on<00:05:28.160> this

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
and when we go a little deeper on this

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.410 
and when we go a little deeper on this
especially<00:05:29.960> in<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.140> first<00:05:30.320> book<00:05:31.180> genesis<00:05:32.180> in

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
especially in the first book genesis in

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.930 
especially in the first book genesis in
the<00:05:33.170> Old<00:05:33.350> Testament<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:34.070> think<00:05:34.340> we'll<00:05:34.520> discover

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
the Old Testament I think we'll discover

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.670 
the Old Testament I think we'll discover
some<00:05:35.240> things<00:05:35.510> that<00:05:35.660> are<00:05:35.840> rather<00:05:36.830> shocking
