00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
okay it's incredibly hard as I guess one

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.149 
okay it's incredibly hard as I guess one
would<00:01:23.149> expect<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:23.659> notes<00:01:24.049> it's<00:01:24.710> just<00:01:24.979> really

would expect that notes it's just really

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.569 
would expect that notes it's just really
fun<00:01:25.429> I<00:01:26.259> guess<00:01:27.259> because<00:01:27.439> of<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.860> it's<00:01:28.369> not

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
fun I guess because of that it's not

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.899 
fun I guess because of that it's not
that<00:01:28.850> new<00:01:29.679> tall<00:01:30.679> but<00:01:30.920> yeah<00:01:31.100> it's<00:01:31.310> just<00:01:31.520> just

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
that new tall but yeah it's just just

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.770 
that new tall but yeah it's just just
really<00:01:32.240> really<00:01:32.360> difficult<00:01:34.270> but<00:01:35.270> feel<00:01:35.750> like

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
really really difficult but feel like

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.569 
really really difficult but feel like
I'm<00:01:35.990> learning<00:01:36.319> which<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.649> good<00:01:42.369> what<00:01:43.369> is<00:01:43.460> that

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
hard but very good to do and also what I

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.040 
hard but very good to do and also what I
like<00:04:09.460> about<00:04:09.490> it<00:04:09.910> which<00:04:10.030> may<00:04:10.210> be<00:04:10.240> separates<00:04:10.900> a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
like about it which may be separates a

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.920 
like about it which may be separates a
little<00:04:11.290> bit<00:04:11.410> from<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.390> cricket<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.510> play<00:04:13.750> not

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
little bit from the cricket I play not

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.390 
little bit from the cricket I play not
that<00:04:13.960> we<00:04:14.230> don't<00:04:14.380> all<00:04:14.620> get<00:04:14.770> on<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.100> they'll<00:04:15.220> not

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
that we don't all get on and they'll not

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.979 
that we don't all get on and they'll not
that<00:04:15.580> it's<00:04:15.670> not<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.820> social<00:04:16.150> environment<00:04:16.270> but<00:04:16.750> I

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that it's not a social environment but I

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.960 
that it's not a social environment but I
like<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.380> fact<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:18.130> emphasis<00:04:18.460> on<00:04:18.760> on

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
like the fact that the emphasis on on

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.570 
like the fact that the emphasis on on
helping<00:04:19.570> each<00:04:19.690> other<00:04:19.810> are<00:04:20.080> thin<00:04:20.290> on<00:04:20.430> Vanessa<00:04:21.430> a

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
helping each other are thin on Vanessa a

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.310 
helping each other are thin on Vanessa a
competing<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.300> be<00:04:22.450> each<00:04:22.630> other<00:04:22.870> in<00:04:23.140> those

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
competing to be each other in those

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.760 
competing to be each other in those
process<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.370> think<00:04:24.520> that's<00:04:24.640> a<00:04:24.760> really<00:04:24.970> valuable

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
process I think that's a really valuable

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.590 
process I think that's a really valuable
aspect<00:04:26.770> of<00:04:26.920> this<00:04:27.070> kind<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:28.240> ODI<00:04:28.480> cricket

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
aspect of this kind of the ODI cricket

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.560 
aspect of this kind of the ODI cricket
and<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.110> think<00:04:29.290> um<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:31.090> know<00:04:31.150> there's<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.540> lot

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
and I think um you know there's a lot

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.390 
and I think um you know there's a lot
state<00:04:31.990> from<00:04:32.200> that<00:04:32.440> alongside<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.190> fact<00:04:33.370> that

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
state from that alongside the fact that

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.000 
state from that alongside the fact that
as<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.820> for<00:04:34.240> example<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.690> bowler<00:04:35.010> practicing

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
as a for example as a bowler practicing

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.220 
as a for example as a bowler practicing
with<00:04:36.760> this<00:04:36.910> blindfold<00:04:37.390> actually<00:04:37.840> would<00:04:38.080> aid

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
with this blindfold actually would aid

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.220 
with this blindfold actually would aid
my<00:04:38.710> technique<00:04:39.670> a<00:04:39.760> me<00:04:40.000> technically<00:04:40.450> when<00:04:41.200> I

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
my technique a me technically when I

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.520 
my technique a me technically when I
comfortable<00:04:41.770> without<00:04:42.730> biathlon<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.750> there's

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
comfortable without biathlon so there's

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.290 
comfortable without biathlon so there's
a<00:04:44.590> lot<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.860> be<00:04:44.920> gained<00:04:45.130> from<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.520> both<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.030> it's

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
a lot to be gained from it both so it's

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.360 
a lot to be gained from it both so it's
