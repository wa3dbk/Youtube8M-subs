today<00:00:01.829> I'm<00:00:02.070> doing<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.610> brushless<00:00:02.970> conversion

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
today I'm doing a brushless conversion

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.010 
today I'm doing a brushless conversion
on<00:00:03.870> my<00:00:03.990> blade<00:00:04.410> nano<00:00:04.799> CPX<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.879> I'm<00:00:06.839> going<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
on my blade nano CPX and I'm going to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.140 
on my blade nano CPX and I'm going to
try<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.379> show<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.189> step<00:00:08.490> by<00:00:08.639> step<00:00:08.670> I

try and show it to you step by step I

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.910 
try and show it to you step by step I
don't<00:00:09.300> know<00:00:09.389> if<00:00:09.450> I'll<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.599> able<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.139> because

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
don't know if I'll be able to because

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.709 
don't know if I'll be able to because
I'm<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.309> only<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.700> filming<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.269> but<00:00:12.480> I'll<00:00:12.570> do

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
I'm the only one filming it but I'll do

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.209 
I'm the only one filming it but I'll do
my<00:00:12.750> best<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.230> show<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> subs<00:00:13.860> along<00:00:14.099> the

without<00:00:18.960> battery<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:20.189> use<00:00:20.279> 25.6<00:00:21.210> Gramps<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
without battery we use 25.6 Gramps and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.090 
without battery we use 25.6 Gramps and
we'll<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.320> weighs<00:00:22.500> after<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
we'll see what it weighs after the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.460 
we'll see what it weighs after the

I'm<00:00:48.719> using<00:00:49.579> his<00:00:51.320> edition<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> motor<00:00:52.800> which

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
I'm using his edition of the motor which

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.000 
I'm using his edition of the motor which
is<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.730> press<00:00:53.969> fit<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.480> frame<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
is just a press fit into the frame of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.459 
is just a press fit into the frame of
the<00:00:56.010> asteroid<00:00:56.760> motor<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> same<00:00:58.199> motor

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
the asteroid motor it's the same motor

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
the asteroid motor it's the same motor
except<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> doesn't<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> spacer<00:01:00.750> ring

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
except it doesn't have this spacer ring

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.009 
except it doesn't have this spacer ring
and<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.289> cut<00:01:01.559> out<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.129> lighter<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
and it's cut out and it's lighter and

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
and it's cut out and it's lighter and
asteroid<00:01:04.019> designs<00:01:04.379> made<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> separate<00:01:05.250> spacer

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
asteroid designs made a separate spacer

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.289 
asteroid designs made a separate spacer
that<00:01:06.780> makes<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> press<00:01:07.350> into<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.650> frame<00:01:08.299> but

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that makes it press into the frame but

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.179 
that makes it press into the frame but
overall<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.900> DC<00:01:10.140> motor<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.740> version<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
overall it's DC motor this version is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.390 
overall it's DC motor this version is
just<00:01:11.369> slightly<00:01:11.670> heavier<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:13.950> i'm<00:01:14.130> going

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
just slightly heavier so now i'm going

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
just slightly heavier so now i'm going
to<00:01:14.490> start<00:01:14.640> disassembling<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.509> nano<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to start disassembling my nano so I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.780 
to start disassembling my nano so I
could<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:16.950> started<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.490> brushless

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
could get started on this brushless

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.530 
could get started on this brushless
conversion<00:01:19.159> okay<00:01:20.159> guys<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.640> disassembled<00:01:21.390> my

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
conversion okay guys i disassembled my

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.380 
conversion okay guys i disassembled my
nano<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:23.009> next<00:01:23.250> thing<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> need

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
nano and the next thing is going to need

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.130 
nano and the next thing is going to need
to<00:01:24.570> cut<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:25.619> motor<00:01:25.950> supports<00:01:27.140> take

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to cut out these two motor supports take

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.280 
to cut out these two motor supports take
this<00:01:28.740> piece<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.119> asteroid<00:01:30.570> design<00:01:30.900> sprain

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
this piece of the asteroid design sprain

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.030 
this piece of the asteroid design sprain
brace<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.090> CA<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.780> place<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.650> flat

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
brace and CA it into place on this flat

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.179 
brace and CA it into place on this flat
bar<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:37.409> after<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> we're<00:01:38.100> going

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
bar here and then after that we're going

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.460 
bar here and then after that we're going
to<00:01:38.250> reinstall<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.119> stock<00:01:39.390> motor<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to reinstall the stock motor just so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
to reinstall the stock motor just so
that<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.799> line<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.400> bottom<00:01:41.640> frame

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that we go line the bottom frame

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.319 
that we go line the bottom frame
stiffener<00:01:42.869> which<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.329> then

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
to remove the stock motor and take this
CF<00:01:52.829> disc<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:54.409> use<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.770> top<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:57.090> dip

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
CF disc and use it up top here just dip

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.130 
CF disc and use it up top here just dip
in<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.420> frame<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> little<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.590> then

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
in the frame a little bit more and then

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.660 
in the frame a little bit more and then
once<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.710> glued<00:02:01.920> into<00:02:02.130> place<00:02:02.250> we're

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
once that is all glued into place we're

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.620 
once that is all glued into place we're
going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:03.320> cut<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:05.310> front<00:02:05.759> bar<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
going to cut out this front bar just a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.270 
going to cut out this front bar just a
little<00:02:06.840> bit<00:02:07.140> then<00:02:07.590> we're<00:02:07.710> also<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.069> cut

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
little bit then we're also going to cut

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.479 
little bit then we're also going to cut
a<00:02:08.310> notch<00:02:08.610> down<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> motor<00:02:10.259> wires<00:02:10.590> so

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
a notch down here for the motor wires so

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.760 
a notch down here for the motor wires so
I'm<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
I'm going to do all that and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.660 
I'm going to do all that and
show<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.890> what<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.160> looks<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.430> when<00:02:13.550> I'm

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
show you what it looks like when I'm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.900 
show you what it looks like when I'm
done<00:02:13.880> make<00:02:14.750> sure<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.050> sand<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.890> pieces<00:02:16.430> with

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
done make sure you sand the pieces with

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.180 
done make sure you sand the pieces with
the<00:02:17.150> carbon<00:02:17.450> fiber<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.200> plastic<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.010> that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
the carbon fiber and the plastic so that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.600 
the carbon fiber and the plastic so that
the<00:02:19.460> CA<00:02:20.300> glue<00:02:20.660> sticks<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.410> better<00:02:24.550> okay<00:02:25.550> so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
the CA glue sticks to it better okay so

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.930 
the CA glue sticks to it better okay so
now<00:02:25.910> my<00:02:26.090> frame<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.630> cut<00:02:26.990> all<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.920> CF<00:02:28.310> pieces<00:02:28.760> or

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
now my frame is cut all the CF pieces or

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.210 
now my frame is cut all the CF pieces or
c8<00:02:29.300> into<00:02:29.660> place<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:31.660> right<00:02:32.660> here<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.410> cut<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
c8 into place and right here I cut a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.330 
c8 into place and right here I cut a
little<00:02:34.490> notch<00:02:35.000> for<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.140> motor<00:02:36.350> wires<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.950> exit

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
little notch for the motor wires to exit

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.390 
little notch for the motor wires to exit
out<00:02:37.460> of<00:02:37.490> so<00:02:37.880> they<00:02:38.000> don't<00:02:38.210> get<00:02:39.160> stressed<00:02:40.160> or

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
out of so they don't get stressed or

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.950 
out of so they don't get stressed or
anything<00:02:40.790> because<00:02:41.000> they're<00:02:41.180> very<00:02:41.360> small<00:02:41.750> and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
anything because they're very small and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.440 
anything because they're very small and
fragile<00:02:42.220> then<00:02:43.220> after<00:02:43.640> i<00:02:43.760> install<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.270> motor

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
fragile then after i install the motor

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.030 
fragile then after i install the motor
is<00:02:44.600> just<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.900> press<00:02:45.140> fit<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.920> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
is just a press fit in just like the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.890 
is just a press fit in just like the
stock<00:02:46.280> motor<00:02:46.660> I'll<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.310> cfp<00:02:49.310> sup<00:02:49.640> top<00:02:49.970> and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
stock motor I'll do the cfp sup top and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.040 
stock motor I'll do the cfp sup top and
then<00:02:51.290> I'll<00:02:51.560> install<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.670> three-in-one<00:02:53.630> board

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
then I'll install the three-in-one board

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.420 
then I'll install the three-in-one board
and<00:02:54.910> I'll<00:02:56.140> show<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.380> servo<00:02:57.830> spacers<00:02:58.400> and

way<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.360> esc<00:03:29.780> will<00:03:29.900> does<00:03:30.050> get<00:03:30.230> better<00:03:30.380> current

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
way the esc will does get better current

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.160 
way the esc will does get better current
but<00:03:31.310> it's<00:03:31.400> really<00:03:31.550> not<00:03:31.820> as<00:03:32.090> necessary<00:03:32.900> for<00:03:33.140> our

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
but it's really not as necessary for our

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.660 
but it's really not as necessary for our
mile<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.709> get<00:03:34.660> my<00:03:35.660> soldering<00:03:36.110> iron<00:03:36.530> set<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.920> 350

mile to get my soldering iron set to 350
degrees<00:03:37.850> Celsius<00:03:38.720> seem<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.410> be<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.560> perfect

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
degrees Celsius seem to be a perfect

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.790 
degrees Celsius seem to be a perfect
temperature<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.080> now<00:03:42.080> I'll<00:03:42.290> go<00:03:42.500> ahead<00:03:42.530> and

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
temperature and now I'll go ahead and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.830 
temperature and now I'll go ahead and
press<00:03:43.130> fit<00:03:43.459> my<00:03:43.640> motor<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.360> then<00:03:44.660> I'll<00:03:44.810> show

press fit my motor and then I'll show

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.480 
press fit my motor and then I'll show
you<00:03:45.080> how<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.260> use<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.470> servo<00:03:45.980> spacers<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.920> here

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
you how to use the servo spacers so here

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.330 
you how to use the servo spacers so here
is<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.700> servo<00:03:50.480> spacer<00:03:50.990> one<00:03:51.320> side<00:03:51.530> is<00:03:51.560> flat<00:03:51.860> one

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
is a servo spacer one side is flat one

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.240 
is a servo spacer one side is flat one
side<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:52.910> concave<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.870> concave<00:03:54.560> side<00:03:54.590> we'll

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
side is concave the concave side we'll

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.420 
side is concave the concave side we'll
face<00:03:55.520> towards<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:56.120> motor<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:57.530> I'm<00:03:58.040> going<00:03:58.370> to

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
face towards the motor so I'm going to

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.750 
face towards the motor so I'm going to
put<00:03:58.840> on<00:03:59.840> my<00:04:00.020> servos<00:04:00.500> with<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.860> servo<00:04:01.220> spacers

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
put on my servos with the servo spacers

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.340 
put on my servos with the servo spacers
and<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.150> way<00:04:02.240> it<00:04:02.330> will<00:04:02.450> be<00:04:02.570> easier<00:04:02.990> for<00:04:03.080> you

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
and that way it will be easier for you

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.090 
and that way it will be easier for you
to<00:04:03.440> see<00:04:03.530> how<00:04:04.100> these<00:04:04.430> are<00:04:04.790> installed<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:06.100> here

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
to see how these are installed and here

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.250 
to see how these are installed and here
you<00:04:07.190> can<00:04:07.310> see<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:07.820> have<00:04:07.850> my<00:04:08.150> motor<00:04:08.540> press<00:04:08.989> fit<00:04:09.230> it

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
you can see I have my motor press fit it

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.520 
you can see I have my motor press fit it
into<00:04:09.500> place<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:14.330> now<00:04:14.450> I<00:04:14.480> have<00:04:14.600> one<00:04:15.020> servo

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
into place so now I have one servo

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.000 
into place so now I have one servo
installed<00:04:15.980> up<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:17.299> servo<00:04:18.169> spacers<00:04:18.680> come

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
installed up that servo spacers come

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.700 
installed up that servo spacers come
with<00:04:19.190> longer<00:04:19.700> screws<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.480> as<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.680> see

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
with longer screws and as you can see

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.980 
with longer screws and as you can see
here<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.190> motor<00:04:22.430> clears<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.120> servo<00:04:23.540> now<00:04:23.750> I

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
here the motor clears the servo now I

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.240 
here the motor clears the servo now I
open<00:04:24.860> on<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.130> other<00:04:25.340> servo

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
open on the other servo

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.020 
open on the other servo
screwing<00:04:27.180> my<00:04:27.360> main<00:04:27.570> board<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:28.430> solder<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
screwing my main board a solder the

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.160 
screwing my main board a solder the
brushless<00:04:30.450> motor<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.260> esc<00:04:33.170> reassemble

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
brushless motor to the esc reassemble

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.840 
brushless motor to the esc reassemble
the<00:04:34.260> helicopter<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.100> then<00:04:35.190> it's<00:04:35.370> ready<00:04:35.610> to

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
the helicopter and then it's ready to

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.910 
the helicopter and then it's ready to
fly<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.780> i'm<00:04:36.840> going<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.050> keep<00:04:37.230> on<00:04:37.440> assembling

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
fly so i'm going to keep on assembling

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.290 
fly so i'm going to keep on assembling
and<00:04:38.220> then<00:04:38.370> show<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.700> what<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.000> looks<00:04:39.030> like

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
and then show you what it looks like

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
and then show you what it looks like
when<00:04:39.450> I'm<00:04:39.600> finished<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:42.270> now<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.630> helicopter

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
when I'm finished so now the helicopter

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.370 
when I'm finished so now the helicopter
is<00:04:43.440> back<00:04:43.650> together<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.610> final<00:04:44.910> weight<00:04:45.210> is

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
is back together the final weight is

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.370 
is back together the final weight is
26.1<00:04:46.380> grams<00:04:47.040> without<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.640> battery<00:04:47.990> so<00:04:48.990> we<00:04:49.200> add

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
26.1 grams without the battery so we add

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.270 
26.1 grams without the battery so we add
it<00:04:49.410> half<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.400> gram<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.510> helicopter<00:04:52.280> it's

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
it half of a gram to the helicopter it's

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.750 
it half of a gram to the helicopter it's
not<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.760> much<00:04:54.140> but<00:04:55.140> it<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.920> half<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.310> gram<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.730> a

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
not that much but it is half a gram on a

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.890 
not that much but it is half a gram on a
relatively<00:04:57.360> small<00:04:57.480> helicopter<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:59.810> here<00:05:00.810> is

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
relatively small helicopter and here is

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:10.010 
relatively small helicopter and here is
what<00:05:01.140> my<00:05:01.350> final<00:05:01.890> wiring<00:05:02.430> looks<00:05:02.580> like<00:05:07.940> and<00:05:09.020> I

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
what my final wiring looks like and I

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.020 
what my final wiring looks like and I
