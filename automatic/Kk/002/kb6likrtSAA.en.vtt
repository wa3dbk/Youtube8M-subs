00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
with the 18 to 55 lens if you find that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.140 
with the 18 to 55 lens if you find that
that<00:01:09.330> focal<00:01:09.900> range<00:01:10.260> suits<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.549> style<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
that focal range suits your style of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.620 
that focal range suits your style of
photography<00:01:13.130> then<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.360> plan<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
photography then and you don't plan to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.130 
photography then and you don't plan to
go<00:01:15.840> full<00:01:16.080> frame<00:01:16.259> look<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.549> lens<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
go full frame look at this lens and I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.100 
go full frame look at this lens and I
think<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> lot<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.090> people<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.689> does

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
think that for a lot of people it does

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
think that for a lot of people it does
suit<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.799> style<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.250> photography<00:01:23.340> because

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
suit your style of photography because

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.690 
suit your style of photography because
Canon<00:01:24.810> has<00:01:24.990> probably<00:01:25.560> researched<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.400> quite<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
Canon has probably researched it quite a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.550 
Canon has probably researched it quite a
bit<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:29.100> why<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:30.210> sell<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.470> many

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
bit and that's why they sell so many

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.069 
bit and that's why they sell so many
DSLRs<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.350> zoom<00:01:34.350> range<00:01:35.540> now<00:01:36.540> ever<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
DSLRs with that zoom range now ever it

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.140 
DSLRs with that zoom range now ever it
seems<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.439> everybody<00:01:38.009> wants<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.729> more

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
seems like everybody wants to have more

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.310 
seems like everybody wants to have more
range<00:01:40.159> including<00:01:41.159> me<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.640> wish<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.659> lens<00:01:42.990> had

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
range including me I wish this lens had

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.020 
range including me I wish this lens had
more<00:01:43.590> range<00:01:44.060> but<00:01:45.060> wasn't<00:01:45.720> any<00:01:45.810> bigger<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
more range but wasn't any bigger and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.280 
more range but wasn't any bigger and
still<00:01:48.030> had<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:49.439> image<00:01:49.740> quality<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
still had a the image quality it has and

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.940 
still had a the image quality it has and
you<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.740> probably<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.280> possible<00:01:53.970> so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
you know that's probably not possible so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.370 
you know that's probably not possible so
you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.520> probably<00:01:57.060> about<00:01:57.659> right<00:01:58.079> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you know it's probably about right just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.069 
you know it's probably about right just
where<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> anyway<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
where it is so anyway I really want to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.310 
where it is so anyway I really want to
recommend<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:04.579> you<00:02:05.579> know<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.820> produces<00:02:06.390> great

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
recommend it you know it produces great

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.940 
recommend it you know it produces great
results<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.069> low<00:02:08.280> light<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
results in low light and the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.480 
results in low light and the
out-of-focus<00:02:11.459> at<00:02:12.030> that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
out-of-focus at that

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:24.280 
out-of-focus at that
it<00:02:13.030> gives<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.660> bokeh<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:15.180> wonderful

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.640 

okay<00:02:25.129> now<00:02:25.310> stay<00:02:25.670> with<00:02:25.700> me<00:02:25.970> just<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:26.780> couple<00:02:27.110> more

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.179 

as<00:02:33.159> you<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.180> see<00:02:34.390> those<00:02:35.379> are<00:02:35.620> not<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.010> best

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
as you can see those are not the best

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.339 
as you can see those are not the best
images<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.849> world<00:02:36.879> but<00:02:37.450> if<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.959> see<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
images in the world but if you see the

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.070 
images in the world but if you see the
little<00:02:38.530> bokeh<00:02:38.829> balls<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:41.230> background

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.259 

yeah<00:02:46.080> yeah<00:02:46.890> they<00:02:47.129> look<00:02:47.370> pretty<00:02:47.580> good

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
yeah yeah they look pretty good

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.740 
yeah yeah they look pretty good
they<00:02:48.390> look<00:02:48.629> pretty<00:02:48.780> dreamy<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.150> round<00:02:51.150> and

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
they look pretty dreamy and round and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.300

own<00:05:09.100> 7d<00:05:10.100> equivalent<00:05:10.940> in<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.330> d300s<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:13.250> is

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
own 7d equivalent in the d300s that is

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.080 
own 7d equivalent in the d300s that is
probably<00:05:14.390> a<00:05:14.480> great<00:05:14.810> camera<00:05:15.320> as<00:05:15.530> well<00:05:15.730> so<00:05:16.730> I'm

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
probably a great camera as well so I'm

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.390 
probably a great camera as well so I'm
not<00:05:17.240> going<00:05:17.420> to<00:05:17.480> say<00:05:17.630> anything<00:05:18.350> about<00:05:18.500> the

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
not going to say anything about the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.800 
not going to say anything about the
d300s<00:05:20.000> I<00:05:20.390> I've<00:05:20.780> read<00:05:21.110> reviews<00:05:21.710> about<00:05:22.640> it<00:05:23.060> but

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
d300s I I've read reviews about it but

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.060 
d300s I I've read reviews about it but
other<00:05:23.960> than<00:05:24.110> that<00:05:24.230> I<00:05:24.260> don't<00:05:24.650> know<00:05:24.770> anything

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
other than that I don't know anything

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.820 
other than that I don't know anything
about<00:05:25.310> it<00:05:25.610> so<00:05:25.640> I'm<00:05:25.820> not<00:05:25.850> I<00:05:26.000> say<00:05:26.270> one<00:05:26.630> word<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.800> I

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
about it so I'm not I say one word but I

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.230 
about it so I'm not I say one word but I
would<00:05:28.370> just<00:05:28.400> recommend<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:28.970> everybody

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
would just recommend that everybody

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.260 
would just recommend that everybody
check<00:05:29.660> out<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.990> 7d<00:05:30.530> if<00:05:31.220> you're<00:05:31.520> thinking

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
check out the 7d if you're thinking

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.210 
check out the 7d if you're thinking
about<00:05:32.330> going<00:05:32.660> with<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:32.990> camera<00:05:33.650> of<00:05:33.860> that

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
about going with a camera of that

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.020 
about going with a camera of that
caliber<00:05:36.070> it's<00:05:37.070> great<00:05:37.520> I<00:05:37.790> mean<00:05:38.030> it<00:05:38.330> it's<00:05:38.600> I

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
caliber it's great I mean it it's I

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.030 
caliber it's great I mean it it's I
can't<00:05:41.030> find<00:05:41.270> fault<00:05:41.630> with<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:42.200> can't<00:05:42.680> find

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
can't find fault with it I can't find

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.670 
can't find fault with it I can't find
fault<00:05:43.400> with<00:05:43.490> it<00:05:43.730> if<00:05:43.850> it<00:05:44.000> had<00:05:44.180> a<00:05:44.680> articulating

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
fault with it if it had a articulating

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.580 
fault with it if it had a articulating
screen<00:05:45.920> on<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.490> back<00:05:46.700> that<00:05:47.000> moved<00:05:47.240> around

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
screen on the back that moved around

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.760 
screen on the back that moved around
then<00:05:48.590> in<00:05:48.800> my<00:05:48.950> opinion<00:05:48.980> it<00:05:49.700> would<00:05:49.790> be<00:05:49.970> perfect<00:05:50.420> I

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
then in my opinion it would be perfect I

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.650 
then in my opinion it would be perfect I
haven't<00:05:51.770> had<00:05:51.860> a<00:05:51.890> III<00:05:52.250> did<00:05:52.700> have<00:05:52.970> one<00:05:53.330> problem

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
haven't had a III did have one problem

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.040 
haven't had a III did have one problem
when<00:05:53.990> I<00:05:54.020> first<00:05:54.410> bought<00:05:54.650> it<00:05:55.270> that<00:05:56.270> I<00:05:56.360> think<00:05:56.810> now

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
when I first bought it that I think now

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.990 
when I first bought it that I think now
was<00:05:57.380> due<00:05:57.620> to<00:05:57.970> me<00:05:58.970> upgrading<00:05:59.720> the<00:05:59.840> firmware<00:06:00.110> and

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
was due to me upgrading the firmware and

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.540 
was due to me upgrading the firmware and
I<00:06:02.000> think<00:06:02.360> I<00:06:02.510> was<00:06:02.690> trying<00:06:02.930> to<00:06:03.140> run<00:06:03.470> it<00:06:03.650> I<00:06:03.890> must

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
I think I was trying to run it I must

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.480 
I think I was trying to run it I must
not<00:06:04.790> have<00:06:05.260> reset<00:06:06.260> it<00:06:06.410> or<00:06:06.560> something<00:06:07.010> I<00:06:07.160> think<00:06:07.190> I

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
not have reset it or something I think I

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.800 
not have reset it or something I think I
I<00:06:07.700> think<00:06:07.790> you're<00:06:08.150> supposed<00:06:08.420> to<00:06:08.480> take<00:06:08.660> the

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
I think you're supposed to take the

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.470 
I think you're supposed to take the
battery<00:06:09.260> out<00:06:09.460> for<00:06:10.460> a<00:06:10.490> period<00:06:10.760> of<00:06:10.940> time<00:06:11.180> and

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
battery out for a period of time and

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.930 
battery out for a period of time and
then<00:06:11.570> put<00:06:11.780> it<00:06:11.870> back<00:06:11.900> in<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.620> I<00:06:13.310> think<00:06:13.610> I<00:06:13.700> forgot

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
then put it back in and I think I forgot

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.210 
then put it back in and I think I forgot
to<00:06:14.150> do<00:06:14.540> that<00:06:14.570> and<00:06:15.110> I<00:06:15.140> then<00:06:15.500> I<00:06:15.590> got<00:06:15.860> an<00:06:15.980> error

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
to do that and I then I got an error

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.320 
to do that and I then I got an error
message<00:06:16.930> but<00:06:17.930> after<00:06:18.260> I<00:06:18.320> did<00:06:18.410> that<00:06:18.890> and<00:06:19.190> found

out I needed to do it and did it I have

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.370 
out I needed to do it and did it I have
had<00:06:22.790> a<00:06:22.850> problem<00:06:23.180> since<00:06:23.510> that's<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:23.870> only

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
had a problem since that's the only

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.740 
had a problem since that's the only
problem<00:06:24.830> I've<00:06:24.920> had<00:06:24.950> with<00:06:25.430> his<00:06:25.610> camera<00:06:25.970> was

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
problem I've had with his camera was

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.960 
problem I've had with his camera was
after<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.200> firmware<00:06:27.440> upgrade<00:06:27.800> and<00:06:28.610> at<00:06:28.790> first

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
after the firmware upgrade and at first

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.490 
after the firmware upgrade and at first
I<00:06:29.180> thought<00:06:29.210> it<00:06:29.450> was<00:06:29.540> due<00:06:29.810> to<00:06:29.990> an<00:06:30.110> aftermarket

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
I thought it was due to an aftermarket

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.240 
I thought it was due to an aftermarket
battery<00:06:31.300> but<00:06:32.300> that<00:06:32.900> battery<00:06:33.350> has<00:06:33.740> been<00:06:33.770> as

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
battery but that battery has been as

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.570 
battery but that battery has been as
good<00:06:34.640> or<00:06:34.820> better<00:06:35.210> than<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:36.770> Canon<00:06:37.250> battery

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
good or better than the Canon battery

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.580 
good or better than the Canon battery
and<00:06:37.850> it's<00:06:38.000> thought<00:06:38.210> it's<00:06:38.450> an<00:06:38.630> acht<00:06:38.870> iike<00:06:39.380> and

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
and it's thought it's an acht iike and

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.570 
and it's thought it's an acht iike and

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
photography falls in that range that

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.100 
photography falls in that range that
zoom<00:07:12.990> range<00:07:13.350> between<00:07:14.270> 1755<00:07:15.270> it's<00:07:15.600> really<00:07:16.080> a

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
zoom range between 1755 it's really a
