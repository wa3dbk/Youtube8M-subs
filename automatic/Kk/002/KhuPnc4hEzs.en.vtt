be looking at the modern warfare 3 perks

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.729 
be looking at the modern warfare 3 perks
and<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.200> an<00:00:34.290> analysis

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and this is just going to be an analysis

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.080 
and this is just going to be an analysis
of<00:00:34.829> tier<00:00:35.070> 1<00:00:35.280> i'm<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.730> through<00:00:35.880> each

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
of tier 1 i'm going to go through each

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
of tier 1 i'm going to go through each
tier<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.840> quality<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.890> each<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
tier because this quality on each of the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
tier because this quality on each of the
tears<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.059> think<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.390> tier<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> gonna

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
tears and I think that tier one is gonna

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
tears and I think that tier one is gonna
going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> play<00:00:40.710> choir<00:00:40.950> role<00:00:41.160> probably<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.640> as

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
going to play choir role probably not as

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
going to play choir role probably not as
much<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:42.149> tier<00:00:42.600> 2<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:43.050> you'll<00:00:43.200> see<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.620> later

much as tier 2 as you'll see in a later

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.470 
much as tier 2 as you'll see in a later
video<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.160> tier<00:00:44.610> 1<00:00:44.789> has<00:00:44.969> some<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.329> big

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480

still saying that the pro version is
that<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.850> climb<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.420> schools

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that it's going to be climb all schools

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
that it's going to be climb all schools
faster<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> same<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> was

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
faster and this was the same as it was

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.550 
faster and this was the same as it was
in<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:18.119> more<00:01:18.330> fair<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.869> addition<00:01:19.500> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
in one more fair to an addition that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.289 
in one more fair to an addition that
climate<00:01:19.979> over<00:01:20.040> objects<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.909> makes<00:01:21.119> you

climate over objects really makes you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.940 
climate over objects really makes you
really<00:01:21.659> makes<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.990> quite<00:01:22.170> fast<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.740> because

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
really makes you quite fast but because

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
really makes you quite fast but because
you<00:01:23.009> probably<00:01:23.130> don't<00:01:23.400> realize<00:01:23.520> how<00:01:23.700> many

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
you probably don't realize how many

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.969 
you probably don't realize how many

call<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> duty<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.570> I'm

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
call of duty so I do like that I'm

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
call of duty so I do like that I'm
really<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.409> sure<00:01:28.470> about<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.920> kana<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.310> no

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
really not sure about the kana lot no

really not sure about the kana lot no
unlimited<00:01:29.880> sprint<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.720> love<00:01:30.810> in

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
unlimited sprint because I do love in

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.450 
unlimited sprint because I do love in
black<00:01:31.350> ops<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.280> side<00:01:32.310> of

black ops you can get from one side of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
black ops you can get from one side of
the<00:01:32.579> map<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> other<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.420> quickly<00:01:33.900> without

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the map to the other so quickly without

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
the map to the other so quickly without
unlimited<00:01:34.530> sprint<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> same<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
unlimited sprint but at the same time it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
unlimited sprint but at the same time it
takes<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.570> long<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> get<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.049> site's<00:01:37.259> up

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
takes so long to get your site's up

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
takes so long to get your site's up
after<00:01:37.920> sprinting<00:01:38.189> up<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.670> sometimes<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
after sprinting up there sometimes I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.429 
after sprinting up there sometimes I
think<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.479> may<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.659> get<00:01:39.960> me<00:01:40.079> heels<00:01:40.290> i

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
think it may actually get me heels i

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.719 
think it may actually get me heels i
think<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.710> sprint<00:01:40.979> longer<00:01:41.189> distances<00:01:41.549> is

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
think that sprint longer distances is

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.830 
think that sprint longer distances is
pretty<00:01:41.970> good<00:01:42.119> i<00:01:42.150> probably<00:01:42.390> gonna<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.720> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
pretty good i probably gonna have this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
pretty good i probably gonna have this
on<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> russian<00:01:43.409> class<00:01:43.590> paul<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> an<00:01:44.100> SMG

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
on a russian class paul you of an SMG

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.120 
on a russian class paul you of an SMG
have<00:01:45.270> extreme<00:01:45.960> condition<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.710> that's<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
have extreme condition on so that's the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.530 
have extreme condition on so that's the
first<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> second<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.180> sleight<00:01:48.509> of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
hand and this is a pretty famous park

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.639 
hand and this is a pretty famous park
it's<00:01:50.880> very<00:01:51.030> widely<00:01:51.420> used<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.110> call<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> duty

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it's very widely used in call of duty

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.289 
it's very widely used in call of duty
and<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> normal<00:01:53.490> version<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> mean

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and the normal version is going to mean

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.179 
and the normal version is going to mean
that<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.600> faster<00:01:55.110> reload<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that you have faster reload in and the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.350 
that you have faster reload in and the
pro<00:01:56.340> version<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.030> mean<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
pro version is going to mean that you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.030 
pro version is going to mean that you
have<00:01:57.420> faster<00:01:57.899> weapon<00:01:58.229> swap<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.890> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
have faster weapon swap it and this is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039 
have faster weapon swap it and this is
the<00:01:59.159> same<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.490> scalp<00:01:59.790> pro<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.299> black<00:02:00.630> ops<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the same as scalp pro in black ops the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.560 
the same as scalp pro in black ops the
ability<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.740> change<00:02:02.310> weapons<00:02:02.579> fast<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.299> i

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
ability to change weapons fast and i

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
ability to change weapons fast and i
think<00:02:03.810> that's<00:02:03.960> pretty<00:02:04.170> good<00:02:04.380> they've<00:02:04.560> kind<00:02:04.799> of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
think that's pretty good they've kind of

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.330 
think that's pretty good they've kind of
broke<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.189> slive<00:02:05.460> hand

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
broke up slive hand

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.649 
broke up slive hand
as<00:02:06.579> you<00:02:06.759> probably<00:02:06.969> know<00:02:07.149> in<00:02:07.210> black<00:02:07.390> ops<00:02:07.509> you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
as you probably know in black ops you

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.270 
as you probably know in black ops you
have<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.869> fast<00:02:08.050> reloaded<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:08.979> also<00:02:09.099> have

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
have the fast reloaded and you also have

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.160 
have the fast reloaded and you also have
the<00:02:09.429> faster<00:02:09.789> aim<00:02:09.940> down<00:02:10.060> sights<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.690> faster

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the faster aim down sights and faster

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.110 
the faster aim down sights and faster
and<00:02:11.260> downsides<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.830> huge<00:02:12.370> advantage<00:02:12.670> it's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and downsides is a huge advantage it's

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.339 
and downsides is a huge advantage it's
really<00:02:13.480> big<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.930> was<00:02:14.019> kind<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.170> like<00:02:14.260> a

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
really big and that was kind of like a

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.930 
really big and that was kind of like a
power<00:02:14.560> pack<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.069> black<00:02:15.220> ops<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.580> maybe<00:02:15.730> that's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
power pack and black ops so maybe that's

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.190 
power pack and black ops so maybe that's
why<00:02:16.090> they're<00:02:16.269> kind<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.540> breaking<00:02:16.810> up<00:02:16.959> they've

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
why they're kind of breaking up they've

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.050 
why they're kind of breaking up they've
broke<00:02:17.410> up<00:02:17.590> or<00:02:17.830> after<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> few<00:02:18.550> years<00:02:18.580> trying<00:02:19.000> to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
broke up or after a few years trying to

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.089 
broke up or after a few years trying to
probably<00:02:19.720> balance<00:02:20.019> things<00:02:20.230> out<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.620> think<00:02:21.010> the

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
probably balance things out I think the

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.619 
probably balance things out I think the
faster<00:02:21.459> weapon<00:02:21.700> swapping<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.090> good<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.450> means

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
faster weapon swapping is good it means

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.539 
faster weapon swapping is good it means
that<00:02:22.959> another's<00:02:23.739> video<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.010> long<00:02:24.220> time<00:02:24.430> ago

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
that another's video a long time ago

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.430 
that another's video a long time ago
about<00:02:24.760> kind<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.420> having<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> shotgun<00:02:25.959> secondary

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
about kind of having a shotgun secondary

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.020 
about kind of having a shotgun secondary
and<00:02:26.560> black<00:02:26.709> ops<00:02:26.920> using<00:02:27.220> scalp<00:02:27.580> row<00:02:27.760> now<00:02:27.970> you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
and black ops using scalp row now you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.940 
and black ops using scalp row now you
can<00:02:28.239> probably<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.599> shotguns<00:02:29.200> secondaries

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
can probably have shotguns secondaries

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.309 
can probably have shotguns secondaries
in<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:30.910> modern<00:02:31.330> warfare<00:02:31.480> 3<00:02:31.629> if<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.080> use

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
in in modern warfare 3 if you use

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.199 
in in modern warfare 3 if you use
sleight<00:02:32.799> of<00:02:32.830> hand<00:02:33.040> pro<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.819> then<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:34.060> pick

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
sleight of hand pro and then just pick

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.550 
sleight of hand pro and then just pick
up<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.420> shotgun<00:02:34.750> off<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> ground<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.260> really

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
up a shotgun off the ground you really

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.199 
up a shotgun off the ground you really
can<00:02:35.680> be<00:02:35.709> able<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.069> switch<00:02:36.489> between<00:02:36.640> them<00:02:36.970> guns

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
can be able to switch between them guns

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.059 
can be able to switch between them guns
pretty<00:02:37.450> far<00:02:37.599> so<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:37.900> for<00:02:38.380> me<00:02:38.590> on<00:02:38.860> the

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
pretty far so I think for me on the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.500 
pretty far so I think for me on the
assault<00:02:39.310> rifle<00:02:39.370> sleight<00:02:39.849> of<00:02:39.880> hand<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.209> must

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
assault rifle sleight of hand is a must

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.819 
assault rifle sleight of hand is a must
just<00:02:40.780> because<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.110> faster<00:02:41.530> reload

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
just because of the faster reload

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.380 
just because of the faster reload
especially<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.700> fact<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:42.910> they<00:02:43.150> don't<00:02:43.329> have

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
especially the fact that they don't have

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.089 
especially the fact that they don't have
chilled<00:02:43.690> mags<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.170> modern<00:02:44.410> warfare<00:02:44.560> 3<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.069> I

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
chilled mags in modern warfare 3 so I

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.680 
chilled mags in modern warfare 3 so I
think's<00:02:45.340> live<00:02:45.549> hand<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:45.910> going<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.120> probably

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
think's live hand is going to probably

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.479 
think's live hand is going to probably
pay<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> big<00:02:47.200> part<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.530> most<00:02:47.739> my<00:02:47.890> assault<00:02:48.099> rifles

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
pay a big part in most my assault rifles

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.589 
pay a big part in most my assault rifles
and<00:02:48.640> prob<00:02:48.790> i'm<00:02:48.970> probably<00:02:49.150> looking<00:02:49.329> at<00:02:49.510> these

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
and prob i'm probably looking at these

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.150 
and prob i'm probably looking at these
other<00:02:49.780> perks<00:02:50.049> in<00:02:50.260> tier<00:02:50.410> 1<00:02:50.590> maybe<00:02:50.799> on<00:02:50.980> some

other perks in tier 1 maybe on some

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
sniper classes as well just getting fast

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.229 
sniper classes as well just getting fast
reloads<00:02:53.200> off<00:02:53.410> next<00:02:54.250> park<00:02:54.790> we<00:02:54.940> have<00:02:55.090> is

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
reloads off next park we have is

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.759 
reloads off next park we have is
scavenger<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.900> actually<00:02:56.200> not<00:02:56.440> unlocked

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
scavenger this is actually not unlocked

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.190 
scavenger this is actually not unlocked
until<00:02:56.950> level<00:02:57.250> 39<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.120> almost<00:02:58.720> half<00:02:58.870> way<00:02:58.900> for

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
until level 39 so almost half way for

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.479 
until level 39 so almost half way for
the<00:02:59.290> prestige<00:02:59.650> if<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.890> don't<00:03:00.069> know<00:03:00.220> there<00:03:00.400> are

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
the prestige if you don't know there are

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.309 
the prestige if you don't know there are
actually<00:03:00.730> 80<00:03:00.940> levels<00:03:01.360> per<00:03:01.599> prestige<00:03:02.079> so

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
actually 80 levels per prestige so

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.589 
actually 80 levels per prestige so
scavenger<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.400> level<00:03:03.640> 39<00:03:03.940> halfway<00:03:04.420> through

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
scavenger is level 39 halfway through

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.360 
scavenger is level 39 halfway through
it's<00:03:05.200> not<00:03:05.349> hundreds<00:03:05.709> in<00:03:05.769> confirmed<00:03:06.129> what<00:03:06.250> they

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
it's not hundreds in confirmed what they

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.920 
it's not hundreds in confirmed what they
are<00:03:06.489> because<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.000> collects<00:03:07.269> Pee<00:03:07.450> all<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
are because it collects Pee all the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.720 
are because it collects Pee all the
levels<00:03:08.140> were<00:03:08.379> stuck<00:03:08.769> at<00:03:08.890> 30<00:03:09.129> so<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.519> didn't

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
levels were stuck at 30 so you didn't

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.430 
levels were stuck at 30 so you didn't
know<00:03:09.819> what<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.180> actually<00:03:10.329> was<00:03:10.600> but<00:03:10.840> if<00:03:11.200> it's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
know what this actually was but if it's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.900 
know what this actually was but if it's
anything<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.889> kind<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.310> previous<00:03:12.639> games

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
anything like the kind of previous games

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.910 
anything like the kind of previous games
it's<00:03:13.180> going<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.480> resupply<00:03:13.780> ammo<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.620> normal

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
it's going to resupply ammo the normal

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.650 
it's going to resupply ammo the normal
version<00:03:15.040> then<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.819> pro<00:03:15.970> version<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.420> probably

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
version then the pro version is probably

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.750 
version then the pro version is probably
going<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.840> resupply<00:03:17.250> equipment<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.370> grant

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
been confirmed by rubber bowling

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.300 
been confirmed by rubber bowling
scavenger<00:03:22.810> will<00:03:23.019> go<00:03:23.200> back<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.620> replenishing

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
scavenger will go back to replenishing

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.830 
scavenger will go back to replenishing
claim<00:03:24.579> walls<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.000> that's<00:03:25.209> something<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.660> watch

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
claim walls so that's something to watch

claim walls so that's something to watch
out<00:03:26.019> for<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:26.410> maybe<00:03:26.709> scavenger<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.250> going<00:03:27.400> to

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
out for so maybe scavenger is going to

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.789 
out for so maybe scavenger is going to
play<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.060> bigger<00:03:28.239> part<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:28.540> warfare<00:03:29.049> 3<00:03:29.380> then<00:03:29.680> it

of like how they've broken up ghost

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.379 
of like how they've broken up ghost
they've<00:03:36.190> broken<00:03:36.340> up<00:03:36.489> ghost<00:03:36.700> intercon<00:03:37.209> like

killstreak kind of thing like ghost you

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.940 
killstreak kind of thing like ghost you
can<00:03:40.630> obviously<00:03:40.810> hide<00:03:41.079> from<00:03:41.169> you<00:03:41.319> OV<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.769> black

version<00:03:48.849> is<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.510> launches<00:03:50.139> lock<00:03:50.349> on<00:03:50.500> faster

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
version is that launches lock on faster

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.940 
version is that launches lock on faster
extra<00:03:51.549> damage<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:52.269> s<00:03:52.419> ports<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:52.930> centuries<00:03:53.440> so

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
extra damage to s ports and centuries so

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.319 
extra damage to s ports and centuries so
I<00:03:53.980> think<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.370> con<00:03:54.730> light<00:03:54.970> everyone's

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
I think this is con light everyone's

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.940 
I think this is con light everyone's
like<00:03:55.480> ears<00:03:55.810> ghost<00:03:56.169> is<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.440> little<00:03:56.680> bit<00:03:56.769> this<00:03:56.859> a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
like ears ghost is a little bit this a

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.770 
like ears ghost is a little bit this a
little<00:03:57.040> bit<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.430> no-go<00:03:57.819> area<00:03:58.180> using<00:03:58.480> ghost

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
little bit of a no-go area using ghost

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.170 
little bit of a no-go area using ghost
so<00:03:59.049> not<00:03:59.709> too<00:03:59.859> sure<00:04:00.010> how<00:04:00.220> that's<00:04:00.880> going<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.060> be

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
so not too sure how that's going to be

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.819 
so not too sure how that's going to be

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
youtube as well but i do think that this

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.240 
youtube as well but i do think that this
actually<00:04:05.019> gonna<00:04:05.200> play<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.560> huge<00:04:05.739> part<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.130> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
actually gonna play a huge part of the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.589 
actually gonna play a huge part of the
game<00:04:06.400> because<00:04:06.730> i'm<00:04:06.910> definitely<00:04:07.359> going<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.540> be

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
game because i'm definitely going to be

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.390 
game because i'm definitely going to be
have<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.900> on<00:04:08.019> an<00:04:08.200> anti<00:04:08.500> air<00:04:08.650> support<00:04:08.950> class<00:04:09.130> you

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
have it on an anti air support class you

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.039 
have it on an anti air support class you
know<00:04:09.519> them<00:04:10.090> games<00:04:10.329> where<00:04:10.599> you're<00:04:10.720> struggling

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
know them games where you're struggling

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.150 
know them games where you're struggling
against<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.440> opponent<00:04:11.769> you<00:04:11.829> just<00:04:12.010> want

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
against the opponent you just want

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.050 
against the opponent you just want
something<00:04:12.310> that's<00:04:12.459> going<00:04:12.639> to

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
something that's going to

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.360 
something that's going to
take<00:04:13.239> down<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:14.050> S<00:04:14.349> port<00:04:14.709> quickly<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.130> i<00:04:15.160> think

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
take down the S port quickly and i think

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.250 
take down the S port quickly and i think
the<00:04:15.489> pro<00:04:15.700> version<00:04:15.730> launches<00:04:16.480> look<00:04:16.660> on<00:04:16.780> faster

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
the pro version launches look on faster

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.620 
the pro version launches look on faster
is<00:04:17.410> really<00:04:18.010> huge<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.700> that's<00:04:19.239> going<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.419> play<00:04:19.600> a

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
is really huge so that's going to play a

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.690 
is really huge so that's going to play a
big<00:04:20.019> role<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.440> also<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.859> fact<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.190> i'm<00:04:21.609> not

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
big role and also the fact that i'm not

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.800 
big role and also the fact that i'm not
sure<00:04:21.790> if<00:04:21.970> many<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.330> guys<00:04:22.419> have<00:04:22.480> noticed

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
sure if many of you guys have noticed

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.409 
sure if many of you guys have noticed
yet<00:04:23.139> that<00:04:23.380> if<00:04:23.980> you<00:04:24.130> take<00:04:24.310> out<00:04:24.460> s<00:04:24.700> poor<00:04:25.030> take<00:04:25.270> our

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
yet that if you take out s poor take our

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.430 
yet that if you take out s poor take our
central<00:04:25.750> gun<00:04:25.870> stuff<00:04:26.080> like<00:04:26.200> that<00:04:26.230> you're

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
central gun stuff like that you're

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.600 
central gun stuff like that you're
actually<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.830> get<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:26.950> point<00:04:27.160> towards

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
actually going to get a point towards

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.970 
actually going to get a point towards
your<00:04:27.700> kill<00:04:27.880> streak<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.990> in<00:04:29.230> itself<00:04:29.380> if

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
your kill streak so that in itself if

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.800 
your kill streak so that in itself if
you<00:04:30.490> have<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.910> kind<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.150> launcher<00:04:31.540> that's<00:04:31.690> going

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
you have a kind of launcher that's going

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.180 
you have a kind of launcher that's going
to<00:04:31.870> come<00:04:32.020> with<00:04:32.169> two<00:04:32.380> missiles<00:04:32.800> you're<00:04:33.070> going

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
to come with two missiles you're going

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.470 
to come with two missiles you're going
to<00:04:33.250> be<00:04:33.340> able<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.580> run<00:04:33.790> this<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.150> then<00:04:34.330> maybe

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
to be able to run this and then maybe

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.600 
to be able to run this and then maybe
take<00:04:34.750> out<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.960> couple<00:04:35.230> of<00:04:35.320> UAVs<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.950> then<00:04:36.220> have

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
take out a couple of UAVs and then have

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.220 
take out a couple of UAVs and then have
two<00:04:36.760> points<00:04:37.150> nearly<00:04:37.450> on<00:04:37.660> your<00:04:37.840> way<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.990> your

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
two points nearly on your way to your

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.570 
two points nearly on your way to your
own<00:04:38.320> UAV<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:38.860> i<00:04:38.889> think<00:04:39.010> that's<00:04:39.190> going<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.400> play

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
own UAV so i think that's going to play

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.580 
own UAV so i think that's going to play
a<00:04:39.610> role<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:40.090> know<00:04:40.660> they've<00:04:40.930> kind<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.200> broken<00:04:41.410> it

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
a role I know they've kind of broken it

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.050 
a role I know they've kind of broken it
up<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.919> try<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.250> get<00:04:42.340> ghost<00:04:42.580> all<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.880> way<00:04:43.000> but

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
up to try and get ghost all the way but

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.370 
up to try and get ghost all the way but
I<00:04:43.270> still<00:04:43.540> think<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:43.840> going<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:43.990> play<00:04:44.110> part

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
I still think it's going to play part

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.050 
I still think it's going to play part
maybe<00:04:44.560> people<00:04:44.980> won't<00:04:45.310> be<00:04:45.520> running<00:04:45.700> this<00:04:45.880> from

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
maybe people won't be running this from

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.760 
maybe people won't be running this from
the<00:04:46.150> stocks<00:04:46.419> I<00:04:46.600> think<00:04:46.810> sleight<00:04:47.440> of<00:04:47.470> hand<00:04:47.680> is

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
the stocks I think sleight of hand is

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.320 
the stocks I think sleight of hand is
really<00:04:48.100> powerful<00:04:48.280> poke<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.820> think<00:04:49.090> it's<00:04:49.210> life

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
really powerful poke I think it's life

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.730 
really powerful poke I think it's life
hands<00:04:49.540> going<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.810> be<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.050> kind<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.410> dominant

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
hands going to be the kind of dominant

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.980 
hands going to be the kind of dominant
perk<00:04:50.950> in<00:04:51.190> this<00:04:51.460> tier<00:04:51.729> but<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.120> do<00:04:52.510> think<00:04:52.720> there

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
perk in this tier but I do think there

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.030 
perk in this tier but I do think there
is<00:04:53.200> actually<00:04:53.530> going<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.680> be<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.830> place<00:04:54.010> for

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
is actually going to be a place for

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.159 
is actually going to be a place for
blind<00:04:54.610> eye<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:54.820> it's<00:04:55.150> probably<00:04:55.780> going<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.080> be

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
blind eye and it's probably going to be

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.560 
blind eye and it's probably going to be

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
on my aunt is poor glasses so the final

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.540 
on my aunt is poor glasses so the final

going<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.330> play<00:05:04.450> out<00:05:04.540> it<00:05:04.720> seems<00:05:04.840> like<00:05:05.020> very

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
going to play out it seems like very

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.350 
going to play out it seems like very
kind<00:05:05.470> of<00:05:05.560> team<00:05:05.889> kind<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.520> park<00:05:06.760> if<00:05:07.060> everyone

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
kind of team kind of park if everyone

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.120 
kind of team kind of park if everyone
was<00:05:07.510> run<00:05:07.630> this<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.050> basically<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.860> normal

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
was run this and basically the normal

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.890 
was run this and basically the normal
version<00:05:09.250> is<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.610> explosive<00:05:10.360> damage<00:05:10.510> is

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
version is that explosive damage is

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.300 
version is that explosive damage is
going<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.139> show<00:05:11.260> your<00:05:11.440> target<00:05:11.800> on<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:11.919> mini<00:05:12.130> map

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
going to show your target on a mini map

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.370 
going to show your target on a mini map
so<00:05:12.520> if<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.090> cook<00:05:13.270> grenade<00:05:13.660> throw<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.169> down

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
so if you cook grenade throw it down

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.600 
so if you cook grenade throw it down
towards<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.830> spawn<00:05:15.160> or<00:05:15.310> something<00:05:15.490> like<00:05:15.550> that

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
towards the spawn or something like that

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.820 
towards the spawn or something like that
and<00:05:15.729> then<00:05:15.940> anyone<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.020> gets<00:05:17.140> kind<00:05:17.440> of<00:05:17.500> damage

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
and then anyone that gets kind of damage

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.320 
and then anyone that gets kind of damage
by<00:05:17.979> it<00:05:18.039> they're<00:05:18.280> going<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.490> probably<00:05:18.880> pop<00:05:19.150> up

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
by it they're going to probably pop up

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.150 
by it they're going to probably pop up
as<00:05:19.450> they<00:05:19.750> would<00:05:19.930> as<00:05:20.110> if<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.380> UAV<00:05:20.620> ones<00:05:20.919> over

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
as they would as if a UAV ones over

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.890 
as they would as if a UAV ones over
there<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.940> pro<00:05:22.090> version<00:05:22.120> is<00:05:22.570> actually

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
there and the pro version is actually

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.240 
there and the pro version is actually
the<00:05:22.990> bullet<00:05:23.320> damage<00:05:23.440> is<00:05:23.830> going<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.039> show<00:05:24.160> it

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
the bullet damage is going to show it

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.010 
the bullet damage is going to show it
targets<00:05:24.610> so<00:05:24.760> basically<00:05:25.390> if<00:05:25.479> anyone's<00:05:25.750> running

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
targets so basically if anyone's running

this per gift say your whole team is
running<00:05:27.880> this<00:05:28.180> perk<00:05:28.450> then<00:05:29.080> anyone<00:05:29.710> on<00:05:30.070> the

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
running this perk then anyone on the

enemy team that you shoot you're pretty

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.210 
enemy team that you shoot you're pretty
much<00:05:31.539> going<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:31.840> know<00:05:31.990> where<00:05:32.140> they<00:05:32.229> are<00:05:32.260> so<00:05:32.590> I'm

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
much going to know where they are so I'm

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.580 
much going to know where they are so I'm
not<00:05:33.400> sure<00:05:33.490> how<00:05:33.610> how<00:05:34.539> big<00:05:34.720> a<00:05:34.780> role<00:05:35.140> is<00:05:35.289> can<00:05:35.440> play

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
not sure how how big a role is can play

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.050 
not sure how how big a role is can play
we're<00:05:35.710> old<00:05:35.830> enough<00:05:35.890> to<00:05:36.220> see<00:05:36.370> how<00:05:36.550> it<00:05:36.700> happens

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
we're old enough to see how it happens

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.880 
we're old enough to see how it happens
in<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.419> game<00:05:37.600> but<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:38.020> think<00:05:38.440> it's<00:05:38.650> probably

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
in the game but I think it's probably

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.230 
in the game but I think it's probably
going<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.190> be<00:05:39.250> kind<00:05:39.520> of<00:05:39.640> like<00:05:39.789> everyone<00:05:40.150> in

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
going to be kind of like everyone in

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.210 
going to be kind of like everyone in
your<00:05:40.360> team<00:05:40.539> agrees<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:41.140> run<00:05:41.320> recon<00:05:41.530> us<00:05:41.830> on<00:05:41.979> that

your team agrees to run recon us on that

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.740 
your team agrees to run recon us on that
because<00:05:42.490> i'm<00:05:42.970> not<00:05:43.060> sure<00:05:43.240> if<00:05:43.389> you're<00:05:43.479> planning

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
because i'm not sure if you're planning
