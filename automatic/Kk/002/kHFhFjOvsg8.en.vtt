00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
already inside of it it's not really a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.700

big deal to me I'm not sure if I prefer
back<00:00:31.920> spacer<00:00:32.309> where<00:00:32.460> standoffs<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.600> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
back spacer where standoffs but this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.120 
back spacer where standoffs but this
this<00:00:33.989> knifes<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.380> little<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.739> heavy<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this knifes a little bit heavy so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.560 
this knifes a little bit heavy so
anything<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> lighten<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.329> I'm

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
anything I can do to lighten it up I'm

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.819 
anything I can do to lighten it up I'm
going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> go<00:00:37.020> ahead<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.710> that

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
going to go ahead and do and I get that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
going to go ahead and do and I get that
that's<00:00:38.010> only<00:00:38.190> minimal<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:38.940> minimal<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that's only minimal but minimal but I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
that's only minimal but minimal but I
think<00:00:40.020> it'll<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> cool<00:00:40.469> cool<00:00:40.920> mod<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.280> do

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
think it'll be a cool cool mod to do

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.819 
think it'll be a cool cool mod to do
anyway<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.910> did<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:42.870> somebody<00:00:43.110> post<00:00:43.500> pictures

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
anyway I did see somebody post pictures

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.500 
anyway I did see somebody post pictures
of<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.129> blade<00:00:44.309> forms<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.969> that's<00:00:45.329> kind<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
of it on blade forms so that's kind of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.580 
of it on blade forms so that's kind of
where<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> got<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> idea<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
where I got the idea so I'm going to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.080 
where I got the idea so I'm going to
tape<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.739> blade<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:50.670> I'm<00:00:50.760> gonna<00:00:50.850> start

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
tape this blade and then I'm gonna start

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.240 
tape this blade and then I'm gonna start
disassembling<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.870> knife<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.800> those<00:00:52.920> blades

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
disassembling the knife and those blades

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.130 
disassembling the knife and those blades
taped<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.120> still<00:00:54.660> want<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.960> careful

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
taped you still want to be careful

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.729 
taped you still want to be careful

I'm going to leave in there so the blade

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770 
I'm going to leave in there so the blade

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.840 
is gonna stay intact I'm going to try to
do<00:01:30.959> this<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.770> through<00:01:32.100> working<00:01:32.369> through<00:01:32.670> one

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
do this all through working through one

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.910 
do this all through working through one
side<00:01:33.179> and<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:34.319> pick<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.709> side

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
side and I'm going to pick this side

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.440 
side and I'm going to pick this side
because<00:01:35.429> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.819> stop<00:01:36.030> pin<00:01:36.270> right

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
because you can see the stop pin right

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.969 
because you can see the stop pin right
there<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.810> can't<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.409> g10<00:01:37.740> side

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
there you can't see it on the g10 side

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.559 
there you can't see it on the g10 side
I'm<00:01:38.610> also<00:01:38.729> hoping<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.179> I'm<00:01:39.270> gonna<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.509> able

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
I'm also hoping that I'm gonna be able

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.929 
I'm also hoping that I'm gonna be able
to<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.229> without<00:01:40.439> cutting<00:01:40.920> off<00:01:41.099> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
to do this without cutting off the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.520 
to do this without cutting off the
lanyard<00:01:42.329> did<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.539> just<00:01:42.840> put<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.349> last

night
and<00:01:45.959> I<00:01:46.530> doubt<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.950> that's<00:01:47.099> gonna<00:01:47.220> happen

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.230 

well<00:02:20.430> maybe<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.790> will<00:02:22.910> no<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.090> definitely

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
well maybe it will no it's definitely

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.190 
well maybe it will no it's definitely
not<00:02:24.480> because<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.170> kind<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:26.690> I'm<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.990> through

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
not because I kind of I'm going through

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.570 
not because I kind of I'm going through
that<00:02:28.380> piece<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.410> there<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.650> go<00:02:31.680> lanyards<00:02:32.340> going

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
that piece so there we go lanyards going

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.550 
that piece so there we go lanyards going
okay<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.760> backspacer<00:02:36.390> came<00:02:36.570> right<00:02:36.750> off<00:02:36.780> and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
okay the backspacer came right off and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.070 
okay the backspacer came right off and
so<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.490> see<00:02:38.760> those<00:02:39.270> standoffs<00:02:39.780> are<00:02:39.900> right

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
so you can see those standoffs are right

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.890 
so you can see those standoffs are right
there<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:42.950> hopefully<00:02:44.210> you<00:02:45.210> can<00:02:45.270> see<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.540> nylon

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.170 
there so hopefully you can see the nylon
washer<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.470> there<00:02:46.850> hopefully<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.000> just

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
washer on there hopefully this just

00:02:48.180 --> 00:03:01.600 
washer on there hopefully this just
slides<00:02:48.360> right<00:02:48.570> back<00:02:48.630> together<00:02:48.900> no<00:02:49.260> problem

lining up here it's not quite lined up

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.970 
lining up here it's not quite lined up
as<00:03:49.940> there's<00:03:50.150> two<00:03:50.270> problems<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:51.560> first<00:03:51.740> one

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
as there's two problems the first one

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.380 
as there's two problems the first one
was<00:03:52.160> is<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.430> when<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.760> was<00:03:52.970> tightening<00:03:53.330> the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
was is that when I was tightening the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.630 
was is that when I was tightening the
screws<00:03:53.690> on<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.709> side<00:03:54.950> they<00:03:55.250> were<00:03:55.340> spinning

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
screws on this side they were spinning

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.730 
screws on this side they were spinning
on<00:03:55.880> that<00:03:56.030> side<00:03:56.240> so<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.450> had<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.690> get<00:03:56.870> another

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
on that side so I had to get another

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.380 
on that side so I had to get another
screwdriver<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.030> other<00:03:59.150> problem

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
screwdriver and then the other problem

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.810 
screwdriver and then the other problem
was<00:03:59.810> is<00:04:00.020> that<00:04:00.200> these<00:04:00.920> standoffs<00:04:01.459> were<00:04:01.580> kind<00:04:01.760> of

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
was is that these standoffs were kind of

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.630 
was is that these standoffs were kind of
pressed<00:04:02.060> fit<00:04:02.300> into<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.320> scale<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.400> once<00:04:04.580> I

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
pressed fit into this scale so once I

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.360 
pressed fit into this scale so once I
had<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:04.820> lined<00:04:05.000> up<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.300> stuck<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.630> in<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.810> vise

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
had it lined up I stuck it in a vise

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.830 
had it lined up I stuck it in a vise
that<00:04:07.370> not<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:07.640> not<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.000> metal<00:04:08.270> of<00:04:08.360> ice<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.480> rubber

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
that not a not a metal of ice a rubber

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.350 
that not a not a metal of ice a rubber
vise<00:04:09.020> and<00:04:09.580> squeezed<00:04:10.580> it<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:10.880> but<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.330> I

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
vise and squeezed it in but that I

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.490 
vise and squeezed it in but that I

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
didn't have the camera with me when I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.050 
didn't have the camera with me when I
did<00:04:12.680> all<00:04:12.770> that<00:04:12.800> so<00:04:13.580> I'm<00:04:13.640> gonna<00:04:13.790> go<00:04:13.850> ahead<00:04:13.910> and

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
we'll put these screws in now and we

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:49.000 
we'll put these screws in now and we
should<00:04:17.419> be<00:04:17.540> done

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.620 

these<00:04:50.010> screws<00:04:50.280> are<00:04:50.340> pretty<00:04:50.640> soft<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.420> I<00:04:51.450> don't

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
these screws are pretty soft so I don't

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:01.930 
these screws are pretty soft so I don't
I<00:04:51.720> don't<00:04:51.780> want<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.050> strip<00:04:52.260> any<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.620> them

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.130

alright folks there's the finished

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:11.420 
alright folks there's the finished
product<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:10.500> I<00:05:10.530> think<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.860> standoffs<00:05:11.220> look<00:05:11.370> a

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
product so I think the standoffs look a

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.780 
product so I think the standoffs look a
little<00:05:11.640> bit<00:05:11.730> better<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:13.650> know<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:14.040> can<00:05:14.640> joke
