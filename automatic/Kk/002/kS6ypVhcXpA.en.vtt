00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.620
 that hello everyone today we will have 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:09.700
 review such a mini review small review 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.620
 on the most popular game console in 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.980
 sony playstation 2 world 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.130
 she was sold out more than 150 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:24.640
 million copies prefix 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:27.970
 released from 2000 on the right year is not exactly 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.880
 I remember but it is sold even now in 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.030
 some stores and you can buy a new one 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.829
 slim version like mine here in this 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.510
 I also have a version with it 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:43.120
 buy about 6 thousand it costs here with us 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.909
 let's say dns store it is sold to 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.309
 now you can buy as well as with hands 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:53.229
 thousands for 3 plus games + 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.589
 Most consoles are already flashed if 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:59.949
 you can take my hands from me too 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.579
 still do so she read games with 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.039
 flash drives 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.439
 but for this you need to buy a pig too 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.649
 there drive some programs i do this 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.619
 didn't do it because i have a console for 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:17.469
 other goals you need to resell to me and 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:21.759
 asked her to sell that about her 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:25.270
 say here as you see unusual what 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.979
 Joystick connectors so the joystick 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.320
 raised will be problematic now 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.020
 it is possible to buy with such a connector somewhere 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 order in china also go for them 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 such are the memory cards 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:43.539
 here she can insert the door 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.689
 actually like two joysticks with this 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:51.189
 the connectors here are successful and possible 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:55.600
 they can also connect a joystick to them 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.369
 and this one I do nâ€™t know for sure 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.020
 it is interesting to connect here 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.630
 joystick and successful or not 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.020
 looks like a memory card all save with 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.140
 of games 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.410
 they are saved on it 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.340
 different in different memories i have on 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.340
 very megabyte 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:24.370
 slim version of sonic 2 is very very 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.430
 compact and very silent ie 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.610
 when you play some even the most 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.880
 such advanced games let gta san 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.570
 andreas is on this one on this console 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.770
 almost in communication makes noise unlike 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.700
 the same Sonya 3 ps3 slim I had it 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:50.980
 quite noisy but of course 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.480
 Heats up too but tolerantly tolerates 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.019
 comparison with a disk with usually yes I 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.050
 Attached not much more 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:02.290
 very easy you can carry money 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.810
 backpack easily fit the new you 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.080
 looks very cool by the way me 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:15.690
 like the design such a glossy insert 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.760
 the main plastic is so matt 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:25.230
 really cool done font here 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.549
 this square is also interesting for them 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.010
 ps2 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:35.350
 fun looks toys on this 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.110
 console and find no problem them very 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.910
 a lot of the last game was released 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.600
 2013 it was fifa 14 but do not think 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.630
 what 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.410
 fifa 14 here was released the same as 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.660
 and on the computer 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.560
 On the computer, of course, the graphics are much better 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.220
 other engine 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.730
 but here it can be said that it is a fifa 7 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.610
 fifa 07 just with updated compositions 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.459
 and with updated forms it was called fifa 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.410
 14 that is, the entire graphics engine there for sure 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.880
 same as on 7 fifi so some 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.870
 powerful games are modern here 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.510
 naturally you 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.849
 will not go and such games are legendary 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.109
 who were at the beginning of the two thousandth 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.889
 popular for example nedforspid 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:25.419
 underground 2 nedforspid underground gta 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:30.250
 various gta3 and gta san andreas 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.030
 Beijing and tekken tekken 4 can that 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.180
 set 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.330
 ps1 games that is actually a very game 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.320
 many more plus you can play flash drives 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.750
 I must have said so now with the games 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.750
 you will have no problems i think of course 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.710
 to the current generation if such a bag 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.840
 let's say but children they will not be me 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.570
 play because the graphics and games are already 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.020
 not so modern and look wrong 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.770
 cool and if you take the permissible and 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.770
 remember some old games then 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.500
 you can try the more my price 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.919
 it seems not well available at the moment 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.490
 three thousand more then you can 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:20.520
 resell here perhaps all this 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.520
 console it connects to the computer through 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:32.620
 here are the cable so-called tulips 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:35.139
 there is also an internet jack I think 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.169
 no one will use it because 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:42.820
 what's the multiplayer? 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:45.880
 some games novelty power supply here 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:53.680
 it is standard itself connecting to 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:55.690
 TV this one meets output two 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.300
 buttons here we have it open this 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.590
 shawl under the discs and turn off 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:08.130
 let's open it this way 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:11.500
 the connector is not a connector as a compartment for the disks 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.360
 This cap is very flimsy I 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.990
 can break if a little effort 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:21.510
 make over here so that's very much on 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.510
 flimsy made need to be careful 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:30.700
 here perhaps all brand name 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.640
 playstation such an interesting console is 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.160
 already history 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.810
 the legendary console was of course 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.290
 cool i play me here 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:45.640
 several games 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:49.270
 that 's the same here on these disks so 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:52.090
 to all those who want to play ps2 I 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.750
 I advise you to buy I advise you to take 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:58.810
 only slim version because of the version 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.380
 most likely everything is already mounted and and 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.040
 all killed by these more sizes she has 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.150
 more she warms more noise more 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.160
 take the steam version 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.510
 Of course there is no point in taking a new one because 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.730
 what new brethren have 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.520
 repaint yet 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:18.220
 the usual here you can take over 3000 to play 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.850
 all is well okay thanks for all 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.330
 viewing 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.330
 it was such a small review to everyone
