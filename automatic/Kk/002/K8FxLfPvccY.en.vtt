00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 all right 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.760
 very good to all welcome here in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.710
 spain today I bring you a short video of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.320
 how to put our product in soccer 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.780
 2015 pc with new graphics 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.240
 generation as you see the public is of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.240
 new generation like the one we have in 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.480
 the new consoles and both of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.460
 lighting like the grass here we can 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.830
 see the repetition is a patch 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.610
 It is obviously an alpha but we can 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.910
 see how the spe tests are already in 3-d 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.460
 and the lighting is much more good 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.030
 that the one that comes in the game escaped 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.940
 by konami no 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.890
 in this case we also have the mode 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.989
 rain here I do not know why it had 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.339
 put rain has put us but with the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.860
 rain also has a quite effect 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.769
 more real that we can not find in the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.850
 PC series version to see if we can 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.850
 teach the time 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.350
 this same stadium follows me 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.350
 rainy 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.090
 and well I'll leave the links in the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.910
 description this patch of a user 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.770
 on the other side dot net the user in 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.030
 question is called immortal here as 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.220
 you can see the effect of the rain is 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.290
 much more real than the one that comes standard 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.070
 and the public because you also see that it is the 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.350
 of new generation know that with friends 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.650
 he left layer two quite a few things in the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.980
 final game also good has its 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.840
 Cons not for the moment in the game itself 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.070
 and in the menu the grass is still 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.810
 flat and the textures to have removed 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.850
 in front of there is bad zinc that has the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.850
 game of konami that in the future in this 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.670
 patch because it will put the ante and 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.380
 zinc as god mandates 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.930
 what we find is that the players 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.540
 once inside the game they look 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.640
 pretty bad this can be fixed 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.680
 also with something to leave in the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.299
 description of the video that is using 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.369
 those sampling is using 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.929
 greater resolution which allows 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.340
 on this monitor in this case the video 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.900
 what I am teaching you is with the 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.000
 production soccer 2015 in 4k as you see 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.650
 it looks luxurious here we have the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.650
 repeat we see the rain 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.150
 much better than in the series game with 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.150
 the lawn in 3-d 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 and well, we will wait for future versions of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.829
 this patch to get better so much 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.019
 what we have already put as new things 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.489
 between them, for example in front of 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.829
 there is zinc for players that look 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.950
 well from afar but good if you have a pc 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.610
 powerful as I said before you can 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.200
 put this solution to play in 4k and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.420
 Well, you do not have any problem because 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.950
 the textures by having twice as many 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.720
 resolution because they look practically 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.010
 equal but better than what comes 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.480
 normal game at 1080p also tell you that 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.000
 this patch is not compatible at the moment 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.459
 with suit fx as it creates weird effects 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.459
 but good the creator is also in 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 it and then it will put something 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.510
 to fix it a custom sweet fx 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.500
 for this particular patch so 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.680
 good I leave you as I said the links in 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.360
 in the description and give it a like and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.750
 subscribe to the channel see you in the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.750
 next
