00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
today we're going to collect a crape

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.020 
today we're going to collect a crape
myrtle<00:00:05.520> legis<00:00:06.180> Romi<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.600> Aika<00:00:07.730> this<00:00:08.730> crape

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
myrtle legis Romi and Aika this crape

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.230 
myrtle legis Romi and Aika this crape
myrtle<00:00:09.420> was<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.440> ground<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.429> nursery

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
myrtle was in the ground in the nursery

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.810 
myrtle was in the ground in the nursery
when<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.139> moved<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:14.780> yet<00:00:15.890> more<00:00:16.890> than<00:00:17.100> likely<00:00:17.340> was

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
when I moved in yet more than likely was

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.840 
when I moved in yet more than likely was
put<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.570> originally<00:00:18.900> when<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.650> home<00:00:20.640> was

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
put in here originally when the home was

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.740 
put in here originally when the home was
originally<00:00:20.939> landscaped<00:00:21.840> back<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.320> 1955

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
originally landscaped back in 1955

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.000 
originally landscaped back in 1955
there's<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> pretty<00:00:25.109> impressive<00:00:25.439> trunk

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
there's a pretty impressive trunk

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.300 
there's a pretty impressive trunk
completely<00:00:26.820> Hollow<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:28.010> graded<00:00:29.010> about<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
completely Hollow and graded about a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.910 
completely Hollow and graded about a
foot<00:00:29.670> higher<00:00:30.000> than<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.349> originally

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
foot higher than what it was originally

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.610 
foot higher than what it was originally
so<00:00:32.160> there's<00:00:32.690> something<00:00:33.690> amazing<00:00:33.930> underneath

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so there's something amazing underneath

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.000 
so there's something amazing underneath
I<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:35.450> in<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.750> little<00:00:36.930> bit<00:00:37.230> we're<00:00:37.500> gonna<00:00:37.620> kind

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
I think in a little bit we're gonna kind

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.260 
I think in a little bit we're gonna kind
of<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.250> over<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.640> specifics<00:00:39.329> about<00:00:40.290> how<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
of go over the specifics about how to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.569 
of go over the specifics about how to
properly<00:00:42.559> dig<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> crape<00:00:43.920> myrtle<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
properly dig a crape myrtle up and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
properly dig a crape myrtle up and
aftercare<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.989> there's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.289> lot

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
aftercare as you can see there's a lot

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.150 
aftercare as you can see there's a lot
of<00:00:46.680> material<00:00:47.100> that's<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.789> cut<00:00:48.750> off

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
of material that's going to be cut off

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.799 
of material that's going to be cut off
we<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.489> our<00:00:50.520> intermittent<00:00:51.180> mist<00:00:51.390> put<00:00:51.690> up

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
we do have our intermittent mist put up

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.520 
we do have our intermittent mist put up
so<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> lot<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> these<00:00:53.600> branches<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.199> one

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so a lot of these branches like this one

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
so a lot of these branches like this one
up<00:00:55.649> top<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.760> interesting<00:00:57.090> movement

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
up top with this interesting movement

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.389 
up top with this interesting movement
but<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.140> has<00:00:58.289> zero<00:00:58.590> taper<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.160> zero

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
but then it has zero taper and zero

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.779 
but then it has zero taper and zero
interest<00:00:59.760> we'll<00:01:00.539> cut<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.789> put

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
interest we'll cut it right here and put

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.399 
interest we'll cut it right here and put
rooting<00:01:03.059> hormone<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.660> put<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.110> mist

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
rooting hormone on it put it in the mist

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.789 
rooting hormone on it put it in the mist
with<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.369> low<00:01:05.549> branch<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.210> left<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.590> grow

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
with this low branch here left to grow

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
with this low branch here left to grow
unrestricted<00:01:08.580> it'll<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.240> help<00:01:09.510> flare

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
unrestricted it'll actually help flare

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.620 
unrestricted it'll actually help flare
this<00:01:10.530> base<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.640> over<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> next<00:01:12.270> couple<00:01:12.510> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this base out over the next couple of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
this base out over the next couple of
years<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:14.310> interesting<00:01:14.850> piece<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
years to have an interesting piece of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719 
years to have an interesting piece of
material<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.689> maybe<00:01:15.900> has<00:01:16.310> an<00:01:17.310> interesting

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
material that maybe has an interesting

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.920 
material that maybe has an interesting
base<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.930> flare<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.950> doesn't<00:01:20.720> that's<00:01:21.720> fine

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
base and flare if it doesn't that's fine

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410 
base and flare if it doesn't that's fine
it<00:01:22.439> didn't<00:01:22.710> cost<00:01:22.860> anything<00:01:23.250> except<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it didn't cost anything except for a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.289 
it didn't cost anything except for a
time<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.049> couple<00:01:25.439> years<00:01:25.729> this<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.060> here

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
time a couple years this one right here

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
time a couple years this one right here
is<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> same<00:01:27.810> same<00:01:28.380> thing<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.040> cut<00:01:29.280> at

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
is the same same thing this was cut at

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640 
is the same same thing this was cut at
one<00:01:29.579> time<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.750> when<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> back<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
one time but then when it back but it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.300 
one time but then when it back but it
had<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> secondary<00:01:33.479> shoot<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.159> could

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
had a secondary shoot so what we could

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
had a secondary shoot so what we could
do<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:36.119> actually<00:01:36.890> cut<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.070> here

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
do is actually cut this here

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.550 
do is actually cut this here
and<00:01:40.430> put<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:41.820> mist<00:01:42.380> with<00:01:43.380> some

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and put this in the mist with some

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.410 
and put this in the mist with some
rooting<00:01:43.860> hormone<00:01:43.980> in<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.880> inorganic

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.040 
rooting hormone in in inorganic
aggregate<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.640> have<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.880> route<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
aggregate and have this route to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.730 
aggregate and have this route to
ultimately<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> sweet<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.160> tree<00:01:51.740> this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
ultimately have a sweet little tree this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.130 
ultimately have a sweet little tree this
is<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> trunk<00:01:53.310> line<00:01:53.460> right<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:55.020> kind

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
is the trunk line right here it's kind

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.470 
is the trunk line right here it's kind
of<00:01:55.290> hard<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:55.800> it's<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.330> have

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
of hard to see but it's there so we have

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.450 
of hard to see but it's there so we have
about<00:01:57.690> maybe<00:01:57.900> eight<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.380> ten<00:01:58.620> nice<00:01:59.100> little

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
about maybe eight to ten nice little

about maybe eight to ten nice little

crape myrtle starts that we're going to

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.110 
crape myrtle starts that we're going to
work<00:02:01.650> on<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.980> top<00:02:02.220> but<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.580> reason<00:02:02.880> why<00:02:03.000> I'm

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
work on the top but the reason why I'm

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120 
work on the top but the reason why I'm
collecting<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.720> isn't<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> little

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
collecting it isn't for the little

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.139 
collecting it isn't for the little
shoots<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.730> I'm<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:07.970> getting<00:02:08.970> off

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
shoots that I'm going to be getting off

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.020 
shoots that I'm going to be getting off
it's<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.570> wonderful<00:02:09.869> base<00:02:10.820> with<00:02:11.820> these

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
it's this wonderful base with these
