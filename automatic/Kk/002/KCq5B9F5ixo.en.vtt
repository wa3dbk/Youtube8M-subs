nothing here and that's understandable

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.220

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
says one thing we're talking about if

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.150 
says one thing we're talking about if
you<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.869> type<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.320> person<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.830> would<00:00:20.010> be

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
you are the type of person that would be

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.310 
you are the type of person that would be
interested<00:00:20.880> otherwise<00:00:21.689> there's<00:00:22.140> really

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
interested otherwise there's really

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.900 
interested otherwise there's really
nothing<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:23.100> we'll<00:00:23.279> probably<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:23.760> this

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
nothing here we'll probably make this

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.450 
nothing here we'll probably make this
very<00:00:24.119> short<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.689> very<00:00:24.750> sweet<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.680> let's

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
very short and very sweet so let's

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.220 
very short and very sweet so let's
tackle<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> two<00:00:27.029> topics<00:00:27.480> essentially<00:00:28.050> so

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
tackle the two topics essentially so

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
tackle the two topics essentially so
number<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.920> multiplayer<00:00:29.550> code<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
number one is multiplayer code so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
number one is multiplayer code so
apparently<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:31.019> been<00:00:31.140> some<00:00:31.439> issues<00:00:31.590> with

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
apparently there's been some issues with

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.590 
apparently there's been some issues with
multiplayer<00:00:32.340> recently<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> not<00:00:33.270> being<00:00:33.480> as

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
multiplayer recently it not being as

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.630 
multiplayer recently it not being as
stable<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.050> people<00:00:34.380> would<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.309> there's<00:00:35.579> been

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
stable as people would like there's been

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.130 
stable as people would like there's been
reports<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> crashing<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.750> kinds<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
reports of it crashing all kinds of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.720 
reports of it crashing all kinds of
things<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.559> they're<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.250> working<00:00:38.489> on

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
things so they're really working on

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.160 
things so they're really working on
trying<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.059> multiplayer<00:00:39.390> stable<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.079> they

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
trying to get multiplayer stable so they

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
trying to get multiplayer stable so they
can<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.680> stable<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.219> possible<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> one

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
can be as stable as possible for the one

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.380 
can be as stable as possible for the one
point<00:00:42.780> over<00:00:43.079> least<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:44.280> being<00:00:44.550> said<00:00:44.789> that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
point over least that being said that

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.209 
point over least that being said that
means<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.809> need<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.230> divert<00:00:46.829> some<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.070> their

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
means they need to divert some of their

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.860 
means they need to divert some of their
attention<00:00:47.309> from<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> normal<00:00:48.420> build<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
attention from the normal build of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.959 
attention from the normal build of
making<00:00:49.590> things<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.219> building<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> new

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
making things you know building the new

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.569 
making things you know building the new
features<00:00:51.360> NPCs<00:00:51.930> animation<00:00:52.620> stealth<00:00:52.949> etc<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
features NPCs animation stealth etc and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
features NPCs animation stealth etc and
focus<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.020> focus<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.010> multiplayer

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
focus and focus on the multiplayer

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.189 
focus and focus on the multiplayer
aspect<00:00:56.910> making<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> other<00:00:57.750> things<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
aspect making the other things get a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.349 
aspect making the other things get a
little<00:00:58.379> bit<00:00:58.590> more<00:00:58.710> delayed<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.789> what<00:01:00.180> their

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
little bit more delayed so what their

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
little bit more delayed so what their
solution<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.230> maybe<00:01:01.739> find<00:01:02.070> somebody

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
solution is is to maybe find somebody

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.740 
solution is is to maybe find somebody
who<00:01:02.760> could<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> hundred<00:01:03.239> percent<00:01:03.449> dedicated

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
who could be a hundred percent dedicated

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
who could be a hundred percent dedicated
to<00:01:04.260> multiplayer<00:01:04.830> which<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
to multiplayer which is where the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.960 
to multiplayer which is where the
interesting<00:01:06.540> portion<00:01:07.229> comes<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.790> are

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
interesting portion comes in if you are

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.330 
interesting portion comes in if you are
somebody<00:01:09.299> who's<00:01:09.689> fluent<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.229> C++<00:01:11.040> knows<00:01:11.310> a

the crafting update to the game a few
issues<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.049> resolve<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> new<00:02:04.710> animation

issues to resolve with the new animation

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.170 
issues to resolve with the new animation
system<00:02:05.219> that's<00:02:05.490> holding<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.820> back<00:02:05.969> from

further development on the moment

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.589 
further development on the moment
basically<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.860> re<00:02:08.099> export

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
basically they have to re export

basically they have to re export
hundreds<00:02:09.599> upon<00:02:09.720> hundreds<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.170> new<00:02:10.319> animations

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
hundreds upon hundreds of new animations

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.050 
hundreds upon hundreds of new animations
which<00:02:11.069> they've<00:02:11.370> talked<00:02:11.610> about<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.849> past

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
which they've talked about in the past

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.400 
which they've talked about in the past
but<00:02:12.599> once<00:02:12.750> that's<00:02:12.870> done<00:02:13.110> we'll<00:02:13.260> be

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
but once that's done we'll be

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.290 
but once that's done we'll be
looking<00:02:13.680> at<00:02:13.800> seeing<00:02:14.100> some<00:02:14.370> build<00:02:14.550> 32<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.210> I

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
looking at seeing some build 32 in the I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.540 
looking at seeing some build 32 in the I
would<00:02:15.600> assume<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:16.140> will<00:02:16.530> back<00:02:16.710> up<00:02:16.890> my<00:02:17.010> save<00:02:17.250> file

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
would assume I will back up my save file

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.670 
would assume I will back up my save file
basically<00:02:17.940> no<00:02:18.450> news<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:18.750> right<00:02:19.140> now<00:02:19.320> and
