00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.250
 as such 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.490
 good to everyone here and raven again in 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.769
 an ambo sing I already know that these last 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.480
 They frequent a lot but it's a day 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.730
 quite interesting for those who 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.470
 we are blizzard fans because today 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.140
 devil repair of souls or rather already 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.790
 He left 15 hours ago for but like me 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.070
 I like to buy physical things 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.410
 I was able to play at 12 o'clock at night and I had 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.259
 to go at 3 to the store to buy 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.250
 an edition the worst edition of devil 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.890
 that exists that is the edition 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.449
 collector that the intellectual box of 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.039
 which we will do now 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.839
 unfortunately in lighting leaves 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.460
 much to be desired as you can see so 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.609
 the box looks pretty obviously but 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.379
 I assure you that it is precious to me 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.390
 love the texture of the letters that 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.159
 they shine a little is very beautiful but good 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.960
 here there is more reflection than something else like that 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.530
 that we're going to take the fret off of 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.319
 above because we do not want that for 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.120
 nothing and while I'm removing you 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.120
 I say that obviously those who have 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.860
 followed my first and second channel will know 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.170
 that I made a complete series of devil 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.430
 3 original that I do not have it in 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.120
 collector not even in physical 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.850
 why not 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.070
 next to the annual wow step though 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.890
 I like the truth in physics 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.220
 so for that same reason I'm going to do 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.229
 me a complete series of repair shows to 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.810
 starting today will be long chapters 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.490
 because I want to upload the full game what 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.650
 as soon as possible to have it there for 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.119
 all of you so that you enjoy but 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.920
 well let's see first the thing left 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.330
 back which is the typical piece of paper that you 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.820
 he says that is what the edition includes 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.740
 collector and includes the game 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.740
 proper obviously for pc 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.900
 and for mac if I'm not wrong dvd and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.390
 blu-ray about how the band was made 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.030
 music sound illustrations 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.190
 repression is a little book in the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.050
 carpet that is a pretty bad 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.030
 that she does not use a person 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.780
 collectors and some things 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.369
 exclusive of the game as in cannes 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.050
 spectral and transfigura bless 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.399
 for devil the mascot for the egg 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.490
 some portraits for other games of 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.670
 blazer and apart if you put your code 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.100
 or collector of devil 3 before 31 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.930
 March on battle net you will have some 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.200
 how many exclusive things more like 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.150
 wings and I do not know what what little things more than 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.560
 I honestly do not care much but 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.340
 well it 's an extra extra because I do not suppose 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.440
 what for 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.780
 I caught her as soon as possible and not wait 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.420
 down price because for what 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.879
 this thing is worth too much devil 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.310
 is evil and malevolent and evil and everything 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.680
 is tested for that why that much 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.930
 this little thing in particular is worth 80 euros 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.400
 so that includes I think it's a steal and 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.650
 I think they are taking advantage of it a little 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.970
 that we fans of skillful and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.250
 zÃ¡rate we are collecting things 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.780
 collectors for many years and 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.840
 I for example could not miss a 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.599
 more I wanted her to have my possession and although 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.250
 worth 80 euros I had to buy it from 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.069
 done so I can lower the camera to 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.870
 teach the face a little better because it is 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.760
 what deserves it is very nice what happens 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.790
 is that my lighting in this room 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.440
 it's a mess so it looks very dark 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.290
 I think I'm going to turn off the screen that does not 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.640
 they behaved the day finished x to 30 ni 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.299
 bottles that I think I have here for the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.160
 ground 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.780
 I think so a little looks best 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.180
 there is not much space pressed in 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.370
 all its glory but it's pretty believe me it's 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.840
 very pretty because he does one thing of that 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.840
 I have the mobile flash 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.400
 It is very beautiful and this is how the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.740
 reliefs of the letters slogans I think 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.110
 I think it is worth spending some 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.090
 seconds you know how beautiful it is but not 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.250
 we turn off the light and we're going to start 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.020
 open this thing to see what's inside 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.760
 for that you will have to raise the camera 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.350
 again and remove those bottles from here 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.350
 and one here three years at least 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.480
 I would have to have a fish eye to 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.170
 this camera seriously 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.700
 I do not fit and everything I want to record 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.989
 looking at what he wants to finish the 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.459
 invitation is small but the area where 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.810
 draw yes that is small this 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.940
 obviously opens like all 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.160
 recent blizzard boxes for 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.580
 above 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.070
 hi open 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.760
 and it accomplishes tenths provided with use 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.350
 always go up 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.880
 journalists love our things 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.340
 here an image of malta he 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.139
 Obviously this is the art book 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.880
 that also does not come over with 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.160
 parasol these mats as I said 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.510
 I do not like them very much they are plastic but 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.130
 They are beautiful I think they are designs 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.380
 exclusive and the truth is that it moves 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.639
 a lot of malta design the and such but 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.289
 I'm not going to use it luckily I have the 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.479
 knock down that is quite more comfortable 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.940
 because it's made of cloth and it's much more accurate 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.639
 to really let's open the book of 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.410
 art to see how I can open it 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.410
 because it has a lot of plastic to avoid 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.230
 plastic front 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.880
 plastic the soil and this also has 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.550
 a little bit of relief not too much but 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.200
 something you see that this way you can appreciate and 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.420
 now it is very beautiful 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.160
 illustration is the same as there but it is 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.230
 very pretty and behind I love this 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.330
 It also has relief is very nice 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.010
 also and good is a booklet I do not know 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.860
 how many pages you will have is pretty fat 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.120
 and heavy and therefore has the typical 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.830
 illustrations of how they were made 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.330
 some bugs do not see any 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.030
 cartoon that sometimes count as 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.860
 you can see and similar things that good 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.200
 and I expressed a look I'm not a 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.250
 great fan to see things like that but 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.910
 it would depend on a glance I always do it 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.910
 and here too 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.410
 this place of honor this is the cd 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.910
 music a cd a second a cardboard 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.140
 basically inside is the cd of 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.940
 music I'm not going to open it because it does not have 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.620
 sense has more mystery come the 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.150
 tracks that are included that are not 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.540
 many but always bizet music 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.730
 it's very good so itunes 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.520
 and here we have the game if I do not 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.840
 wrong if this is the dvd game of 5 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.430
 exministra that is not worth it either 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.920
 open it because only the CD comes and little 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.940
 more not seeing and manuals lately in 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.940
 I keep this here 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.780
 and the last thing I think we have left is the 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.850
 tvdc behind the scenes that is a dvd and 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.370
 blu-ray that I like that there is this 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.260
 possibility of putting it in blu-ray and it's 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.210
 basically how it became devil that 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.140
 it does not have more mystery as you can 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.570
 see to be a collector's edition 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.610
 it's pretty poor does not include many 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.710
 things usually gets you many more 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.480
 things like for example to see if 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.970
 I remove a little the camera could teach 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.710
 a little thing that we put with the views 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.520
 highlighted for example 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:44.210
 quite higher 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.520
 in the pendrive this one of the traitor was 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.139
 pretty nice divine for a price 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.840
 minor if I'm not wrong so I think that 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.970
 this is a bit scam and a bit stolen but 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.330
 I bought the same with his same man with 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.220
 Its the same but good, I've already taught you 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.560
 how is the box inside on the outside and 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.690
 by all everywhere 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.449
 available is pretty pretty yes and 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.789
 They are always very nice to use 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:09.620
 approach and there's not much more to teach 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.690
 nor that telling this is all there is 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.729
 many things as I say for 80 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.409
 euros I think this is a scam but 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.880
 we will see that after the games game has 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.110
 a few rather high minutes in what 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.819
 we 've been on the day I've seen some 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.560
 I'm not going to do a review 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:23.360
 home in charge of a complete play and 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.069
 you can see the first chapter today if 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.009
 everything goes as planned as I think 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.809
 that today you can 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:30.460
 enjoy the first chapter that the 

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:32.770
 I still make them quite long for 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.809
 upload the game as soon as possible but 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.809
 well I hope that as always 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.319
 until next time
