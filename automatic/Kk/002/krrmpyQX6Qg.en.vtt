00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 and so guys hello everyone from the sun 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.820
 california valleys today we will have 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.240
 problem video let's say so with us 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:17.960
 the refrigerator is broken well, in general, he 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.939
 not broken it just started let's say 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.119
 here's a freezer yes that is there 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.560
 the fridge is like this 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.099
 the refrigerator here and it is divided into two 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.290
 sections that is in one section just 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.890
 products on the other section freezing 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.840
 the camera is this freezer and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.840
 another section is just a section well i'm so 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.390
 just as you detail because how 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.469
 so that it is clear then and here 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.629
 that's where here here here here here 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.850
 the temperature is shown which is a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.210
 freezer temperature is yes 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.229
 inside this section so here we are 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:09.060
 this sensor started to show 25 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:11.490
 To hell with them here these as a Fahrenheit, well yes here 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.040
 naturally as if it is clear that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.700
 the freezer does not work as 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.189
 need to work in general, so what am I talking about? 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.990
 the whole thing I really just want 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.270
 now show you how much it is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.860
 worth it means we did my husband 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.320
 he called in the morning called the company here 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.180
 to this company 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.960
 here they have written it even that 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.590
 the next repair will cost you 25 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.979
 dollars 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.140
 of the night at minus $ 25 here means 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.829
 so he called this company came 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.320
 the young man sort of began to understand 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.960
 with this fridge pushed him there 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.740
 something on turned on and off looked in 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.990
 general 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.399
 started something there doing a lot of things i 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.930
 freed and here on this whole 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.720
 freezer there all by 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.330
 pulled out here so he began to explain 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.659
 In general, the fact that there is not work there is something 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.599
 burnt out well, you know how firstly 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:14.370
 woman to explain more and in English well 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.410
 that is, of course I understood him 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.590
 it doesn't really matter to me 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:28.799
 painted everything you need and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.720
 and all that is not necessary means I want this 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.830
 still a moment for a little how about yes 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.680
 addition, I noticed and do not know why in 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.840
 America I don't know for sure or this is not 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.630
 so come across or is it I do not know whether it 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.170
 so really every second writes 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.500
 with my left hand I don't know why I don't know what 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.380
 This is a feature of such here, but they write 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.630
 they just scribble here watch this 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.970
 it's still very cool here everything is written here 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.810
 at least something can be main board on 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.820
 parse there has hit em this is 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.799
 heating paws and that is in general 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.320
 in short here he painted here all 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.480
 what you need he did not say such a thing you 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.660
 You know, I'll do it now, but through 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.609
 a week he will be maximum again 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.109
 heated that is, everything will be back 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.900
 same he is there 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.030
 somehow defrosted it with a hair dryer 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.040
 That's all Nelly ice in general, I do not know 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.590
 that man peacefully laughed at me of course 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.859
 but never mind, I tell as 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.630
 like a woman to tell here he is not all 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.430
 it began to tell there to show 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.230
 explain and in general I said yes 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.810
 I'll do it for a week 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.970
 here it is necessary to order some details 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.639
 I don’t have the parts with me 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.519
 I will order it for you for a week 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:50.459
 I'll do next monday just 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.769
 I will come and change the details here 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.560
 in general, everything is painted to what 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.450
 ideas like for everything for that I did a note 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.350
 paid five hundred twenty three dollars 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:05.880
 that is, I kinda paid already 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.400
 and he will continue to do so, as it were 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.190
 next monday yes that is 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.100
 he did not leave a receipt as if with all 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.190
 There numbers from payment with the address 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.650
 companies with all the affairs here and in general 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.010
 here it is 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.980
 I don’t know so much money honestly 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.950
 big this breakage is serious this semi 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.370
 how would she of course seriously if not 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:36.360
 works freezer naturally it can be seen 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.060
 just beyond the statute of limitations can probably 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.190
 be these devices there are some here 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.170
 who broke they went out well 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.750
 in general, there is nothing forever yes all 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.330
 need to change but the fact is that of course 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:54.630
 yes, how would such a lot of money 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.730
 And well, I do not know insurance of course 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.620
 no matter what it is 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.990
 why don't I have a fridge there 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.820
 as far as I honestly do not even know 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.720
 how much is this fridge at all 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.150
 then years or he and asked me 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.790
 this guy he says like this long ago 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.620
 the fridge here I say 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.200
 I know this fridge 10 months what 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.180
 there I am as if not in the know I'm honest 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.540
 saying even he already forgot to ask here 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.310
 how long is this refrigerator because 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.040
 what can really be but no 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.420
 Of course no insurance is no longer here but 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.170
 in general, here and so 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.330
 fix up the fridge well again in 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.580
 depending on which problem with which 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.390
 It’s a problem, but what’s there 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.870
 burned out 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.070
 some kind of heating you can see 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.120
 heating lamp that's how I understood 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:50.270
 there is a tricky lamp but here's such here 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.060
 the sum is well, in general, that's all 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.230
 such a short video about our 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.220
 refrigerator What all until
