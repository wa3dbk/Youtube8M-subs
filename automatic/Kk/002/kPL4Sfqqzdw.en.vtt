00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
dogs are really loyal creatures and I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
dogs are really loyal creatures and I
think<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.609> why<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.480> humans<00:01:00.960> love<00:01:01.140> them

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
think that's why we as humans love them

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.860 
think that's why we as humans love them
so<00:01:01.559> much<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.879> it<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.210> sad<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.719> now

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so much so it was really sad but now

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.420 
so much so it was really sad but now
he's<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.350> us<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> we'll<00:01:04.920> take<00:01:05.070> care<00:01:05.280> of

he's here with us and we'll take care of
them<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.700> hopefully<00:01:05.820> find<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> better

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.890 
them and hopefully find them a better
home<00:01:06.810> he<00:01:07.409> probably<00:01:07.680> does<00:01:07.950> miss<00:01:08.250> her<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.900> we're

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
home he probably does miss her but we're

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.620 
home he probably does miss her but we're
kind<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:11.000> distracting<00:01:12.000> him<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.180> other<00:01:12.420> dogs
