00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.809
 there are people I am juniors and I made this video 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.809
 for all those people that you have 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.240
 asked how bling is done but I 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.340
 You could teach it to blind fire 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 it's very simple and I always taught the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.030
 people in private parties and has 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.810
 helped also why I was not going to get a 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.740
 video teaching all of you and good 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.740
 in short is the following 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.440
 in the following examples that go to 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.720
 see are long- distance examples where 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.220
 the imaginary point is always against 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.840
 farther three enemies the point 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.540
 imaginary will always be more more 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.010
 centered on the screen farther but 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.870
 it is simply an approximation 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.489
 you believe that there are fixed points neither gives 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.840
 simply an approximation because 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.180
 you know that the bullet goes to one side 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.500
 as for another but one thing that you have 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.460
 have to be clear that against the objective 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.080
 is subject further the bullet tends more to 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.000
 open then the point is always 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.280
 further from the screen if the goal 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.500
 is closer the bullet gives less 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.530
 time to open therefore the point 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.290
 is always closer to the doll here 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.190
 As you can see I am implying that 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.320
 you have to practice 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.120
 the blind fire with the center of the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.550
 screen from a distance what is 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.350
 trying here is to try to hit him with the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.870
 center of the screen to the madman who is going 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.990
 in the distance and then aimed for you to see 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.540
 more or less where the shot has been 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.210
 there are many people who say there is a point 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.979
 imaginary and it 's here and it always shoots 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 considering this point always 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.509
 shoot in this way is a lie 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.250
 because the bullet tends to open so 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.729
 So much is not going to be the same closely 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.729
 from afar 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.240
 the next example that you are going to see are 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.280
 at a short distance 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.650
 at a short distance as you will see 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.659
 the imaginary circle is closer 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.700
 because when dealing with times of crisis 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.590
 therefore it is closer to the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.950
 target what you have to aim so 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.950
 above 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.399
 once you know how to shoot short and 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.350
 middle distance the only thing that remains is 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.240
 practice and also many times things 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.710
 so do not think there is nobody 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.470
 is the best in the world doing blind 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.720
 fire and nothing is very lucky lots of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.540
 Sometimes the only thing that can be handled is 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.890
 blind fer perhaps a very short distance 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.890
 simply body with body stuck 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.870
 all right 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.890
 then a movement that very 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.140
 few people teach everyone teaches 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.390
 how to do blind fer I do not know what moves me 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.260
 I'm here already such but very few people 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.620
 says how how to make the movement how 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.060
 get a better result when it comes to 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.910
 make a wine but because many people 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.030
 he tried in blind fire and always 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.440
 kill or fail one of the movements that 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.440
 I always do is this 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.670
 it's very easy you just have to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.070
 take advantage of any moment of confusion 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.530
 either because they are shooting with 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.710
 lancer or because he is distracted or 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.030
 simply because you look confident and 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.700
 you know you're going to move forward you're going to dodge 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.320
 the shot simply and most importantly 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.990
 to make this movement the first thing is 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.850
 be quick at the time of shooting you have to 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.310
 be very fast recontra faster roll 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.950
 more possibility you have to put them 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.120
 the shot that does not give you your shot and 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.940
 another one of the very important points 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.730
 observe if you are being blocked if you 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.980
 they are shooting and they hide if you 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.080
 approach and shoot will have greater 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.780
 possibility of giving a tad ftr in the 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.490
 head and being hurt is easier 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.410
 give a faire jump those are the two 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.440
 most important points for me to 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.690
 make a wing fire and that's all but 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.460
 I hope you can practice 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.490
 movement that I promise you is a 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.770
 moment that serves a lot and that's all 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.819
 until next time 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.819
 who is getting into
