right now it's unparalleled in MLS and
that's<00:01:24.540> pretty<00:01:25.110> strong<00:01:25.470> talk<00:01:25.770> considering

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that's pretty strong talk considering

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880 
that's pretty strong talk considering
the<00:01:26.670> number<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.360> playmakers<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.380> making

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the number of playmakers we have making

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
the number of playmakers we have making
stuff<00:01:29.189> happen<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.030> league<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
stuff happen all over the league so I

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.300 
stuff happen all over the league so I
think<00:01:30.810> maybe<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.500> Houston<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.159> bring

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
think maybe for Houston they bring

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.160 
think maybe for Houston they bring
another<00:01:32.579> deem<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> mix<00:01:33.540> servando

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
another deem it into the mix servando

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.740 
another deem it into the mix servando
carrasco<00:01:34.710> weren't<00:01:35.670> revolt<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.180> he's<00:01:36.360> fit<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
