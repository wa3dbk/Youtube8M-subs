we're gonna look at a kind of diagram

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.369 
we're gonna look at a kind of diagram
called<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.580> phase<00:00:05.819> diagram<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.690> shows<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
called a phase diagram that shows a

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.200

started on what's going on in this graph
first<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.670> pressure<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.180> one

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
first of all we have pressure on one

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.270 
first of all we have pressure on one
axis<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.469> temperature<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> the

area<00:00:56.910> into<00:00:57.180> three<00:00:57.449> regions<00:00:57.770> we<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
area into three regions we have the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.670 
area into three regions we have the
solid<00:00:59.430> region<00:00:59.579> over<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> ice<00:01:01.230> for

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
solid region over here which is ice for

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.250 
solid region over here which is ice for
water<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> liquid<00:01:03.660> region<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
water we have the liquid region in the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.969 
water we have the liquid region in the
middle<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:06.299> called<00:01:06.540> water<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.110> we

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
middle which is just called water and we

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.550 
middle which is just called water and we
have<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> gas<00:01:08.490> region<00:01:08.850> over<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
have the gas region over here which we

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.670 
have the gas region over here which we
call<00:01:10.770> vapour<00:01:11.720> now<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> way<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.200> diagram

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
call vapour now the way this diagram

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.100 
call vapour now the way this diagram
works<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> pick<00:01:15.270> any<00:01:15.450> set<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
works is that if you pick any set of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350 
works is that if you pick any set of
conditions<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.070> any<00:01:17.280> set<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.640> pressure<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
conditions so any set of pressure and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.030 
conditions so any set of pressure and
temperature<00:01:18.439> it's<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> give<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
temperature it's going to give you a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.149 
temperature it's going to give you a
point<00:01:20.430> somewhere<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.390> map<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.009> let's<00:01:23.009> say

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
point somewhere on this map so let's say

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
point somewhere on this map so let's say
I<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> point<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:25.049> some

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
I have a point right here it's at some

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.340 
I have a point right here it's at some
pressure<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.369> temperature<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.780> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
pressure in some temperature I know that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
pressure in some temperature I know that
at<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> temperature<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.340> pressure<00:01:29.549> water

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
at that temperature and pressure water

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.840 
at that temperature and pressure water
will<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> liquid<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.159> dot<00:01:32.430> this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
will be a liquid because this dot this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.440 
will be a liquid because this dot this
point<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> liquid<00:01:34.200> space<00:01:34.700> if<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.240> had

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
point is in the liquid space if I had

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.530 
point is in the liquid space if I had
instead<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.290> condition<00:01:38.070> down<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.270> some

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
instead a condition down here so some

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
instead a condition down here so some
temperature<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.890> looks<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> very

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
temperature with what looks like a very

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460 
temperature with what looks like a very
low<00:01:41.729> pressure<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.840> looks<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.200> I'm<00:01:43.380> gonna

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
low pressure it looks like I'm gonna

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.460 
low pressure it looks like I'm gonna
have<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.770> gas<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.700> my<00:01:44.820> substance<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:46.259> that's

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
have a gas for my substance so that's

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.100 
have a gas for my substance so that's
generally<00:01:46.979> how<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.430> diagram<00:01:47.909> works<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
generally how this diagram works now the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.219 
generally how this diagram works now the
lines<00:01:49.560> mean<00:01:50.220> something<00:01:50.670> special<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.930> lines

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
lines mean something special the lines

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.190 
lines mean something special the lines
represent<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> set<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.759> conditions<00:01:54.299> where<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
represent the set of conditions where a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.039 
represent the set of conditions where a
phase<00:01:55.740> change<00:01:55.770> starts<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.759> happen<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.960> let's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
phase change starts to happen so let's

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.690 
phase change starts to happen so let's
look<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> point<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> these<00:01:59.340> lines

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
look at a point on one of these lines

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.359 
look at a point on one of these lines
for<00:02:00.030> example<00:02:00.409> let's<00:02:01.409> take<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> point<00:02:01.920> right

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
for example let's take the point right

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.959 
for example let's take the point right
here<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.719> at<00:02:03.840> 101<00:02:04.320> point<00:02:04.649> 3<00:02:04.920> kilo<00:02:05.280> pascals<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
here so at 101 point 3 kilo pascals of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.130 
here so at 101 point 3 kilo pascals of
pressure<00:02:06.240> at<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.649> point<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.220> where<00:02:08.879> ice

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
pressure at this point is where ice

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
pressure at this point is where ice
becomes<00:02:10.140> water<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.830> where<00:02:11.250> water<00:02:11.489> becomes<00:02:11.849> ice

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
becomes water or where water becomes ice

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.980 
becomes water or where water becomes ice
if<00:02:12.300> we're<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.660> other

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
if we're going the other

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.010 
if we're going the other
direction<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.700> way<00:02:14.970> would<00:02:15.420> be<00:02:15.450> melting

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
direction so this way would be melting

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.100 
direction so this way would be melting
and<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.920> way<00:02:17.130> would<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.760> freezing<00:02:18.090> at<00:02:18.390> this

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
and this way would be freezing at this

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.380 
and this way would be freezing at this
point<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.740> we<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.760> figure<00:02:20.970> out<00:02:21.090> what

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
point and we can figure out what

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.960 
point and we can figure out what
temperature<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.470> change<00:02:22.830> happens<00:02:23.250> at<00:02:23.430> by

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
temperature this change happens at by

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.900 
temperature this change happens at by
just<00:02:24.210> dropping<00:02:24.450> down<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:25.460> vertical<00:02:26.460> line<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
just dropping down a vertical line and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.540 
just dropping down a vertical line and
reading<00:02:27.510> what<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> temperature<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.860> at<00:02:29.190> that

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
reading what the temperature is at that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.570 
reading what the temperature is at that
point<00:02:30.020> now<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.260> case<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:32.040> know<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
point now in this case we know that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.870 
point now in this case we know that
water<00:02:32.810> freezes<00:02:33.810> at<00:02:33.990> zero<00:02:34.290> degrees<00:02:34.590> Celsius<00:02:34.880> so

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
water freezes at zero degrees Celsius so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.090 
water freezes at zero degrees Celsius so
this<00:02:36.090> point<00:02:36.390> here<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.900> zero<00:02:37.620> degree<00:02:37.890> Celsius

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
this point here is zero degree Celsius

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.140 
this point here is zero degree Celsius
if<00:02:38.610> we<00:02:39.510> look<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.080> point<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.880> this<00:02:41.880> other

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
if we look at this point on this other

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
if we look at this point on this other
line<00:02:42.420> over<00:02:42.750> here<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> line

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
line over here that is on the line

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.750 
line over here that is on the line
between<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.030> liquid<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.540> gas<00:02:45.600> areas<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.580> we

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
between the liquid and gas areas so we

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.850 
between the liquid and gas areas so we
know<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.570> direction<00:02:49.110> from<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.560> liquid

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
know that this direction from a liquid

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.250 
know that this direction from a liquid
to<00:02:50.010> gas<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.520> vaporization<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:52.080> this

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
to gas is vaporization and in this

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.070 
to gas is vaporization and in this
direction<00:02:52.520> we<00:02:53.520> have<00:02:53.700> gas<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.270> liquid<00:02:54.330> which

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
direction we have gas to a liquid which

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.340 
direction we have gas to a liquid which
is<00:02:55.140> condensation<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.810> those<00:02:57.810> two<00:02:58.080> phase

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
is condensation so those two phase

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.410 
is condensation so those two phase
changes<00:02:58.860> also<00:02:59.070> occur<00:02:59.760> at<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.120> particular

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
changes also occur at a particular

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.800 
changes also occur at a particular
temperature<00:03:01.020> at<00:03:01.290> standard<00:03:02.190> pressure<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
temperature at standard pressure and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.690 
temperature at standard pressure and
that<00:03:03.810> particular<00:03:04.230> temperature<00:03:04.830> for<00:03:05.430> boiling

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
that particular temperature for boiling

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.170 
that particular temperature for boiling
or<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.300> condensation<00:03:07.020> we<00:03:07.860> know<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.700> hundred

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
or for condensation we know is a hundred

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.080 
or for condensation we know is a hundred
degrees<00:03:09.510> Celsius<00:03:10.310> now<00:03:11.310> there's<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.580> third<00:03:11.820> line

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
degrees Celsius now there's a third line

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.640 
degrees Celsius now there's a third line
segment<00:03:12.510> we<00:03:12.600> haven't<00:03:12.810> talked<00:03:12.990> about<00:03:13.110> yet<00:03:13.440> and

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
segment we haven't talked about yet and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.980 
segment we haven't talked about yet and
that's<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.400> down<00:03:14.580> here<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.720> this

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
that's the one down here so this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.950 
that's the one down here so this
condition<00:03:16.680> where<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.430> solid<00:03:17.850> becomes<00:03:18.090> directly

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
condition where a solid becomes directly

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.620 
condition where a solid becomes directly
a<00:03:18.990> gas<00:03:19.260> or<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> gas<00:03:20.220> directly<00:03:20.550> becomes<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.270> solid

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
a gas or a gas directly becomes a solid

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.740 
a gas or a gas directly becomes a solid
we<00:03:22.200> know<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.530> sublimation<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.370> deposition

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
we know that sublimation and deposition

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.050 
we know that sublimation and deposition
those<00:03:24.750> phase<00:03:25.050> changes<00:03:25.700> notice<00:03:26.700> how<00:03:26.820> it's<00:03:27.000> not

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
those phase changes notice how it's not

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.240 
those phase changes notice how it's not

sublimation of water to occur the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.560 
sublimation of water to occur the

all<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:54.630> means<00:04:54.930> is<00:04:55.170> that<00:04:55.260> if<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:55.740> go<00:04:55.890> higher

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
for a liquid to exist so we call it the

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.630 
for a liquid to exist so we call it the
critical<00:05:04.020> point<00:05:04.260> because<00:05:04.590> past<00:05:05.070> this<00:05:05.340> point
