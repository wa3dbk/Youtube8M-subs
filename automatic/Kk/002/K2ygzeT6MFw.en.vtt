every every game play for me in that

it<00:02:22.900> cuz<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.290> think<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.099> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
it cuz I think this is like the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.559 
it cuz I think this is like the
douchiest<00:02:24.579> part<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:24.939> commentary<00:02:25.360> if<00:02:25.450> you

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
douchiest part of the commentary if you

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.229 
douchiest part of the commentary if you
ask<00:02:25.720> me<00:02:25.930> always<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.129> gameplay<00:02:27.610> introduction

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.780 
honest I think these players were pretty
bad<00:03:07.389> and<00:03:07.659> I<00:03:07.720> didn't<00:03:07.959> notice<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.319> too<00:03:08.409> like

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
bad and I didn't notice it too like

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.830 
bad and I didn't notice it too like
whatever<00:03:09.790> halfway<00:03:10.209> through<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.510> game<00:03:10.629> that<00:03:10.810> i

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
whatever halfway through the game that i

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.149 
whatever halfway through the game that i
was<00:03:10.959> playing<00:03:11.170> it's<00:03:11.319> bad<00:03:11.500> players<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.099> i

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
was playing it's bad players and so i

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.589 
was playing it's bad players and so i
really<00:03:12.340> didn't<00:03:12.609> get<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.760> take<00:03:13.329> full<00:03:13.480> advantage

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
really didn't get to take full advantage

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.539 
really didn't get to take full advantage
of<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.049> lobby<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:14.530> what<00:03:15.129> are<00:03:15.189> you<00:03:15.250> gonna<00:03:15.310> do<00:03:15.519> I

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
I realized that it's probably not a good
