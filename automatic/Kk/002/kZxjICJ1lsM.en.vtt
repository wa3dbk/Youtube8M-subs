that's<00:00:46.469> pretty<00:00:46.649> much<00:00:46.860> where<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.250> love<00:00:47.430> ends

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.889 
that's pretty much where my love ends
with<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.940> product<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.510> found<00:00:48.690> that

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
with this product because I found that

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
with this product because I found that
it<00:00:49.020> didn't<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.289> anything<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it didn't do anything at all to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.220 
it didn't do anything at all to
moisturize<00:00:50.850> my<00:00:50.879> lips<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:52.050> want<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
moisturize my lips now I don't want to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.900 
moisturize my lips now I don't want to
say<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.710> tried<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.219> lips<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.640> felt

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
say that it tried out my lips but I felt

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.119 
say that it tried out my lips but I felt
like<00:00:54.059> after<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.289> two<00:00:55.469> hours<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
like after the one or two hours that it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
like after the one or two hours that it
takes<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.579> dissipate<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:57.539> lips<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:58.440> lips

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
takes to dissipate for my lips my lips

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.220 
takes to dissipate for my lips my lips

tiny tad bit moisturize it kind of

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.500

reminded<00:01:04.739> me<00:01:04.830> actually<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> EOS<00:01:06.090> lip<00:01:06.330> balm

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
reminded me actually of the EOS lip balm

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
reminded me actually of the EOS lip balm
that<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.810> bought<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.439> year<00:01:07.830> ago<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> honeydew

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that I bought a year ago in the honeydew

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.820 
that I bought a year ago in the honeydew
and<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.630> bought<00:01:09.810> again<00:01:10.080> maybe<00:01:10.320> 3<00:01:10.650> or<00:01:10.680> 4

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and then I bought again maybe 3 or 4

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
and then I bought again maybe 3 or 4
months<00:01:11.189> ago<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:12.090> summer's<00:01:12.960> fruit<00:01:13.439> or

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
months ago in this summer's fruit or

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
months ago in this summer's fruit or
whatever<00:01:13.830> scent<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.150> fact<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> they're

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
whatever scent and the fact that they're

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.140 
whatever scent and the fact that they're
both<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> waxy<00:01:17.189> side<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.430> feel<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.820> these

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
both on the waxy side I feel like these

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990 
both on the waxy side I feel like these
types<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.689> lip<00:01:19.140> balms<00:01:19.409> spin<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.549> lips<00:01:20.759> more

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
types of lip balms spin on my lips more

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.240 
types of lip balms spin on my lips more
than<00:01:21.180> anything<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.020> really

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
than anything they don't really

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.410 
than anything they don't really
moisturize<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.400> much<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.850> coat<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> lips

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
moisturize as much as they coat the lips

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.090 
moisturize as much as they coat the lips
which<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.960> good<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> winter<00:01:25.770> modes

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
which is good for the winter modes

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.530 
which is good for the winter modes
because<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.759> something<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.240> kind<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
because you want something that kind of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.109 
because you want something that kind of
protects<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.200> lips<00:01:28.380> from<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.250> elements<00:01:29.790> but

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
protects your lips from the elements but

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
protects your lips from the elements but
at<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> same<00:01:30.509> time<00:01:30.810> I've<00:01:31.650> tried<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
at the same time I've tried this in the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.230 
at the same time I've tried this in the
warmer<00:01:32.729> months<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.570> hasn't<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:33.990> done

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
warmer months and it hasn't really done

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.359 
warmer months and it hasn't really done
anything<00:01:36.240> amazing<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.009> sad<00:01:38.220> because

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
anything amazing which is sad because

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.999 
anything amazing which is sad because
this<00:01:39.299> retails<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> 28<00:01:40.590> dollars

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
