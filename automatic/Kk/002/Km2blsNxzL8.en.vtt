either you have to give it a password or

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.380 
either you have to give it a password or

if you have the public no black and
white<00:04:14.680> unrestricted<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:15.860> you're<00:04:16.010> able<00:04:16.310> to

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
white unrestricted so you're able to

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.150 
white unrestricted so you're able to
pack<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.780> need<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.109> set<00:04:18.320> this<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.709> public

mode<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:20.269> basically<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.870> next<00:04:21.709> step<00:04:22.010> will<00:04:22.160> be

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
mode so basically the next step will be

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.830 
mode so basically the next step will be
again<00:04:23.720> if<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.050> are<00:04:24.169> using<00:04:24.410> that<00:04:24.830> contract<00:04:25.400> for
