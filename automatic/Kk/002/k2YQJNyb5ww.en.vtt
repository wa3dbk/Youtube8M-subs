00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.340
 today's tutorial day but I'm 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.460
 different and better 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.460
 I'm gray- haired I'm with 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.050
 I I'm finding me miranda by 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.470
 sword devil slim 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.039
 It's the enemy 's who gets this. 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.939
 fashion and'm worshiping for two days only 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.640
 I made 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.110
 And then to show you a makeup. 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.180
 to value this hair because this 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.670
 Like I can not go with any face, right? 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.070
 I'll really looked like a grandmother then 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 It has to do a very incredible look and I 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.469
 I decided to make this blackened eye 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.879
 that joining to risk buckles everyone 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.739
 loves everyone like a black eye 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.320
 I'll teach you how to do it. 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.329
 it with a palette that sums it all up 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.059
 practically what you need 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.870
 I think you 're going to enjoy it, you want to see it well with me. 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.390
 in the tutorial 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.809
 I'll start then using the palette and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 I felt the basic in this one contains a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.060
 grass 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.010
 I'm going to start using this claret color 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 I 'll use that little brownie then. 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.810
 there is no longer a brightness, a brand is a 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.490
 shade more donut and then I'll use 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 the black 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.900
 I'll start with the light shade I'm going 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.470
 take a little bit of the soft brush strip 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.310
 the excess and now I'm giving 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:34.860
 little hits in the region that I want 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.650
 nominate inner corner of the eye and logo 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.150
 below the eyebrow 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.280
 now I'll use a cuddly brush 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.320
 of these preschoolers and I'm going to pick up the brown 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.170
 and very little shade to light 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.820
 start not to create a blur and then I 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.820
 I'll come here in this outer corner. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.020
 and I'll vanish my poop 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.220
 who prefers a slightly lighter eye 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.140
 can stay brown only because this 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.770
 brown may require a new dark medium 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.780
 if you can stand alone in the brown and fill 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.510
 the entire eyelid with it needs 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:23.030
 necessarily black and blurred sum 11 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.860
 and now I'm going to get another brush too 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.290
 these are smoking and I'm going to put a shade 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:33.260
 black handle strip and the black shadow 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.780
 excess to not fall to stay all 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 panda that most everything black is then strip 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.900
 access to avoid danger of falling 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:48.500
 Anything and everyone will see it goes, just beat it. 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.830
 apply the black on the moving eyelid beginning 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.380
 Every time you vote for the black shadow 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:00.020
 that we strike the past as obvious 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.760
 black with the brush arises brown 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.170
 this is important that this will keep the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.270
 gradient will not do that thing 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.270
 marked black middle right 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.920
 now below I'll get the map 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.030
 one again with another brush like that 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.400
 and I'm going down here 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:32.410
 now I'll get another little bill 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:40.940
 black flying neighbor aids middle 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:44.350
 with a bevel providing the brush ume 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.690
 down the fabric as the de-inking agents 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.030
 vote in the black shadow to take the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.060
 and I'll just make a mark 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.239
 so the root of the lashes will stay 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.980
 I was stronger the stronger I was now. 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:05.230
 a black pencil and if you want to hit and I 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:09.190
 I will apply on the water line and below 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.190
 and on top 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:18.789
 now eyelash mask I'm going to use here 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:23.729
 with more volume than I'm loving many 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.729
 layers and I'll be right back 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.830
 and he's ready the eye I already thought 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.710
 about it but it was already filled 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.930
 were ready as well as the skin with 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.460
 doctor freitas nancy is santana when 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:44.169
 in plot now I'm going to use one of the blush ta 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.940
 this color here that bakes the pacu 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:56.880
 I'll make the outline with this jobim tone 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:56.880
 what the son is and in that sense so 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:04.400
 the hoop up contour has returned 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.379
 more daring and more orange than most 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.539
 wear jeans that I wear more 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.240
 so I think it'll be okay 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:16.330
 so this is a bad slope 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.330
 so the blush takes away the excess 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:27.590
 now we're to the illuminator 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.750
 illuminator will be the same shade as 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.330
 I used my eyes 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:39.259
 So I 'll get her here, um. 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:41.919
 access to 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.919
 let's go here 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.300
 Look here now for button and I'm going to use 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:57.850
 also from the palette this one and it is taken 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:05.340
 here is the creamy whipped cream that he 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:05.340
 go pick up with the brush and do not even deceive 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.900
 So look there ready makeup hope 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:25.360

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.009

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.990
 practically all the products that 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.059
 You do not need to keep running back. 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.050
 of one product or another and another is already 

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:34.899
 all by hand 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.899
 Go there now and enjoy the practical holiday.
