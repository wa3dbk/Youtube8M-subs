 the soldiers of the terrestrial domain and then the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.710
 wonderful art 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.500
 it is called you know what favorite indeed 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:21.260
 I let you illustrate it from the joints 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.680

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.930
 as you can see on the cover there is the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:35.360
 our beautiful queen style kerrigan 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.540
 of the zerg pages absolutely 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.230
 obviously coated for this 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.300
 beautiful artbook in which we have before 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.450
 always in the first pages that harry ton 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.520
 here is explained in a few words how 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.710
 building 10 is very pretty 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.030
 because you have to start says from a lot of 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:02.330
 teeth that it sucks a little though in which 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:08.630
 obviously it explains a little it makes you see 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.600
 some various drawings, some citations 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.280
 from characters and also from the first 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.700
 always rather interesting starcraft 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.590
 with a song at the level of say if one 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.750
 he is more interested in, for example, also a 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.070
 how to draw certain things here is the 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.410
 quality also of the designs and we have 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:38.380
 in addition to various from the iis that goes short 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:43.850
 we also have various various crap 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.280
 there are quite a few beautiful landscapes 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.530
 also the earth because they can never 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.630
 missing with various storyboards 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.959
 however our dear high luz mans e 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:03.430
 there are also of course over all 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:08.110
 the test environments were right 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.150
 inside at the end finally not for last but 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.090
 no less important 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.100
 hell I'm there we'll find first first or 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.660
 then propolis we will find peoples we will find 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.400
 oh well anyway it is a beautiful art that 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.260
 alone beautiful alone is worth the price 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:30.810
 of the limited the only chance that 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:35.320
 we can say I was saying at the level of 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.240
 content is completely similar except 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.480
 for what I liked the most 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.500
 of the limited of the first that is the 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.080
 tumbler with in starcraft broodwar 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.750
 But needless certain that would persecute them 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.280
 but you feel the lack of that 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.229
 something extra 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:59.860
 another thing always included in the 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:04.000
 limited there are various usual dlc codes 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:08.410
 including some avatars 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.430
 for your account 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:15.130
 some in the blizzard network 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.680
 beasts for world of warcraft 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:22.600
 rather than the devil 3 rather than 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:26.260
 however the usual things you see in 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.410
 all limited and blizzard nothing a 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.570
 very nice dini for a thin mouthpiece 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:36.539
 but perhaps it makes a very good impression 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.539
 on the shelf hello to all bye bye
