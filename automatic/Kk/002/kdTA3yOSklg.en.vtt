00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.619
 first of all, please comment on this 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.970
 when one is pissed off totally ridiculous 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.320
 in fact I'm just and sure front if the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.250
 people find their mouths so that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.630
 the people who annoy me 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.670
 instead of stopping to annoy me they have 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 rather tend to make fun of me and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.520
 it's understandably stopped there it's a 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.410
 monster to pursue and what would you do 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.550
 to commit suicide or to run but I'm running 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.450

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.670
