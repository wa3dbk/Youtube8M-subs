00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.000
 fifa 12 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 according to the latest news that I could read 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.829
 fifa 12 will improve noticeably as well as add more things 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.079
 this is what I have been able to find out 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.099
 new camera that will be noticeably closer to the ground 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 new menu interface which will be simpler, softer and more ergonomic 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.800
 evolution and calculation of actions in real time 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.439
 integration of an impact engine impact zone that should limit the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.520
 number of contacts present in fifa 11 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.440
 new already in the most developed pro player intelligence game vision 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.380
 that must influence player passes 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.370
 re balance between attack and defense as well as between the players more 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.220
 physicists and technical players 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.400
 ia should also be able to treat the passes the centers and so on - 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.960
 robotic than before 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.840
 you must also be able to play your strengths in the pro mode 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.540
 new presentation of the parties that are very inspired by the matches 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.860
 english 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.740
 possibility of injury is to say 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.450
 without contact with the enemy if there is too much abuse of a player especially at 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.180
 Full Time 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.870
 location of the lesion 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.050
 if a player receives a nudge he touches his face 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.140
 Iia also keeps in memory the blow received during the rest of the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.950
 match 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.420
 the round automatic pressure or square button will simply follow the player 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.860
 new management of ball protection that should help players to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.490
 protect yourself less physically 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.210
 integration of a new short dribble with the east that is quier two similar to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.320
 the multiple touches of the ball of messi three new stadiums 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.870
 Impact zone is defined as the integration of contact areas 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.630
 new in players 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.230
 hips knees etc. game view a more human ia 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.000
 each player will have a vision more or less according to their abilities and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.190
 capabilities 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.320
 it will be important the positioning of the player and the visual perception that 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.070
 have 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 it will not be the same to give a forward pass than a backward pass 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.500
 will be more precise the actions that are made towards an address where the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.059
 Player's visual field arrives 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.319
 impressive lighting effects according to journalists 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.419
 pes 2012 the cursor change is fixed 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.150
 the l1 works very well 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.430
 You can also change player with the extinguisher made to fixed 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.149
 the shots are more like the old peres 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.259
 more control and that makes them more sensitive 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.569
 new shooting and physical animations of the ball 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.609
 the new camera is wonderful we have never changed it to the wide 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.609
 teaches more field and created as the old broad 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.169
 in pes 2012 you can see the substitutes warming up coaches moving and the 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.439
 field staff walking around the field 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.839
 the grass looks more lush 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.930
 different courts in the stadiums and great news 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.709
 different cameras for each stadium 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.979
 the animations return when running 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:05.719
 so players like messi or ronaldo have their own and there are a lot 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.839
 more than you can assign 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.839
 we have played at the most difficult level and it is as we believed 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.689
 the defensiveness of the big teams is hard to beat 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.709
 in the first game nor a shot on goal 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.219
 nobody has asked but I want to confirm that the animations of the 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:22.879
 trips are no longer 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.219
 you will always have control of the player 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.539
 100% response 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.579
 they have arranged for fast players to be able to go at speed now 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.549
 yes you can yes the ship hosting the players is not 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.739
 fast players face and can leave the slow 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.639
 Fault animations are more realistic 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.529
 the collision system is fantastic 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:50.489
 again insists on animations when running and says it is 100% fluid 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.219
 the running players are incredible 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:54.010
 as well 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.719
 but the great animation is in 2012 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.939
 100% more fluid 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.829
 the physics of the ball is improved now it is seen how it takes effect aids 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.899
 little boats in the passes 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:09.649
 he also says that thanks to the new physics of the ball the shots on goal 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.509
 they are different to weight 2011 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:17.409
 thanks to the new physics the shots are different to the 2011 throw-ins and 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.939
 door has improved 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.210
 now you can alternate with the stigma of fact to whom you want to spend 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.639
 the normal game speed will be similar to 2011 weight 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.710
 speed similar to that of 2011 we continue 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.909
 the free throws feel different 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.009
 again for the physics of the ball 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.009
 centers and shots are more immersive with the ball 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.470
 says that the defenders will no longer stand by giving a pass to the hole as 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.949
 happened in pes 2011 or something like that very easy to endure defense 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.009
 do not worry about physical contact 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.569
 no more balls to the hollow easy point the improved referees 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.529
 we will have benefit law finally 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:57.909
 corrected referees 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.489
 pitan law of advantage and also admonish after the game is 

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:02.460
 stop 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.180
 the passes will be very different from the 2011 weight, we can remove the bar if 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.509
 we want 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.680
 very different passes to 2011 are more satisfactory 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.529
 the bar can be hidden 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.000
 Well, that's all 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.110
 if my opinion is of any use to me, I am more than fifa 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.309
 but I also play alps 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.659
 I hope you liked it
