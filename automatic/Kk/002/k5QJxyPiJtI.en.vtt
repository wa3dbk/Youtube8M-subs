either<00:02:51.150> he<00:02:51.450> doesn't<00:02:51.870> know<00:02:52.080> or<00:02:52.500> he's<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.580> kind

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
either he doesn't know or he's just kind

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.330 
either he doesn't know or he's just kind
of<00:02:53.970> giving<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.390> safe<00:02:54.660> answer<00:02:54.990> which<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.800> kind<00:02:56.130> of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
of giving a safe answer which is kind of

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.090 
of giving a safe answer which is kind of
not<00:02:57.300> quite<00:02:58.080> what<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.620> would<00:02:58.770> want<00:02:59.010> it

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
not quite what you would want it

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.010 
not quite what you would want it
reassuring<00:02:59.610> or<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.240> you'd<00:03:00.390> want<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.720> hear

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
reassuring or what you'd want to hear

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.780 
reassuring or what you'd want to hear
yeah<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.410> mean<00:03:01.680> maybe<00:03:01.890> Brady<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.550> just

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
yeah I mean maybe Brady is just

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.430 
yeah I mean maybe Brady is just
demanding<00:03:03.270> more<00:03:03.450> accountability<00:03:03.900> from<00:03:04.230> those

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
demanding more accountability from those

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.830 
demanding more accountability from those
around<00:03:04.590> him<00:03:04.950> why<00:03:05.460> build<00:03:06.030> them<00:03:06.120> up<00:03:06.270> when

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
around him why build them up when

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.540 
around him why build them up when
they're<00:03:07.140> not<00:03:07.320> helping<00:03:07.530> him<00:03:07.860> play<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.220> his<00:03:08.340> best

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
they're not helping him play it his best

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.900 
they're not helping him play it his best
either<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.360> know<00:03:09.450> why<00:03:09.630> bail<00:03:09.900> them<00:03:10.170> out<00:03:10.320> or

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
either so you know why bail them out or

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.300 
either so you know why bail them out or
maybe<00:03:11.910> Brady<00:03:12.270> just<00:03:12.570> realizes<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:14.010> think<00:03:14.070> to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
maybe Brady just realizes and I think to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.790 
maybe Brady just realizes and I think to
an<00:03:14.490> extent<00:03:14.820> we<00:03:15.000> know<00:03:15.210> that<00:03:15.480> he<00:03:15.660> realizes<00:03:16.110> this

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
an extent we know that he realizes this

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.690 
an extent we know that he realizes this
team<00:03:17.100> has<00:03:17.840> huge<00:03:18.840> genuine<00:03:19.500> flaws<00:03:19.739> they<00:03:20.340> cannot

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
team has huge genuine flaws they cannot

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.000 
team has huge genuine flaws they cannot
get<00:03:21.480> into<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.780> situation<00:03:21.989> where<00:03:22.620> they<00:03:22.709> can<00:03:22.860> be<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
get into a situation where they can be a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.440 
get into a situation where they can be a
one-dimensional<00:03:23.700> offense<00:03:23.820> they<00:03:24.300> have<00:03:24.330> proven

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
one-dimensional offense they have proven

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.020 
one-dimensional offense they have proven
that<00:03:24.870> through<00:03:25.560> four<00:03:25.800> games<00:03:25.830> already<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.790> if

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that through four games already and if

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.400 
that through four games already and if
they're<00:03:27.180> gonna<00:03:27.300> dig<00:03:27.540> themselves<00:03:27.720> into<00:03:28.110> big

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
they're gonna dig themselves into big

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.720 
they're gonna dig themselves into big
holes<00:03:28.680> they're<00:03:29.340> going<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.550> be<00:03:29.700> a

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
holes they're going to be a

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.880 
holes they're going to be a
one-dimensional<00:03:30.480> offense<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:31.050> that's<00:03:31.650> not

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
one-dimensional offense and that's not

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.490 
one-dimensional offense and that's not
good<00:03:32.100> for<00:03:32.130> Brady<00:03:32.489> his<00:03:33.060> well-being<00:03:33.570> his<00:03:34.170> bones

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
good for Brady his well-being his bones

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.010 
good for Brady his well-being his bones
I<00:03:34.950> mean<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.400> offensive<00:03:35.940> line<00:03:36.120> continues<00:03:36.870> to

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
I mean the offensive line continues to

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.449 
I mean the offensive line continues to
let<00:03:37.170> him<00:03:37.260> get<00:03:37.380> whacked<00:03:37.650> there<00:03:37.920> was<00:03:38.010> one<00:03:38.220> play

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
let him get whacked there was one play

can<00:04:15.600> keep<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.840> up<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.200> Marvin<00:04:16.470> Lewis<00:04:16.620> has<00:04:16.890> had

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
can keep it up and Marvin Lewis has had

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.250 
can keep it up and Marvin Lewis has had
some<00:04:17.250> forgettable<00:04:17.880> coaching<00:04:18.419> moments<00:04:18.810> but<00:04:19.019> I

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
some forgettable coaching moments but I

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.830 
some forgettable coaching moments but I
think<00:04:20.070> Bill<00:04:20.250> Belichick<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:20.850> his<00:04:21.239> entire<00:04:21.540> team

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
think Bill Belichick in his entire team

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.270 
think Bill Belichick in his entire team
have<00:04:22.049> had<00:04:22.169> some<00:04:22.350> forgettable<00:04:22.650> moments<00:04:23.190> this

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
have had some forgettable moments this

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.890 
have had some forgettable moments this
season<00:04:23.340> too<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.030> it's<00:04:24.180> not<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.450> good<00:04:24.690> matchup

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
season too so it's not a good matchup

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.390 
season too so it's not a good matchup
for<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.289> Patriots<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.950> way<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.250> they're

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
for the Patriots the way that they're

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.390 
for the Patriots the way that they're
playing<00:04:26.729> I<00:04:26.910> mean<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.210> hot

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
playing I mean it's hot

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.920 
playing I mean it's hot
to<00:04:27.550> sit<00:04:27.940> here<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.180> expect<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.810> Patriots

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
to sit here and expect that the Patriots

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.170 
to sit here and expect that the Patriots
can<00:04:29.350> come<00:04:29.500> back<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.800> win<00:04:30.040> but<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.340> think<00:04:30.699> there

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
can come back and win but I think there

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.200 
can come back and win but I think there
can<00:04:31.360> be<00:04:31.419> some<00:04:31.720> optimism<00:04:32.199> if<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:33.070> don't<00:04:34.000> think

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
can be some optimism if I don't think

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.640 
can be some optimism if I don't think
the<00:04:34.270> Patriots<00:04:34.630> have<00:04:34.870> really<00:04:35.110> built<00:04:35.320> anything

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
the Patriots have really built anything

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.040 
the Patriots have really built anything
in<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:35.979> last<00:04:36.130> 15<00:04:36.610> years<00:04:36.789> off<00:04:37.060> moral<00:04:37.539> victories

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
in the last 15 years off moral victories

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.810
