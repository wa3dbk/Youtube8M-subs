jutsus has been nerfed a bit from what I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.600 
jutsus has been nerfed a bit from what I
see<00:02:51.720> his<00:02:52.140> jutsu<00:02:52.590> isn't<00:02:52.920> as<00:02:53.070> fast<00:02:53.370> anymore

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
see his jutsu isn't as fast anymore

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.910 
see his jutsu isn't as fast anymore
because<00:02:54.090> before<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.840> couldn't<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.530> ninja

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
because before you couldn't do ninja

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.340
