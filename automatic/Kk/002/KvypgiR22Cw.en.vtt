just quickly fire this up I'll tell you
what<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> code<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.769> when<00:00:27.920> it<00:00:28.920> fires<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:31.790> this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
what the code is when it fires up this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.360 
what the code is when it fires up this
is<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> code<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> got<00:00:33.450> from<00:00:33.660> say<00:00:33.960> ran<00:00:34.380> away<00:00:37.129> yeah

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
is a code I got from say ran away yeah

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.799 
is a code I got from say ran away yeah
its<00:00:38.989> purpose<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> had<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> funky

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
its purpose is you see I had the funky

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.180 
its purpose is you see I had the funky
or<00:00:45.809> whatever<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.230> called<00:00:46.289> oh<00:00:46.680> yeah<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.920> think

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
or whatever it's called oh yeah I think

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.670 
or whatever it's called oh yeah I think
that<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> world<00:00:47.870> when<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.930> beat<00:00:49.110> funky

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
that was the world when you beat funky

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.209 
that was the world when you beat funky
then<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.989> weird<00:00:51.989> looking<00:00:52.350> thing<00:00:52.379> it's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
then you get a weird looking thing it's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.389 
then you get a weird looking thing it's
in<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.430> special<00:00:53.820> world<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.840> anyway<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.190> have
