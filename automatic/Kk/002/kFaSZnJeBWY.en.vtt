the<00:00:27.840> attack<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.590> did<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> filter

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the attack and did you have a filter

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.200 
the attack and did you have a filter
section<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:31.199> gives<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.850> broad<00:00:32.850> variety

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:53.750 
show you the four voices that you have
to<00:00:43.199> choose<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.760> there's<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> sub<00:00:45.210> octave<00:00:52.760> then

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to choose from there's a sub octave then

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.729 
to choose from there's a sub octave then
you<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.119> the<00:00:54.239> guitar<00:00:54.390> voice

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:10.450 

hmm<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.840> octave<00:01:03.410> above

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:22.120 

and<00:01:11.210> then<00:01:11.750> square<00:01:12.140> wave

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.480 

all<00:01:22.400> right<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:22.820> then<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.119> can<00:01:23.299> blend<00:01:23.619> any<00:01:24.619> of

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
all right so then you can blend any of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.890 
all right so then you can blend any of
the<00:01:25.610> various<00:01:26.060> ones<00:01:26.210> I'm<00:01:26.420> going<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.570> start<00:01:26.810> with

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
the various ones I'm going to start with

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.810 
the various ones I'm going to start with
a<00:01:26.960> sub<00:01:27.170> octave<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:30.009> little<00:01:31.009> aught<00:01:31.310> if

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.320 

that's<00:01:35.780> Square<00:01:36.290> life

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:48.480 

Shh<00:01:40.960> residents<00:01:41.680> make<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:41.980> little<00:01:42.160> brighter

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.340 

the<00:01:49.490> next<00:01:49.850> control<00:01:50.600> we'll<00:01:50.720> show<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:50.930> is<00:01:51.200> the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
the next control we'll show you is the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.849 
the next control we'll show you is the
attack<00:01:51.710> delay<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:52.850> here<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.270> off

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.130 

I'll<00:01:58.950> bring<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> in

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.520 

it's<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.770> longer

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:17.860 

Oh

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.320 

a<00:02:18.099> next<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:19.220> will<00:02:19.280> show<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.790> filter<00:02:20.150> sweep

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
a next I will show you the filter sweep

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.960 
a next I will show you the filter sweep
stage<00:02:20.810> we're<00:02:21.799> going<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.980> start<00:02:22.280> going<00:02:22.519> from<00:02:22.790> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
stage we're going to start going from a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.539 
stage we're going to start going from a
low<00:02:23.180> frequency<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:24.080> high<00:02:24.349> frequency<00:02:25.069> you

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
low frequency to a high frequency you

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.820 
low frequency to a high frequency you
can<00:02:25.670> adjust<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.060> resonance

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.710 

and<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.580> rate<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.090> speed<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.570> goes

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.600 

you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.770 

all<00:02:40.610> right<00:02:40.790> now<00:02:40.970> we're<00:02:41.090> gonna<00:02:41.210> start<00:02:41.540> from<00:02:41.660> a

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
all right now we're gonna start from a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.720 
all right now we're gonna start from a
higher<00:02:41.990> frequency<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> lower

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.619 

and<00:02:49.730> get<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:49.910> faster<00:02:50.480> rate

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.319 

and<00:02:57.629> then<00:02:57.930> also<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.549> hone<00:02:59.849> in<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.150> a

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
and then also you can hone in on a

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.130 
and then also you can hone in on a
certain<00:03:00.629> frequency<00:03:02.750> I'm<00:03:03.750> going<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.019> add<00:03:04.109> a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
certain frequency I'm going to add a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:20.580 
certain frequency I'm going to add a
little<00:03:04.349> attack<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:05.099> for<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.459> effect

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.290 

it's<00:03:21.590> very<00:03:21.830> easy<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.280> get<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.550> variety<00:03:22.760> of

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
it's very easy to get a variety of

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.510 
it's very easy to get a variety of
sounds<00:03:23.720> out<00:03:24.020> of<00:03:24.050> this<00:03:24.230> unit<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.770> I'll<00:03:25.280> show

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
sounds out of this unit and I'll show

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.260 
sounds out of this unit and I'll show
you<00:03:25.580> a<00:03:25.730> few

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
you a few

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:37.650 
you a few
here's<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.990> bode<00:03:27.440> effect

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:50.760 

and<00:03:38.200> here's<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.100> very<00:03:39.370> percussive<00:03:39.760> sound<00:03:49.770> all

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
and here's a very percussive sound all

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.700 
and here's a very percussive sound all
right<00:03:50.890> here's<00:03:51.220> a<00:03:51.310> really<00:03:51.520> cool<00:03:51.760> lead<00:03:52.030> sound

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.610 

you

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.140 

for<00:04:03.620> whatever<00:04:03.800> style<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.340> music<00:04:04.459> you're<00:04:04.790> into

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
for whatever style of music you're into

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.520 
for whatever style of music you're into
I<00:04:05.180> think<00:04:05.510> you'll<00:04:05.629> find<00:04:05.810> that<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.170> micro

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
I think you'll find that the micro

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.490 
I think you'll find that the micro
synthesizer<00:04:07.099> is<00:04:07.870> capable<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:08.989> some<00:04:09.170> really

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
synthesizer is capable of some really

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.900 
synthesizer is capable of some really
cool<00:04:09.890> fat<00:04:10.340> analog<00:04:11.000> sense<00:04:11.300> sounds
