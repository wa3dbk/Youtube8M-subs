frames<00:01:03.699> going<00:01:04.699> this<00:01:04.909> way<00:01:05.120> towards<00:01:05.870> my<00:01:06.050> room

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
frames going this way towards my room

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.490 
frames going this way towards my room
right<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:07.880> that's<00:01:08.240> my<00:01:08.360> first<00:01:08.689> clue<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.140> lift<00:01:09.350> up

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
right so that's my first clue I lift up

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.880 
right so that's my first clue I lift up
the<00:01:09.649> foam<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.299> this<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.079> studs<00:01:12.469> under<00:01:12.770> the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
the foam and this the studs under the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.510 
the foam and this the studs under the
foam<00:01:13.960> look<00:01:14.960> like<00:01:15.170> they're<00:01:15.380> going<00:01:15.530> again<00:01:16.340> that

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
foam look like they're going again that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.270 
foam look like they're going again that
way<00:01:16.670> towards<00:01:17.000> my<00:01:17.149> room<00:01:17.770> leave<00:01:18.770> me<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.039> think

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
way towards my room leave me to think

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.810 
way towards my room leave me to think
that<00:01:19.340> okay<00:01:19.670> this<00:01:19.820> doesn't<00:01:20.060> go<00:01:20.240> like<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:21.820> the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
that okay this doesn't go like that the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:38.190 
that okay this doesn't go like that the
joist<00:01:25.090> number<00:01:26.090> two<00:01:35.350> that's<00:01:36.350> running<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:37.460> way

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
joist number two that's running this way

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.170 
joist number two that's running this way
so<00:01:39.200> we'll<00:01:39.439> leave<00:01:39.560> me<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.829> think<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.189> the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
so we'll leave me to think that the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.959 
so we'll leave me to think that the
floor<00:01:41.420> joists<00:01:41.659> are<00:01:41.869> running<00:01:42.109> like<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.969> just

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
floor joists are running like that just

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.289 
floor joists are running like that just
pay<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:44.270> weight<00:01:44.420> right<00:01:48.820> stairs<00:01:49.820> they<00:01:50.119> have<00:01:50.210> to

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
pay the weight right stairs they have to

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.359 
pay the weight right stairs they have to
dissipate<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.689> weight<00:01:50.979> why<00:01:51.979> wouldn't<00:01:52.219> they

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
dissipate the weight why wouldn't they

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.010 
dissipate the weight why wouldn't they
run<00:01:52.579> like<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:56.229> with<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.380> being<00:01:57.590> said

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
run like that so with that being said

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.010 
run like that so with that being said
that's<00:02:00.020> where<00:02:00.259> I<00:02:00.289> have<00:02:00.439> my<00:02:00.619> small<00:02:01.189> fish<00:02:01.520> tank<00:02:02.020> I

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
that's where I have my small fish tank I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.230 
that's where I have my small fish tank I
hope<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.159> prayer<00:02:04.399> that<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.640> joy<00:02:04.789> start<00:02:05.060> running

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
hope a prayer that the joy start running

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.270 
hope a prayer that the joy start running
like<00:02:05.359> that<00:02:05.420> because<00:02:06.049> even<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.740> small<00:02:07.039> one<00:02:07.189> is

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
like that because even the small one is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.999 
like that because even the small one is
for<00:02:07.490> 250<00:02:07.909> pounds<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.270> water<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:09.289> rock<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.920> all

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
for 250 pounds of water and rock and all

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.330 
for 250 pounds of water and rock and all
that<00:02:10.130> fun<00:02:10.340> stuff<00:02:10.369> on<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:12.170> outside<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:13.099> this

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
that fun stuff on the outside of this

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.040 
that fun stuff on the outside of this
Wharf<00:02:13.670> he<00:02:13.940> toured<00:02:14.180> out<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.450> war<00:02:14.750> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
Wharf he toured out in this war the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.650 
Wharf he toured out in this war the
chimney<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.670> directly

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
chimney is directly

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.650 
chimney is directly
underneath<00:02:17.810> there<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.580> where<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:20.480> know

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
underneath there so where that you know

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.110 
underneath there so where that you know
right<00:02:21.320> here<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:22.250> good<00:02:22.460> on<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.610> first<00:02:22.880> floor

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
right here I'm good on the first floor

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.480 
right here I'm good on the first floor
would<00:02:23.270> be<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.960> chimney<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.280> would<00:02:25.400> assume

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
would be the chimney and I would assume

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.790 
would be the chimney and I would assume
the<00:02:25.850> flu<00:02:26.060> would<00:02:26.240> go<00:02:26.360> up<00:02:26.540> behind<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.530> wall

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
the flu would go up behind this wall

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.890 
the flu would go up behind this wall
directly<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:32.060> don't<00:02:32.450> know<00:02:32.540> if<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.750> would

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
directly so I don't know if that would

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.740 
directly so I don't know if that would
be<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.050> supporting<00:02:33.620> wall<00:02:33.650> or<00:02:34.010> not<00:02:34.750> because

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
be a supporting wall or not because

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.010 
be a supporting wall or not because
there's<00:02:36.020> we<00:02:36.350> all<00:02:36.530> flew<00:02:36.860> behind<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.430> think

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
there's we all flew behind it I think

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.820 
there's we all flew behind it I think
but<00:02:40.690> well<00:02:41.690> just<00:02:41.870> think<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:42.140> an<00:02:42.230> outside<00:02:42.620> wall

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
but well just think to an outside wall

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.820 
but well just think to an outside wall
you<00:02:43.010> really<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:44.810> have<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.990> window<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.970> then

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
you really you have a window and then

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.800 
you really you have a window and then
you<00:02:48.830> know<00:02:48.890> maybe<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.190> foot<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.330> left<00:02:50.450> you

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
you know maybe a foot to the left you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.400 
you know maybe a foot to the left you
have<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.960> second<00:02:51.320> room<00:02:52.240> now<00:02:53.260> behind<00:02:54.260> this

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
have the second room now behind this

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.460 
have the second room now behind this
wall<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.000> neighbor's<00:02:56.300> house<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:59.470> don't

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
wall is the neighbor's house I don't

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.950 
wall is the neighbor's house I don't
know<00:03:00.590> what<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:01.670> would<00:03:01.850> be<00:03:02.210> considered<00:03:02.780> a

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
know what that would be considered a

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:13.330 
know what that would be considered a
supporting<00:03:03.380> wall<00:03:06.040> maybe<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.780> don't<00:03:09.730> know<00:03:12.340> what

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
supporting wall maybe I don't know what

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.560 
supporting wall maybe I don't know what
there<00:03:14.240> is<00:03:14.330> I<00:03:14.510> don't<00:03:14.930> contract<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.850> mean<00:03:20.060> as

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
there is I don't contract so I mean as

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.850 
there is I don't contract so I mean as
you<00:03:20.660> can<00:03:20.780> see<00:03:20.900> this<00:03:21.050> looks<00:03:21.380> like<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.680> would<00:03:21.740> be

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
you can see this looks like it would be

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.370 
you can see this looks like it would be
the<00:03:21.950> best<00:03:22.100> spot<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:23.360> something<00:03:23.750> big<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:23.959> 90

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
the best spot to have something big a 90

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.440 
the best spot to have something big a 90
gallon<00:03:24.709> which<00:03:24.860> would<00:03:25.010> weigh<00:03:25.070> 850<00:03:25.730> pounds<00:03:26.030> and

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
gallon which would weigh 850 pounds and

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.720 
gallon which would weigh 850 pounds and
really<00:03:27.290> like<00:03:27.440> 125<00:03:28.250> gallon<00:03:28.670> which<00:03:28.880> would<00:03:29.870> waive

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
really like 125 gallon which would waive

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.330 
really like 125 gallon which would waive
1400<00:03:31.730> pounds<00:03:32.020> almost<00:03:33.020> 3/4<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.680> ton<00:03:35.980> if<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.130> had

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
1400 pounds almost 3/4 of a ton if I had

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.810 
1400 pounds almost 3/4 of a ton if I had
to<00:03:37.580> I<00:03:37.990> could<00:03:39.220> put<00:03:40.220> something<00:03:40.520> in<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.670> closet

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
to I could put something in the closet

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.800 
to I could put something in the closet
here<00:03:41.740> but<00:03:43.480> second<00:03:44.480> clue<00:03:44.780> would<00:03:45.470> be<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:47.570> joists

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
here but second clue would be the joists

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.930 
here but second clue would be the joists
will<00:03:48.200> usually<00:03:48.470> run<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:48.980> shorter<00:03:49.400> distance<00:03:49.550> of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
will usually run the shorter distance of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.670 
will usually run the shorter distance of
the<00:03:50.030> house<00:03:50.209> so<00:03:50.989> I'm<00:03:51.080> looking<00:03:51.410> I'm<00:03:51.530> looking

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
the house so I'm looking I'm looking

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.530 
the house so I'm looking I'm looking
around<00:03:52.870> saying<00:03:54.610> okay<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.120> going<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.480> be

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
around saying okay this is going to be

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.490 
around saying okay this is going to be
the<00:03:56.600> shortest<00:03:56.870> distance<00:03:57.020> of<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.380> house<00:03:59.500> from

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
the shortest distance of the house from

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.370 
the shortest distance of the house from
right<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.650> left<00:04:01.390> but<00:04:02.390> then<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.930> know<00:04:03.050> you<00:04:03.080> look

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
right to left but then you know you look

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.140 
right to left but then you know you look
at<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.590> attic<00:04:03.890> you<00:04:03.920> look<00:04:04.160> at<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.370> bathtub<00:04:04.790> and

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
at the attic you look at the bathtub and

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.080 
at the attic you look at the bathtub and
doesn't<00:04:05.570> make<00:04:05.690> sense<00:04:05.989> then<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.260> think<00:04:07.060> he's<00:04:08.060> a

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
doesn't make sense then you think he's a

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.750 
doesn't make sense then you think he's a
townhouse<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.170> thing<00:04:09.350> is<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:10.670> know

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
townhouse the thing is you know

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.030 
townhouse the thing is you know
blah<00:04:11.180> quiet<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:12.410> will<00:04:12.560> be<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.739> longest

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
blah quiet that will be the longest

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.050 
blah quiet that will be the longest
distance<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.520> house<00:04:15.310> but<00:04:16.310> it's<00:04:16.669> it

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
distance to the house but it's it

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.500 
distance to the house but it's it
doesn't<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:19.700> doesn't<00:04:19.940> make<00:04:20.150> sense<00:04:20.390> because

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
doesn't it doesn't make sense because

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.110 
doesn't it doesn't make sense because
the<00:04:20.690> way<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.900> bathtub<00:04:21.350> is<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.880> way<00:04:23.000> the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
the way the bathtub is and the way the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.640 
the way the bathtub is and the way the
a-teams<00:04:23.540> are<00:04:23.810> in<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.140> attic<00:04:24.470> and

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.830 

so<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.710> would<00:04:31.280> assume<00:04:31.610> that<00:04:31.670> where<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:32.540> have

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
so you would assume that where I have

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.490 
so you would assume that where I have
that<00:04:33.340> I'm<00:04:34.340> probably<00:04:34.610> catching<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.930> Joyce<00:04:36.200> with

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
that I'm probably catching to Joyce with

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.640 
that I'm probably catching to Joyce with
it<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:37.090> 90<00:04:38.090> gallon<00:04:38.390> before<00:04:38.840> feet<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.350> maybe<00:04:39.560> I

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
it a 90 gallon before feet so maybe I

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.030 
it a 90 gallon before feet so maybe I
catch<00:04:40.090> 16<00:04:41.090> times<00:04:41.450> 2<00:04:41.960> is<00:04:41.990> 32

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
catch 16 times 2 is 32

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.700 
catch 16 times 2 is 32
that's<00:04:43.940> another<00:04:44.120> 12<00:04:44.450> is<00:04:44.630> 48<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.110> would<00:04:45.500> catch

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
that's another 12 is 48 I would catch

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.250 
that's another 12 is 48 I would catch
maybe<00:04:46.400> 3<00:04:46.730> Joyce<00:04:48.970> 125<00:04:49.970> gallon<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.540> 6<00:04:50.810> feet<00:04:50.990> so

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
maybe 3 Joyce 125 gallon is 6 feet so

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.980 
maybe 3 Joyce 125 gallon is 6 feet so
maybe<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.530> would<00:04:51.710> catch<00:04:51.920> for<00:04:52.540> 4<00:04:53.540> joist

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
maybe I would catch for 4 joist

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.850 
maybe I would catch for 4 joist
I<00:04:54.490> was<00:04:55.490> lucky<00:04:55.670> so<00:04:56.510> let<00:04:57.500> me<00:04:57.560> know<00:04:57.680> what<00:04:57.800> you

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
I was lucky so let me know what you

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.000 
I was lucky so let me know what you
think<00:04:58.070> if<00:04:58.370> it's<00:04:58.550> doable<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.630> did<00:05:00.530> spill<00:05:00.830> some

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
think if it's doable I did spill some

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.560 
think if it's doable I did spill some
water<00:05:01.220> on<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.460> rug<00:05:01.640> and<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:01.910> went<00:05:02.060> through<00:05:02.150> the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
water on the rug and it went through the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.460 
water on the rug and it went through the
rug<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.110> started<00:05:04.010> leaking<00:05:04.130> into<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.520> ceiling

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
rug and started leaking into the ceiling

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.870 
rug and started leaking into the ceiling
underneath<00:05:06.470> and<00:05:06.770> leaked<00:05:07.130> for<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.580> know<00:05:07.670> maybe

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
underneath and leaked for you know maybe

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.440 
underneath and leaked for you know maybe
about<00:05:08.170> 15<00:05:09.170> minutes<00:05:09.850> but<00:05:10.850> that<00:05:10.910> would<00:05:11.270> lead<00:05:11.420> me

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
about 15 minutes but that would lead me

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.150 
about 15 minutes but that would lead me
to<00:05:11.600> believe<00:05:11.810> maybe<00:05:12.230> the<00:05:12.500> wood<00:05:12.710> got<00:05:12.920> wet

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
to believe maybe the wood got wet
