00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
improve your timing and make you listen

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.559 
improve your timing and make you listen
for<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.410> bass<00:02:23.620> kicks<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.310> songs<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:25.030> this

for the bass kicks and songs now this

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.420 
for the bass kicks and songs now this

me show you the tracks you already
listened<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> 125<00:02:49.330> BPM<00:02:49.750> now<00:02:50.290> here's<00:02:50.470> 128<00:02:59.670> now

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
listened to 125 BPM now here's 128 now

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.370 
listened to 125 BPM now here's 128 now
if<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:00.970> remember<00:03:01.060> when<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.930> listen<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.350> the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
if you remember when you listen to the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.670 
if you remember when you listen to the
125<00:03:03.100> BPM<00:03:03.930> 128<00:03:04.930> does<00:03:05.079> not<00:03:05.200> sound<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.560> much

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
125 BPM 128 does not sound that much

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.360 
125 BPM 128 does not sound that much
different<00:03:06.070> because<00:03:06.190> it's<00:03:06.489> not<00:03:07.470> BPM<00:03:08.470> is<00:03:09.010> beats

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
different because it's not BPM is beats

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.770 
different because it's not BPM is beats
per<00:03:09.549> minute<00:03:09.850> beats<00:03:10.570> per<00:03:10.810> minute<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.350> how<00:03:11.769> many

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
per minute beats per minute is how many

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.240 
per minute beats per minute is how many
don't<00:03:13.780> say<00:03:13.900> bass<00:03:14.140> kicks<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.859> doesn't<00:03:15.100> have<00:03:15.190> to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
don't say bass kicks it doesn't have to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.680 
don't say bass kicks it doesn't have to
be<00:03:15.280> basically<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:15.850> necessarily<00:03:16.269> but<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.600> has

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
be basically it's necessarily but it has

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.789 
be basically it's necessarily but it has
to<00:03:16.750> be<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.019> timing<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.560> song<00:03:17.970> 128<00:03:18.970> BPM<00:03:19.090> is

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
to be the timing of the song 128 BPM is

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.009 
to be the timing of the song 128 BPM is
essentially<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.209> bass<00:03:22.209> kicks<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:22.750> here

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
essentially the bass kicks in here

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.080 
essentially the bass kicks in here
because<00:03:23.260> house<00:03:23.680> music<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.640> bass<00:03:24.820> kicks

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
because house music the bass kicks

you to do is listen to this ink out with
me<00:03:40.170> one-two-three-four<00:03:41.730> one-two-three-four

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
me one-two-three-four one-two-three-four

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.819 
me one-two-three-four one-two-three-four
one-two-three<00:03:44.620> one-two-three<00:03:46.500> now<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.680> was

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
one-two-three one-two-three now that was

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.250 
one-two-three one-two-three now that was
an<00:03:47.920> entire<00:03:48.190> measure<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.790> measure<00:03:49.690> consists<00:03:50.140> of

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
an entire measure a measure consists of

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.180 
an entire measure a measure consists of
four<00:03:50.500> bars<00:03:50.769> a<00:03:51.130> bar<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.150> four<00:03:52.569> beats<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.980> so

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
four bars a bar is four beats and so

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.460 
four bars a bar is four beats and so
that<00:03:54.819> every<00:03:55.060> time<00:03:55.239> we<00:03:55.329> counted<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.720> four<00:03:55.989> that

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
that every time we counted to four that

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.720 
that every time we counted to four that
was<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.739> bar<00:03:57.870> pretty<00:03:58.870> simple<00:03:59.260> follow<00:03:59.769> me<00:03:59.950> here

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
was a bar pretty simple follow me here

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.580 
was a bar pretty simple follow me here
I'm<00:04:01.209> talking<00:04:01.569> about<00:04:01.599> camera<00:04:02.050> which<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.379> really

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
I'm talking about camera which is really

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.259 
I'm talking about camera which is really
weird<00:04:02.709> right<00:04:02.920> now<00:04:03.099> but<00:04:03.489> if<00:04:03.819> you're<00:04:04.030> listening

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
weird right now but if you're listening

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.309 
weird right now but if you're listening
to<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.569> on<00:04:04.840> youtube<00:04:05.019> bear<00:04:05.950> with<00:04:06.069> me<00:04:06.239> now

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
to this on youtube bear with me now

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.270 
to this on youtube bear with me now
probably<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.409> easiest<00:04:08.980> way<00:04:09.310> how<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:09.970> count

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
probably the easiest way how I count

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.339 
probably the easiest way how I count
because<00:04:12.450> when<00:04:13.450> you're<00:04:13.599> using<00:04:13.810> this<00:04:13.989> with<00:04:14.140> real

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
because when you're using this with real

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.590 
because when you're using this with real
tracks<00:04:14.909> you<00:04:15.909> never<00:04:16.359> really<00:04:18.030> put<00:04:19.030> in<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.329> song

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
tracks you never really put in the song

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.569 
tracks you never really put in the song
halfway<00:04:20.049> through<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.290> measure<00:04:20.549> preferably<00:04:21.549> I

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
halfway through a measure preferably I

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.570 
halfway through a measure preferably I
like<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.210> put<00:04:22.419> in<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.630> song<00:04:22.870> after<00:04:23.229> a<00:04:24.160> measure

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
like to put in the song after a measure

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.930 
like to put in the song after a measure
I<00:04:24.910> always<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.930> go<00:04:26.139> by<00:04:26.320> twos<00:04:26.669> so<00:04:27.669> if<00:04:27.850> you

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
I always like to go by twos so if you

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.360 
I always like to go by twos so if you
put<00:04:28.180> in<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.330> song<00:04:28.600> after<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.770> first<00:04:30.010> for<00:04:30.250> me

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
put in the song after the first for me

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.850 
put in the song after the first for me
play<00:04:30.580> right<00:04:31.060> now<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.840> would<00:04:32.290> sound<00:04:32.500> kind<00:04:32.830> of

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
play right now it would sound kind of
