00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.620
 if they start looking for a gold joint 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.400
 addition tv 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.160
 here are three programs you can start 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.609
 the fourth fifth does not exclude 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.349
 he will turn on sooner or later 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.869
 try there right 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.919
 the same with the birth of a car 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.039
 a person can eat a lot for a long time 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.099
 carefully very carefully 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.279
 then the pain is a situation when suddenly he would 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.539
 to learn 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.179
 but can't do it 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.579
 why, that is, it was cases 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.470
 ao i won't call them 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.420
 when the antenna was happening 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.850
 when famous people fail 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.290
 the rescuers missed the plane 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.270
 and crashed fell very 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.630
 serious accident 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.670
 and in order to 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.460
 henceforth this situation is not broken not 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.010
 get to talk to be able to do it 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.060
 The first the second but any talked 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.640
 situations 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.340
 requires such skills that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.540
 processed when studying admission 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.240
 sport driving 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.350
 it means the driver who is so welcome 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.230
 owns 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.190
 he is significant 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.540
 I have 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.930
 better will control 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.940
 the situation 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.290
 and 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.280
 in the majority of the population 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.790
 in a sports football celebration 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.650
 these are completely different things 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.730
 ao 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.720
 cooper emergency well is not 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840
 part of sports driving 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.490
 it's the same as 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.119
 as a percentage they ask me how am i 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.340
 treat for example 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.710
 to drift competition 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.330
 i am very good at iran 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.260
 drift 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.420
 but this 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.750
 part of sports driving 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.090
 this is one of the elements of sports driving 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.220
 and the percentage that the racer 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.940
 who owns at all 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.910
 sport driving 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.340
 for him this percentage was just 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.140
 ridiculously consider 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.110
 ridiculously easy to do 30 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.420
 it's not serious even to talk about it 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 all so athletes morning gymnastics 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.160
 and suddenly the soonest I know so 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.100
 loved morning gymnastics so 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.440
 cool so cool here it is in my eyes so 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.589
 looks like 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.489
 percentage therefore 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.400
 assessment is all elements of sports 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.179
 style 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.909
 eg 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.979
 if you are a percentage about style courses 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.039
 emergency driving taught you 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.079
 very quickly raise rub 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.019
 and from lock to lock 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.849
 what can really be very strong 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.309
 help emergency situations especially 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:32.809
 when the car skidded on a slippery road 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.869
 already they say no need to be able to committees 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.339
 but if you decide to drive fast 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.129
 the same slippery road in winter, no 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.219
 let's say amateur 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.079
 competitions which is a lot of us about 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.679
 held 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.529
 tons with such a torsion at the helm nowhere 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.739
 Believe in general will not be the last battle 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.149
 last places 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.009
 but that one final acceptor returned 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.989
 know both that and that is but 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.459
 I have the skills and experience 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.159
 and sports driving and culture 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.299
 warrior
