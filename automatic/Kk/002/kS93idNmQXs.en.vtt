00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
doing these are about two centimeters

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
doing these are about two centimeters
apart<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.200> side<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.680> about<00:00:34.800> six

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
apart and that side in about six

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.410

centimeters<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:37.760> I'm<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.210> draw

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
centimeters and I'm just going to draw

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060 
centimeters and I'm just going to draw
these<00:00:39.719> I'm<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.590> ink<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:40.950> in

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.729 

little<00:00:48.239> curve<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> blip<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> then

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
little curve with a blip on it and then

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.959 
little curve with a blip on it and then
down<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:51.329> flick<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> bottom<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
down and a flick at the bottom and a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.279 
down and a flick at the bottom and a
flick<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> other<00:00:54.570> side<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> that's

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
flick on the other side and that's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.029 
flick on the other side and that's
called<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> serif<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.460> flick<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.890> then

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
called a serif the little flick and then

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.610 
called a serif the little flick and then
-<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.789> will<00:01:00.090> start<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.690> blob<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.410> go

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
- I will start with a little blob and go

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.240 
- I will start with a little blob and go
above<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.399> line<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.350> then<00:01:04.350> curve<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.100> you're

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
above the line and then curve so you're

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.120 
above the line and then curve so you're
coming<00:01:05.430> straight<00:01:05.670> down<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
coming straight down and then so that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.210 
coming straight down and then so that
then<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.770> do<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> nice<00:01:14.040> little

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
then you can get up do a nice little

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.130 
then you can get up do a nice little
curve<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.330> two<00:01:17.210> three<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.990> will

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
curve like that on two three this will

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.530 
curve like that on two three this will
come<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.920> ooh

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
come in here ooh

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.800 
come in here ooh
and<00:01:22.820> because<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:23.970> thinking<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and because I'm thinking about it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.370 
and because I'm thinking about it
because<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.590> strange<00:01:27.200> yes<00:01:28.200> I'm

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
because it's all going strange yes I'm

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.230 
because it's all going strange yes I'm
talking<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.369> would<00:01:29.820> probably<00:01:29.880> not

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
talking about it I would probably not

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
talking about it I would probably not
normally<00:01:30.600> bring<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> around<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.530> bit<00:01:31.680> lower

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
normally bring that around a bit lower

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.230 
normally bring that around a bit lower
to<00:01:32.340> about<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.820> line<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:34.110> two<00:01:34.439> three

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
to about that line then one two three

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.100 
to about that line then one two three
and<00:01:37.610> four<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:42.299> should<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.780> flipped

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and four so that should have flipped

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810 
and four so that should have flipped
around<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.680> bottom<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.189> as<00:01:44.280> well

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
around the bottom there as well

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.319 
around the bottom there as well
and<00:01:46.159> five<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> little<00:01:47.700> flick<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and five will have a little flick on the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
and five will have a little flick on the
end<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:49.079> these<00:01:49.259> will<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.619> come<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:52.200> little

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
end and these will just come a little

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.069 
end and these will just come a little
ball<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.670> end<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:55.880> six<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.719> start

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
ball on the end and six would have start

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
ball on the end and six would have start
off<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.259> slightly<00:01:58.560> above<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.189> go<00:01:59.310> below<00:01:59.759> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
off just slightly above and go below the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.310 
off just slightly above and go below the
line<00:02:00.060> there<00:02:01.009> bring<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.189> down<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.229> kind<00:02:04.229> of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
line there bring that down so it kind of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.050 
line there bring that down so it kind of
joins<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> bottom<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.850> six

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
joins at the bottom there like that six

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.860 
joins at the bottom there like that six
seven

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.150 

and<00:02:12.870> AIDS<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.690> not<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.260> kind<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.739> proper

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and AIDS this is not a kind of a proper

everybody's<00:02:31.860> handwriting<00:02:32.310> has<00:02:32.489> kind<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.819> odd

everybody's handwriting has kind of odd

everybody's handwriting has kind of odd
things<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.980> mine<00:02:35.400> has<00:02:35.430> odd<00:02:35.790> things

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
things in it and so mine has odd things

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.970 
things in it and so mine has odd things
in<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.450> as<00:02:36.599> well<00:02:37.730> but<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.349> can<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.830> really

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
in it as well but but I can do it really

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.240 
in it as well but but I can do it really
quite<00:02:41.610> fast<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:43.830> do<00:02:45.049> I'm<00:02:46.049> gonna<00:02:46.250> take

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
quite fast and so I do I'm gonna take

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
quite fast and so I do I'm gonna take
this<00:02:47.370> down<00:02:47.610> here<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.239> I'm<00:02:48.330> going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.540> try<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
this down here and I'm going to try and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.949 
this down here and I'm going to try and
do<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:48.989> faster<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> more<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
do this faster so this is a more of a

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:01.370 
do this faster so this is a more of a
size<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.440> would<00:02:52.709> normally<00:02:53.040> do<00:03:00.170> well<00:03:01.170> not

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
size that I would normally do well not

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.020 
size that I would normally do well not
not<00:03:01.590> speed<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.099> this<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.400> or<00:03:02.549> anything<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.970> is

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
not speed of this up or anything this is

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:16.699 
not speed of this up or anything this is
alive<00:03:03.810> again

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.470 

and<00:03:17.709> that's<00:03:18.190> about<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.239> know<00:03:19.300> if<00:03:19.420> you

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
and that's about it and you know if you

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.089 
and that's about it and you know if you
want<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.660> shade<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.080> in<00:03:20.230> there<00:03:20.500> are<00:03:20.620> lots<00:03:20.950> of

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
want to shade it in there are lots of

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.910 
want to shade it in there are lots of
different<00:03:21.400> ways<00:03:21.520> of<00:03:21.730> doing<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:22.150> as<00:03:22.420> well<00:03:22.920> so

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
different ways of doing that as well so

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.440 
different ways of doing that as well so
like<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.250> say<00:03:24.430> it's<00:03:24.880> more<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.120> kind<00:03:25.270> of<00:03:25.360> a

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
like I say it's more a kind of a

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.890 
like I say it's more a kind of a
handwriting<00:03:25.840> than<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.980> proper<00:03:27.910> font<00:03:28.120> but<00:03:28.780> if

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
handwriting than a proper font but if

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.960 
handwriting than a proper font but if
you<00:03:29.050> you<00:03:29.680> know<00:03:30.040> if<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.250> follow<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.640> strokes

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
you you know if you follow the strokes

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.370 
you you know if you follow the strokes
and<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.239> just<00:03:31.510> rehearse<00:03:31.810> them<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.140> rehearse

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
and you just rehearse them and rehearse

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.290 
and you just rehearse them and rehearse
them<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.650> practice<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.190> practices<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.910> always

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
them and practice and practices I always

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.630 
them and practice and practices I always
say<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:35.530> too<00:03:35.830> will<00:03:36.040> become<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.610> a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
say it too will become like a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.840 
say it too will become like a
handwriting<00:03:37.209> for<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:39.519> you'll<00:03:39.670> just
