hey everybody in YouTube this is rude

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.260 
hey everybody in YouTube this is rude
boy<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.800> today<00:00:02.070> I'm<00:00:02.190> back<00:00:02.370> with<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.760> new<00:00:03.090> video

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
boy and today I'm back with a new video

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.660 
boy and today I'm back with a new video
I'm<00:00:03.689> going<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.140> be<00:00:04.259> unboxing<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:04.980> ocz<00:00:05.490> vertex

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
I'm going to be unboxing the ocz vertex

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.080 
I'm going to be unboxing the ocz vertex
to<00:00:06.240> solid<00:00:07.140> state<00:00:07.170> drive<00:00:07.710> what<00:00:08.639> makes<00:00:08.910> this

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
to solid state drive what makes this

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.549 
to solid state drive what makes this
solid<00:00:09.510> state<00:00:09.690> drive<00:00:09.900> different<00:00:10.290> from<00:00:10.440> the

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
solid state drive different from the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.100 
solid state drive different from the
previous<00:00:10.740> solid<00:00:11.429> state<00:00:11.639> drives<00:00:11.940> from<00:00:12.179> ocz<00:00:12.870> is

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
previous solid state drives from ocz is

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.440 
previous solid state drives from ocz is
that<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.160> comes<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> new<00:00:14.880> side<00:00:15.150> force

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
that it comes with the new side force

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.689 
that it comes with the new side force
controllers<00:00:16.049> which<00:00:16.949> gives<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.490> better

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
controllers which gives it a better

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.470 
controllers which gives it a better
boost<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.180> performance<00:00:18.949> now<00:00:20.029> previously<00:00:21.029> from

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
boost in performance now previously from

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.620 
boost in performance now previously from
my<00:00:21.570> other<00:00:21.750> solid<00:00:22.230> state<00:00:22.439> drive<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:22.920> ocz<00:00:23.400> vertex

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
my other solid state drive my ocz vertex

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.650 
my other solid state drive my ocz vertex
250<00:00:24.630> gig<00:00:24.810> hard<00:00:25.019> drive<00:00:27.410> let's<00:00:28.410> see<00:00:29.210> it<00:00:30.210> has<00:00:30.390> much

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
250 gig hard drive let's see it has much

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.470 
250 gig hard drive let's see it has much
better<00:00:30.990> read<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.590> write<00:00:31.769> performance<00:00:32.300> now<00:00:33.300> my

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
better read and write performance now my

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.990 
better read and write performance now my
old<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.899> used<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> believe<00:00:34.649> 150<00:00:35.399> 160

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
old one used to do I believe 150 160

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.910 
old one used to do I believe 150 160
read<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.500> does<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> hunt<00:00:38.420> 285<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.800> believe<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
read this does a hunt 285 I believe the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520 
read this does a hunt 285 I believe the
old<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.219> did<00:00:41.340> 250<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> could<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.270> wrong<00:00:42.500> now<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
old one did 250 I could be wrong now I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.709 
old one did 250 I could be wrong now I
know<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.040> fact<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.430> right<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> 10

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
know for a fact the right on this is 10

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
know for a fact the right on this is 10
times<00:00:45.930> better<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.649> does<00:00:46.800> 275<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.610> old

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
times better this one does 275 my old

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.700 
times better this one does 275 my old
one<00:00:47.969> did<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.390> 150<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.530> 160<00:00:52.039> okay<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.469> one

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
one did like 150 to 160 okay so this one

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.889 
one did like 150 to 160 okay so this one
definitely<00:00:55.949> has<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.670> boost<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> performance

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.599 

now<00:01:00.899> another<00:01:01.530> thing<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.280> about<00:01:02.309> this

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
now another thing that I like about this

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.020 
now another thing that I like about this
solid<00:01:03.090> state<00:01:03.239> drive<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.979> it<00:01:04.979> comes<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
solid state drive is it comes with a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820 
solid state drive is it comes with a
mounting<00:01:06.630> bracket<00:01:06.720> which<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.470> will<00:01:07.650> show<00:01:07.770> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
mounting bracket which I will show you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
mounting bracket which I will show you
guys<00:01:08.360> also<00:01:09.360> from<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> heard<00:01:09.900> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
guys also from what I heard this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.899 
guys also from what I heard this
performs<00:01:10.680> much<00:01:10.860> better<00:01:10.890> than<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> intel<00:01:11.700> g2

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
performs much better than the intel g2

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.840 
performs much better than the intel g2
drives<00:01:13.040> okay<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.159> let<00:01:14.310> me<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
drives okay now let me just get to the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.719 
drives okay now let me just get to the
unboxing<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:16.040> show<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.130> guys<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.520> comes

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
unboxing and show you guys what comes

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.870 
unboxing and show you guys what comes
inside<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:23.479> in<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.509> second<00:01:25.549> you<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
inside of this in one second you put the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:49.070 
inside of this in one second you put the
camera<00:01:27.150> down

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.520 

okay<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> got<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.640> right<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> basically

old one oh this is pretty funny this is
new<00:02:41.360> my<00:02:42.360> SSD<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.200> faster<00:02:43.680> than<00:02:43.860> your<00:02:44.010> HDD<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
new my SSD is faster than your HDD and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.000 
new my SSD is faster than your HDD and
yes<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.810> all<00:02:45.959> that's<00:02:46.170> all<00:02:46.530> those<00:02:46.800> kids

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.290 
who's leaving me comments telling me
there<00:02:48.660> htd<00:02:49.550> outperforms<00:02:50.550> my<00:02:50.700> solid<00:02:51.120> state
