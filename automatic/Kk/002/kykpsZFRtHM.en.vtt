00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.509
 not being a comic book fan I personally 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.219
 smitten simply indescribable 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.039
 charm you are interested friend 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.990
 Dedpul from it is difficult for me to evaluate everything 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.000
 depths of interest hidden strigo about 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.640
 other bravely stirring whoami 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.039
 men since after deadpool night so 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.080
 seriously though penetrated at 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.640
 respect and kindness to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.769
 some of them after quality 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.079
 screening at all is not difficult 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.390
 Well, this is a movie, but with games, everything is like that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.040
 not really add up that is solo play 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.969
 still nothing like that about batman there for example 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.370
 but with something 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.379
 online somehow everything is not right 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 disi heroes with this were better than those 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.590
 same marks 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 for it was very cheerful and beautiful Odessa 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.500
 universe but now here's another infinite 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.360
 krayzis 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.129
 story packed in popular now 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 frameworks could pro comic heroes those 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.180
 most children of the most different at the same time 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.020
 epochs following in the footsteps of the most popular 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.239
 moba 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.250
 league in the wedges that is if you played 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.899
 lol will give you everything will be clear if not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.850
 he would for you generally dark dark 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.560
 forest first thing you need to understand what it is 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.210
 a game about how you have a few 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.010
 paths to the base of the enemy to which you 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 must get in order to break it 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.270
 crush your enemies carry something in style 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.850
 Batman I killed your mother and father or 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.009
 joker i cut your mouth there somehow and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.659
 all this for 20 40 minutes and such 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.979
 quick incarnation in the shoes of a loved one 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.810
 Hero of universe di si 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.520
 in order to cause others not less than heart 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.200
 expensive but they are not yet that right 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.450
 much much true most famous 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 there is a type of batman in the same jokers 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.400
 women cats and just a miracle of women and green 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.290
 lanterns of course where do without aquaman 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.640
 but as soon as a familiar face is found 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.890
 you can go to battle there 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.750
 some differences from neighbors by genre 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 firstly kind of just something with a set 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.140
 No money should be spent on creeps 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.750
 so strongly what 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.700
 evolve not much sweating during 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.990
 the match will turn out even quite but here 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.579
 extremely young fighters 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.740
 here again the point is what if you don't 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.869
 familiar with the genre of the mob then general each 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.700
 a match is one separate little life 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.380
 hero there he swings from scratch for 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.030
 game cap opening with the passage 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.560
 leveling four active skills and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.399
 getting stronger by buying 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.710
 of all things 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.880
 increasing the life of a hero there mana hero 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.220
 or what he spend there 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.900
 his physical to magical power in order to 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.430
 the course of the battle is still a state of affairs in 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.290
 the game has changed all the time 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.600
 interesting to try to break through to the base 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.550
 enemy at the same time taking into account the simplicity 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.740
 accumulating money things like 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.420
 division by support in kerry tanks and 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.490
 the rest here persists but in general 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.530
 anyone can swing to him 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.390
 convenient and trained in his jug 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.340
 the enemy seems to be the most important thing 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.370
 just look what your hero is strong 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.380
 magic sat down there physical in the sense or 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.570
 thick php and already from this dance but 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.640
 again if you are completely fresh meat then 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.380
 just buy recommended collect 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.540
 coins that is here is some kind of fish 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.070
 unbelievable no you kill you buy 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.960
 money buy some stuff 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.700
 become stronger and gradually 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.860
 break through the enemy base either 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.630
 trying to protect your chips here 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.610
 rather, is that every hero 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.420
 has its copy from some other 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.340
 measurements 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.430
 if you don't like a regular joker 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.810
 can take steam bank fat and 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.610
 impenetrable ie stay with your 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.810
 favorite hero yes we get 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.430
 pleasure from a completely different 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.350
 gameplay as for places where 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.160
 a battle takes place then this gotham card is well 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.200
 or parts of it 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.120
 either with two or with three lines here 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.950
 the main thing is that firstly 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.790
 cards after the heroic rampage remain 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.650
 traces in the form 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.480
 destruction well and you can still rush 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.370
 all sorts of things and second mind 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.820
 damage to the city ​​in stone 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.010
 jungle 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.720
 there are new passages through which 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.490
 you can get to the enemies unnoticed and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.320
 completely from the unexpected side though 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.000
 chip with a sort of levolution which is here 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.950
 there is in my opinion it would be possible 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.720
 to develop even more so that straight himself 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.300
 Wanted himself on superman flew through 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.370
 at home and made my line but so far 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.950
 and on one of the cards in the one with 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.420
 three lines there is a local leviathan 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.710
 who knows for the murder who are not only 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.800
 raking money xp 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.690
 but special skills like account or stasis 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.120
 shield blocks damage entering comrades 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.430
 near and stasis well freezes 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.530
 enemies depriving them of the opportunity to beat us while 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.810
 This is true, too, they can not drink in general 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.060
 I derived from the battle of the drag To command 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.620
 it merged from the carrier ran away and everything is all 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.320
 happy then already bought all 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.390
 returned and soldered already and drag anyone that is 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.280
 such a feature that allows you to 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.230
 take the crucial moment of the match and 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.180
 snatch victory from the mouth of the enemy in 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.070
 the rest as lol only instead of bushes 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.630
 where can we hide biographical 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.310
 platforms i.e. gameplay 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.049
 four active skills several 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.460
 passive and a couple of active 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.169
 exciting skills that we choose 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.780
 in advance before the match and for those who want 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.400
 more speakers there is a goto heights mode 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.199
 map with five dots 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.699
 grab and hold constantly 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.800
 chasing in circles one after another and 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.629
 orbital instrument in addition which 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.909
 if you grab it and bring down on 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.740
 enemies meteor shower or she can 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.449
 become 6 control point which 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.699
 will help you achieve victory faster 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.199
 therefore, the actual battles take place in 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.909
 center then on the edges and everything happens 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.259
 very quickly in addition should 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.180
 probably still clarify what the game is 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.400
 opportunity to develop yourself before the fight 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.169
 buying modifiers and yeah mentat and 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.150
 which will give us additional bonuses 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.069
 in the form of this crit chance 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.780
 or add active skills so 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.449
 earned battles will not get dusty and 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.949
 kapitsa only for buying there skins this 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.199
 perhaps all you need to know about 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.270
 infinite krayzis she does not offer 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.129
 something really incredible innovative and 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.810
 even in some places where 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.969
 I do not shine shine again about 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.009
 levolution place but fan of comics 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.599
 who would like to fight for order 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.639
 or anarchy in goths here you can 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.620
 have some fun and in the shoes of batman you 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.080
 first to tear back baba cat so 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.990
 punk escaping from noir batman 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.069
 chased by a fat joker and atomic 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.199
 green lantern 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:34.550
 such things are the same at my infinite 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.550
 Extremely everything
