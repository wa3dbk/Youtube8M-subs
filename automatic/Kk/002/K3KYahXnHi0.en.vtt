00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
all world fine I didn't enjoy it that's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.180 
all world fine I didn't enjoy it that's
the<00:03:27.510> opposite<00:03:27.870> extreme<00:03:28.080> that's<00:03:28.620> planning<00:03:28.980> all

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the opposite extreme that's planning all

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.710 
the opposite extreme that's planning all
the<00:03:29.310> way<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:29.550> what<00:03:29.790> happens<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.239> was<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> bar

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the way now what happens this was a bar

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.090 
the way now what happens this was a bar
actually<00:03:31.020> that<00:03:31.320> I<00:03:31.350> was<00:03:31.530> playing<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:31.980> was

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
actually that I was playing and it was

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.220 
actually that I was playing and it was
just<00:03:32.280> trendy<00:03:32.700> plays<00:03:32.940> not<00:03:33.540> not<00:03:33.870> where<00:03:34.200> people

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
just trendy plays not not where people

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.350 
just trendy plays not not where people
were<00:03:34.739> dancing<00:03:34.950> or<00:03:35.280> anything<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.760> kind<00:03:36.300> of

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
were dancing or anything so kind of

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.640 
were dancing or anything so kind of
didn't<00:03:36.540> really<00:03:36.630> matter<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.230> planned<00:03:37.500> it

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
didn't really matter that I planned it

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.840 
didn't really matter that I planned it
they<00:03:37.739> imagined<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.190> people<00:03:38.489> were<00:03:38.580> dancing

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
they imagined that people were dancing

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.670 
they imagined that people were dancing
imagine<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.540> are<00:03:39.690> playing<00:03:39.959> where<00:03:40.470> there's<00:03:40.620> a

like that what is people don't I what
you<00:03:44.430> planned

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you planned

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.210 
you planned
we'll<00:03:45.540> look<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.870> stuck<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:46.920> nothing<00:03:47.190> you

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
we'll look you stuck it's nothing you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.490 
we'll look you stuck it's nothing you
can<00:03:47.459> do<00:03:47.580> just<00:03:48.209> like<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.840> guy<00:03:49.019> who's<00:03:49.320> got<00:03:49.440> his

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
can do just like the guy who's got his

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.740 
can do just like the guy who's got his
represent<00:03:50.040> where<00:03:50.340> he's<00:03:50.880> got<00:03:51.120> no<00:03:51.269> idea<00:03:51.300> what

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
represent where he's got no idea what

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.910 
represent where he's got no idea what
he's<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.050> play<00:03:52.230> next<00:03:52.560> they're<00:03:52.709> not

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
he's going to play next they're not

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.070 
he's going to play next they're not
nothing<00:03:53.519> has<00:03:53.610> been<00:03:53.760> thought<00:03:53.940> about<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.840> the

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
nothing has been thought about it's the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.900 
nothing has been thought about it's the
opposite<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.890> it's<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.519> bad<00:03:56.700> in

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
opposite to that and it's just as bad in

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.650 
opposite to that and it's just as bad in
its<00:03:57.060> own<00:03:57.209> way

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
its own way

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.680 
its own way
so<00:03:58.590> obviously<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.610> good<00:04:00.000> way<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.180> doing<00:04:00.450> it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
so obviously the good way of doing it

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.660 
so obviously the good way of doing it
somewhere<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.320> middle<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.489> kind

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
somewhere in the middle and this is kind

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.520 
somewhere in the middle and this is kind
of<00:04:02.760> what<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.150> would<00:04:03.300> call<00:04:03.420> smart<00:04:03.780> preparation

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
of what I would call smart preparation

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.940 
of what I would call smart preparation
this<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.670> where<00:04:05.850> you

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
this is where you

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.610 
this is where you
put<00:04:07.700> some<00:04:08.060> thought<00:04:08.360> in<00:04:08.569> beforehand<00:04:09.170> in<00:04:09.349> order

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
put some thought in beforehand in order

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.290 
put some thought in beforehand in order
to<00:04:09.740> give<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.069> a<00:04:10.130> bit<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.430> freedom<00:04:10.700> when<00:04:11.270> you

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
to give you a bit of freedom when you

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.530 
to give you a bit of freedom when you
get<00:04:11.540> there<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.430> what<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.580> do<00:04:13.730> well<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.209> start

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
get there so what to do well to start

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.039

second<00:05:10.310> thing<00:05:10.520> is<00:05:10.700> to<00:05:11.510> have<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.750> rough<00:05:12.289> idea<00:05:12.470> of

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
second thing is to have a rough idea of

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.590 
second thing is to have a rough idea of
the<00:05:13.280> structure<00:05:13.580> of<00:05:13.760> your<00:05:13.820> set<00:05:14.150> if<00:05:14.419> you're

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
the structure of your set if you're

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.510 
the structure of your set if you're
playing<00:05:14.870> all<00:05:15.080> night<00:05:15.110> have<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.860> beginning<00:05:16.250> a

playing all night have a beginning a
middle<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:17.090> an<00:05:17.150> end<00:05:17.270> even<00:05:17.510> if<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:17.780> only<00:05:17.900> play

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
middle and an end even if you only play

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.930 
middle and an end even if you only play
for<00:05:18.140> an<00:05:18.380> hour<00:05:18.470> having<00:05:19.039> a<00:05:19.250> beginning<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.910> middle

for an hour having a beginning a middle
and<00:05:20.270> an<00:05:20.360> end<00:05:20.450> just<00:05:20.600> a<00:05:20.810> rough<00:05:21.050> idea<00:05:21.200> so<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.160> can

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
and an end just a rough idea so you can

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.370 
and an end just a rough idea so you can
then<00:05:22.669> structure<00:05:23.510> you<00:05:23.600> choose<00:05:23.840> a<00:05:23.870> little<00:05:24.229> bit

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
then structure you choose a little bit

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.219 
then structure you choose a little bit
more<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.250> can<00:05:25.400> have<00:05:25.550> warm-up<00:05:26.240> Pete<00:05:26.960> I'm

so<00:07:02.640> my<00:07:02.880> advice<00:07:03.030> as<00:07:03.360> far<00:07:03.390> as<00:07:03.570> preparation<00:07:03.960> goes

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
so my advice as far as preparation goes

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.800 
so my advice as far as preparation goes
is<00:07:04.650> between<00:07:05.100> the<00:07:05.220> two<00:07:05.370> extremes<00:07:05.790> prepare<00:07:06.510> for

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
is between the two extremes prepare for

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.750 
is between the two extremes prepare for
and<00:07:07.050> that's<00:07:07.290> a<00:07:07.470> very<00:07:07.710> important<00:07:08.160> thing<00:07:08.220> have

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
and that's a very important thing have

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.730 
and that's a very important thing have
many<00:07:09.030> mixes<00:07:09.420> ready<00:07:09.750> but<00:07:10.080> be<00:07:10.230> prepared<00:07:10.620> to

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
many mixes ready but be prepared to

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.490

change<00:07:11.010> things<00:07:11.310> around<00:07:11.400> chop<00:07:11.910> and<00:07:12.060> change

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
change things around chop and change

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.410 
change things around chop and change

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.220
