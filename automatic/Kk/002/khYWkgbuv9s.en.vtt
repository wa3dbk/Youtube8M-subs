00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.710
 the more so because he has not yet decided but the first step 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.959
 new generation of Kamchatka deal 

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:07.299
 tenth grader this gas flowed more 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.349
 Invented courtesy but the principle of freedom 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.459
 information but then how does it work 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.399
 learned Natalia Salnikova 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:15.379
 write and what am i 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:16.880
 This is a question of that 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.369
 these are unit keys 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.550
 I pressed 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.249
 over here people just push 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.789
 a.v and here I have ever given information 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.359
 Already the computer is the main difference between him 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.779
 appearance and in principle work there 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.479
 this kind of computer falls out 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:32.910
 commands here is this device 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.960
 leg 104 9 fast and without microprocessors 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.330
 which is every modern 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.850
 the keyboard created him a tenth grader there 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.150
 Casco Stepan Bolshedvorskaya 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.270
 understands the passion of computers he 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.020
 I thought they could all be made easier 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.660
 there was an idea 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.690
 of what to transfer processes memory 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.790
 i.e. program 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.630
 him 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.300
 that is, we would all have worked inside 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.550
 of memory 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.690
 this 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.970
 proper idea 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.800
 it will be a breakthrough and computational 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 technicians consider time for themselves 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.430
 child leader 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.220
 little prince design office 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.260
 in which stepan creation is engaged 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.900
 bodak devices only the first step 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.320
 the theory is confirmed now I dream 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.180
 designer and teacher make 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.770
 absolutely new programs 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.480
 I know for sure nobody is better 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.420
 no one in memory has ever created 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.070
 electrode device by 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.800
 programming it will be new 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.400
 computers in general as if there are the most 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.610
 diverse they will depend only 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.400
 from the programmer what he will 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.580
 create such 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.540
 the processor you need 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.430
 tutor equipment kids 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.550
 constantly invent something 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.150
 tells Mikhail Shamolin 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.160
 for example on this device by the way 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.829
 also collected by schoolchildren 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.380
 reconstruction is sweet it too know 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.800
 hows 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.460
 Now the device is reprogrammed 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.260
 now he is also hot flashes 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.330
 almost all the development of new designers 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.130
 has practical application here 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.840
 for example electromagnet im 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.240
 I want to conveniently collect manatki 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.510
 metal objects idea 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.070
 was born to the guys when they bought 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.430
 store guests 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.730
 what profession choose stepan is not yet 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.950
 decided but in the future he plans to get on 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.600
 your device patent to become 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.140
 real inventor 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.860
