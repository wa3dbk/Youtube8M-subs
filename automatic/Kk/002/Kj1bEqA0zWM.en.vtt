00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.809
 hi guys and welcome to this 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 new tech news episode 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.650
 this week we talk about lubuntu 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.529
 days in kraft of the charger for 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.340
 ultra fast windows xp e smartphone 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.340
 of the wind 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.689
 retirement of windows xp pushes i 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.460
 computer owners a little dated a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.080
 having to choose whether to change computers or 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 keep your own loyal piece of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.980
 antiques but change the system 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.900
 operational the most obvious option is its own 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.570
 linux yet many users could 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.190
 feeling lost in being projected 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.350
 suddenly in this new world 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.970
 but do not worry lubuntu thinks one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.830
 lightened version of ubuntu fits 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.720
 just to machines not too recent ed 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.339
 to complete the picture there is also a theme 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.199
 which makes the system very similar to 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.239
 windows xp at a superficial glance 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.070
 after installing the theme to ubuntu 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 it's incredibly similar to the system 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.089
 now retired leave the grandmother of 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.589
 install lubuntu the theme is quick 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.510
 succession could have effects 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.820
 unwanted so give you a hand 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.799
 get help from someone more prepared 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.350
 things done the old pc could 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.430
 find new life even from the simpsons 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.890
 a tribute to the now comes 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.390
 very popular in fact minecraft in one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.860
 of the last episodes broadcast in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.450
 america the initial acronym was 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.680
 made in the same graphic style 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.030
 of the video game 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.189
 the title has also been changed to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.330
 the occasion together kraft the only one 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.770
 version of the video the moment 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.450
 available and shooting a little 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.460
 amateur but allows us to appreciate 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.869
 some of the famous locations of the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.149
 proposal board in version 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.380
 minecraft does not lack a good version 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.179
 clipper ready for detonation 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.100
 we therefore recommend taking a look 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.630
 to the video before the fox decides to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.170
 have it removed for violation of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.909
 copyright 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.909
 let's hope it doesn't happen anyway 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.660
 recharge your smartphone in just 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.830
 30 seconds will be possible starting from 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.420
 2016 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.370
 in fact the technology that allows one 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.010
 this loading speed has already been 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.450
 developed by the Israeli store Dr. 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.550
 who unveiled through a video the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.260
 prototype of this new charger 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.360
 which in no time has loaded to 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.250
 one hundred percent the galaxy s 4 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.030
 in appearance the charger like one 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.470
 large ad hoc 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.270
 however, the priority objective is 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.830
 that of reducing its size 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.630
 the market cost should be 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.400
 about thirty dollars 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.380
 the curious note is that store dote is one 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.050
 specialist in semiconductors based 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.610
 biological so-called nanodots are gods 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.290
 component-based bricks 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.300
 biological thanks to them 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.040
 features can be combined 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.630
 to get different results 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.370
 among the many also to speed up the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.370
 battery charging processes 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.959
 the British government does not give up windows 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.090
 xp and has made arrangements with microsoft for 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.240
 extend the latter's support of 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.080
 office 2003 and exchange 2003 for others 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.320
 12 months 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.360
 all for 6.71 million euros 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.310
 to report the news and weekly computer 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.230
 which emphasizes how the government looks 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.640
 satisfied with the agreement 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.350
 the move at the bottom should at least 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.690
 according to government statements 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.330
 British saves 20 million 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.860
 pounds in these 12 months if many 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.810
 will follow the example of the crown 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.000
 the redmond company risks 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.380
 to make more money with the death of xp than 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.600
 with the transition to a new system 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.160
 operating microsoft is not missing anyway 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.200
 to point out that these agreements do not 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.610
 eliminate the need to abandon the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.610
 old system soon 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.900
 the guarantor for the competition and the 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.400
 market initiated proceedings 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.650
 preliminary investigation on remodulation 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.810
 tariff implemented by wind on the offer 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.490
 all including special edition 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.410
 wind has enriched the wind offer 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.360
 digital one of the most competitive of the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.610
 market with additional elements of a 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.500
 service was indeed increased by 2 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.510
 at 3 gigabytes the traffic volume 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.350
 internet with a cost increase of 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.690
 only 2 euros 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.580
 had declared wind to tom's hardware 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.680
 this integration was communicated with 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.050
 over 30 days in advance giving to 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.550
 customers the opportunity to exercise 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.080
 free the right of withdrawal le 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.790
 consumer association union 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.770
 national consumers and other consumption 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.750
 however they protested and decided to 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.460
 contact the guarantor it is in fact supposed 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.320
 that wind has implemented practices 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.270
 incorrect commercial remodeling 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.490
 unilaterally the offer before the 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.050
 course of the promised five years not 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:14.100
 it remains to wait for the outcome of the 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:15.660
 affair and also this episode of tech 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.910
 news has come to an end as usual 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.500
 thank you for your company if 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.420
