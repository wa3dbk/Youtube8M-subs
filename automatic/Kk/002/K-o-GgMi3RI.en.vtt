lashes because I have really tiny lower

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.390 
lashes because I have really tiny lower
lashes<00:05:09.099> and<00:05:09.460> this<00:05:09.880> wand<00:05:10.210> is<00:05:10.450> very<00:05:10.750> small<00:05:11.139> so<00:05:12.070> it

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
lashes and this wand is very small so it

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.190 
lashes and this wand is very small so it
works<00:05:12.580> better<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:13.120> for<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.810> upper<00:05:14.020> lashes

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200
