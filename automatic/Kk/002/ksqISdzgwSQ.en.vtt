00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
fire but it's like in a ball I think

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.050 
fire but it's like in a ball I think
it's<00:05:41.870> a<00:05:42.140> it<00:05:42.620> is<00:05:42.950> kekkei<00:05:43.160> genkai<00:05:43.250> I<00:05:43.580> think<00:05:43.880> it's

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
it's a it is kekkei genkai I think it's

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.460 
it's a it is kekkei genkai I think it's
kekkei<00:05:44.480> genkai<00:05:44.510> of<00:05:44.960> fire<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:46.690> round<00:05:47.690> or<00:05:48.050> I'm

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
kekkei genkai of fire and round or I'm

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.820 
kekkei genkai of fire and round or I'm
not<00:05:48.590> sure<00:05:48.830> why<00:05:49.070> all<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.610> Alba<00:05:50.410> releases<00:05:51.410> but<00:05:51.770> I

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
not sure why all the Alba releases but I

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.650 
not sure why all the Alba releases but I
think<00:05:52.010> it's<00:05:52.130> some<00:05:52.250> long<00:05:52.430> after<00:05:52.850> that<00:05:52.880> well

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
think it's some long after that well

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.050 
think it's some long after that well
that's<00:05:53.780> important<00:05:54.320> all<00:05:54.680> right<00:05:54.890> but<00:05:55.460> um<00:05:55.730> it<00:05:55.940> was

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
that's important all right but um it was

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.730 
that's important all right but um it was
a<00:05:56.150> stand<00:05:56.330> up<00:05:56.420> so<00:05:56.570> I<00:05:56.720> thought<00:05:57.140> it<00:05:57.320> was<00:05:57.500> kind<00:05:57.680> of

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
a stand up so I thought it was kind of

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.700 
a stand up so I thought it was kind of
