00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
did actually see these codes before I

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
did actually see these codes before I
Rosen's<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.420> sure<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.140> meant

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
Rosen's really sure if they really meant

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.049 
Rosen's really sure if they really meant
anything<00:00:37.530> though<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> didn't<00:00:38.489> upload<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.969> I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
anything though so I didn't upload it I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.250 
anything though so I didn't upload it I
didn't<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.660> anything<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.110> it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
didn't really think of anything of it

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.560 
didn't really think of anything of it
but<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.500> he<00:00:40.680> actually<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.670> saw<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> he

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
but then he actually I saw that he

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
but then he actually I saw that he
noticed<00:00:42.960> them<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.590> maybe<00:00:44.190> I'll

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
noticed them so I was like maybe I'll

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
noticed them so I was like maybe I'll

this<00:00:48.539> typical<00:00:49.020> gamer<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.410> hope<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.920> okay<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
this typical gamer I hope it's okay that

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.580 
this typical gamer I hope it's okay that
I<00:00:50.430> use<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.789> photos<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> codes<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I use your photos of the codes because I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.650 
I use your photos of the codes because I
could<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> close<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
could not get it a close up of them I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240 
could not get it a close up of them I
don't<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.710> how<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.890> did<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
don't really know how you did it you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.459 
don't really know how you did it you
probably<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.789> screenshot<00:00:57.420> its<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:57.960> even

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
probably like screenshot its or even

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.369 
probably like screenshot its or even
know<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.190> um<00:00:59.690> we're<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.140> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
know but um we're going to get into this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.590 
know but um we're going to get into this
so<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:02.280> next<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> stairs<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
so if you go next to the stairs that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
so if you go next to the stairs that
lead<00:01:03.750> down<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> double<00:01:04.350> tap<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.280> cell

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
lead down to double tap in the cell

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.460 
lead down to double tap in the cell
there<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> code<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> wall<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.320> like

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
there is a code on the wall on this like

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.539 
there is a code on the wall on this like
piece<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> paper<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> looks<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> just

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
piece of paper that looks like it just

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.380 
piece of paper that looks like it just
like<00:01:08.760> glued<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.299> taped<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:09.930> something<00:01:10.110> um<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
like glued or taped on or something um I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
like glued or taped on or something um I
don't<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.990> means<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
don't really know what it means and in a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.980 
don't really know what it means and in a
second<00:01:14.490> you'll<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> full<00:01:15.210> close<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
second you'll see the full close up of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.359 
second you'll see the full close up of
it<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.350> typically<00:01:16.799> typical<00:01:17.400> gamer<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:19.369> so

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it that typically typical gamer has so

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.240 
it that typically typical gamer has so
right<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.680> right<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.159> go

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
right here right now there you go

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160 
right here right now there you go
there's<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> code<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.570> can't<00:01:24.990> really

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
there's the code if you can't really

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
there's the code if you can't really
make<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> letters<00:01:26.159> I'll<00:01:26.729> link<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
make out all the letters I'll link a

reddit post where this guy actually has

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.940 
reddit post where this guy actually has
the<00:01:31.530> code<00:01:32.360> completely<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.650> together<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the code completely like together and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.160 
the code completely like together and
it's<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.340> typed<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
it's like typed out so you can see the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.160 
it's like typed out so you can see the
code<00:01:37.850> right<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.270> another<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
code right here is another one or up the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.190 
code right here is another one or up the
stairs<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> another<00:01:42.390> code<00:01:42.780> like

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
stairs and this one is another code like

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
stairs and this one is another code like
I<00:01:43.320> said<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.619> don't<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.130> it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
I said we don't really know what it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.850 
I said we don't really know what it
means<00:01:44.430> he<00:01:44.970> thinks<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.360> has<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> decipher<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.380> went

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
means he thinks he has a decipher I went

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you up to date also that was the code

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.950 
you up to date also that was the code
right<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.640> for<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.810> next

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
right there for that that one the next

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.060 
right there for that that one the next
one<00:01:58.079> you're<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> code

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
one you're not going to see the code

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.520 
one you're not going to see the code
until<00:01:59.250> after<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> last<00:02:00.899> two<00:02:01.200> codes

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
until after because the last two codes

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.600 
until after because the last two codes
are<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:01.979> right<00:02:02.130> next<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> each<00:02:02.490> other

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
are going to be right next to each other

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.679 
are going to be right next to each other
because<00:02:02.820> there's<00:02:03.030> four<00:02:03.210> codes<00:02:03.420> all<00:02:03.570> together

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
because there's four codes all together

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.660 
because there's four codes all together
I<00:02:03.930> couldn't<00:02:04.259> split<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.250> some<00:02:05.369> reason

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I couldn't split up for some reason

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.389 
I couldn't split up for some reason
every<00:02:05.880> time<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.060> tried<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.920> wouldn't<00:02:07.920> unlike

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
every time I tried to it wouldn't unlike

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.230 
every time I tried to it wouldn't unlike
work<00:02:08.640> so

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
work so

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.700 
work so
this<00:02:10.750> one's<00:02:10.930> right<00:02:11.080> outside<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.410> cafeteria

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
this one's right outside the cafeteria

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.360 
this one's right outside the cafeteria
and<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.260> inside<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.650> cell<00:02:15.070> like<00:02:15.250> I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and it's just inside the cell like I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.670 
and it's just inside the cell like I
said<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.790> you'll<00:02:16.480> see<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.750> code<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.260> second

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
said so you'll see that code in a second

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.110 
said so you'll see that code in a second
after<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.040> run<00:02:18.190> around<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.670> run<00:02:18.880> up<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.090> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
after you run around and run up to the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.360 
after you run around and run up to the
spawn<00:02:19.570> room<00:02:19.840> it's<00:02:20.440> going<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.650> be<00:02:20.770> two<00:02:21.040> cells

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
spawn room it's going to be two cells

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.770 
spawn room it's going to be two cells
over<00:02:21.730> from<00:02:21.940> where<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.240> would<00:02:22.360> usually<00:02:22.480> get

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
over from where you would usually get

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.660 
over from where you would usually get
like<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.290> drop<00:02:23.620> inside<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.160> one<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> cells

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
like the drop inside of one of the cells

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.640 
like the drop inside of one of the cells
I<00:02:24.940> believe<00:02:25.480> it's<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.660> double<00:02:25.900> tap<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.440> not<00:02:26.530> go

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
I believe it's a double tap and not go

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.620 
I believe it's a double tap and not go
out<00:02:26.740> those<00:02:26.980> have<00:02:27.220> double<00:02:27.460> points<00:02:27.760> um<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:31.420> like

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
out those have double points um but like

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.180 
out those have double points um but like
I<00:02:31.780> said<00:02:31.840> there's<00:02:32.560> another<00:02:32.830> one<00:02:34.920> sorry<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.040> hear
