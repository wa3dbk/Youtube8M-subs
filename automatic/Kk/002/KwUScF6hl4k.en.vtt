00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.379
 Hello, I am 2 and today I will tell 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.630
 you about the secret of production hang up the most 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.060
 sensationalized on the film on state numbers 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.740
 car that protects it from cameras 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.609
 video recording traffic 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.160
 so let's actually go this film 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.130
 is some kind of unique or secret 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.409
 and the leaders of the company Araf who 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.119
 engaged in producing data and more 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.460
 many films for use in 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.060
 different fields of activity and think 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.039
 could not 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.800
 how ingenious are ours 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.559
 russian guys so god for numbers 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.940
 use reflective film oracal 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.120
 Scarlet 75 500 and above the most suitable 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.269
 according to characteristics series 5 700 film 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.780
 black main application of films 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.210
 or alive 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.370
 this is making road signs and 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.980
 pointers since thanks to their 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.010
 structure, they are clearly visible and readable. 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.230
 even on unlit sections of roads in 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.899
 principle and work is that in a pancake 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.659
 reflects the resulting beam of light back 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.810
 on the radiation source in this case 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.570
 Antosh nickname is the camera more precisely its in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.270
 in a hurry that's why to demonstrate 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.880
 the work of this film you are given to compare 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.640
 shooting numbers with flash and without flash 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.490
 In the first case, the numbers light up and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.560
 merges with the white background of the numbers and why 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.020
 the same video recording camera will not see the state 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.659
 number you ask we do not notice 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.880
 no flares the fact is that 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.340
 most video capture cameras 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.250
 works in infrared mode that is 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.640
 chip respectively also infrared 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.950
 it is not visible to the human eye 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.220
 we can only notice the frequent some not 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.590
 red dot and so moving on and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.720
 so how do you make the numbers yourself 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.409
 Here shavermy algorithm of actions is given to find 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.840
 film 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.940
 You can terma trading materials for 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.780
 outdoor advertising and past sites 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.619
 ads 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.290
 prices for plowshares of a series 5 700 varies from 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.320
 1000 to 4000 rubles 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.509
 step 2 you need to find in your 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.330
 city services plotter cutting 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.769
 it is there that you will not be able to cut stencils 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.200
 numbers step 3 is the hardest and 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.330
 arc til nym for many it 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.000
 plotter layout 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.920
 vector graphics editor as well 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.110
 how far not everyone has skills 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.510
 using vector editors we 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.320
 give you the opportunity to purchase 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.989
 ready layout about you . 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.709
 yes but 100 millimeters repeats skull 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.900
 tours and size numbers of state numbers in our 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.650
 layout you can cut from one 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.519
 320 feet per meter of film 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.340
 both 540 digits denoting the number of regions 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.769
 You can also tell us which numbers. 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.790
 no amount interests you 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.540
 and we will do for you individually 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.349
 the cost of the layout is only 250 rubles 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:12.739
 step 4 plotter cutting itself 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.489
 step 5 we cut the film so that each 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.219
 the figure was 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:21.260
 separately step 6 abubakar then 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.590
 have choose the bottom of the cut 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.859
 film and that's the figure ready 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.400
 and now let's calculate and 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.870
 cost price from new numbers first i 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.599
 bought one meter 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.590
 oro light series 5 700 bohemian 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.909
 outdoor advertising 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:45.430
 for one and a half thousand rubles and secondly 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:48.310
 we take into account the cost of the layout of 250 rubles and 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.480
 third plotter cutting itself 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:57.079
 also cost me 250 rubles 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.450
 possible you will find cheaper by folding i 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.439
 got that my expenses are two 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.739
 thousand rubles m will now calculate 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:09.590
 the cost of one digit is 2 thousand rubles 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.919
 loss of 320 typhus 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.639
 and it turns out about six and a half 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:19.519
 rubles from the price of one such figure 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.340
 village varies from 6 hundred 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.350
 over the silence 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.260
 mages of the city from 350 to 800 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.650
 draw conclusions swami was prabog to new 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.650
 meeting
