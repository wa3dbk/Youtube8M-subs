00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
they can grow into and I guess I'm just

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.189 
they can grow into and I guess I'm just
a<00:06:15.380> little<00:06:15.500> frustrated<00:06:15.830> that<00:06:16.960> having<00:06:17.960> been

a little frustrated that having been
around<00:06:18.440> enough<00:06:18.830> cases<00:06:19.490> I<00:06:20.080> can<00:06:21.080> see<00:06:21.409> where<00:06:22.070> the

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
around enough cases I can see where the

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.159 
around enough cases I can see where the
improvements<00:06:22.880> could<00:06:23.030> have<00:06:23.150> been<00:06:23.300> made<00:06:23.539> if<00:06:23.810> an

improvements could have been made if an

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.149 
improvements could have been made if an
tech<00:06:24.409> just<00:06:24.650> applied<00:06:24.979> more<00:06:25.699> time<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:27.159> market

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.779 
tech just applied more time and market
research<00:06:28.840> to<00:06:29.840> the<00:06:29.990> 19-hundred<00:06:30.770> so<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:31.520> guess

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
research to the 19-hundred so I guess

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.430 
research to the 19-hundred so I guess
I'm<00:06:31.970> more<00:06:32.120> disappointed<00:06:32.960> than<00:06:32.990> anything

nineteen hundred falters and there
wasn't<00:07:03.240> enough<00:07:03.510> time<00:07:04.400> invested<00:07:05.400> and<00:07:05.610> just

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
wasn't enough time invested and just

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.550 
wasn't enough time invested and just
really<00:07:06.390> thinking<00:07:07.260> out<00:07:08.070> everything<00:07:08.790> so

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560
