the<00:00:31.590> warrior<00:00:31.949> series<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> misty<00:00:33.210> Starr<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the warrior series and misty Starr and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.500 
the warrior series and misty Starr and
how<00:00:34.320> much<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.680> always<00:00:35.100> loved<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.790> name<00:00:35.820> misty

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
from the series so I decided when I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690 
from the series so I decided when I
would<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.140> rabbit<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.950> would<00:00:41.160> name<00:00:41.370> her

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
