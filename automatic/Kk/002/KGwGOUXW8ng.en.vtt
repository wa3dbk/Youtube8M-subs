seems to be a consensus on YouTube that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.089 
seems to be a consensus on YouTube that
modern<00:02:14.790> warfare<00:02:14.970> 3<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> bad<00:02:16.140> game<00:02:16.349> now<00:02:17.040> for

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
modern warfare 3 is a bad game now for

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.670 
modern warfare 3 is a bad game now for
me<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.270> bad<00:02:18.450> game<00:02:18.690> no<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.349> played<00:02:19.470> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
me I think is a bad game no I played a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530 
me I think is a bad game no I played a
hell<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.129> lot<00:02:20.250> worse<00:02:20.360> definitely<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> lot

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
hell of a lot worse definitely a lot

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.530 
hell of a lot worse definitely a lot
worse<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.459> could<00:02:23.459> name<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:23.879> game<00:02:24.120> off<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.270> top

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
worse I could name one game off the top

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.030 
worse I could name one game off the top
of<00:02:24.569> my<00:02:24.660> head<00:02:24.720> riser<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.410> robots<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
of my head riser the robots on the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.570 
of my head riser the robots on the
snares<00:02:26.340> anybody<00:02:26.730> remember<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.120> crap<00:02:27.360> yeah<00:02:27.900> I

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
snares anybody remember that crap yeah I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.770 
snares anybody remember that crap yeah I
don't<00:02:29.580> think<00:02:29.790> modern<00:02:29.940> warfare<00:02:30.120> 3<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.599> bad

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
don't think modern warfare 3 is a bad

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.660 
don't think modern warfare 3 is a bad
game<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.230> think<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.860> problem<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.640> that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
game I think the problem is is that

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.570 
game I think the problem is is that
ecology<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.540> general<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.580> over

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
ecology in general is just over

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.720
