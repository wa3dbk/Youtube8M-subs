00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello to all subscribers today we 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 look at the stick figure for the video game 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:12.269
 batman arkham origins and this is killer croc 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.889
 as you see this is a very beautiful box 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.350
 triangular shape 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.630
 if you want you can easily display 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.850
 key in the package or get out of the package 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.400
 then put back in the package and she 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.920
 can be stored in this package because 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.800
 what is the packaging showcase which will 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.210
 protect your figure from dust on the side of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:40.290
 us a gorgeous image of batman from behind 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.899
 we can see the other figures 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.870
 time to get it out of the box 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.030
 wow size comparison right in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.670
 the beginning of the review here you can see 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.980
 how big is our killer CRIC 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.949
 compared to the standard 7 inch 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.030
 figure for example with harley quinn me 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.250
 there hasn't been a review for harley quinn but you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.489
 do you know their millions on youtube well 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.220
 okay, I'll do something super spiteful 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.369
 character and super detailed 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.430
 figurine 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.950
 generally american observers low 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.680
 Estimate this figure probably because 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.689
 it costs only 20 bucks while 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.080
 another shako circle on arkhem asaylum 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.000
 worth 40 that second killer croc rather 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.070
 I will have everything in about a month 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.620
 then I will make a comparison 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.470
 between these two figures but for now 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.970
 let's look at this figure and 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.040
 we begin, of course, with his clothes 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.840
 look at his excellent teksturku 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.030
 pants 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.360
 This is a super painting striped pants 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.720
 details as I said excellent 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.259
 look even at his nails 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.229
 detailed nails 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.670
 special attention deserve straps 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.190
 very interesting they are painted 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.890
 almost like real ones made from 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.229
 soft rubber so here they are 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.959
 cool can hang these straps i have 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.209
 due to tightening it tightening it has 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.020
 bandages on both hands and they don't 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.010
 remind 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.330
 best times triple h of ww ii when 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.480
 there was still a lot of awesome blood fights 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.090
 well painted blood so done 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.940
 more under the dried looks very cool 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.690
 Well, who will hug with this 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.670
 bully. mobility in the torso more precisely 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.280
 incision in the body from this point 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.950
 mobility you know how I feel with 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.200
 Krishna mobility figurines possible 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.019
 here it should be all the more behind it 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.840
 mobility is not so noticeable most likely 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.239
 movingly standing in this figure will 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.370
 useful in the end will need the same 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:58.829
 bend down to reach batman 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.410
 all praise deserves mobility 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.239
 look no bolts in the knee 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.540
 almost invisible even when we 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.590
 bend your leg see how cool it is 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.640
 done from behind 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.790
 of course you can see but when we bent 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.780
 leg nowhere else you can not see 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.709
 understand what I mean 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.170
 the appearance of the figure is not spoiled 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.540
 painting used several tones 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.980
 same color therefore looks 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:32.130
 it's very cool look well and most 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.800
 the main thing let's look at his sculptor 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.190
 faces here we can see very angry 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.450
 kun a bunch of teeth yes it is exactly the teeth here 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:48.230
 these little white things are small 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.750
 eyes but painted very neatly 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.640
 do you think about this figure write in 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.400

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.330
