00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.520
 hi girls, i hope you meet 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.400
 super good thank you very much for being one 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.440
 again with me today as you saw already in the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.540
 title I'm going to show you how it is that I've 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.240
 made the curls that showed them today 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.120
 in photos and how do you see my hair right now? 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.780
 melo is lank sees in the morning so 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.330
 I know that with a dryer and 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.550
 that's how I'm going to use this 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.640
 iron that I bought in the center is super 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.920
 economic that I gave him to turn on and 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.200
 now it's going to heat up today 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.210
 apply this the extraordinary of 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.490
 l'orÃ©al paris this is in format in 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.310
 express that's why it's so liquid and 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.979
 I'm going to apply a little more but as I 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.690
 I said already I bring it applied as I have the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.640
 Short hair needs very little 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.130
 quantity of any product that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.650
 applied in my hair and good iron 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.110
 it's already hot so let's divide 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.590
 these are the ones that I am going to show you are 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.510
 very very loose and I say could not be from 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.950
 another way since I bring my hair very 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.130
 short 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.409
 so then they are pretty loose I leave 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.710
 here a little hair must be done 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.539
 in a very messy way because no 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.050
 we want seen as well as super 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.180
 perfect 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.940
 then here we are going around as 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.110
 that grilled 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.110
 so that they are staying 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.799
 and then everything will be like very 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.869
 messy here I'm taking tufts of 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.869
 hair because of where I reach 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.710
 and always the curls when they are glued to 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.310
 the face should go out 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.310
 okay 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.360
 and it's a bit difficult with this cut 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.940
 I bring you but well, it's not 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.520
 impossible let's drop a little more 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.680
 hair and as you can see it's super fast and 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.240
 I did the bottom part did you 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.190
 it comes to stay the way you 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.190
 you want then you take it again 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.020
 some curls are not so marked 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.960
 like others but then we can give a 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.910
 pass 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.480
 vineyard ya like I do not need the 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.480
 top part 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.670
 and so we are taking much more with d 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.490
 and here we go we have here 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.330
 the bangs will also be out all 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.580
 goes out when it's around the 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.500
 face 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.900
 and well, more or less that's how it goes 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.050
 being there you have to move very well the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.580
 desacomodar a little hair to you 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.440
 they know that I do not have much volume in 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.100
 the top part so let's do 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.170
 a little 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.740
 I'm going to apply some spray 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.740
 this 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.280
 and with a comb of this type we are going to 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.280
 create a number 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.750
 two 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.449
 i 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.449
 but apply a little more spray 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.290
 and now it 's time to comb it 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.200
 and nothing, I hope you liked it 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.970
 that has pleased all those 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.770

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.810
