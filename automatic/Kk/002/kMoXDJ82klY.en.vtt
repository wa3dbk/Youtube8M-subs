 80 by 120 centimeters that areas measure such a commercial euro range 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.490
 because a standard moderator still fits perfectly but they could 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.770
 Imagine that on such a small area a complete room setup 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.529
 Could find space 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.899
 with the standard furniture that is in his living room with him would be with 

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.550
 Not to be sure but that was the challenge for two 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.710
 aspiring diploma designer 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.289
 For their thesis, the Crocs invented solo and that's one really 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.640
 amazing idea for mobile living free following the motto today here tomorrow 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.920
 on 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.239
 how do you mean that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.080
 we need the kids 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.510
 but Brunner remains super

 by Ulli BrÃ¼nger and Larry Insights 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.150
 why see 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.820
 This morning tomorrow there is nothing easier than the job afterwards 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.600
 we show the ideal possibility scarce city Neumarkt a friend as 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.490
 Brand for Winnetou 23 as dusty from the laptop to the worries 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.170
 that in 8 minutes 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.160
 Dreieich 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.780
 a mobile home 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.900
 The idea comes from Sebastian housing and Marcel Krings two young designers 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.040
 from the ca Immo International School of Design Kazuhiro is her diploma piece 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.119
 handy handy for those who are born to us 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.750
 transferred stress and we want to try to remove the user so the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.950
 Piste is completely built in just 5 minutes without tools 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.380
 no probate makers needed what you can do 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.810
 Euro and despite its still percent an old box a fourth foul and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.080
 for his own word 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.760
 easy luggage for a broad target group 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.010
 There are many people to think about here 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.840
 For example, one percent of students and students are just out of their husbands 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.470
 Percent from the parents' house, percent of business consultants take off 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.380
 short-term other cities are and if they have to move again 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.670
 You can get your furniture boss from any forwarder Aupeo 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.150
 Let's expect a task-force centimeters that's the basis of a 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.320
 euro pallet 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.690
 so that is the box Andy percent the victories transport is uncertain the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.790
 coupled and can be transported at 80 euros throughout Germany 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.590
 the box is given on time 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 but how do you get them into the apartment when there is no elevator 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.379
 typical situation 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.759
 no elevator 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.639
 we build up in individual cases 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.849
 Question 2 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.500
 if necessary, even in the rain 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.190
 then, however, only under a platzeck a move without cartoons just polished and 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.329
 toolbox 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.329
 the something bumpy 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.949
 and that is the bottom part of the cabinet 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.639
 and that is the shelf 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.400
 This gulf can not be built even by gauche gross motor experts 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.459
 Screws no leaked the bandage just stuck 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.679
 And so that nothing falls out of the page, the icing on the cake is like felt 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.679
 Klondike 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.099
 The sophistication of the system is in many small details 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.809
 and what's amazing is that they are smartly crafted but throughout 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.809
 are 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.449
 who magically magnetic cabinet for example he does not have a single 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.589
 Hinges anyway, you can fold in 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.379
 Graz ots it is percent 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.829
 incorporated into the middle class of a textile chemistry 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.529
 to the 30 all 380 kv if let 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.139
 at the whole cabinet 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.270
 Costolo had a prestigious award in both young designers 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.830
 and rightly so
