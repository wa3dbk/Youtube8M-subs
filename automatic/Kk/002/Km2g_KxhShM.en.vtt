very<00:01:32.369> difficult<00:01:33.119> make<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> parting

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

parts<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> you're<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> braid<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.799> in

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
parts and you're going to braid and in

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.289 
parts and you're going to braid and in
case<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.399> know<00:01:59.549> how<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> braid<00:02:00.030> I'm

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
case you don't know how to braid I'm

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.090 
case you don't know how to braid I'm
going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> show<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:01.259> try<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.530> explain<00:02:01.920> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
going to show you not try to explain it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.690 
going to show you not try to explain it
but<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.460> show<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.700> um<00:02:03.439> so<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.500> cross<00:02:05.219> over<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
but just show you um so you cross over I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.479 
but just show you um so you cross over I
tend<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.240> take<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> front<00:02:06.840> piece<00:02:07.049> first

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
tend to like take the front piece first

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.110 
tend to like take the front piece first
cross<00:02:08.489> over<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.660> cross<00:02:10.050> over<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
cross over and then cross over just a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.400 
cross over and then cross over just a
normal<00:02:12.569> braid

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
normal braid

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920 
normal braid
and<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.490> tend<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.880> try<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.120> pull<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.780> make

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and I tend to try to pull it and make

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.860 
and I tend to try to pull it and make
sure<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.260> stays<00:02:16.290> kind<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.190> behind<00:02:17.580> my<00:02:17.850> ear<00:02:18.120> like

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
sure it stays kind of behind my ear like

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.110 
sure it stays kind of behind my ear like
don't<00:02:19.140> pull<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.380> too<00:02:19.710> forward<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:23.130> make<00:02:23.970> sure

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
don't pull it too forward and make sure

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.960 
don't pull it too forward and make sure
the<00:02:24.210> sections<00:02:24.570> are<00:02:24.690> pretty<00:02:24.930> even

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
the sections are pretty even

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.220 
the sections are pretty even
except<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.090> noticed<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.600> I've<00:02:27.690> got<00:02:27.840> one<00:02:28.020> like

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
except I noticed that I've got one like

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.450 
except I noticed that I've got one like
fatty<00:02:28.500> section<00:02:29.070> but<00:02:29.310> that's<00:02:29.520> okay<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:31.460> and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
fatty section but that's okay so and

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.610 
fatty section but that's okay so and
this<00:02:33.060> definitely<00:02:33.420> takes<00:02:33.660> practice<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
this definitely takes practice like the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.160 
this definitely takes practice like the
braiding<00:02:34.890> part<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.370> easy<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.030> putting<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.080> on

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
braiding part is easy but putting it on

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.840 
braiding part is easy but putting it on
top<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.440> your<00:02:37.530> head<00:02:37.710> part<00:02:37.920> takes<00:02:38.220> practice<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
top of your head part takes practice I a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.340 
top of your head part takes practice I a
lot<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.450> times<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.170> multiple

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
lot of times have to do it multiple

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.650 
lot of times have to do it multiple
times<00:02:40.560> before<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> get<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.490> right<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.510> is

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
times before I get it right so this is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.240 
times before I get it right so this is
not<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> quick<00:02:43.140> out-the-door<00:02:43.470> hairstyle

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
not a quick out-the-door hairstyle

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.180 
not a quick out-the-door hairstyle
unless<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:44.880> really<00:02:45.240> good<00:02:45.450> at<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:46.130> okay<00:02:47.130> so

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
unless you get really good at it okay so

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.010 
unless you get really good at it okay so
you've<00:02:47.520> got<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.820> braided<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.570> end

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
you've got it braided to the end

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.100 
you've got it braided to the end
I<00:02:49.340> leave<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.940> tiniest<00:02:51.360> bit<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.660> section

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
I leave just the tiniest bit of section

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.690 
I leave just the tiniest bit of section
left<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.590> mean<00:02:52.800> these<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:53.100> just<00:02:53.130> kind<00:02:53.460> of<00:02:53.490> dry

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
left I mean these are just kind of dry

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.000 
left I mean these are just kind of dry
ends<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.330> don't<00:02:54.660> want<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.900> deal<00:02:55.110> with<00:02:55.290> so

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
ends that I don't want to deal with so

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.370 
ends that I don't want to deal with so
basically<00:02:56.040> you've<00:02:56.610> got<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.970> now<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:58.230> to

basically you've got this now I like to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.970 
basically you've got this now I like to
take<00:02:58.620> my<00:02:58.860> finger<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:00.170> kind<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.290> push<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.590> so

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
because if you just do this it kind of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.350 
because if you just do this it kind of
ends<00:03:03.750> up<00:03:03.870> weird<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.620> like<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.580> push<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.240> make

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
ends up weird I like to push it to make

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.650 
ends up weird I like to push it to make
sure<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.630> get<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.960> nice<00:03:07.170> little<00:03:07.200> loop<00:03:07.770> there

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
sure you get that nice little loop there

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660 
sure you get that nice little loop there
so<00:03:09.660> push<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.020> like<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.860> then<00:03:11.370> lay<00:03:11.640> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
so push it like that and then lay it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.290 
so push it like that and then lay it
over<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> top<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:12.570> your<00:03:12.720> head<00:03:12.960> and<00:03:14.150> once<00:03:15.150> you

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.420 
in I use blonde bobby pins you can still
see<00:03:36.210> them<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.720> doesn't<00:03:36.930> even<00:03:37.020> matter<00:03:37.400> but<00:03:38.400> I

stay very well and I put a few in there

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.060 
stay very well and I put a few in there
because<00:03:59.600> this<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.660> pretty<00:04:01.260> heavy<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.650> it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
because this is pretty heavy and it

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.180 
because this is pretty heavy and it
naturally<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.790> kind<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.209> pulling<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:04.590> yeah<00:04:04.800> so

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
naturally is kind of pulling so yeah so

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.070 
naturally is kind of pulling so yeah so
essentially<00:04:05.670> this<00:04:05.850> is<00:04:06.000> what<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.180> have<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.930> you

essentially this is what I have if you
can<00:04:07.230> see<00:04:07.820> so<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:09.300> got<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.690> side<00:04:10.050> done<00:04:10.440> pretty

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
can see so you got that side done pretty

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.260 
can see so you got that side done pretty
little<00:04:11.040> milkmaid<00:04:11.880> braid<00:04:12.209> there<00:04:12.830> now<00:04:14.270> the

little milkmaid braid there now the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.930 
little milkmaid braid there now the
other<00:04:15.420> side<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.380> we're<00:04:16.500> at<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.739> end<00:04:16.859> put<00:04:17.790> your

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
other side so we're at the end put your
