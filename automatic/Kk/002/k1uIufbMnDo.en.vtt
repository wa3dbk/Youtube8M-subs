sort of hold all this in place and I do

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.340

of<00:06:48.840> add<00:06:49.319> curls<00:06:49.770> to<00:06:49.919> my<00:06:50.009> hair<00:06:50.190> with<00:06:50.280> it<00:06:50.400> but<00:06:50.520> I<00:06:50.580> do

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
of add curls to my hair with it but I do

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.790 
of add curls to my hair with it but I do
find<00:06:50.910> that<00:06:51.090> my<00:06:51.270> hair<00:06:51.479> gets<00:06:51.870> caught<00:06:52.259> into<00:06:52.680> the

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
find that my hair gets caught into the

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.980 
find that my hair gets caught into the
little<00:06:53.039> little<00:06:53.729> cracks<00:06:54.300> and<00:06:54.509> crevices<00:06:54.960> and

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
little little cracks and crevices and

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.559 
little little cracks and crevices and
it's<00:06:55.319> sort<00:06:55.590> of<00:06:55.770> like<00:06:55.949> snags<00:06:56.520> and<00:06:56.699> breaks<00:06:57.360> the

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:57.569 
it's sort of like snags and breaks the

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.839 
it's sort of like snags and breaks the
hair<00:06:57.750> so<00:06:58.349> I<00:06:58.650> do<00:06:58.740> think<00:06:59.130> it's<00:06:59.310> just<00:06:59.520> better<00:06:59.699> to

00:06:59.839 --> 00:06:59.849 
hair so I do think it's just better to

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.460 
hair so I do think it's just better to
straighten<00:07:00.330> the<00:07:00.419> hair<00:07:00.599> and<00:07:00.930> maybe<00:07:01.229> add<00:07:01.440> some

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
straighten the hair and maybe add some

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.100 
straighten the hair and maybe add some
flips<00:07:01.949> or<00:07:02.159> kind<00:07:02.729> of<00:07:02.880> wave<00:07:03.389> it<00:07:03.569> in<00:07:03.690> a<00:07:03.780> little<00:07:04.020> if

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
flips or kind of wave it in a little if

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.570 
flips or kind of wave it in a little if
