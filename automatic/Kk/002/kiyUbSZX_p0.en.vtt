00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
people might say how do you do that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.870 
people might say how do you do that
because<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.890> catalyst<00:00:31.890> control<00:00:32.099> center<00:00:32.279> right

because in catalyst control center right

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.229 
because in catalyst control center right
now<00:00:33.110> it<00:00:34.110> only<00:00:34.500> allows<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.160> 8<00:00:35.399> 30<00:00:35.610> megahertz

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
now it only allows up to 8 30 megahertz

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.889 
now it only allows up to 8 30 megahertz
for<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> core<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.230> age<00:00:37.559> 50<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> memory

for the core and age 50 for the memory

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.170 
for the core and age 50 for the memory
but<00:00:39.899> there's<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.110> secret<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.120> how<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
but there's a secret to do that how to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.630 
but there's a secret to do that how to
fix<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> go<00:00:43.680> higher<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.129> will

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
fix that and how to go higher I will

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.190 
fix that and how to go higher I will
cover<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.140> further<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.739> video<00:00:48.050> this<00:00:49.050> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
cover that further in this video this is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
cover that further in this video this is

the graphic test number three Canyon

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.630 
the graphic test number three Canyon
something<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.149> we're<00:00:54.149> getting<00:00:54.329> about<00:00:54.449> 27<00:00:54.960> FPS

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
something and we're getting about 27 FPS

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.959 
something and we're getting about 27 FPS
I'll<00:00:56.640> compare<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> result<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.989> results<00:00:58.500> with

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
I'll compare a result the results with

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.420 
I'll compare a result the results with
non<00:00:59.969> overclocked<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.750> other<00:01:00.930> settings<00:01:01.649> later

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
non overclocked in other settings later

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
my scores in 3dmark 06 went up

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
my scores in 3dmark 06 went up
approximately<00:01:11.420> 200<00:01:12.420> points<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.820> 3dmark

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.020 

much<00:01:31.990> better<00:01:32.230> score<00:01:32.530> than<00:01:32.560> they<00:01:32.770> used<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.040> get

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.310 

you<00:01:37.030> could<00:01:37.180> probably<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.600> higher<00:01:37.810> if<00:01:38.140> you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
you could probably get higher if you

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.770 
you could probably get higher if you
took<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.190> time<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.790> overclock<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:40.420> card

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
took the time to overclock this card

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.310 
took the time to overclock this card
higher<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.730> do<00:01:42.970> this<00:01:43.120> tweak<00:01:43.450> there's<00:01:44.170> a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
higher now to do this tweak there's a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.810 
higher now to do this tweak there's a
couple<00:01:45.220> programs<00:01:45.730> you<00:01:46.210> will<00:01:46.240> need<00:01:46.480> to<00:01:46.510> get

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
couple programs you will need to get

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.400 
couple programs you will need to get
first<00:01:49.200> you'll<00:01:50.200> need<00:01:50.290> rivia<00:01:50.740> tuna<00:01:51.130> tuner<00:01:51.850> a

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
first you'll need rivia tuna tuner a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.320 
first you'll need rivia tuna tuner a
two-point<00:01:53.410> 24<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.930> drivers<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:57.330> furmark

two-point 24 the drivers and furmark

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.480 
two-point 24 the drivers and furmark
i'll<00:01:58.510> put<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.290> link<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.010> description

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
i'll put this link in the description

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.490 
i'll put this link in the description
when<00:02:01.090> uploaded<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.810> basically<00:02:04.810> skip<00:02:05.200> all<00:02:05.350> the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
when uploaded so basically skip all the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.310 
when uploaded so basically skip all the
blabber<00:02:06.330> first<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.509> have<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.720> find<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:08.110> special

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
blabber first you have to find a special

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.240 
blabber first you have to find a special
file<00:02:08.740> in<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.220> way<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.729> install<00:02:10.119> review<00:02:10.450> tuner

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
file in the way you install review tuner

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.420 
file in the way you install review tuner
you<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.640> go<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:15.270> your<00:02:16.270> review<00:02:16.630> tuner

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you have to go to your review tuner

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.370 
you have to go to your review tuner
folder<00:02:18.430> where<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.700> installed<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.540> then

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
folder where you installed it and then

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.710 
folder where you installed it and then
open<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.800> Rivia<00:02:21.610> tuner<00:02:22.470> CFG<00:02:23.470> file<00:02:23.709> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
open up the Rivia tuner CFG file and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.600 
open up the Rivia tuner CFG file and
then<00:02:25.720> still<00:02:26.380> look<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:27.209> go<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.720> GPU

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
then still look like this go to the GPU

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.120 
then still look like this go to the GPU
102<00:02:30.750> section<00:02:32.880> 1002<00:02:33.880> section<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.650> look<00:02:35.650> under

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
102 section 1002 section and look under

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.890 
102 section 1002 section and look under
RV<00:02:36.730> 770<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.880> you'll<00:02:39.880> have<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.239> add<00:02:40.390> something

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
RV 770 and you'll have to add something

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:51.090 
RV 770 and you'll have to add something
you<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.470> add<00:02:44.910> 94<00:02:48.120> b3h<00:02:49.620> looks<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.920> like

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
you have to add 94 b3h looks just like

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.699 
you have to add 94 b3h looks just like
that<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.989> again<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.560> 94<00:02:54.190> capital<00:02:54.820> B<00:02:55.110> 3<00:02:56.110> small

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
that so again it's 94 capital B 3 small

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.900 
that so again it's 94 capital B 3 small
