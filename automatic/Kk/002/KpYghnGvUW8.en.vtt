00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.420
 good in today's video we'll talk 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:09.810
 on how to care for guti pups or 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.360
 rather to the alekines of the bukis 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.180
 Well, to begin with if we want the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.310
 we can remove it from the aquarium so that 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.100
 parents do not eat them and they only help 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.050
 all the fry or if we can not 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 leave in the aquarium that they 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.779
 they charge to hide and for example 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.540
 like I've only had one other baby 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.169
 two have eaten them that way 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.250
 the divine 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.730
 I have decided to take it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.010
 and so better and so survive but if 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.620
 you want you can leave it in the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.530
 aquarium since there would be no problem 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.040
 in leaving it but the weakest would die 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.140
 and only a few 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.110
 if you have for example even if it's just 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.040
 a female in a small aquarium can 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.280
 that the female has offspring because they can 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.489
 accumulate what would be 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.610
 good if they copulate once they have stopped 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.820
 several months so if he copulated in the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.140
 store buying 6 or where 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.500
 bought the one that sold you 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.470
 Well, maybe I came pregnant and 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.010
 If you were already pregnant, you can have it if 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.320
 first 7 fry and if it is already a 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.520
 experienced female may have 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.520
 many fry 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.469
 if we have for example several females 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.130
 for example I have six females and two 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.920
 males 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.799
 that means I can have enough 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 babies suppose that every female has 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.240
 20 babies would be more than 120 fry 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.310
 that could give me my females and 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.439
 They are enough, but this time I only 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.979
 I found a fry I think it's 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.469
 pretty weird good where we'll place the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.590
 fry if we decide to remove it by 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.740
 example put it here in this species 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.740
 of 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.830
 stopped with water 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.530
 has a couple of liters of water since it is 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.260
 as it is very small 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.040
 it moves is very tiny and even if 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.250
 little water is enough for him 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.080
 and food we can give you the typical 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.000
 scales that seizes the parents 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.580
 I for example the history of the brand 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.560
 tetro so yes they are healthy and 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.180
 powerful 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.069
 and these are 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.440
 scales and we take them and place it like this 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.900
 and we give it to the alevÃ­n 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.330
 are these of the tetra mark they put that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.110
 they are for laps but they also serve 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.970
 for what would be the loops 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.580
 or if I do not give them these little balls 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.540
 that are very tiny balls 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.660
 I'm going to get a few good ones 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.490
 very tiny balls 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.510
 eating well are the 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.510
 google's fingerlings 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.500
 and in his aquarium where the fry is 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.750
 for example I put a plant in case 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.550
 I wanted to hide but I realized that 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.580
 What he likes to do most is walk 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.340
 swimming around the fish tank looking for food and 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.519
 hiding especially if I approach 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.370
 to what would be where I have it goes 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.459
 exposing in the plant if it had 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.250
 left where the parents' aquarium 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.810
 surely they would have eaten it since 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.810
 the parents are very cannibal 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.250
 and I will make a video about the parents and their 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.409
 aquarium so that you can see the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.290
 good and that has helped this 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.939
 tutorial dale like and do not forget 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.939
