00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.679 
finishers I've used silver eyes in the
game<00:01:41.159> normally<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.360> go<00:01:42.509> through

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
game normally if you go through

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.300 
game normally if you go through
one-on-one<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> keeper<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.040> look<00:01:44.189> more

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
one-on-one with the keeper you look more

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.999 
one-on-one with the keeper you look more
like<00:01:44.369> finessing<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> round<00:01:45.560> but<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.649> perky

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
like finessing it round but with perky

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.800 
like finessing it round but with perky
you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.310> simply<00:01:47.640> smash<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> most<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you can simply smash it in and most of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.780 
you can simply smash it in and most of
time<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.530> may<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.950> even<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> corner

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
time it may not even go in the corner

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.130 
time it may not even go in the corner
it'll<00:01:51.000> sometimes<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.600> straight<00:01:51.899> down<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it'll sometimes go straight down the

it'll sometimes go straight down the
middle<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.560> still<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.490> his<00:01:53.579> shot

it's<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.240> powerful<00:01:54.860> his<00:01:55.860> volleys<00:01:56.250> also

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it's just so powerful his volleys also

I did get a thing 1 volley and he has

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.089 
I did get a thing 1 volley and he has
got<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.719> best<00:02:06.869> following<00:02:07.200> I've<00:02:07.439> ever<00:02:07.829> seen

without saying his long shots are
incredible

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
incredible

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
incredible
I<00:02:13.830> think<00:02:14.130> I'm<00:02:14.250> asked<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.460> record<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.850> few<00:02:15.060> but

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
I think I'm asked to record a few but

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.120 
I think I'm asked to record a few but
I've<00:02:15.630> scored<00:02:15.840> plenty<00:02:16.320> more<00:02:16.470> like<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.860> before

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
I've scored plenty more like that before

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.340 
I've scored plenty more like that before
I<00:02:17.310> got<00:02:17.430> my<00:02:17.580> PVR<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:18.750> your<00:02:18.900> opponent<00:02:19.260> gives

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
I got my PVR and if your opponent gives

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.410 
I got my PVR and if your opponent gives
cookie<00:02:19.680> space<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.190> more<00:02:20.310> than<00:02:20.430> likely<00:02:20.460> score

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
cookie space and more than likely score

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.350 
cookie space and more than likely score
from<00:02:21.570> any<00:02:21.810> distance<00:02:22.740> really<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.120> few

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
from any distance really so the few

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.210 
from any distance really so the few
negatives<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.230> first<00:02:25.560> these<00:02:25.830> being<00:02:26.100> is

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
negatives the first these being is

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.400 
negatives the first these being is
priced<00:02:26.550> he<00:02:27.000> did<00:02:27.240> used<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.630> about<00:02:27.750> 200<00:02:28.050> to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
priced he did used to be about 200 to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.190

300<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.100> Xbox<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:30.150> he<00:02:30.210> did<00:02:30.450> get<00:02:30.660> hyped<00:02:30.960> up

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
300 can the Xbox but he did get hyped up

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.440 
300 can the Xbox but he did get hyped up
and<00:02:31.380> that's<00:02:31.650> why<00:02:31.800> prices<00:02:32.130> are<00:02:32.400> high<00:02:32.550> now<00:02:32.850> when

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
and that's why prices are high now when

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.090 
and that's why prices are high now when
it<00:02:33.540> comes<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.810> ps3<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.380> don't<00:02:34.740> really<00:02:34.920> know<00:02:35.070> if

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
it comes to ps3 I don't really know if

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.460 
it comes to ps3 I don't really know if
his<00:02:35.280> price<00:02:35.520> has<00:02:35.700> changed<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.750> I'm<00:02:36.840> assuming

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
his price has changed but I'm assuming

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.110 
his price has changed but I'm assuming
that's<00:02:37.710> gone<00:02:37.980> down<00:02:38.220> as<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.520> know<00:02:38.760> silver

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
that's gone down as I know silver

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.140 
that's gone down as I know silver
informs<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.990> lot<00:02:40.200> rarer<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.620> there<00:02:41.150> next

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
informs or a lot rarer on there next

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.850 
informs or a lot rarer on there next
things<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.390> taste<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.870> skill<00:02:43.080> moves<00:02:43.350> now<00:02:43.830> I

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
things is taste and skill moves now I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.500 
things is taste and skill moves now I
don't<00:02:44.130> mind<00:02:44.400> slow<00:02:44.670> strikers<00:02:45.210> with<00:02:45.330> three

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
don't mind slow strikers with three

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.300 
don't mind slow strikers with three
stars<00:02:45.720> skill<00:02:45.960> moves<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.680> know<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> lot<00:02:47.280> of

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
stars skill moves but I do know a lot of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.340 
stars skill moves but I do know a lot of
people<00:02:47.610> can't<00:02:47.820> use<00:02:47.910> strikers<00:02:48.450> below<00:02:48.750> 80<00:02:48.990> pace

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
people can't use strikers below 80 pace

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.840 
people can't use strikers below 80 pace
or<00:02:49.620> strikes<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.100> don't<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.430> four-star

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
or strikes that don't have four-star

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.780 
or strikes that don't have four-star
skills<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.720> guess<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> native<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.250> tiny

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
skills so I guess it is a native a tiny

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.220 
skills so I guess it is a native a tiny
bit<00:02:53.970> more<00:02:54.090> pace<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.540> he<00:02:54.630> banging<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.960> lot<00:02:54.990> more

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
bit more pace and he banging a lot more

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.080 
bit more pace and he banging a lot more
girls<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:55.680> guess<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.070> down<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.580> personal

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
girls but guess it's down to personal

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.660 
girls but guess it's down to personal
preference<00:02:57.540> really<00:02:58.070> lastly<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.220> less<00:02:59.490> obvious

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
preference really lastly a less obvious

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.210 
preference really lastly a less obvious
point<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.510> if<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.720> use<00:03:00.780> pokey<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:02.010> have

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
point is that if you use pokey you have

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.550 
point is that if you use pokey you have
to<00:03:02.370> change<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.820> way<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.000> play<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:03.540> was<00:03:04.170> lucky

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
to change the way you play I was lucky

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.200 
to change the way you play I was lucky
that<00:03:04.680> I'd<00:03:04.950> used<00:03:05.250> him<00:03:05.430> before<00:03:05.460> catching<00:03:05.910> this

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
that I'd used him before catching this

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.290 
that I'd used him before catching this
gameplay<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.720> him<00:03:06.920> because<00:03:07.920> if<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.820> hadn't<00:03:09.210> I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
gameplay of him because if I hadn't I

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.030 
gameplay of him because if I hadn't I
probably<00:03:09.960> wouldn't<00:03:10.260> have<00:03:10.320> scored<00:03:10.650> half<00:03:10.890> of

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
probably wouldn't have scored half of

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.010 
probably wouldn't have scored half of
these<00:03:11.160> goals<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.730> lot<00:03:12.210> of<00:03:12.300> people<00:03:12.570> tell<00:03:12.840> you

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
these goals a lot of people tell you

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.050 
these goals a lot of people tell you
that<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.980> get<00:03:14.100> used<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.370> him<00:03:14.580> don't

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
that you have to get used to him don't

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.880 
that you have to get used to him don't
expect<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.660> use<00:03:15.780> him<00:03:15.900> for<00:03:16.050> one<00:03:16.200> game<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.650> score

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
expect to use him for one game and score

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.470 
expect to use him for one game and score
a<00:03:16.920> hat-trick<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.520> takes<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.910> few<00:03:18.030> games<00:03:18.300> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
a hat-trick it takes a few games to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.199 
a hat-trick it takes a few games to
learn<00:03:18.600> how<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> use<00:03:19.170> them<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.580> overall<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.760> he

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
learn how to use them so overall is he

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.110 
learn how to use them so overall is he
worth<00:03:21.390> paying<00:03:21.720> 300<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.620> 400<00:03:23.070> K<00:03:23.220> for<00:03:23.489> in<00:03:23.700> my

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
worth paying 300 to 400 K for in my

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.780 
worth paying 300 to 400 K for in my
opinion<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.840> can<00:03:25.230> get<00:03:25.410> them<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.680> 200<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.370> 300

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
opinion you can get them for 200 to 300

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.520 
opinion you can get them for 200 to 300
K<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.780> don't<00:03:27.989> really<00:03:28.170> have<00:03:28.260> anything

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
K and you don't really have anything

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.830 
K and you don't really have anything
better<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:29.040> spend<00:03:29.310> your<00:03:29.400> coins<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:29.940> go<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.660> get

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
better to spend your coins on go and get

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.810 
better to spend your coins on go and get
them<00:03:31.050> but<00:03:31.590> if<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.830> can't<00:03:32.100> get<00:03:32.250> them<00:03:32.370> cheaper

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
them but if you can't get them cheaper

to make it a bit shorter as I think the
last<00:03:47.700> one<00:03:47.820> was<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.060> bit<00:03:48.180> too<00:03:48.330> long<00:03:48.510> but<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:49.440> you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
last one was a bit too long but if you
