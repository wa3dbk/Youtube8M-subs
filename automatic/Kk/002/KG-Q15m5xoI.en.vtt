00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 in the us human rights activists have taken new 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.569
 steps in the fight against the police 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.639
 cruelty and racial prejudice by 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.130
 the whole country is gaining momentum movement 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:23.189
 called black breakfast like this 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:25.289
 look like protest of its members except 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.699
 dogs your activist groups come into 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 cafes and restaurants where most 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.570
 visitors are white and prevent them from eating 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.380
 list and on African Americans 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.430
 victims of police brutality 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.230
 reaction to attempts to inform 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.010
 the public in such a way happens 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.010
 ambiguous 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.809
 the channel itself some visitors are 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.629
 how this man in anger leaves 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.920
 institutions because they were prevented 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.690
 restaurant manager also unhappy 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.329
 activists because they scare 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.100
 customers for example on this video one of 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.199
 Visitors trying to convey to 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.120
 speakers the idea that their 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:10.380
 actions they will not achieve anything 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.810
 good however most visitors 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.490
 try to continue the meal though noticeably 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.920
 that being in a cafe is not comfortable for them 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.110
 josh pasok theory expert 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 communication believes that such protests 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.950
 counterproductive this situation is vividly 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.930
 demonstrates that the expectation is related 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.570
 the election of a black politician for the post 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.430
 President did not materialize people hoped 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 that racial conflict started during 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.140
 times of slavery and continuing to this 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 the day is finally coming to naught but that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.939
 did not happen if you think about it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.619
 nothing surprising significant 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.320
 economic inequality is nowhere 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.729
 disappeared and overcoming it is likely 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.680
 will take a lot of time 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.630
 perhaps some visitors 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.770
 restaurants not previously interested 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.350
 this problem 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.509
 will become more aware however i 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.579
 I think that such actions will not lead 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.320
 by some kind of global change in 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.189
 endless interracial stories 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.189
 contradictions in the usa
