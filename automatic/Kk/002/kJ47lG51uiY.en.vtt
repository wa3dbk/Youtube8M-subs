00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.740
 It's the only tattoo I have in the world. 

00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:08.074
 That's the "tattoo" 

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.733
 Is this a tattoo? (Just not a point ...) 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.120
 MACE: What kind of tattoo is that? 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.080
 I have a tattoo. 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.380
 I skated on the road when I was in elementary school. 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.140
 My hands are all around. 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.280
 But my dad left me in the house. 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.094
 So I went to get some mackerel. 

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:30.216
 But your hands are hurt so you have to disinfect them. 

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:32.314
 That's it. 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.740
 Let's eat and sterilize once 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.040
 MACE: I did not have a hygiene idea. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.520
 If I have to disinfect, I will. 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.640
 What do we do? 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.960
 "Yeah, just let me eat and disinfect!" 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.540
 I ate first. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.360
 MACE: She's been blind, but she's sick and nabal. 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.560
 How do I sterilize my stomach? 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.560
 I just ate my stuff. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.820
 I ate it and said, "Oh, do you want to disinfect it now?" I saw the wound. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 The soup is off here 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 But this is even harder! Over time. 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.840
 What does it mean to be stuck? I have to scrape the wound. 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 I'm scared! It 's getting more hotter than before. 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.160
 I just let it go. I just gave up ... 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.320
 I got a scab and I did not want to take off the scab, so I gave it another, 

00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:20.794
 It was a tattoo. 

00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:21.974
 MACE: You're covered in that condition. 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 MACE: You have a joke in your age. 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.000
 MACE: You have a springtime SAUCE. 

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:30.487
 But this is a little cute. 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.320
 It looks like a fox and a little heart-shaped? 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.020
 MACE: Well, that would be better for your body because you can eat that dye. 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.340
 Much better! 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 MACE: You gave up on your skin. 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.620
 MACE: I gave the spring to the skin. 

00:01:47.514 --> 00:01:49.514
 Yeah, yeah. I gave up on the skin without eating. 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.860
 SKIN FOOD COPY: Do not eat 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.320
 Yield to skin 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.540
