okay<00:00:00.299> we're<00:00:00.450> going<00:00:00.599> to<00:00:00.690> make<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.290> bow<00:00:01.530> for<00:00:01.770> the

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
okay we're going to make a bow for the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.249 
okay we're going to make a bow for the
top<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.340> six<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.760> seven<00:00:03.060> foot<00:00:03.270> tree<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:04.140> the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
top of a six to seven foot tree and the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.289 
top of a six to seven foot tree and the
way<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.410> do<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:05.190> take<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.700> say<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
way to do that is you take and say the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.720 
way to do that is you take and say the
say<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.810> tree<00:00:07.020> 7-foot<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:08.220> multiply<00:00:08.700> that

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
say the tree 7-foot you multiply that

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.450 
say the tree 7-foot you multiply that
times<00:00:09.179> 2.5<00:00:09.960> that's<00:00:10.860> going<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.160> give<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.340> your

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
times 2.5 that's going to give you your

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.430 
times 2.5 that's going to give you your
longest<00:00:11.880> length<00:00:12.090> you're<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> use<00:00:13.139> three

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
longest length you're going to use three

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440 
longest length you're going to use three
lengths<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.549> second<00:00:14.910> length<00:00:15.059> you're<00:00:15.330> going

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
lengths the second length you're going

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.680 
lengths the second length you're going
2-3<00:00:15.870> inches<00:00:16.350> off<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.800> first<00:00:17.190> length<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.449> we

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
2-3 inches off the first length so we

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.510 
2-3 inches off the first length so we
figured<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.380> first<00:00:19.590> length<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.980> 17<00:00:20.490> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
figured that the first length is 17 and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.700 
figured that the first length is 17 and
a<00:00:20.730> half<00:00:20.760> inches<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.720> we're<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> say<00:00:22.199> 17

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
a half inches so we're going to say 17

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.730 
a half inches so we're going to say 17
inches<00:00:23.180> minus<00:00:24.180> 3<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.510> 14<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.380> that's<00:00:25.560> going<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
inches minus 3 is 14 so that's going to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.950 
inches minus 3 is 14 so that's going to
be<00:00:25.800> our<00:00:25.890> second<00:00:26.400> length<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> third

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
be our second length and then the third

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
be our second length and then the third
length<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.470> minus<00:00:28.800> 34<00:00:29.160> 14<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> that's<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
length we minus 34 14 and that's the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
length we minus 34 14 and that's the
third<00:00:31.349> leg<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:32.210> 11<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.260> one

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
third leg is going to be 11 so the one

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049 
third leg is going to be 11 so the one
what<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.860> want<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.460> 10<00:00:35.700> yards<00:00:35.969> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
what we want to do is take 10 yards of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.670 
what we want to do is take 10 yards of
material<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:37.110> we're<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> pinch<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
material and we're going to pinch the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.549 
material and we're going to pinch the
end<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> locate<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> crosses

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
end of it and locate one of the crosses

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.560 
end of it and locate one of the crosses
closest<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> center<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.700> place<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
closest to the center and place the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.229 
closest to the center and place the
pinch<00:00:42.870> over<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.860> those<00:00:43.950> crosses<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.090> with

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
pinch over one of those crosses and with

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.850 
pinch over one of those crosses and with
your<00:00:45.360> pliers<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.899> pinch<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> together<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
your pliers you pinch it together and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.990 
your pliers you pinch it together and
press<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.100> through<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.520> cross<00:00:47.700> cut

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
press it through the cross cut

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.470

approximately<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:49.700> quarter<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.879> an<00:00:51.000> inch<00:00:53.480> then

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
approximately a quarter of an inch then

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.729 
approximately a quarter of an inch then
you're<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> measure<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.260> longest

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you're going to measure your longest

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.329 
you're going to measure your longest
length<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> we're<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> go<00:01:00.359> 12<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.800> five

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
push it through a quarter of an inch now

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.289 
push it through a quarter of an inch now
the<00:01:19.890> main<00:01:20.070> thing<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.759> don't<00:01:20.880> want<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> do

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the main thing is you don't want to do

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.990 
the main thing is you don't want to do
this<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> air<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:23.759> add

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
this in the air because it will not add

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
this in the air because it will not add
resistance<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> push<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.650> want<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
resistance to the push in so you want to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.590 
resistance to the push in so you want to
make<00:01:26.009> sure<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.580> push<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.090> against

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
make sure that you push it in against

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.160 
make sure that you push it in against
the<00:01:27.689> cutting<00:01:27.990> board<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> book<00:01:30.020> next<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the cutting board or a book next you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.330 
the cutting board or a book next you
want<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.409> keep<00:01:31.560> measuring<00:01:33.829> for<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.159> lakes

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
want to keep measuring for all the lakes

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
want to keep measuring for all the lakes
on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> top<00:01:35.909> they're<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> same

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
on the top they're going to be the same

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.020 
on the top they're going to be the same
so<00:01:37.259> we're<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.770> 17<00:01:38.280> inches<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.880> each

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so we're going to use 17 inches for each

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.800 
so we're going to use 17 inches for each
of<00:01:39.240> these<00:01:39.329> four<00:01:40.140> cross<00:01:40.439> cuts<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> center

measure inch push into the cross into

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.680 
measure inch push into the cross into
the<00:02:04.409> cutting<00:02:04.770> board<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:06.149> around<00:02:06.420> here

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
the cutting board now we get around here

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.809 
the cutting board now we get around here
and<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.990> order<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.470> four<00:02:07.860> lengths<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.429> top

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and in order to have four lengths on top

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.650 
and in order to have four lengths on top
to<00:02:09.690> make<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.550> symmetrical<00:02:11.989> on<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.260> last<00:02:13.530> one

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
to make it symmetrical on that last one

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.559 
to make it symmetrical on that last one
you're<00:02:15.660> going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.900> pinch<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.540> place<00:02:18.540> it

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
you're going to pinch it and place it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.809 
you're going to pinch it and place it
right<00:02:18.780> next<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.890> first<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.670> went

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
right next to that first one you went

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.800 
right next to that first one you went
into<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:23.400> take<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.730> pliers<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.300> push<00:02:24.630> it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
into just take your pliers and push it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.840 
into just take your pliers and push it
right<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.260> next<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:25.860> now<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.340> two

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
right in next to it so now you have two

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.310 
right in next to it so now you have two
knots<00:02:27.350> on<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> other<00:02:28.620> side<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> disc
