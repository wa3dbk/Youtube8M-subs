00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.649
 static wheel balancing you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.809
 like bearings 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.759
 normal open without coefficients 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.849
 Spassk usually engine oil 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.109
 said the easy to spin the rod 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:25.920
 metal sturdy masking tape and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:28.740
 actually weights which hangs on 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:42.930
 Spokes with different nominal more 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:46.829
 less how to do it all so wheel 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.289
 I already confuse pereobut 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 and old rubber so it is already a little bit 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.520
 Fetis seat and quite evenly 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.520
 so balancing is very much needed 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.000
 tighter which go up under scammers 2 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.210
 in order to emphasize themselves 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.930
 the simple was not indicated anywhere 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.409
 In principle , they can be fixed differently. 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.409
 another to do 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.390
 we see which system turned out 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.549
 easy to spin without sticking without anything 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.909
 now if we stop it right away 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.079
 strives to move me even 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.689
 slightly to the other side of the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.590
 lead because she starts spinning 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.670
 which light side is heavy 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.170
 side down so masking tape for 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 knife tends to become a little bit somewhere 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.649
 Hold to she found with 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649
 equilibrium point 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.580
 here 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.310
 here on at the balance point I take for 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:19.860
 convenience we meet allure on tape 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.860
 the top point pasted dash know. 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.280
 so so here we get by virtue 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.010
 gravity 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.530
 more hard part tends down then 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.489
 accordingly us so that 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.760
 balance this 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.299
 and imbalance we need to hang the weights 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.120
 top just opposite 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.639
 painting this tape I take 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.879
 at random just picking up 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:01.159
 some weight for again for 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.349
 quickness to practice a handy little 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.180
 lean in one direction 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.969
 another if we see that she doesn't care 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:14.419
 begins to seek regrinding means 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:18.129
 little hung up version 2 which one and 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.129
 we just fix it with our hands pressing all 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:30.889
 we see that now he is filmed in one 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:33.489
 the side is still stable in this account too 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:36.079
 I can still, in principle, this wheel is always 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.849
 I had many other she knows hike 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.509
 spawn 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.509
 somewhere in between 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.030
 Well, let's quickly I got 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.230
 do it because basically they are still 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.230
 he didnâ€™t drink 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.560
 so we see that we already have 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.560
 equilibrium point is no longer so intelligible 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.479
 already by the method let's say that intuition is not 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.680
 We understand that the radiation is located 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.049
 a little bit here because basically 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.479
 weight three pieces hang and they 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:29.360
 distribute a little weight here that is 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.280
 here you can be just more 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.729
 heavy lighter weights rearranged 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.729
 in places 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.220
 worth 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.970
 starts to move 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:59.620
 moving so okay loads me still on 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.620
 heavier 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:42.139
 as we see it starts in another 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:44.360
 side to twist along the way we are a little bit 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.580
 not 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.879
 where we just check different positions 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:54.159
 so that it does not spin it a little bit 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:56.659
 starts but she already starts 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:59.080
 spin the other side then it turns out 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.080
 weights 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:07.819
 on something intermediate in weight I have 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.729
 there are no intermediates on one side with 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.259
 the other side of me firm chase the ride 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.599
 anyway the wheels will be all the same near 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.389
 therefore, it is quite accurate balancing from 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:20.469
 equal to make me a big plant no i 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.469
 it will not suffer 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.490
 you can try the wheels easier cruise 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.490
 what is 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:47.640
 leg of this is significantly lacking 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:51.710
 it is clearly visible that the thread starts right away 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.710
 spin all the same put harder 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.230
 if you want you can balance 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:06.190
 no worse than dynamic at all of 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:08.320
 tire stations for this need with 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:12.580
 more with small steps different weights and 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.010
 the principle of patience 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.260
 forgot at the end no look forget these 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:27.910
 carpenter weights good to put 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:32.320
 preferably large pliers heavy 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:34.740
 even more top we compress here 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.740
 small they have special 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.990
 thickening building it will be here they 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.980
 wider and they are a little bit with edges here already 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.950
 because of the dirt and 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:49.950
 old age is not visible they are decks on our 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.950
 verge of the spokes they get to sit tight
