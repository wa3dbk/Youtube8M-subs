ever seen to doll sized lipstick I think

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.449

it's<00:03:19.949> a<00:03:20.040> little<00:03:20.340> bit<00:03:20.519> big<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:22.009> okay<00:03:23.009> it'll

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
it's a little bit big but okay it'll

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.420 
it's a little bit big but okay it'll
work<00:03:23.609> and<00:03:23.849> then<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:25.620> one<00:03:25.769> I'm<00:03:25.889> really<00:03:26.220> excited

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
work and then the one I'm really excited

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.319 
work and then the one I'm really excited
about<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.629> doll<00:03:27.780> size<00:03:27.989> nail<00:03:28.259> polish<00:03:29.329> there

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
about is the doll size nail polish there

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.899

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
are plenty of small nail polish bottles

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.080 
are plenty of small nail polish bottles
but<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.509> this<00:03:33.720> one<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.819> really<00:03:35.819> nice

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
but I think this one is really nice

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.030 
but I think this one is really nice
because<00:03:36.329> it's<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.019> actual<00:03:37.530> nail<00:03:37.709> polish

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
because it's like the actual nail polish

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.179 
because it's like the actual nail polish
bottle<00:03:38.879> shape<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.709> would<00:03:40.829> see<00:03:40.979> in

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
bottle shape that you would see in

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.249 
bottle shape that you would see in
larger<00:03:41.549> bottles<00:03:41.909> instead<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.900> those<00:03:43.049> like

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:43.259
