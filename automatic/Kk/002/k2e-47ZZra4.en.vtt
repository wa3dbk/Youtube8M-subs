00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:12.070
 So you see here the low lying housing 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:14.420
 lg 0 1 b what the front this 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.610
 typical 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.770
 then the dvd drive opens and 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.599
 if you shut it down then 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.210
 you have access to the memory 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:33.720
 card reader with usb 3.0 and you have 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.340
 stop usb connections and the audio 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.450
 Connections here the power switch of the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.079
 reset button here the functions are running and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.570
 the disk activity indicator 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.700
 this usb 3.0 uses usb 2.0 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.890
 because there is no slot on the mainboard 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.040
 for usb 3.0 further freely because the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.960
 decision up here the the multicard 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.940
 reader is because I have said such as 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.480
 have the highest speed out 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.850
 I wanted to cover the case 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.070
 still left and right open 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.509
 So please do not be surprised we will 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.650
 also to do that if you because of the 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.530
 temperature times look 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 Up here we have this image of the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:21.359
 new series straight power with 480 gold 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.179
 plus it's all very much out 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.939
 Of course, the fan will quietly shut down 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.639
 is regulated now the box fan so 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.159
 which was with the i5 processor with it 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:37.049
 then we have kingston twice which 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.590
 frame 24 gigabytes of our eight gigabytes 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.409
 Valuev is running in dual channel mode to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.149
 then I have the hard drive up here 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.630
 installed with an adapter from 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.420
 three and a half to five quarters as far as you can 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.950
 can see and below here the other one 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.240
 hard disk you would have it here too 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.280
 but I could build that 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.219
 Some temperature development because 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.600
 However , I already found myself warming my hand 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.479
 the not so practical canceled 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.240
 Greater distance would be nice to me and the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:12.300
 ssd has found space down here 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.740
 That's an extra way to bracket where 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.810
 I then luckily on this 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.940
 adapter from three and a half to 21 too 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.880
 could dispense here was unfortunately no 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.420
 space 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.840
 Kathrin's place is first of all housing then 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.450
 later install fan from the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.600
 here we have space behind us 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.620
 have space here and then fell in 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 The housing cover is still two 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.390
 slits resp 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.010
 where you can probably catch yes here 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.420
 below we had this 3.0 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.920
 connection this is the excuse usb 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.850
 2.0 adapter from 30 to 20 of the 30 conductors 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.770
 connected by multicard regency and 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.410
 graphics card is here also on board 1 x 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:05.560
 vga and dvi from intel chipset yes then 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.230
 I have tried this cable here 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.380
 relatively well visually summarized 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.590
 So that's just as compact as possible 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.940
 logical and really do not stop 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.130
 if I put in and fan in now 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.150
 The air circulation with big problems 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.150
 prepares yes as I said volume is 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.460
 optimal if the housing to it then still 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:34.870
 better and I'll show you again from 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:39.490
 behind the connections or natural 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:43.690
 power switch is then clearly ps2 mouse 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:50.470
 and keyboard then usb 2.0 2 port usb 3 0 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:52.240
 2 hdmi connection 1 x vga and dvi then there 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.820
 below the network connection gigabit 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.480
 ethernet is clear 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.280
 and again twice usb and then stop 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.320
 the audio inputs and outputs also after 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.320
 in front and through is occupied by 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.940
 for power consumption I have here now 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.830
 a magnetar connected in the power 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.239
 average is 40, he shows 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.440
 on 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.070
 so that is 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.780
 In any case , he consumes very humana 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.850
 since required 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.930
 I would have honestly been with that now 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.850
 calculated twice 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.650
 can you look like that then under 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.650
 but load it otherwise everything perfectly
