how it can digital into meta moe
first<00:00:44.510> take<00:00:45.050> out<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.200> patches<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.430> top<00:00:46.670> and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.630 
first take out the patches the top and
it<00:00:48.710> can<00:00:48.950> divide<00:00:49.489> into<00:00:49.760> two<00:00:50.030> piece<00:00:51.340> so<00:00:52.340> that<00:00:52.460> you

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
it can divide into two piece so that you

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.470 
it can divide into two piece so that you
can<00:00:52.960> hide<00:00:53.960> under<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.649> foot<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.399> it<00:00:56.059> won't

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
and then unfold body and turn back is

00:01:50.200 --> 00:02:00.600 
and then unfold body and turn back is
upper<00:01:50.770> body<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.240> front<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:58.710> next<00:01:59.710> foe<00:02:00.250> is

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
and I think this a little bit string on

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.680 
and I think this a little bit string on
this<00:03:17.690> top<00:03:18.110> because<00:03:18.970> yeah<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.000> seem<00:03:20.420> you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
this top because yeah you seem you

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.830 
this top because yeah you seem you
should<00:03:20.959> have<00:03:21.290> his<00:03:21.530> tail<00:03:21.860> but<00:03:22.459> then<00:03:23.300> die<00:03:23.480> seems

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
should have his tail but then die seems

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.070 
should have his tail but then die seems
do<00:03:24.140> not<00:03:24.319> make<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:28.310> got<00:03:28.819> another<00:03:29.360> net

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
do not make it and I got another net

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.539 
do not make it and I got another net
amount<00:03:30.319> model<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:33.019> can<00:03:33.049> see<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:34.280> have

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
amount model and you can see it so have

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.870 
amount model and you can see it so have
this<00:03:34.700> long<00:03:35.269> tail<00:03:35.600> but<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:36.860> one<00:03:37.100> missed<00:03:37.640> that

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
this long tail but this one missed that

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.280 
this long tail but this one missed that
this<00:03:39.190> is<00:03:40.190> not<00:03:40.549> represent<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.390> my<00:03:41.810> figure

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
misses tail is because the 10 Bend I did

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.059 
misses tail is because the 10 Bend I did
not<00:03:46.819> create<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.989> one<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:49.310> time<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:51.069> you

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
not create the one to this time and you

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.770 
not create the one to this time and you
can<00:03:52.340> compare<00:03:53.000> how<00:03:53.450> they<00:03:53.750> look<00:03:53.930> like

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
can compare how they look like

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:05.480 
can compare how they look like
and<00:03:57.010> their<00:03:58.010> clothes<00:03:59.440> have<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.470> break<00:04:00.920> different

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:19.030 

and<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.300> can<00:04:06.450> see<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.750> back

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.960 

and<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.840> end<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.260> my<00:04:23.040> two<00:04:23.100> days<00:04:23.460> with
