00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.240

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.399
 fixer from art visage 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.850

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.850

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 base and enjoy using it already 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.569
 somewhere a jar floor on the bottom spent 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.130
 I decided to take my palette from oka dokie 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.170
 I really like this white here 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.170
 shade and put on all eyelid 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.049
 hard brush from essense paint it 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 they are of course crumbly so you need with 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.310
 they are not gently showered under the eyes and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.639
 to make it all a little shade and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.270
 I take a fluffy brush and simple surplus 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:02:01.789
 some blow off as if from an eye 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.670
 This time I decided to make arrows with 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.579
 of these shades from the Nikita palette or on 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.280
 the same brush oblique I will write 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.780
 and spend this here is not very much and 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.260
 thick arrow near the stairs polina ru 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.500
 so eyelashes just to make a look 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.400
 brighter and lashes to appear 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.220
 more such filled then you can 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.950
 do a little bit arrow by length or 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.950
 just leave without any there 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.410
 elongation in general is already your 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.180
 discretion scramble I will apply 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.530
 shade thick view from the same palette 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.480
 nekit gently just fill up the fight 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:51.010
 not very saturated as this is more 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:56.860
 still day make-up and shade 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.230
 it's all in circular motions and for 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.180
 highlight i take a shade and very out 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.100
 wrap palettes and also put on 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:09.910
 inner corners of the eyes and to and the same 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.410
 Of course I will apply under the brow without 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.410
 I'm not going anywhere 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.620
 Now I have mascara 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.999
 Maybellin such ordinary tubes as this 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.999
 twirling in my opinion 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.849
 we now swarm just put on 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:38.760
 corners of mascara then it seems so more 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:40.950
 fox look by the way one more type which 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.859
 didn't like this white pencil again 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.299
 me pencil gd 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.700
 generally used very often before 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.980
 then stopped now under this makeup 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.900
 don't like wearing white again 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.019
 pencil to look more 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.609
 open so I do not know even by 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.319
 attracts attention it seems to me 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:06.230
 now also the same brown shadows 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:12.590
 just letting down the lower lash line 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.120
 to look so distinct 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.570
 Now probably my contouring 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.320
 favorite part of me as always my blush 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.150
 by three 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.479
 brown and my tassel is trending down 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:35.060
 sbh and shorter competing of course the face 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:35.060
 cheekbones forehead all as usual better 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.470
 use your cream blush from 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.800
 manhattan is no longer even just like 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.270
 rouge and how to base the next blush 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.240
 to keep longer 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.870
 better color even by itself is very very 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.210
 beautiful and just so autumn me 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.880
 really like they are absolutely matte 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.810
 so very creamy top 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.050
 apply just these rouge from reason 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.940
 these rosy satin inoppost so 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.420
 Basically, they hold me well 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:21.310
 I wanted that day just such a super 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:25.570
 fixing the whole let's say so and shading 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:31.840
 it's all further but now look at 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:34.890
 you just want to fail but it 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.890
 such a small bonus 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.100
 still don't like chrysler underwear 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.160
