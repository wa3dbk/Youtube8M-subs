00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
changes that I wanted as opposed to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.810 
changes that I wanted as opposed to
going<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.949> actual<00:00:29.670> prop<00:00:30.269> details<00:00:30.720> but

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820

going with the actual prop details but
the<00:00:32.820> first<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:35.000> Luke<00:00:36.000> return<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> jedi

hero but I don't like the control box if

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.459 
hero but I don't like the control box if
it<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.030> display<00:00:42.059> then<00:00:42.750> great<00:00:43.020> yeah<00:00:43.290> it's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it was on display then great yeah it's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.830 
it was on display then great yeah it's
awesome<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
awesome but this one is you know for the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.970 
awesome but this one is you know for the
purpose<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:48.079> actually<00:00:49.079> playing<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.950> i

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
purpose of actually playing with it so i

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.910 
purpose of actually playing with it so i
put<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.670> switches<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.469> Nubia<00:00:52.469> near<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
put the switches from Nubia near the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.869 
put the switches from Nubia near the
back<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> bank<00:00:53.430> ones<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.390> instead<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:56.219> gold

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
back to bank ones on it instead the gold

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.689 
back to bank ones on it instead the gold
one<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.420> ox<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.260> silver<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
one is ox and the silver one is the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.270 
one is ox and the silver one is the
activator<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> pretty<00:01:01.859> much<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> same

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
activator this is pretty much the same

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.149 
activator this is pretty much the same
design<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> v2<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.409> inch<00:01:04.559> neck<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
design as the v2 with one inch neck the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.789 
design as the v2 with one inch neck the
difference<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.080> solid<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
difference is that it's solid that you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.780 
difference is that it's solid that you
can't<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.400> through<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.820> time<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.750> um

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
can't see through at this time but um

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.510 
can't see through at this time but um
it's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.150> good<00:01:12.390> technique<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.140> actually

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
it's a good technique and I actually

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.300 
it's a good technique and I actually
have<00:01:14.520> an<00:01:14.820> obi-wan<00:01:15.680> revenge<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> sith<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
have an obi-wan revenge of the sith that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.570 
have an obi-wan revenge of the sith that
i'm<00:01:17.400> making<00:01:18.080> with<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.170> also<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:20.009> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
i'm making with it also just because it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
i'm making with it also just because it
works<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.509> seven<00:01:21.810> eighths<00:01:21.900> inch<00:01:22.080> blade

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
works if it's a seven eighths inch blade

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.039 
works if it's a seven eighths inch blade
um<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.060> pretty<00:01:24.180> deep<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.659> optics

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
um actually it's pretty deep the optics

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.460 
um actually it's pretty deep the optics
or<00:01:25.200> somewhere<00:01:25.619> around<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:26.450> but<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
or somewhere around here but it's a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.770 
or somewhere around here but it's a
crystal<00:01:28.890> focus<00:01:29.130> v3<00:01:32.119> by<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> way<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> pommel

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
crystal focus v3 by the way the pommel

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.600 
crystal focus v3 by the way the pommel
is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.710> modified<00:01:35.689> what<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.960> M<00:01:39.770> ps3<00:01:40.770> version<00:01:41.460> 2

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
is a modified what is it M ps3 version 2

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.960 
is a modified what is it M ps3 version 2
but<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.320> trimmed<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.680> by<00:01:43.950> Strider<00:01:44.670> at

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
but it was trimmed down by Strider at

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
but it was trimmed down by Strider at
custom<00:01:45.390> saber<00:01:45.600> shop<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.920> fits<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
custom saber shop and I think it fits a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.499 
custom saber shop and I think it fits a
lot<00:01:47.250> better<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.880> another<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.420> on

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
lot better I have another one that's on

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:59.010 
lot better I have another one that's on
my<00:01:48.630> v2<00:01:48.930> walls

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:09.669 

so<00:02:00.020> here's<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.350> one<00:02:07.450> second<00:02:08.450> one<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:09.380> bear

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
so here's that one second one is a bear

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.130 
so here's that one second one is a bear

Clone<00:02:15.140> Wars<00:02:15.260> shorts<00:02:15.710> I<00:02:16.010> did<00:02:16.460> one<00:02:16.610> before<00:02:17.120> with

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
Clone Wars shorts I did one before with

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.500 
Clone Wars shorts I did one before with
a<00:02:17.450> big<00:02:17.720> huge<00:02:18.020> hole<00:02:18.320> in<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.710> middle<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.510> but

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
a big huge hole in the middle of it but

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.270 
a big huge hole in the middle of it but
I<00:02:20.540> don't<00:02:20.750> own<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.200> one<00:02:21.350> anymore<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.980> went<00:02:22.130> to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
I don't own that one anymore it went to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.090 
I don't own that one anymore it went to
django<00:02:22.760> who<00:02:23.300> in<00:02:23.840> turn<00:02:23.990> gave<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.800> gyro

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
django who in turn gave it to the gyro

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.120 
django who in turn gave it to the gyro
so<00:02:25.550> she's<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.910> one<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.060> owns<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.480> now<00:02:27.130> this

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
so she's the one that owns it now this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.640 
so she's the one that owns it now this
one<00:02:28.310> was<00:02:28.550> scratch<00:02:29.120> built<00:02:29.360> almost<00:02:29.900> entirely

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
one was scratch built almost entirely

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.710 
one was scratch built almost entirely
this<00:02:31.550> is<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:33.310> modular<00:02:34.310> pommel<00:02:34.940> system<00:02:35.209> also<00:02:35.360> I

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
this is a modular pommel system also I

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.020 
this is a modular pommel system also I
think<00:02:35.870> it's<00:02:36.050> at<00:02:36.140> number<00:02:36.380> five<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:39.459> aux<00:02:40.459> button

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
the activation it's just a big huge bar

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.970

with the slider switch like right in

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.720 
with the slider switch like right in
here<00:02:53.590> I'll<00:02:54.590> know<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:54.890> all<00:02:55.220> three<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.520> these

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
here I'll know that all three of these

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.140 
here I'll know that all three of these
are<00:02:56.090> actually<00:02:56.660> built<00:02:56.989> um<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.950> lot<00:02:58.880> sturdier

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
are actually built um a lot sturdier

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.210 
are actually built um a lot sturdier
than<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.540> usually<00:02:59.720> build<00:03:00.110> sabers<00:03:00.530> just<00:03:00.920> because

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
than I usually build sabers just because

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.880 
than I usually build sabers just because
like<00:03:01.459> um<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:04.239> got<00:03:05.239> sick<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.600> being<00:03:06.470> all<00:03:06.590> ginger

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
like um I got sick of being all ginger

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.039 
like um I got sick of being all ginger
with<00:03:07.040> my<00:03:07.850> toys<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.330> stuff<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.720> was<00:03:08.810> like<00:03:08.930> you

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
with my toys and stuff so I was like you

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:09.940 
with my toys and stuff so I was like you
know<00:03:09.140> I'm<00:03:09.200> going<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.410> make<00:03:09.530> something<00:03:09.769> that's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
know I'm going to make something that's

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.759 
know I'm going to make something that's
tough<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.780> don't<00:03:11.959> break<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.560> made

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
tough and I don't break it so I made

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.320 
tough and I don't break it so I made
these<00:03:12.799> tougher<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.730> maybe<00:03:13.880> that's<00:03:14.150> another

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
these tougher so maybe that's another

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.580 
these tougher so maybe that's another
reason<00:03:14.510> why<00:03:14.660> they<00:03:14.959> thought<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.320> they<00:03:15.530> were

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
reason why they thought that they were

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.310 
reason why they thought that they were
series<00:03:16.390> anyway<00:03:17.390> this<00:03:17.480> one<00:03:17.630> has<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.810> seven

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
series anyway this one has a seven

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.370 
series anyway this one has a seven
eighths<00:03:18.440> inch<00:03:18.650> blade<00:03:19.180> also<00:03:20.180> but<00:03:20.840> it's<00:03:21.110> kind<00:03:21.320> of

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
eighths inch blade also but it's kind of

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.690 
eighths inch blade also but it's kind of
cool<00:03:21.650> how<00:03:22.280> this<00:03:22.489> one<00:03:22.670> works<00:03:24.549> tighten<00:03:25.549> that

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
cool how this one works tighten that

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.670 
cool how this one works tighten that
down<00:03:25.760> none<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:26.750> stuff<00:03:26.870> actually<00:03:27.170> sticks

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
down none of this stuff actually sticks

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.460 
down none of this stuff actually sticks
out<00:03:27.860> except<00:03:28.250> for<00:03:28.570> maybe<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.780> aux<00:03:30.080> button<00:03:30.350> a

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
out except for maybe the aux button a

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.870 
out except for maybe the aux button a
little<00:03:30.709> bit<00:03:31.840> all<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.459> joints<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.610> stuff

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
little bit all of the joints and stuff

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.630 
little bit all of the joints and stuff
they're<00:03:35.120> all<00:03:35.209> hidden<00:03:35.600> set<00:03:35.870> screws<00:03:36.610> except<00:03:37.610> for

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
they're all hidden set screws except for

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.360 
they're all hidden set screws except for
the<00:03:38.470> blade<00:03:39.470> retention<00:03:39.830> screw<00:03:39.980> which<00:03:40.130> is<00:03:40.250> just

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
the blade retention screw which is just

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.050 
the blade retention screw which is just
a<00:03:40.519> regular<00:03:40.670> set<00:03:40.970> screw<00:03:41.120> but<00:03:41.600> um<00:03:41.810> again<00:03:42.230> nothing

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
a regular set screw but um again nothing

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.539 
a regular set screw but um again nothing
to<00:03:44.060> keep<00:03:44.239> me<00:03:44.299> from<00:03:45.110> holding<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.010> yeah<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.370> can

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
to keep me from holding it yeah I can

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.069 
to keep me from holding it yeah I can
comfortably<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.500> this<00:03:48.500> right<00:03:48.680> here<00:03:48.739> is<00:03:48.950> a

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
comfortably so this right here is a

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.780 
comfortably so this right here is a
brass<00:03:51.079> tube<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.530> holds<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.920> wires<00:03:52.400> that

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
brass tube that holds the wires that

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.060 
brass tube that holds the wires that
feed<00:03:53.630> from<00:03:53.870> switch<00:03:54.170> down<00:03:54.440> into<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.860> rest<00:03:55.010> of

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
feed from switch down into the rest of

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:03.580 
feed from switch down into the rest of
the<00:03:55.160> body<00:03:55.280> that's<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.000> only<00:03:56.150> reason<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.360> is

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:14.979

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.080 

but<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.169> what's<00:04:16.320> cool<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:17.100> dumb<00:04:17.519> if<00:04:17.940> you

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
but that what's cool is that dumb if you

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.810 
but that what's cool is that dumb if you
do<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.419> right<00:04:18.600> like<00:04:18.870> keep<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.440> big<00:04:20.250> flat<00:04:20.549> part

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
do it right like keep the big flat part

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.730 
do it right like keep the big flat part
against<00:04:21.120> your<00:04:21.239> hand<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:22.049> can<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.560> old

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
against your hand you can do the old

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.790 
against your hand you can do the old
like<00:04:23.220> um<00:04:23.540> Sidious<00:04:24.540> thing<00:04:24.810> or<00:04:25.290> it's<00:04:25.440> kind<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.650> a

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
like um Sidious thing or it's kind of a

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.690 
like um Sidious thing or it's kind of a
jerk<00:04:26.040> movement<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:27.980> then<00:04:28.980> you<00:04:29.520> don't

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
jerk movement and then you don't

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.340 
jerk movement and then you don't
necessarily<00:04:29.880> have<00:04:30.389> to<00:04:30.540> hold<00:04:30.960> anything<00:04:31.200> down

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
necessarily have to hold anything down

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.340 
necessarily have to hold anything down
you<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.340> let<00:04:33.150> friction<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.810> grab<00:04:33.990> onto<00:04:34.169> it

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
you just let friction and grab onto it

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.219 
you just let friction and grab onto it
remember<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.639> then<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.810> it's<00:04:39.960> kind<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.169> like

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
remember and then so it's kind of like

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.790 
remember and then so it's kind of like
motion<00:04:40.680> activated<00:04:41.070> but<00:04:41.820> it's<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.990> cheap<00:04:43.380> poor

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
motion activated but it's the cheap poor

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.100 
motion activated but it's the cheap poor
man's<00:04:44.010> way<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.280> making<00:04:44.910> motion<00:04:45.210> activated<00:04:45.570> so

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
man's way of making motion activated so

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.550 
man's way of making motion activated so
it<00:04:46.200> works<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:46.530> cool<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:51.419> last<00:04:51.660> one<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.350> take

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
it works is cool the last one is I take

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:03.440 
it works is cool the last one is I take
the<00:04:52.860> blade<00:04:53.490> out<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.790> this<00:04:53.880> one<00:04:54.090> is<00:04:54.750> the<00:05:02.300> call<00:05:03.300> it

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
couple of things that I changed on here

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.750 
couple of things that I changed on here
was<00:05:21.840> first<00:05:22.080> of<00:05:22.200> all<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.440> box<00:05:22.680> I<00:05:22.919> don't<00:05:23.640> really

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
was first of all the box I don't really

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.350 
was first of all the box I don't really
like<00:05:23.850> boxes<00:05:24.390> but<00:05:24.570> this<00:05:25.289> one<00:05:25.500> is<00:05:25.770> in<00:05:26.700> a<00:05:27.180> position

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
like boxes but this one is in a position

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.210 
like boxes but this one is in a position
where<00:05:27.570> it's<00:05:27.870> not<00:05:27.990> going<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.260> obstruct<00:05:28.770> my<00:05:28.979> hand

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
where it's not going to obstruct my hand

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.520 
where it's not going to obstruct my hand
hold<00:05:29.510> if<00:05:30.510> it<00:05:30.690> was<00:05:30.780> on<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.020> other<00:05:31.050> side<00:05:31.169> like

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
hold if it was on the other side like

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.800 
hold if it was on the other side like
the<00:05:31.710> prop<00:05:31.919> is<00:05:32.100> then<00:05:32.400> it<00:05:32.520> would<00:05:32.669> be<00:05:32.850> but<00:05:33.300> I<00:05:33.360> put

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
the prop is then it would be but I put

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.570 
the prop is then it would be but I put
it<00:05:33.900> on<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.140> other<00:05:34.229> side<00:05:34.530> which<00:05:34.710> is<00:05:34.860> what<00:05:35.370> the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
it on the other side which is what the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.700 
it on the other side which is what the
left<00:05:35.789> side<00:05:36.030> instead<00:05:36.630> of<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.810> other<00:05:36.840> one<00:05:37.140> but

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
left side instead of the other one but

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.010 
left side instead of the other one but
um<00:05:37.940> don't<00:05:38.940> usually<00:05:39.060> put<00:05:39.300> things<00:05:39.510> in<00:05:39.630> boxes<00:05:39.780> but

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
um don't usually put things in boxes but

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.270 
um don't usually put things in boxes but
it<00:05:40.110> was<00:05:40.200> just<00:05:40.350> nice<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.530> have<00:05:40.830> all<00:05:41.100> the

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
it was just nice to have all the

cyan from the clone wars cartoon shorts

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:04.380 
cyan from the clone wars cartoon shorts
I<00:06:55.330> just<00:06:55.540> like<00:06:55.690> that<00:06:55.870> color<00:06:56.140> blue<00:07:03.180> another<00:07:04.180> cool

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
I just like that color blue another cool

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.960 
I just like that color blue another cool
thing<00:07:04.450> is<00:07:04.690> that<00:07:04.900> I<00:07:05.500> didn't<00:07:06.250> intend<00:07:06.730> for<00:07:06.760> it<00:07:06.880> to

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
thing is that I didn't intend for it to

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.760 
thing is that I didn't intend for it to
happen<00:07:07.150> but<00:07:07.390> there's<00:07:07.900> little<00:07:08.080> slits<00:07:08.560> on

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
happen but there's little slits on

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.500 
happen but there's little slits on
either<00:07:09.040> side<00:07:09.370> of<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.610> box<00:07:09.850> which<00:07:10.180> means<00:07:10.420> I

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
either side of the box which means I

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.200 
either side of the box which means I
just<00:07:10.720> cut<00:07:10.900> the<00:07:11.050> hole<00:07:11.200> too<00:07:11.410> big<00:07:11.440> but<00:07:12.220> it<00:07:12.550> allows

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
just cut the hole too big but it allows

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.580 
just cut the hole too big but it allows
down<00:07:13.480> to<00:07:13.630> come<00:07:13.780> through<00:07:13.990> so<00:07:14.170> this<00:07:14.350> one's

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
down to come through so this one's

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.840 
down to come through so this one's
actually<00:07:14.710> a<00:07:14.980> little<00:07:15.190> bit<00:07:15.400> louder<00:07:15.520> than<00:07:15.820> the

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
actually a little bit louder than the

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.350 
actually a little bit louder than the
other<00:07:16.030> two<00:07:16.770> because<00:07:17.770> the<00:07:18.220> sound<00:07:18.760> vents<00:07:19.150> come

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 
other two because the sound vents come

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.760 
other two because the sound vents come
from<00:07:20.070> the<00:07:21.070> side<00:07:21.280> there<00:07:21.550> you<00:07:21.790> can<00:07:21.940> sort<00:07:22.120> of<00:07:22.180> see

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
from the side there you can sort of see

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.930 
from the side there you can sort of see
that's<00:07:23.770> pretty<00:07:23.980> sloppy<00:07:24.220> on<00:07:24.460> my<00:07:24.580> part<00:07:24.880> but

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
that's pretty sloppy on my part but

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.610 
that's pretty sloppy on my part but
honestly<00:07:25.390> it<00:07:25.630> worked<00:07:25.810> out<00:07:25.930> for<00:07:26.110> the<00:07:26.200> better<00:07:26.350> so

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
honestly it worked out for the better so

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:36.770 
honestly it worked out for the better so
hey<00:07:26.830> win<00:07:28.170> anyway<00:07:32.670> those<00:07:33.670> are<00:07:34.120> my<00:07:34.390> lightsabers

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.790 

stand<00:07:37.780> by<00:07:38.320> Halon<00:07:38.890> customs<00:07:39.400> profit<00:07:39.880> up<00:07:40.800> and

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 
stand by Halon customs profit up and

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.270 
stand by Halon customs profit up and
that's<00:07:42.370> it<00:07:42.520> later
