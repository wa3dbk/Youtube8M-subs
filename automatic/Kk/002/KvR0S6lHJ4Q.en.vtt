00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
on about half way we want to have room

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.490 
on about half way we want to have room
to<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:58.259> both<00:01:59.070> directions<00:01:59.100> here<00:02:00.290> now<00:02:01.290> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
to go both directions here now this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.889 
to go both directions here now this
cable<00:02:01.890> stop<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.369> works<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.390> help<00:02:03.540> adjust

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.949 
now at this point ship the shifter down
into<00:02:47.950> second<00:02:48.489> gear<00:02:49.349> that's<00:02:50.349> what<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:51.069> notch

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
into second gear that's what one notch

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.229 
into second gear that's what one notch
now<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.349> where<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.680> comes<00:02:53.860> into<00:02:54.040> handy<00:02:54.579> to

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
now this is where it comes into handy to

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.160 
now this is where it comes into handy to
see<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.260> indicator<00:02:56.829> pin<00:02:57.189> there<00:02:58.079> what<00:02:59.079> you

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.270 
down until you can look down this hole
and<00:03:08.829> see<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.659> top<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.709> indicator<00:03:12.069> pin

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
and see the top of the indicator pin

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.910 
and see the top of the indicator pin
coming<00:03:12.519> just<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:15.790> past<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.930> top<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.470> end<00:03:17.620> of

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
coming just just past the top the end of

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.119 
coming just just past the top the end of
the<00:03:18.310> axle<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.079> now<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.140> should<00:03:20.500> be<00:03:20.530> in<00:03:20.620> second

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
the axle and now you should be in second

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:27.210 
the axle and now you should be in second
gear<00:03:21.989> okay<00:03:22.989> now<00:03:23.230> time<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.590> test<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:26.980> up

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
gear okay now time to test this up

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.819 
gear okay now time to test this up
in<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.459> third<00:03:27.700> gear<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.500> what<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.590> should

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
in the third gear and what you should

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.539 
in the third gear and what you should
see<00:03:30.069> is<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.730> wheel<00:03:30.879> turning<00:03:31.239> very<00:03:31.569> slightly

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
see is the wheel turning very slightly

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.899 
see is the wheel turning very slightly
faster<00:03:33.549> than<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.840> sprocket<00:03:35.590> there<00:03:35.909> let's

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
faster than the sprocket there let's

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.839 
faster than the sprocket there let's
shift<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.239> into<00:03:37.480> second<00:03:38.260> gear<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:39.639> wheel

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
shift it into second gear the wheel

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.789 
shift it into second gear the wheel
should<00:03:40.180> turn<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.870> same<00:03:41.139> speed<00:03:41.620> as<00:03:41.769> the

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
should turn the same speed as the

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.910 
should turn the same speed as the
product<00:03:42.340> sprocket<00:03:42.909> and<00:03:43.329> if<00:03:44.139> I<00:03:44.230> shift<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.590> into

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
product sprocket and if I shift it into

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.970 
product sprocket and if I shift it into
first<00:03:45.159> gear<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.720> sprockets<00:03:47.260> move<00:03:47.470> faster

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
first gear the sprockets move faster

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.689 
first gear the sprockets move faster
than<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.250> wheel<00:03:48.430> in<00:03:49.329> which<00:03:49.510> case<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.930> does<00:03:50.699> so

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
than the wheel in which case it does so

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.220 
than the wheel in which case it does so
I'll<00:03:51.790> go<00:03:51.910> back<00:03:52.090> into<00:03:52.269> second<00:03:52.750> gear<00:03:52.959> just

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
I'll go back into second gear just

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.800 
I'll go back into second gear just
double-check<00:03:53.799> that<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.599> everything<00:03:55.599> looks

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
double-check that and everything looks

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.979 
double-check that and everything looks
good<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:57.000> now<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.060> can<00:03:58.269> go<00:03:58.359> ahead<00:03:58.389> just

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
good so now you can go ahead just

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.280 
good so now you can go ahead just
tighten<00:03:59.349> this<00:03:59.440> little<00:03:59.680> lock<00:03:59.859> nut<00:04:00.129> here<00:04:01.290> lock
