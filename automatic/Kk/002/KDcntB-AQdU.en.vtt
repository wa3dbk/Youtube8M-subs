00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:56.515
Next game is 'tail steal'! Like always, teams choose
which team to fight before knowing the game.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:01:01.320
M : You guys have to face each other. Green Team,
come here. Red Team go there.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.237
Green Team and Red Team thought they are becoming into one team

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:11.306
Instead of facing against each other,
Green and Red teams groups up.

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:26.727
Two team finally understands as they are designated into positions.

00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:32.030
A team wins if it takes other team's tails
or breaking other team's composition.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.333
Again, telling  the rules of the game is the hardest part of the game.

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:42.707

00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:26.542

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:39.596
The final match is Red vs Yellow.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:45.701
Yellow Team's Wolf catches the moment when Red Team is hiding the tail.

00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:58.034
As Wolf tells to his teammates, Yellow Team hides the tail.

00:02:58.034 --> 00:03:23.014
Two teams make a fast spinning windmill.

00:03:23.014 --> 00:03:38.049
As time goes, the speed decreases.

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:51.049
Yellow Team Sorry takes Red Team Faker's tail and wins the match.
