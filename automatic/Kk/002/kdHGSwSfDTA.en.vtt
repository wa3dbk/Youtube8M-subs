few random holes that are not going to
be<00:02:21.720> used<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.740> just<00:02:23.580> got<00:02:23.730> those<00:02:23.910> well<00:02:24.090> today<00:02:24.360> and

you can see the square patch on the left

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.160 
you can see the square patch on the left
and<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.210> one<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> right<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.720> don't<00:02:27.900> know

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and the one on the right I don't know

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.810 
and the one on the right I don't know
what<00:02:28.350> those<00:02:28.530> were<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.710> what<00:02:29.400> originally

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
what those were for what originally

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.190 
what those were for what originally
passed<00:02:30.030> through<00:02:30.240> there<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.570> we<00:02:31.050> no<00:02:31.170> longer

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
passed through there but we no longer

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.930 
passed through there but we no longer
need<00:02:31.650> them<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.400> there<00:02:32.580> were<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.910> few

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
need them and there were just a few

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.410 
need them and there were just a few
small<00:02:33.600> round<00:02:33.810> holes<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.970> plug<00:02:35.970> welded<00:02:36.270> as

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
small round holes that we plug welded as

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.200 
small round holes that we plug welded as
well<00:02:36.600> with<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> little<00:02:37.730> backing<00:02:38.730> plate<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
well with a little backing plate on the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.080 
well with a little backing plate on the
back<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.590> we'll<00:02:41.370> go<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:41.550> drive<00:02:41.730> these<00:02:41.850> down

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
back so we'll go and drive these down

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.450 
back so we'll go and drive these down
and<00:02:42.390> get<00:02:42.570> them<00:02:42.660> ready<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:43.080> some<00:02:43.170> filler<00:02:43.460> all

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
and get them ready for some filler all

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.100 
and get them ready for some filler all
right<00:02:44.640> well<00:02:44.850> we've<00:02:45.060> got<00:02:45.720> all<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.900> our<00:02:45.960> holes

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
right well we've got all of our holes

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.190 
right well we've got all of our holes
welded<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.130> come<00:02:47.430> down<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.750> got<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.050> first

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
welded up come down and I got the first

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.850 
welded up come down and I got the first
course<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.040> body<00:02:50.220> filler<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:52.740> know

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
course of body filler on and you know

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.500 
course of body filler on and you know
this<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.190> not<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.640> be<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> show<00:02:54.000> car<00:02:54.240> and

out some of the unevenness where we

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.949 
out some of the unevenness where we
loaded<00:03:05.160> up<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> patches<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.209> know<00:03:06.720> just

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
loaded up the patches and you know just

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.650 
loaded up the patches and you know just

this<00:03:10.920> back<00:03:11.250> here<00:03:11.520> because<00:03:12.050> with<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.140> engine

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
this back here because with the engine

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.350 
this back here because with the engine
in<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.560> car<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.100> all<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.430> turbo<00:03:14.730> stuff<00:03:15.060> and

all that it's almost not even visible so

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.070 
all that it's almost not even visible so
we're<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.950> using<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.550> little<00:03:20.670> bit<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:21.080> quantum

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
we're just using a little bit of quantum

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.960 
we're just using a little bit of quantum
one<00:03:22.760> one<00:03:23.760> coat<00:03:24.510> over<00:03:24.840> all<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.110> seams<00:03:25.350> and

one one coat over all the seams and

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.030 
one one coat over all the seams and
we'll<00:03:26.970> sand<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.390> down<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.810> put<00:03:28.680> some<00:03:28.830> primer

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
we'll sand it down and put some primer

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.300 
we'll sand it down and put some primer
on<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.280> feather<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.880> out<00:03:31.160> hopefully<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
on it feather it out hopefully the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.710 
on it feather it out hopefully the
quantum<00:03:32.640> one<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:32.940> not<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.330> be<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> problem

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
quantum one is not going to be a problem

access to and we've really seam sealed
it<00:03:41.280> up<00:03:41.400> good<00:03:41.610> every<00:03:42.120> seam<00:03:42.420> every<00:03:42.930> weld<00:03:43.230> spot

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
it up good every seam every weld spot

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.120 
it up good every seam every weld spot
will<00:03:43.950> get<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.400> good<00:03:45.530> sealing<00:03:46.530> up<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> seam

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
will get a good sealing up with a seam

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.949 
will get a good sealing up with a seam
sealer<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.610> then<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:50.510> scene<00:03:51.510> down<00:03:51.750> here

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
sealer and then this scene down here

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.340 
sealer and then this scene down here
that<00:03:52.050> goes<00:03:52.260> all<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.470> way<00:03:52.560> across<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:54.110> over<00:03:55.110> to

that goes all the way across and over to

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.770 
that goes all the way across and over to
there<00:03:55.560> we<00:03:55.769> would<00:03:55.950> welded<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.370> up<00:03:56.720> where<00:03:57.720> we

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
there we would welded that up where we

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.860 
there we would welded that up where we
put<00:03:57.989> toe<00:03:58.769> boards<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.330> we'll<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.540> use<00:04:00.690> some

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
put toe boards in we'll just use some

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.840 
put toe boards in we'll just use some
self<00:04:01.110> levelling<00:04:01.739> seam<00:04:01.980> sealer<00:04:02.220> down<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.640> low

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.189 
and and then sealer and base coat clear
coat<00:04:36.990> all<00:04:37.990> right<00:04:38.199> well<00:04:38.440> we've<00:04:39.960> had<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.050> put

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
coat all right well we've had to put

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.649 
coat all right well we've had to put
quite<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.530> bit<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.710> filler<00:04:41.919> on<00:04:42.099> this<00:04:42.250> thing<00:04:42.659> and

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
quite a bit of filler on this thing and

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.020 
quite a bit of filler on this thing and
probably<00:04:44.560> did<00:04:45.039> more<00:04:45.250> than<00:04:45.280> we<00:04:45.490> should<00:04:45.520> but

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
probably did more than we should but

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.980 
probably did more than we should but
it's<00:04:46.389> getting<00:04:46.690> there
