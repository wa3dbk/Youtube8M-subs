00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.940 
other other events and you know I've you
know<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:09.840> structure<00:01:10.140> was<00:01:10.380> much<00:01:10.590> better<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
know here my structure was much better I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.920 
know here my structure was much better I
decided<00:01:11.430> okay<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.330> know<00:01:12.840> Bev's<00:01:13.260> his<00:01:13.439> freestyle

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
decided okay I know Bev's his freestyle

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
decided okay I know Bev's his freestyle
but<00:01:15.930> maybe<00:01:16.409> he<00:01:16.590> will<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> couple<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> new

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
but maybe he will have a couple of new

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.820 
but maybe he will have a couple of new
tricks<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.360> had<00:01:19.049> roughly<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.500> mind<00:01:19.680> what<00:01:19.799> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
tricks so I had roughly in mind what I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.999 
tricks so I had roughly in mind what I
was<00:01:20.130> gonna<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.659> knew<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.290> left

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
was gonna do but I knew I left

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.910

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.760 
he looked like he'd just breezed through
everyone<00:02:42.960> else<00:02:43.080> he'd<00:02:43.350> done<00:02:43.500> some<00:02:43.650> amazing

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.610 
everyone else he'd done some amazing
tricks<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.940> think<00:02:45.240> your<00:02:45.750> technicality<00:02:46.470> in

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
tricks but I think your technicality in

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.220 
tricks but I think your technicality in
that<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.010> round<00:02:47.460> ground<00:02:48.450> him<00:02:48.630> down<00:02:48.660> where

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that in that round ground him down where

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.990 
that in that round ground him down where
he<00:02:49.260> couldn't<00:02:50.160> do<00:02:50.310> anything<00:02:50.520> else<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:50.970> they

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
he couldn't do anything else so they

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.700 
he couldn't do anything else so they
made<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.480> mistakes<00:02:51.840> then<00:02:52.110> gene<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.590> mean

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
made the mistakes then gene and I mean

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.080 
made the mistakes then gene and I mean
yeah<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:52.980> think<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.520> was<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> thing<00:02:53.910> with
