00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.930
 hello everyone is welcome on 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.030
 the nonsense of choquenet today I 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.210
 offers you to make the recipe for 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.290
 bones homemade burger buns and you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.060
 see that it's really very 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.250
 easy and that his request really very 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.480
 few ingredients left then the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.859
 first tip to make a good one 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.750
 burger is to buy yeast 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.550
 so fresh from baker's yeast 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.170
 and not the one that is dehydrated actually 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.740
 in small sachets that makes the whole 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.379
 difference 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.540
 so you're going to dissolve the yeast in 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.850
 warm milk and you'll leave it 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.129
 rest 5 minutes later in your 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.510
 big bowl of gold a robot you will put 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.000
 the flour the salt the sugar is added to it 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.920
 then water plus the mixture so of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680
 yeast that will have 5 minutes rest 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.020
 the milk is then added the egg and there 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.219
 you knead it all in with 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.680
 do you put the little hook at 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.329
 level of your robot you will knead 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 for a few minutes it takes 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.329
 really get something from list 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.460
 homogeneous must really be 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 mix well so here is after 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.910
 a few minutes that makes you a big one 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.580
 ball you off and at that time 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.899
 you will be able to incorporate the butter 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.520
 case the butter be careful he is at 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.479
 room temperature is not butter 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.490
 melted in the pan 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.220
 he really came out of the fridge there is a 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.810
 hour and so he is or fluffy so 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.280
 you add that butter and you go 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.920
 mix until it's really 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.360
 completely incorporate in the dough and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 when it's over you'll take 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.599
 a big bowl a big bowl finally a 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 container you will put oil 

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.470
 to prevent this paste from sticking to you 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 poured it in you then put a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.880
 plastic film and you will leave 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.429
 rest this dough for two hours 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.690
 therefore at room temperature 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.940
 after two hours of which you can 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.140
 see that it really inflates his 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.209
 glue even a little bit to the plastic 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 so you remove it you flour is 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.569
 your work plan you take out the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.739
 dough and you're going to knead it just two 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.080
 three minutes is really history of 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:57.030
 the gas die and not more than three minutes 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.500
 so now we're going to train so 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.349
 balls for the bones we cut you 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.640
 already for the first time in two years 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.959
 follows you take your first step 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.340
 you cut it in half you take the 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.229
 second will cut in half here you 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.959
 divide each time in half and so 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.819
 you get in the end eight little bones 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.640
 and you will see that these little bugs 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.660
 will become pretty big then we will 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.370
 take a big baking sheet 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.720
 you city â€‹â€‹and the bottom you are not 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.530
 obliged you can use if you 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.660
 want a sheet of paper 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.270
 greaseproof and so has it you 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.770
 spread them out your little steps so your like 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.660
 you made balls you go them 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.250
 place and you tap on the top 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.830
 slightly here to give them so 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.260
 this final form then we place a 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.150
 good clean towel dry on the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.500
 on it and let it go up for 1h30 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.270
 so there you can see that they have 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.060
 doubling in volume they really have their 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.800
 final shape so you place milk in 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.360
 done for gilding so on some 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.040
 I put sesame seeds on 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 others I put grated cheese you 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.550
 can put poppy seeds finally 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.470
 or even bursts of bacon that's like 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.770
 you then want to bake 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.240
 halfway up to 180 Â° for 25 minutes 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.010
 it is enough that the good ones are well 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.840
 golden on top that is well 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.850
 fluffy and if you want you can 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.650
 plant the blade of a small Kurdish finally 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.250
 or a knife and that must come out in 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.170
 do everything dry 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.880
 so here they are really at the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.500
 out of the oven they are all hot that 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.820
 feels super good so I 'll get it to you 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.370
 cut you go like that will be able to see you again 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.260
 inside the stake that gives it so 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.180
 baker's yeast really 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.400
 important because it smells but great 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.710
 good it gives texture and smell 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.790
 but just magic 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.530
 so here you can see 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.690
 inside so you have it's all 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.880
 me milk lamy and well ventilated it's 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.890
 just sublime so now so you 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.150

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.800

 here we are it's really something 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.660
 to do you can keep them 48 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.010
 hours in a small, well-sealed cloth 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.450
