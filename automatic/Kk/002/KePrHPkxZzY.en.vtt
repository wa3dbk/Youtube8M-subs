00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
in all of the last five games but no

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.100 
in all of the last five games but no
goal<00:01:05.780> will<00:01:05.960> be<00:01:06.110> more<00:01:06.380> valuable<00:01:06.590> than<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:08.110> so

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
goal will be more valuable than that so

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.700 
goal will be more valuable than that so
with<00:01:10.210> less<00:01:11.210> than<00:01:11.450> three<00:01:11.720> minutes<00:01:11.870> left<00:01:12.230> they

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
with less than three minutes left they

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.080 
with less than three minutes left they
look<00:01:13.010> as<00:01:13.130> if<00:01:13.160> they<00:01:13.280> are<00:01:13.460> going<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.700> get<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.850> point

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
look as if they are going to get a point

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.410 
look as if they are going to get a point
but<00:01:14.630> question<00:01:15.410> will<00:01:15.560> still<00:01:15.830> keep<00:01:16.250> running<00:01:16.670> and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
but question will still keep running and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.300
