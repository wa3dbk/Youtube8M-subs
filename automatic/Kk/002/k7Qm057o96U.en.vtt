00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
presenting from simple to complex it's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.690 
presenting from simple to complex it's
the<00:00:45.750> same<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> brushes<00:00:46.739> start<00:00:47.579> with

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the same way with the brushes start with

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.760 
the same way with the brushes start with
the<00:00:47.820> simple<00:00:48.210> stuff<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.530> number

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the simple stuff like we did in number

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
the simple stuff like we did in number
one<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.250> you'll<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.149> absolutely<00:00:51.600> no

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
one and you'll have absolutely no

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.810 
one and you'll have absolutely no
problem<00:00:52.230> reaching<00:00:52.800> where<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.280> are<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.640> in

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
problem reaching where we are now in

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.459 
problem reaching where we are now in
number<00:00:54.030> five<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:55.039> here<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.160> go

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
number five all right here we go

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.389 
number five all right here we go
balance<00:00:59.930> here<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.050> valid<00:01:01.500> pattern<00:01:01.859> number<00:01:02.010> one

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
balance here is valid pattern number one

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.340 
balance here is valid pattern number one
it's<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:03.870> want<00:01:04.170> any

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
it's for when you don't want any

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
it's for when you don't want any
subdivision<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> time<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> just

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
subdivision in the time when you just

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.890 
subdivision in the time when you just
want<00:01:06.479> quarter<00:01:06.960> notes<00:01:07.170> alright<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> basic

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
want quarter notes alright and the basic

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
want quarter notes alright and the basic
motion<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> instead<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:12.030> across

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
motion here is instead of going across

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.940 
motion here is instead of going across
the<00:01:12.689> drum<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.140> we've<00:01:13.320> done<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.560> previous

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the drum like we've done in previous

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.420 
the drum like we've done in previous
patterns<00:01:14.900> all<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.680> segments<00:01:17.280> one

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
patterns all right in segments one

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.600 
patterns all right in segments one
through<00:01:17.700> four<00:01:18.860> what<00:01:19.860> we're<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.400> now

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
through four what we're going to do now

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.429 
through four what we're going to do now
is<00:01:20.820> we're<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> go<00:01:21.450> around<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.170> drum

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
is we're going to go around the drum

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.990 
is we're going to go around the drum
like<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.600> call<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.810> Halfmoon<00:01:25.049> stroke

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
like this I call it a Halfmoon stroke

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.550 
like this I call it a Halfmoon stroke
because<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> looks<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:27.689> half-moons<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
because it looks like two half-moons and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.780 
because it looks like two half-moons and
it<00:01:29.220> sounds<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.970> one

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.630 

again<00:01:37.790> as<00:01:38.450> with<00:01:38.840> everything<00:01:39.110> else<00:01:39.350> we've<00:01:39.620> done

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
again as with everything else we've done

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.020 
again as with everything else we've done
okay

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:52.910 

the<00:01:45.030> Russians<00:01:45.450> don't<00:01:45.600> leave<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> head<00:01:51.920> very

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the Russians don't leave the head very

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.250 
the Russians don't leave the head very
so

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.770 

so<00:01:58.800> if<00:01:58.980> you're<00:01:59.160> playing<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.300> don't<00:02:00.540> want

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
so if you're playing and you don't want

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.180 
so if you're playing and you don't want
any<00:02:01.080> subdivision<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.030> quarter<00:02:03.510> note<00:02:04.190> you

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
any subdivision of the quarter note you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.760 
any subdivision of the quarter note you
just<00:02:05.220> want<00:02:05.610> straight<00:02:05.970> for<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:07.500> little

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
just want straight for this little

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.480 
just want straight for this little
pattern<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:09.380> now<00:02:10.380> what<00:02:10.860> if<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.220> want<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
pattern to that now what if you want to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.330 
pattern to that now what if you want to
subdivide<00:02:14.240> in<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.360> triplet<00:02:15.780> subtly<00:02:16.320> one<00:02:16.980> two

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
subdivide in a triplet subtly one two

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.070 
subdivide in a triplet subtly one two
three<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:18.060> two<00:02:18.090> three<00:02:18.420> one

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.810 

so<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.320> have<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.620> new<00:02:24.800> sticking<00:02:25.340> instead<00:02:25.700> of

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
so now we have a new sticking instead of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.110 
so now we have a new sticking instead of
right<00:02:26.030> left<00:02:27.020> right<00:02:27.370> left<00:02:28.570> we<00:02:29.570> have<00:02:29.750> right<00:02:30.260> left

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
right left right left we have right left

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.830 
right left right left we have right left
that's<00:02:32.120> right<00:02:32.920> watch<00:02:33.920> my<00:02:34.160> left<00:02:34.400> hand<00:02:34.730> it's<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
that's right watch my left hand it's the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.620 
that's right watch my left hand it's the
one<00:02:36.020> doing<00:02:36.320> all<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.590> stuff<00:02:36.890> left<00:02:37.850> that's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
one doing all the stuff left that's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.370 
one doing all the stuff left that's
right<00:02:40.030> right<00:02:41.030> now<00:02:41.510> compare<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.110> the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
right right now compare that to the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:56.000 
right right now compare that to the
standard<00:02:48.459> okay<00:02:49.600> okay<00:02:50.600> now<00:02:51.410> listen<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.740> this

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.010 

much<00:02:57.010> for

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.140 

and<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.560> have<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.860> options<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.430> adding<00:03:01.700> even

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.870 

so<00:03:38.960> we<00:03:39.110> realize<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.800> is<00:03:39.830> all<00:03:40.160> sorts<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.670> places

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
so we realize it is all sorts of places

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.600 
so we realize it is all sorts of places
within<00:03:41.450> these<00:03:41.780> two<00:03:42.110> half<00:03:42.410> circles<00:03:42.710> where<00:03:43.580> I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
within these two half circles where I

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:57.050 
within these two half circles where I
can<00:03:43.940> access

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.520 

that<00:03:58.060> was<00:03:58.269> rash<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.920> great<00:04:00.250> no<00:04:00.519> triplet<00:04:01.530> uses

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
that was rash and great no triplet uses

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.100 
that was rash and great no triplet uses
a<00:04:02.560> pill

yes<00:04:10.340> right

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.750 

and<00:04:19.199> all<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.620> sub<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:19.949> start<00:04:20.220> putting<00:04:20.400> stuff

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
and all the sub you start putting stuff

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.129 
and all the sub you start putting stuff
together<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.239> start<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.660> sound<00:04:21.840> real

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
together and start to sound real

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.390 
together and start to sound real
complicated<00:04:23.270> but<00:04:24.270> it's<00:04:24.419> not<00:04:25.130> just<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.220> matter

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
complicated but it's not just a matter

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.700 
complicated but it's not just a matter
of<00:04:26.550> learning<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:27.030> fan<00:04:27.360> press<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.229> fan<00:04:28.470> in

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
of learning the fan press the fan in

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.310 
of learning the fan press the fan in
different<00:04:29.010> places<00:04:29.250> within<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.760> pattern<00:04:30.320> now

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
different places within the pattern now

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.750 
different places within the pattern now
I<00:04:31.350> just<00:04:31.560> wanted<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.160> do<00:04:32.220> another<00:04:32.400> pattern

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
I just wanted to do another pattern

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.820 
I just wanted to do another pattern
right<00:04:33.660> right<00:04:34.260> left

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
right right left

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.740 
right right left
I<00:04:34.949> put<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.699> skip<00:04:35.970> feed<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:36.330> with<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.570> right

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
I put the skip feed in with the right

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.469 
I put the skip feed in with the right
hand<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.280> can<00:04:38.310> work<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:38.790> that<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.270> might

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
hand so you can work on that that might

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.500 
hand so you can work on that that might
be<00:04:39.600> more<00:04:39.750> comfortable<00:04:40.290> for<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.860> don't<00:04:40.949> know

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
be more comfortable for you I don't know

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.450 
be more comfortable for you I don't know
but<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.630> idea<00:04:42.780> is<00:04:43.139> folks<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:43.979> just<00:04:44.280> to

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
but the idea is folks is just to

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.250 
but the idea is folks is just to
experiment<00:04:45.889> go<00:04:46.889> with<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.760> flow<00:04:48.060> if<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.660> get

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
experiment go with the flow if you get

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.890 
experiment go with the flow if you get
an<00:04:49.380> idea<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:50.100> say<00:04:50.280> huh<00:04:50.490> well<00:04:51.240> that's<00:04:51.330> how<00:04:51.600> I<00:04:51.630> had

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
an idea to say huh well that's how I had

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.080 
an idea to say huh well that's how I had
said<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.500> do<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.740> this<00:04:52.919> way<00:04:53.160> but<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:53.580> want<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:54.000> do

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
said to do it this way but I want to do

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.010 
said to do it this way but I want to do
it<00:04:54.210> this<00:04:54.330> way<00:04:54.740> follow<00:04:56.090> your<00:04:57.090> idea<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.810> develop

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
it this way follow your idea and develop

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.290 
it this way follow your idea and develop
because<00:04:58.740> that's<00:04:58.919> what<00:04:59.130> this<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.340> for<00:04:59.490> is<00:05:00.060> to

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
because that's what this is for is to

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.100 
because that's what this is for is to
find<00:05:00.330> your<00:05:00.960> way<00:05:01.610> of<00:05:02.610> playing<00:05:03.030> with<00:05:03.930> this

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
find your way of playing with this

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:12.140 
find your way of playing with this
technique<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:06.660> your<00:05:06.840> own<00:05:06.990> way

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:21.909 

so<00:05:16.980> that<00:05:17.980> one

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:29.149 

yeah<00:05:22.370> I<00:05:22.400> lose<00:05:22.729> my<00:05:22.939> hands<00:05:23.360> on

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.189 

that's<00:05:29.369> the<00:05:29.520> key<00:05:29.729> then<00:05:30.599> give<00:05:30.809> you<00:05:30.869> the<00:05:30.989> sound

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
that's the key then give you the sound

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.709 
that's the key then give you the sound
that's<00:05:31.529> gonna<00:05:31.649> give<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:31.949> the<00:05:31.979> flow

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.760 

all<00:05:37.719> right<00:05:37.960> so<00:05:38.710> try<00:05:39.460> that<00:05:39.490> out<00:05:40.289> if<00:05:41.289> you<00:05:41.500> play<00:05:41.710> in

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
all right so try that out if you play in

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.920 
all right so try that out if you play in
your<00:05:41.830> stage<00:05:42.129> band<00:05:42.430> at<00:05:42.610> school<00:05:42.909> when<00:05:43.840> the

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
your stage band at school when the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.499 
your stage band at school when the
ballot<00:05:44.319> comes<00:05:44.590> up<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.979> major<00:05:45.310> director<00:05:46.030> with

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
ballot comes up a major director with

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.170 
ballot comes up a major director with
your<00:05:46.659> new<00:05:46.780> brush<00:05:47.050> pattern<00:05:47.500> he<00:05:48.490> will<00:05:48.699> be<00:05:48.879> amazed

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
your new brush pattern he will be amazed

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.520 
your new brush pattern he will be amazed
believe<00:05:49.569> me<00:05:49.750> okay

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530

thanks for listening thanks for watching
I<00:05:53.110> think<00:05:53.860> we're<00:05:53.979> gonna<00:05:54.069> do<00:05:54.340> maybe<00:05:54.699> one<00:05:55.180> more

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
I think we're gonna do maybe one more

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.439 
I think we're gonna do maybe one more
segment<00:05:56.080> on<00:05:56.169> brushes<00:05:56.729> which<00:05:57.729> will<00:05:57.879> be<00:05:57.969> segment

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
segment on brushes which will be segment

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.879 
segment on brushes which will be segment
six<00:05:59.039> so<00:06:00.039> one<00:06:00.969> two<00:06:01.240> three<00:06:01.270> four<00:06:01.659> five<00:06:02.229> get<00:06:02.710> that

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
six so one two three four five get that

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.629 
six so one two three four five get that
under<00:06:03.159> get<00:06:03.430> those<00:06:03.610> under<00:06:03.909> your<00:06:03.939> belt<00:06:04.270> and

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
under get those under your belt and

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.600 
under get those under your belt and
segment<00:06:06.639> six<00:06:06.879> and<00:06:07.090> maybe<00:06:07.419> even<00:06:07.629> segment<00:06:08.199> seven

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
segment six and maybe even segment seven

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.219
