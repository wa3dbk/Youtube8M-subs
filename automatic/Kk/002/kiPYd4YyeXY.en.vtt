00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
 Y 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.799
 or moves it towards minute to a kiss tome 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.320
 another video showing by Trump 059 8 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.630
 course a new game of dragon ball z 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.669
 the evolution let's start with the game 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.110
 it's okay for fish and quietly 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.439
 they want to play it I'll leave them in the link 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.080
 of the description and we start welcome 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.520
 to the training of BÃ©la 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.970
 fleck and payment pours 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.240
 perfect in transport stuff as well 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.300
 count twice I make you up by 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.300
 down 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.480
 x to attack 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.850
 ready now but transport and attack 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.969
 Let's see 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.490
 the pasta you can recharge your kit 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.980
 crush x to tighten 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.980
 now elevate all of you that is already a 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.820
 mental academic 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.980
 I am going to start 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.970
 story number 1 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.409
 young sigh I will record only up 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.409
 until it reaches 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.740
 until the third enemy and there finish 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.740
 the video 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.690
 well that was easy now let's start with 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.690
 the saga of bears 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 webber or adif 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.220
 I am root at this moment good the 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.630
 little game though simple and have the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.700
 Worst graphics in the world is very 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.620
 entertaining as it teaches you all the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.290
 sagas that you have had in which has been 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.820
 given in dragon ball z and those things up 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.620
 even with ma jin wook 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.520
 when you get that you have to go 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.750
 several times x to defeat him perfect 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.480
 now 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.480
 when what dies for the first time 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.229
 It will be simple because I already know how to conjugate xd 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.700
 I take time to learn to 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.880
 get used to the controls and those 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.880
 things 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.210
 give to me 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.310
 after radio I think that comes vegueta 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.360
 I think when you waste vegueta 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.430
 to spill 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.129
 for him 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.349
 Believe it first, they are very simple 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.329
 the enemies until the saga of 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.689
 freezer that starts to be very very but 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:35.000
 very complicated especially in defeat 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.920
 what is life what is the first 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.439
 war over where he says to put by 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.889
 example the first bar indicates your life 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:45.109
 the second bar indicates your kit for 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.909
 reload lend and to attack 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.189
 is always x if you want to make a 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.489
 super mechanically good is crushed the 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.489
 X 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.760
 you have bet on the x is good time 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.760
 you have crushed the X and loose 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.470
 the other I say will also be like this though 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.780
 also sometimes does not defend 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.540
 and well after this finish the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.180
 xd video so let's see 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.530
 and Colo is already in his faction 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.630
 Believe it or not, these are the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.910
 stronger enemies than attacked 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.240
 you are very fast 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.000
 dodging kamehameha is recharging 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.450
 they throw you to those are very dirty look at you 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.090
 he threw a shirt and he dodged it 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.489
 also when I say more powers are very 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.370
 agile to dodge 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.590
 I only think that from 10 only Latinas to one 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.050
 I'm going to make a mental bed 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.790
 every now and then he gives me the for the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.790
 boy who has a pick 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.190
 go dead 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.670
 perfect now comes the third 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.950
 after he defeats these four that 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.780
 remain 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.849
 finish the video because I think if you do not 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.020
 it was very long I do not think that you 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.670
 like 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.110
 I just wanted to show you what the 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.950
 super game that I found in 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.580
 Internet 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.580
 good 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.739
 everything is becoming more 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.970
 go dead 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.539
 As you can see they are fast and sometimes they are going to 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.320
 change for the better what makes you 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.320
 stresses too much 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.100
 and I think I win there we go 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.910
 vehicles manufactured not 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.910
 they do not have leaves 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.940
 Perfect I think this will finish 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.530
 record I hope you liked it and if 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.170
 they want more of this coming in the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.510
 comments and should not go through 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.400
 my facebook for me on my channel too 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.790
