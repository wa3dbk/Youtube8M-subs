show you how to use the polygon delete
edge<00:00:08.530> tool<00:00:09.070> I<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:10.809> a<00:00:10.839> polygon<00:00:11.379> cube<00:00:12.209> with<00:00:13.209> one

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
edge tool I have a polygon cube with one

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.430 
edge tool I have a polygon cube with one
to<00:00:14.469> three<00:00:14.879> edges<00:00:15.879> going<00:00:16.150> across<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.810> top<00:00:16.840> face

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
to three edges going across the top face

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.240 
to three edges going across the top face
of<00:00:17.740> that<00:00:18.100> cube<00:00:18.840> now<00:00:19.840> I<00:00:20.109> can<00:00:20.380> right<00:00:20.830> click<00:00:20.859> on

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
of that cube now I can right click on

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.279 
of that cube now I can right click on
the<00:00:21.369> cube<00:00:22.080> select<00:00:23.080> edge<00:00:23.349> and<00:00:24.630> then<00:00:25.630> hold<00:00:26.259> my

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
the cube select edge and then hold my

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.079 
the cube select edge and then hold my
shift<00:00:26.650> button<00:00:26.949> down<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.369> select<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.880> top

three edges and click the look my delete
button<00:00:31.960> on<00:00:32.020> my<00:00:32.080> keyboard<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.800> get<00:00:32.950> rid<00:00:33.070> of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
button on my keyboard to get rid of

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.569 
button on my keyboard to get rid of
those<00:00:33.220> edges<00:00:34.500> now<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.559> edges<00:00:35.950> are<00:00:36.070> gone<00:00:36.280> but

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
those edges now the edges are gone but

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.319 
those edges now the edges are gone but
there's<00:00:36.789> a<00:00:36.850> problem

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
there's a problem

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.709 
there's a problem
if<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.440> right-click<00:00:38.770> and<00:00:39.370> go<00:00:39.399> to<00:00:39.730> my<00:00:40.120> vertex

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
if I right-click and go to my vertex

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.510 
if I right-click and go to my vertex
selection<00:00:41.649> mode<00:00:43.170> you'll<00:00:44.170> see<00:00:44.469> that<00:00:44.860> there's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
selection mode you'll see that there's

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.270 
selection mode you'll see that there's
some<00:00:45.699> vertex<00:00:46.149> is<00:00:46.420> there<00:00:46.660> right<00:00:46.989> there<00:00:47.230> on<00:00:47.500> the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
some vertex is there right there on the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.470 
some vertex is there right there on the
outer<00:00:48.489> edge<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.320> that's<00:00:50.320> not<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.559> good<00:00:50.829> thing

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
outer edge and that's not a good thing

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.150 
outer edge and that's not a good thing
because<00:00:52.480> what<00:00:52.750> happens<00:00:53.079> is<00:00:53.320> let<00:00:53.739> me<00:00:53.769> go<00:00:53.949> back

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
because what happens is let me go back

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.299 
because what happens is let me go back
to<00:00:54.219> my<00:00:54.579> edge<00:00:54.820> mode<00:00:55.230> we've<00:00:56.230> got<00:00:56.469> an<00:00:56.710> edge<00:00:56.949> there

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
to my edge mode we've got an edge there

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.509 
to my edge mode we've got an edge there
an<00:00:57.550> edge<00:00:58.210> there<00:00:58.629> an<00:00:58.870> edge<00:00:59.230> there<00:00:59.620> an<00:00:59.890> edge

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
an edge there an edge there an edge

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.689 
an edge there an edge there an edge
there<00:01:00.760> so<00:01:00.789> we<00:01:01.000> have<00:01:01.149> four<00:01:01.449> edges<00:01:02.489> instead<00:01:03.489> of

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
there so we have four edges instead of

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.120 
there so we have four edges instead of
one<00:01:03.910> edge<00:01:04.090> and<00:01:04.360> that<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:05.470> cause<00:01:05.650> problems

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
one edge and that can cause problems

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.850 
one edge and that can cause problems
later<00:01:06.340> on<00:01:06.430> when<00:01:06.820> you're<00:01:06.909> doing<00:01:07.180> your<00:01:07.210> modeling

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
later on when you're doing your modeling

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.490 
later on when you're doing your modeling
so<00:01:08.860> instead<00:01:09.549> of<00:01:09.720> using<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:11.020> delete<00:01:11.470> button

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
so instead of using the delete button

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.469 
so instead of using the delete button
when<00:01:12.070> you're<00:01:12.189> deleting<00:01:12.520> edges<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:13.090> better

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
when you're deleting edges a better

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.950 
when you're deleting edges a better
method<00:01:13.990> is<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.830> use<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.189> delete<00:01:15.549> edge<00:01:15.759> tool<00:01:16.420> so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
method is to use the delete edge tool so

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.730 
method is to use the delete edge tool so
let<00:01:17.110> me<00:01:17.229> undo

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.210 

okay<00:01:24.490> I'm<00:01:25.150> going<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.690> go<00:01:26.470> back<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.740> my<00:01:26.890> right

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
okay I'm going to go back to my right

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.800 
okay I'm going to go back to my right
click<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.640> select<00:01:27.729> ads<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.360> go<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.510> my<00:01:28.659> edge

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
click and select ads to go to my edge

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.010 
click and select ads to go to my edge
selection<00:01:29.350> mode<00:01:29.530> I'm<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.180> select<00:01:31.810> all

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
selection mode I'm going to select all

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.540 
selection mode I'm going to select all
through<00:01:32.380> those<00:01:32.500> edges<00:01:32.830> again<00:01:33.070> by<00:01:33.280> holding

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
through those edges again by holding

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.910 
through those edges again by holding
down<00:01:33.580> my<00:01:33.700> shift<00:01:33.850> button<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.680> now<00:01:35.680> I'm<00:01:35.770> going

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
down my shift button and now I'm going

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.340 
down my shift button and now I'm going
to<00:01:36.010> go<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.250> my<00:01:36.520> edit<00:01:36.670> mesh'<00:01:36.970> menu<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:37.509> I'm

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
to go to my edit mesh' menu and I'm

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.490 
to go to my edit mesh' menu and I'm
going<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.530> look<00:01:38.650> for<00:01:39.070> delete<00:01:39.880> edge<00:01:40.500> slash

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
going to look for delete edge slash

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
going to look for delete edge slash
vertex<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:45.490> if<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:45.909> go<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.180> vertex<00:01:47.490> mode

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
vertex now if I go to vertex mode

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.410 
vertex now if I go to vertex mode
there's<00:01:49.899> no<00:01:50.200> more<00:01:50.560> vertices<00:01:50.950> on<00:01:51.640> any<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.330> those

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
there's no more vertices on any of those

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.170 
there's no more vertices on any of those
edges<00:01:52.840> now<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.830> if<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.040> go<00:01:54.220> back<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.820> my<00:01:54.850> edge

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
edges now so if I go back to my edge

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.550 
edges now so if I go back to my edge
mode<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:57.789> can<00:01:57.910> see<00:01:58.090> it's<00:01:58.240> one<00:01:58.619> solid<00:01:59.619> edge<00:01:59.950> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
mode you can see it's one solid edge and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.840 
mode you can see it's one solid edge and
that<00:02:02.560> includes<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.250> delete<00:02:03.729> edge<00:02:03.940> tutorial
