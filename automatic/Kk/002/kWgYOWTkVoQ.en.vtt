00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.540
 how to improve the sun graphics of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.059
 sky and water the flight simulator x 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.130

 tell you that the improvement is not spectacular 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.970
 simply because it improves something is worth the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.160

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.820
 the same folder as the textures of the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.460
 microsoft microsoft flight simulator x 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.800

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.620
 the archives although good once done 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.900

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.650
 with what good last we are going to come 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.740

 is now what we have to do 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.170
 will install the water configurator this 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.150
 is the only program or the only thing 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.610
 requires a previous installation that 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.300
 let's go to the folder and here we go 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.910
 to have 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.950
 an excel point that is called next 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.550
 editor water configurator with that 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.750

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.930
 first thing before doing anything what 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.090
 we will have to do will be to come to moore 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.389

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:01.220
 sorry as the forms that you 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.690
