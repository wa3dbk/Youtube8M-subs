think you'll see the intangibles that

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.600

were<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.620> taken<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> Holiday<00:00:50.489> Bowl

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
were really taken from the Holiday Bowl

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.549

the<00:00:50.760> confidence<00:00:51.210> factor<00:00:51.390> across<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> offense

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the confidence factor across the offense

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
the confidence factor across the offense
especially<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.219> Davis<00:00:53.520> Webb<00:00:53.730> you'll<00:00:54.210> see

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
especially with Davis Webb you'll see

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
especially with Davis Webb you'll see
that<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.170> pay<00:00:55.469> off<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.340> season<00:00:56.879> as

you will see depth and just experience

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
you will see depth and just experience
really<00:01:21.030> paying<00:01:21.330> off<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.810> both<00:01:22.049> sides<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
really paying off on both sides of the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.190

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the pads on play someone different get

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.740 
the pads on play someone different get
off<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.610> practice<00:03:17.000> field<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.450> on<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.720> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
off the practice field and on to the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.970 
off the practice field and on to the
game<00:03:17.989> field<00:03:18.260> so<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:18.709> going<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:18.860> be

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
game field so it's going to be

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.430 
game field so it's going to be
interesting<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.489> see<00:03:19.840> against<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.930> team<00:03:21.170> who

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
interesting to see against a team who

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.590 
interesting to see against a team who
has<00:03:21.950> one<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.430> best<00:03:22.580> wide<00:03:22.790> receiving<00:03:23.209> cores

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
has one of the best wide receiving cores

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.590 
has one of the best wide receiving cores
in<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.959> FCS<00:03:24.350> program<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:26.000> think

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
in the FCS program so it I think

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.940 
in the FCS program so it I think
Saturday<00:03:26.780> will<00:03:27.080> be<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.200> good<00:03:27.350> test<00:03:27.410> for<00:03:27.709> what's

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950

the this game week they've done really
good<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.390> think<00:04:40.720> they're<00:04:40.930> really<00:04:41.020> excited

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350

really<00:04:41.710> gelling<00:04:41.980> together<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.640> think<00:04:42.880> last

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
really gelling together and I think last

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.700 
really gelling together and I think last
year<00:04:43.210> office<00:04:43.600> la<00:04:43.750> wasn't<00:04:44.050> really<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.320> closest

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
year office la wasn't really the closest

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.110 
year office la wasn't really the closest
group<00:04:44.920> on<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.100> team<00:04:45.310> but<00:04:45.490> I<00:04:45.550> feel<00:04:45.730> like<00:04:45.880> if<00:04:46.060> you

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120
