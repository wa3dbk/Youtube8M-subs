00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
staying here for a little bit kind of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.179 
staying here for a little bit kind of
hoping<00:01:35.900> that<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.259> might<00:01:36.470> encourage<00:01:36.860> him<00:01:37.100> to

hoping that that might encourage him to

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.530 
hoping that that might encourage him to
just<00:01:37.460> kind<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.790> um<00:01:38.030> stay<00:01:38.990> at<00:01:39.049> a<00:01:39.140> certain<00:01:39.290> path

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
just kind of um stay at a certain path

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.520 
just kind of um stay at a certain path
because<00:01:41.540> that's<00:01:41.750> what<00:01:41.960> happens<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.290> lot<00:01:42.380> of

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
because that's what happens a lot of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.950 
because that's what happens a lot of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.980 
times and if you stay in any stationary
location<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.940> enemy<00:01:47.210> might<00:01:47.420> fall<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:47.720> suit

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.349 
it now it's weird his head actually
camouflaged<00:02:57.680> into<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.069> background<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:59.269> I

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
camouflaged into the background and I

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.809 
camouflaged into the background and I
didn't<00:02:59.599> notice<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.340> his<00:03:01.340> head<00:03:01.609> actually

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
didn't notice that his head actually

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.670 
didn't notice that his head actually
camouflaged<00:03:02.480> into<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.959> background<00:03:03.439> and

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
camouflaged into the background and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.770 
camouflaged into the background and
because<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.159> that<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.340> didn't<00:03:04.639> see<00:03:04.849> him<00:03:04.939> totally

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780
