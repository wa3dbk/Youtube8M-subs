and for the environment and it has to be
cheaper<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.949> example<00:01:01.949> here's<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.760> water

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
cheaper for example here's a water

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.710 
cheaper for example here's a water
treatment<00:01:03.449> plant<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.439> costs<00:01:04.920> money<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.720> here

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
treatment plant it costs money and here

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.020 
treatment plant it costs money and here
is<00:01:06.840> household<00:01:07.320> waste<00:01:07.670> sending<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
dump costs money and generates methane

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.990 
dump costs money and generates methane
that<00:01:12.869> damages<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:13.500> climate<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.760> dump

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that damages our climate if we dump

costs money a wind generator produces
electricity<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.799> need<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> all

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
electricity but you need to put it all

tours<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.750> are<00:01:36.900> expensive<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.740> ugly<00:01:39.560> we

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
tours which are expensive and ugly we

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
tours which are expensive and ugly we
simply<00:01:40.829> put<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> vertical<00:01:41.790> wind<00:01:42.030> turbine

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630

here<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.480> a<00:01:54.510> solar<00:01:54.900> panel<00:01:55.230> it<00:01:55.740> works<00:01:56.160> on<00:01:56.370> both

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
here is a solar panel it works on both

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.380 
here is a solar panel it works on both
sides<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.500> optics<00:01:59.040> concentrate<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.120> send

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
sides so if optics concentrate and send

the sunshine to the bottom two we make

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.480 
the sunshine to the bottom two we make
four<00:02:03.360> times<00:02:03.690> more<00:02:03.870> electricity<00:02:04.470> with<00:02:05.220> three

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
times less material the chamber made

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.870 
times less material the chamber made
from<00:02:08.910> recycled<00:02:09.510> plastic<00:02:09.560> gets<00:02:10.560> home<00:02:10.880> now

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
from recycled plastic gets home now

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.420

Solar<00:02:12.600> also<00:02:13.260> makes<00:02:13.500> heating<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.100> hot<00:02:14.370> water

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
Solar also makes heating and hot water

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.290 
Solar also makes heating and hot water
all<00:02:15.090> at<00:02:15.150> once<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.980> cheap<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.730> place<00:02:18.060> these

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
all at once and cheap we place these

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.560 
all at once and cheap we place these
panels<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:19.050> landfills<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.520> land<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.090> no<00:02:21.300> use

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
panels on landfills so land of no use

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.230 
panels on landfills so land of no use
now<00:02:21.840> gives<00:02:22.320> us<00:02:22.500> energy<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.240> makes<00:02:24.240> money

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
now gives us energy and makes money

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.390 
now gives us energy and makes money
these<00:02:27.240> are<00:02:27.480> not<00:02:27.510> only<00:02:27.900> three<00:02:28.200> good<00:02:28.380> ideas<00:02:28.890> each

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
these are not only three good ideas each

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.610 
these are not only three good ideas each
one<00:02:29.820> has<00:02:30.030> been<00:02:30.240> implemented<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.959> these

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
one has been implemented and these

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.490 
one has been implemented and these
sources<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.160> electricity<00:02:32.610> art<00:02:33.060> cheap<00:02:33.510> so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
sources of electricity art cheap so
