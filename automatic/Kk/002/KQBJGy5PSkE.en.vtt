00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:25.199
 the tite wanted to understand a little better 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.240
 this matter because we should 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.519
 worry so much and not waste the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.500
 electricity is a 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.570
 form of energy generated from 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.450
 other sources used to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 generating it comes from nature if we abuse 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 natural resources 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.230
 we run the risk of exhausting the sources and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.620
 pt they did not always care in our 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.620
 environment 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:01:09.750
 Come and I'll show you that the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.680
 fastest Belgian title 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.680
 Let's go out for a walk. 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 ah 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.240
 electricity is generated from 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.070
 renewable and non-renewable sources 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.070
 renewable sources are those that can 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.340
 short-term response, for example 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.590
 winds and sunlight biomass 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.049
 water because vegetables can be 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.500
 can be planted again and water can 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.520
 its natural cycle after being used 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.520
 sources was targeted 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.880
 non - renewable resources are those 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.340
 with nature takes a long time 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.450
 to replenish the stock with coal 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.670
 mineral oil or its replacement only 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.489
 occurs in millions of years 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.830
 in addition, electricity production 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.760
 may have negative impacts on the environment 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.830
 environment 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.440
 the burning of some fuels to 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.840
 produce electricity for example the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.060
 increase in carbon dioxide emissions 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.950
 atmosphere is contributing to the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.430
 climate change and heating 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.430
 also known as the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.430
 greenhouse 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.630
 the kick 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:42.270
 I tested on what happens with the new 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:45.150
 The atmosphere makes people come here and see 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.730
 how to pollute the environment is bad then 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.010
 It's cool to only use what we need. 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.530
 without waste because these impacts 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.360
 environmental impacts adversely affect 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:01.850
 everyone's life 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.850
 sure what happened 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.180
 I'm thinking about my little brother who is 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.550
 only a baby 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.160
 if we continue to spend the 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.370
 natural resources that way. 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.930
 see in the dirty and polluted world and this is not 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.120
 nothing responsible is anything but sustainable 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.280
 what do you think of introducing the concept of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.530
 sustainability 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720
 maybe your little brother does not suffer yet 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.450
 but the quality of life of the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.580
 future generations will surely be 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.810
 affected and skeptical said the test is taboo 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.810
 let's focus 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.690
 If the pussy-nosed what I am 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.550
 doing without waste we did it 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.500
 china talk to you 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.360
 I'm not interested in killing you. 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.310
 Tell children if they will not miss 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.310
 What is going on here? she said. 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:13.440
 what could and rap on christmas 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.320
 default is exit 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.280
 This is true for you, too. 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.040
 they knew that the waste of energy is 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.950
 depleting national land resources 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.310
 And what do we have to do with it all? 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.160
 but they spend energy without you 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.040
 is very old equipment when 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.070
 nor are we seeing you are more 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:43.169
 chances for elections during the day and 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.990
 come back will be dominated you leave a 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.690
 electric shower ricardo when neither 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.630
 they are taking a shower this is a big 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.440
 waste looking here city and 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.570
 Water 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.669
 but I'd take bath later I 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.700
 I like my hot water 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:04.050
 if you think electricity is gaining access 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.110
 to the comfort of taking a shower 21 to 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.580
 enjoy one was summed up from the air 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.539
 when using machines that 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.900
 makes our life easier but it's cool to use 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.900
 resources with responsibility and 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.789
 brother to put the resources and the 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.530
 future generations says this is 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.530
 sustainable development 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.360
 so it means that my son is going 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.780
 to suffer the consequences of what I do 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.620
 today this is it but I had not thought 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.170
 This is 2 is but I do not want my 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.710
 son to suffer in the future and I did 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.630
 she will do too 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.270
 we are going to change our habits and not 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.040
 let's waste more energy this 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.360
 let's use the energy of form 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.120
 sustainable self-promotion 1 x technique 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.120
 will use the resources of the planet 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.070
 must be done carefully today 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.630
 not to listen to natural resources 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.520
 of future generations 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.860
 some of these features are already 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.950
 such as contamination of the 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.440
 water from the air and men but changing the 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.260
 model of consumption that we have today. 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.510
 change the history of our planet then 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.590
 I can go back to my non world already 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.750
 wait 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.890
 We're going to change but we need to educate. 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.350
 our neighbor he has a cato ram 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.050
 these connections damage the 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:41.040
 distribution 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.220
 for the other consumers still places 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:53.690
 the mines of the risk inspection have a 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:53.690
 new mission will continue the people 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:05.330
