00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:18.869
 but they won 16 56 was home was more 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.680
 easy for the nautical and if this map was 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.260
 mirages we played 1.6 and use the other 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.359
 The team has three players as we have 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.310
 two of the models came to team us 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.790
 we saw you soon entered step I do not know 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.890
 if it was the case of malls and this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 map not only existed so it took 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.090
 account of good guys type guys is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.879
 completely new 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.739
 Canuto did not take coca to win more 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.579
 car races then press 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.200
 quality by the experiences then 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.539
 It is expected a game you already know you will find 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.489
 not be able to pay and thus until the end 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.920
 who has just been arrested, we also support the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.109
 difficult team and deplored the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.969
 favorite to win the turn to the game 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.000
 also did not forget in the same way before 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.280
 65 is a heavy defeat but we know how 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.020
 we have said so many people know that to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.670
 It failed at the time to do things 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.010
 until the next game tomorrow and I think 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 we managed to improve and get back to 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.210
 still achieve a good result for a 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.750
 The objective then analyzed always ran 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.799
 bad 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.390
 - more companies continue on the farm 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.310
 today the rest of the day and the same morning 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.840
 before the next game we'll see what 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.799
 take'll talk about it 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.570
 Let's try the most of the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.460
 gaming finances are avoided and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.700
 able to push hard and then give 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.130
 back over how much with such 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.770
 goal so far has always been the maximum 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.470
 top plates and the benefits that are the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 who buy from detran merit but ours 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.200
 goal is always the maximum 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.490
 we know that promptly some 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.079
 difficulties to our team there is 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.340
 always a while but now two 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.560
 Recent changes join players 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.770
 It's important he was very kind. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.409
 and with the put options even in order to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 get help and more movies by 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.189
 have your two stories have on your twin 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.890
 the more because we do not have that 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.450
 that the 1.6 new things that 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.690
 let's say mirage will play with many 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.250
 and make two partners and is the new 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.080
 using the same era soon will 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.019
 exposing this was more complicated for 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.880
 we are in the world already indicates 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.980
 do not feel old names 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.810
 of teams at international level as is 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.760
 that you share the same space does not 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.650
 has good but we also have players who 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.540
 already had tires doing even Jesus that 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.310
 she was once an outsider for example the ChÃ¡vez 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.830
 This item has already been handed in 12 times 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.470
 I'm not mistaken, the smell also tore 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.510
 as several players so it already has 30 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.819
 victories but of course all this does not 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.069
 Enrico happen is very emphatic ship 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.069
 good and it will be good we also have gracie
