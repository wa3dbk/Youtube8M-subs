okay<00:00:04.160> we're<00:00:04.400> actually<00:00:04.550> endorsed<00:00:05.300> now<00:00:05.450> I've

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
okay we're actually endorsed now I've

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.690 
okay we're actually endorsed now I've
been<00:00:05.930> keeping<00:00:06.319> these<00:00:06.500> cuttings<00:00:06.920> in<00:00:07.370> this

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
been keeping these cuttings in this

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.610 
been keeping these cuttings in this
corner<00:00:08.029> of<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:08.149> house<00:00:08.420> you<00:00:08.990> know<00:00:09.020> away<00:00:09.410> from

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
corner of the house you know away from

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.879 
corner of the house you know away from
the<00:00:09.710> heater<00:00:10.330> for<00:00:11.330> over<00:00:11.690> months<00:00:12.139> and<00:00:12.349> I<00:00:12.860> just

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
the heater for over months and I just

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.450 
the heater for over months and I just
water<00:00:13.250> once<00:00:13.610> a<00:00:14.000> week<00:00:14.259> look<00:00:15.279> it's<00:00:16.279> already

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
water once a week look it's already

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.060 
water once a week look it's already
growing<00:00:16.939> now<00:00:17.330> what's<00:00:17.509> pretty<00:00:17.750> fast<00:00:18.050> you<00:00:18.529> can

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
growing now what's pretty fast you can

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.069 
growing now what's pretty fast you can
see<00:00:19.279> that<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:19.579> skinnier<00:00:20.090> cutting<00:00:20.689> a<00:00:20.810> tree

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:21.079 
see that the skinnier cutting a tree

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.260 
see that the skinnier cutting a tree
grew<00:00:21.890> faster<00:00:22.460> this<00:00:22.669> makes<00:00:22.880> sense<00:00:23.090> because

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
grew faster this makes sense because

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.929 
grew faster this makes sense because
this<00:00:23.599> being<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.470> end<00:00:24.680> of<00:00:24.860> the<00:00:24.950> branch<00:00:25.250> is

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
this being the end of the branch is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.389 
this being the end of the branch is
where<00:00:26.329> it<00:00:26.480> is<00:00:27.020> more<00:00:27.290> dominant<00:00:27.800> it<00:00:28.009> gets<00:00:28.189> more

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
where it is more dominant it gets more

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.540 
where it is more dominant it gets more
it's<00:00:29.029> more<00:00:29.529> stronger<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:30.770> that's<00:00:31.040> why<00:00:31.220> all<00:00:31.250> the

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
it's more stronger so that's why all the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.610 
it's more stronger so that's why all the
cuttings<00:00:31.939> there<00:00:32.599> come<00:00:32.840> in<00:00:32.960> taking<00:00:33.380> from<00:00:33.500> the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
cuttings there come in taking from the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.160 
cuttings there come in taking from the
tip<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.160> branch<00:00:34.340> that's<00:00:34.910> where<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.390> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
tip of the branch that's where the the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.320 
tip of the branch that's where the the
life<00:00:36.380> is<00:00:36.680> strongest<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.670> we<00:00:37.850> can<00:00:38.000> see<00:00:38.180> is

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
life is strongest and we can see is

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.190 
life is strongest and we can see is
growing<00:00:38.720> fast<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:40.030> on<00:00:41.030> this<00:00:41.300> side<00:00:41.630> is<00:00:41.870> already

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
growing fast and on this side is already

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.610 
growing fast and on this side is already
some<00:00:42.440> buds<00:00:42.710> start<00:00:43.100> coming<00:00:43.400> out<00:00:43.580> you<00:00:44.090> know<00:00:44.120> I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
some buds start coming out you know I

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.830 
some buds start coming out you know I
wouldn't<00:00:45.620> celebrate<00:00:45.860> yet<00:00:46.730> because<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:47.690> just

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
wouldn't celebrate yet because this just

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.319 
wouldn't celebrate yet because this just
means<00:00:48.079> that<00:00:48.260> there's<00:00:49.100> still<00:00:49.490> some<00:00:49.700> energy<00:00:50.120> in

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
means that there's still some energy in

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.080 
means that there's still some energy in
these<00:00:50.510> branches<00:00:51.170> that<00:00:51.980> was<00:00:52.100> enough<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.790> to

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
these branches that was enough to to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.350 
these branches that was enough to to
supply<00:00:53.450> to<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.840> buds<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.800> grow<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.430> mean<00:00:55.850> this

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
supply to the buds to grow I mean this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.450 
supply to the buds to grow I mean this
doesn't<00:00:56.570> mean<00:00:56.810> that<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.829> plan<00:00:58.040> will<00:00:58.160> survive

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
doesn't mean that the plan will survive

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.180 
doesn't mean that the plan will survive
you<00:00:58.880> know<00:00:59.000> this<00:00:59.780> just<00:00:59.930> means<00:01:00.200> that<00:01:00.470> now<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
you know this just means that now the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.760 
you know this just means that now the
roots<00:01:01.430> has<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:02.390> catch<00:01:02.570> up<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.050> roots<00:01:03.500> has<00:01:03.649> to

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
roots has to catch up the roots has to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.850 
roots has to catch up the roots has to
start<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.129> grow<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:05.049> start<00:01:06.049> to<00:01:06.350> catch<00:01:06.590> up

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
start to grow and start to catch up

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.610 
start to grow and start to catch up
because<00:01:07.420> there<00:01:08.420> been<00:01:08.570> cases<00:01:08.750> in<00:01:09.260> my

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
because there been cases in my

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.260 
because there been cases in my
experience<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.280> all<00:01:10.490> my<00:01:10.610> cuttings<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
experience that all my cuttings the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.760 
experience that all my cuttings the
leaves<00:01:11.479> are<00:01:11.720> going<00:01:12.020> very<00:01:12.170> well

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
leaves are going very well

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.100 
leaves are going very well
and<00:01:12.860> then<00:01:13.370> all<00:01:13.520> of<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.670> sudden<00:01:13.940> he<00:01:14.000> died<00:01:14.300> because

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
and then all of a sudden he died because

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.500 
and then all of a sudden he died because
you<00:01:15.860> know<00:01:16.010> all<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.370> reserve<00:01:16.760> energy<00:01:17.300> was<00:01:17.479> used

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
you know all the reserve energy was used

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.380 
you know all the reserve energy was used
and<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.860> root<00:01:19.070> did<00:01:19.250> not<00:01:19.490> have<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.909> chance<00:01:19.940> to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
and the root did not have the chance to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.840 
and the root did not have the chance to
grow<00:01:20.620> therefore<00:01:21.620> you<00:01:21.710> know<00:01:21.799> no<00:01:21.979> new<00:01:22.220> no<00:01:22.610> new

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
grow therefore you know no new no new

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.500 
grow therefore you know no new no new
food<00:01:23.180> no<00:01:23.450> new<00:01:23.630> energy<00:01:23.810> was<00:01:24.500> produced<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.510> the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
food no new energy was produced and the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.469 
food no new energy was produced and the
cutting<00:01:26.840> didn't<00:01:27.680> survive<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.400> I<00:01:28.610> hope<00:01:29.150> this<00:01:29.299> is

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
cutting didn't survive so I hope this is

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.030 
cutting didn't survive so I hope this is
not<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.659> case<00:01:29.900> but<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.260> just<00:01:30.530> want<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.740> warn<00:01:30.920> you

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
not the case but I just want to warn you

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.420 
not the case but I just want to warn you
that<00:01:31.130> don't<00:01:31.810> don't<00:01:32.810> celebrate<00:01:33.140> yet<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.190> next

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
that don't don't celebrate yet the next

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.070 
that don't don't celebrate yet the next
step<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.670> want<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.909> do<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.330> move<00:01:35.510> this<00:01:35.750> pot

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
step I want to do is to move this pot

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.789 
step I want to do is to move this pot
outside<00:01:36.680> now<00:01:37.570> still<00:01:38.570> get<00:01:38.720> pretty<00:01:38.900> :<00:01:39.200> nice<00:01:39.440> so

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
outside now still get pretty : nice so

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.859 
outside now still get pretty : nice so
I'm<00:01:39.950> gonna<00:01:40.070> keep<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.520> outside<00:01:40.940> close<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
I'm gonna keep it outside close to the

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.630 
I'm gonna keep it outside close to the
house<00:01:42.369> away<00:01:43.369> from<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.790> wind<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.659> at<00:01:44.750> least<00:01:44.900> the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
house away from the wind so at least the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.770 
house away from the wind so at least the
you<00:01:46.640> can<00:01:46.820> get<00:01:46.939> some<00:01:47.090> indirect<00:01:47.570> sunlight

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
you can get some indirect sunlight

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.440 
you can get some indirect sunlight
because<00:01:48.500> now<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:48.799> has<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.369> new<00:01:49.580> growth<00:01:49.880> it's

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
because now that has the new growth it's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.450 
because now that has the new growth it's
gonna<00:01:50.750> be<00:01:50.869> some<00:01:51.080> sunlight<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:52.040> start<00:01:52.310> doing

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
gonna be some sunlight to start doing

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.760 
gonna be some sunlight to start doing
photosynthesis<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.869> star<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.680> know

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
photosynthesis and star you know

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.590 
photosynthesis and star you know
producing<00:01:55.070> food<00:01:57.729> okay<00:01:58.729> I'm<00:01:58.909> moving<00:01:59.060> out<00:01:59.299> doors

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
producing food okay I'm moving out doors

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.539 
producing food okay I'm moving out doors
in<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.049> shade<00:02:01.900> now<00:02:02.900> it's<00:02:03.080> early<00:02:03.549> February

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
in the shade now it's early February

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.780 
in the shade now it's early February
February<00:02:04.850> 9<00:02:05.810> actually<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.860> let's<00:02:07.460> see<00:02:07.640> what

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
February 9 actually and let's see what

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.199 
February 9 actually and let's see what
happens<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:09.110> couple<00:02:09.470> more<00:02:09.619> weeks

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.039 

okay<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.469> two<00:02:13.709> months<00:02:13.890> after<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:15.019> place<00:02:16.019> a

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
okay this is two months after I place a

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.470 
okay this is two months after I place a
cutting<00:02:16.560> into<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.189> part<00:02:19.969> it's<00:02:20.969> been<00:02:21.060> good<00:02:21.239> I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
cutting into this part it's been good I

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.809 
cutting into this part it's been good I
have<00:02:21.719> to<00:02:21.840> say<00:02:23.900> there<00:02:24.900> are<00:02:24.959> some<00:02:25.109> flowers<00:02:26.040> you

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
have to say there are some flowers you

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.280 
have to say there are some flowers you
notice<00:02:27.120> all<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.359> flower<00:02:27.599> buds<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.989> came

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
notice all the flower buds that came

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.530 
notice all the flower buds that came
with<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> cutting<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.700> should<00:02:29.730> remove<00:02:30.150> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
with the cutting you should remove it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.979 
with the cutting you should remove it
they're<00:02:30.989> just<00:02:31.170> gonna<00:02:31.290> spend<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.829> energy<00:02:32.989> of

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
they're just gonna spend the energy of

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.819 
they're just gonna spend the energy of
the<00:02:34.200> tree<00:02:38.659> our<00:02:39.659> overall<00:02:40.079> tree<00:02:40.409> is<00:02:40.469> doing<00:02:40.709> good

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
the tree our overall tree is doing good

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.670 
the tree our overall tree is doing good
has<00:02:41.340> some<00:02:41.519> concerns<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.420> least<00:02:42.659> the<00:02:43.260> tip<00:02:43.530> of

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
has some concerns the least the tip of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.569 
has some concerns the least the tip of
the<00:02:43.799> leaves<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.250> little<00:02:44.459> bit<00:02:44.579> right<00:02:46.970> no<00:02:49.459> I'm<00:02:50.459> not

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
the leaves a little bit right no I'm not

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.280 
the leaves a little bit right no I'm not
sure<00:02:50.790> why<00:02:50.939> maybe<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.359> roots<00:02:51.569> are<00:02:51.750> not<00:02:51.930> fully

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
sure why maybe the roots are not fully

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.709 
sure why maybe the roots are not fully
functional<00:02:53.099> yet<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.840> we'll<00:02:58.049> wait<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.349> see

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
functional yet but we'll wait and see

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.440 
functional yet but we'll wait and see
okay<00:03:00.719> now<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.139> early<00:03:01.620> April<00:03:02.159> is<00:03:02.519> roughly<00:03:03.180> three

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
okay now is early April is roughly three

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.589 
okay now is early April is roughly three
months<00:03:03.599> after<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.139> made<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.620> cuttings<00:03:05.129> and

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
months after I made the cuttings and

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.000 
months after I made the cuttings and
tried<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.629> propagate<00:03:07.500> this

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
tried to propagate this

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.890 
tried to propagate this
oh<00:03:08.780> there's<00:03:10.819> willows<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.389> there's<00:03:12.750> three

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
oh there's willows and there's three

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.770 
oh there's willows and there's three
well<00:03:13.109> I<00:03:13.349> mean<00:03:13.680> it's<00:03:13.980> growing<00:03:14.219> and<00:03:14.879> but<00:03:15.389> as<00:03:15.629> you

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
well I mean it's growing and but as you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.930 
well I mean it's growing and but as you
can<00:03:15.870> see<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.349> pointed<00:03:16.769> out<00:03:16.829> earlier<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.519> earlier

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
can see I pointed out earlier in earlier

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.569 
can see I pointed out earlier in earlier
videos<00:03:18.620> some<00:03:19.620> leaves<00:03:19.889> will<00:03:20.159> start<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.519> dry<00:03:20.699> out

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
videos some leaves will start to dry out

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.589 
videos some leaves will start to dry out
they'll<00:03:23.579> be<00:03:23.760> dry<00:03:25.579> others<00:03:26.579> are<00:03:26.760> doing<00:03:26.849> fine<00:03:27.209> so

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
they'll be dry others are doing fine so

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.719 
they'll be dry others are doing fine so
that's<00:03:27.959> fine<00:03:28.169> that's<00:03:28.379> fine<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.650> think<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.579> is

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
that's fine that's fine I think this is

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.909 
that's fine that's fine I think this is
party<00:03:29.970> later<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.449> the<00:03:30.569> soil<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.139> I<00:03:31.199> use<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.859> I

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
party later to the soil that I use I I

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.490 
party later to the soil that I use I I
was<00:03:32.340> careless<00:03:32.639> when<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.120> made<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> cutting<00:03:34.379> I

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
was careless when I made a cutting I

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.800 
was careless when I made a cutting I
know<00:03:34.680> we<00:03:34.889> Lowe's<00:03:35.099> will<00:03:35.669> root<00:03:36.000> easily<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.780> I

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
know we Lowe's will root easily so I

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.420 
know we Lowe's will root easily so I
didn't<00:03:37.049> pay<00:03:37.199> attention<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.949> quality<00:03:38.400> of

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
didn't pay attention to the quality of

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.879 
didn't pay attention to the quality of
the<00:03:38.609> soil<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:38.939> I<00:03:39.090> use<00:03:39.389> so<00:03:40.229> I<00:03:40.260> might<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.590> used

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
the soil that I use so I might have used

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.009 
the soil that I use so I might have used
some<00:03:40.979> saw<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.609> not<00:03:42.209> too<00:03:42.389> good<00:03:42.629> or<00:03:42.870> too<00:03:45.019> too

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
some saw that is not too good or too too

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.920 
some saw that is not too good or too too
wet<00:03:46.290> or<00:03:46.319> something<00:03:46.709> or<00:03:48.530> too<00:03:49.530> compacted<00:03:50.220> or

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
wet or something or too compacted or

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.199 
wet or something or too compacted or
maybe<00:03:51.930> even<00:03:52.019> old<00:03:52.470> soil<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.699> might<00:03:53.909> cost

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
maybe even old soil and that might cost

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.110 
maybe even old soil and that might cost
this<00:03:54.509> kind<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:55.040> leaf<00:03:56.040> drying<00:03:56.489> out<00:03:56.699> it's<00:03:56.939> not<00:03:57.060> a

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
this kind of leaf drying out it's not a

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.520 
this kind of leaf drying out it's not a
complete<00:03:57.659> plant

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
complete plant

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.229 
complete plant
drying<00:03:58.799> out<00:03:58.949> just<00:03:59.250> part<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.639> leaf<00:03:59.849> drying

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
drying out just part of the leaf drying

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.599 
drying out just part of the leaf drying
out<00:04:00.479> so<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:01.530> tells<00:04:01.769> me<00:04:01.919> something

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
out so this tells me something

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.430 
out so this tells me something
something's<00:04:03.239> wrong<00:04:03.449> the<00:04:03.659> nutrients<00:04:04.139> so

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
something's wrong the nutrients so

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.380 
something's wrong the nutrients so
but<00:04:06.280> it's<00:04:06.430> okay<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.790> plant<00:04:07.000> seems<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.300> be

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
but it's okay the plant seems to be

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.150 
but it's okay the plant seems to be
doing<00:04:07.510> well<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:08.050> I'm<00:04:08.290> just<00:04:08.650> gonna<00:04:08.800> live<00:04:09.070> here

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
doing well and I'm just gonna live here

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.580 
doing well and I'm just gonna live here
alone<00:04:09.430> like<00:04:09.880> this<00:04:10.060> for<00:04:10.240> now<00:04:10.390> move<00:04:11.050> it<00:04:11.200> out<00:04:11.350> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
alone like this for now move it out to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.330 
alone like this for now move it out to
to<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.070> place<00:04:12.550> where<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:12.820> gets<00:04:12.970> more<00:04:13.210> Sun<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:14.340> I

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
to a place where it gets more Sun and I

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.210 
to a place where it gets more Sun and I
guess<00:04:16.150> that's<00:04:16.330> it<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:17.110> next<00:04:17.350> update<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.920> would

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
guess that's it the next update I would

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.070 
guess that's it the next update I would
do<00:04:18.430> probably<00:04:18.940> be<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.090> wire<00:04:19.360> off<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.690> just<00:04:19.750> want<00:04:20.019> to

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
do probably be a wire off I just want to

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.820 
do probably be a wire off I just want to
let<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.290> plant<00:04:20.560> grow<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:22.200> I'll<00:04:23.200> pray<00:04:23.410> update

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
let the plant grow and I'll pray update

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.260 
let the plant grow and I'll pray update
in<00:04:25.500> in<00:04:26.500> six<00:04:26.860> months<00:04:27.220> or<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:27.520> okay

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
in in six months or so okay

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.630 
in in six months or so okay
thank<00:04:28.510> you
