00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
they were worth it at the time I haven't

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.559 
they were worth it at the time I haven't
regretted<00:01:24.890> getting<00:01:25.369> them<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:26.179> did<00:01:26.359> have<00:01:26.450> to

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
regretted getting them and I did have to

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.779 
regretted getting them and I did have to
go<00:01:26.689> up<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.990> bit<00:01:27.020> in<00:01:27.319> these<00:01:27.499> I<00:01:27.829> wore<00:01:28.280> like<00:01:28.520> around

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
go up a bit in these I wore like around

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.730 
go up a bit in these I wore like around
in<00:01:28.999> 8<00:01:29.210> 28<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.840> half<00:01:29.869> at<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.170> time<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:30.710> I

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
in 8 28 and a half at the time and I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.529 
in 8 28 and a half at the time and I
ended<00:01:30.770> up<00:01:31.039> having<00:01:31.249> to<00:01:31.429> get<00:01:31.579> a<00:01:31.609> 9<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.060> these<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:32.509> I

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
ended up having to get a 9 in these so I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:33.849 
ended up having to get a 9 in these so I
think<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.960> they<00:01:33.079> do<00:01:33.139> run<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:33.469> little<00:01:33.740> bit

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
think that they do run a little bit

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.980 
think that they do run a little bit
small<00:01:34.159> but<00:01:34.909> those<00:01:35.090> are<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.329> things<00:01:35.719> that<00:01:35.899> I've

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
small but those are the things that I've

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.179 
small but those are the things that I've
had<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.409> longest

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
don't think that they're comfortable and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110 
don't think that they're comfortable and
for<00:02:49.710> me<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.130> think<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:50.700> are<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.970> most

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
for me I think that they are the most

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.270 
for me I think that they are the most
comfortable<00:02:51.390> ballet<00:02:51.900> flat<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.530> don't<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.070> any

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
problems with rubbing with them they fit

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.710 
problems with rubbing with them they fit
my<00:02:55.500> feet<00:02:55.710> great<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.850> really<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
my feet great and I really like that the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.690 
my feet great and I really like that the
toe<00:02:57.990> box<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.500> them<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.010> little<00:02:59.370> bit<00:02:59.460> wider

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
toe box on them is a little bit wider

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.450 
toe box on them is a little bit wider
than<00:02:59.880> some<00:03:00.300> other<00:03:00.450> shoes<00:03:00.920> I've<00:03:01.920> had<00:03:02.130> some

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
than some other shoes I've had some

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.030 
than some other shoes I've had some
ballet<00:03:02.670> flats<00:03:03.060> by<00:03:03.270> like<00:03:03.480> Dior<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.380> they<00:03:04.980> were

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
ballet flats by like Dior and they were

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.220 
ballet flats by like Dior and they were
very<00:03:05.340> rounded<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.240> I<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.900> felt<00:03:07.050> like<00:03:07.110> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
very rounded and I just felt like the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.870 
very rounded and I just felt like the
toe<00:03:07.410> box<00:03:07.620> wasn't<00:03:08.070> quite<00:03:08.220> as<00:03:08.310> wide<00:03:08.520> on<00:03:08.670> those

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
toe box wasn't quite as wide on those

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.390 
toe box wasn't quite as wide on those
but<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.510> feels<00:03:09.690> like<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> Riva<00:03:10.350> like<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.950> wider

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
but it feels like the Riva like is wider

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.280 
but it feels like the Riva like is wider
through<00:03:11.880> here<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.600> fits<00:03:12.840> really

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
through here and it fits really

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.410 
through here and it fits really
comfortably<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:14.520> bought<00:03:14.910> these<00:03:15.090> for<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.000 
comfortably so I bought these for the
color<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.020> really<00:03:16.350> really<00:03:16.500> love<00:03:16.770> them<00:03:16.950> I

if you're used to Chanel sunglasses and
also<00:05:45.780> I<00:05:45.810> thought<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.139> packaging<00:05:46.740> was<00:05:46.919> kind<00:05:47.159> of

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
also I thought the packaging was kind of

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.730 
also I thought the packaging was kind of
reminiscent<00:05:47.759> to<00:05:48.060> Chanel<00:05:48.360> as<00:05:48.449> well<00:05:48.629> that<00:05:49.319> comes

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
reminiscent to Chanel as well that comes

with<00:05:49.919> this<00:05:50.039> case<00:05:50.340> which<00:05:50.849> was<00:05:51.060> is<00:05:51.360> nice<00:05:51.750> and

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
with this case which was is nice and

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.830 
with this case which was is nice and
it's<00:05:52.169> lined<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:52.889> it's<00:05:53.879> like<00:05:54.090> bright<00:05:54.300> gold<00:05:54.629> but

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
it's lined and it's like bright gold but

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.270 
it's lined and it's like bright gold but
I<00:05:54.870> don't<00:05:55.080> mind<00:05:55.289> that<00:05:55.409> it's<00:05:55.530> gold<00:05:55.889> because<00:05:56.099> it's

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
I don't mind that it's gold because it's

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.129 
I don't mind that it's gold because it's
you<00:05:56.550> know<00:05:56.580> down<00:05:56.849> in<00:05:56.970> my<00:05:57.090> personal<00:05:57.659> is<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:57.840> time

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
and then it also comes with this

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.830 
and then it also comes with this
cleaning<00:06:01.080> cloth<00:06:01.830> like<00:06:02.340> a<00:06:03.090> little<00:06:03.599> bag<00:06:03.810> that

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
cleaning cloth like a little bag that

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.719 
cleaning cloth like a little bag that
you<00:06:04.110> can<00:06:04.229> put<00:06:04.440> them<00:06:04.530> in<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:05.009> it's<00:06:05.430> got<00:06:05.610> the

little<00:06:06.060> medallion<00:06:06.509> on<00:06:06.599> there<00:06:06.810> so<00:06:07.199> I<00:06:07.500> thought

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
little medallion on there so I thought

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.529 
little medallion on there so I thought
that<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.370> packaging<00:06:08.849> is<00:06:08.970> really<00:06:09.120> nice<00:06:09.360> on

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
many like brown colored flats so I

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.140 
many like brown colored flats so I
thought<00:06:40.020> that<00:06:40.259> would<00:06:40.440> be<00:06:40.590> good<00:06:40.800> and<00:06:41.190> then<00:06:41.849> also

thought that would be good and then also

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.600 
thought that would be good and then also
the<00:06:42.630> Miller<00:06:42.990> sandals<00:06:43.650> and<00:06:43.889> love<00:06:44.130> pink<00:06:44.490> so
