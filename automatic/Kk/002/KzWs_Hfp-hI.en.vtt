00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.470
 Cairo 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.780
 yes 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.570
 for this reason 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.280
 and now that many gamers consensus me 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.619
 name ricardo cobo gamer axel pixel 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.930
 there is a video just very low 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.150
 quality but that's what I can do 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.830
 so far no longer after vido 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.050
 I think it's going to be improving a bit 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.410
 the quality of videos as a hearing aid 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.989
 audio and all that roll 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.370
 many people on facebook and it aims 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.010
 that has months that had announced that 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.440
 They were broken these headsets those 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.690
 people this has always had this 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.700
 how good I started to claim a little more 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.890
 on youtube the bass is going to be a boxing 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.820
 of it with you see it in the title of 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:56.590
 video these bosses are the microsoft live 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.809
 and chat xllx forgiveness 3000 are the ones 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.480
 I have just here all totally 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.040
 new and sealed here are what I 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.460
 I had the ones I had already bought this makes 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.460
 more than a year 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.930
 here is this serves only this channel the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.080
 hearing aid works but you have to have it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.700
 seized from here not from here sorry 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.520
 so it 's a lot of fun I can not 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.220
 do the videos if I stop you from grabbing 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.189
 here the audio noise or maybe my 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.289
 audio record then it 's a lot of roll that 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.030
 he had not had money essentially 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.619
 to buy some or maybe yes but 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.350
 had other priorities you already know that 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.850
 youtube not as I do nothing if a 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.690
 young so I can not invest more 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.799
 what I have fun 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.780
 As I told you, it's been more than a year 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.369
 but honestly they came out very 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.209
 good the reason they got spoiled 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.920
 it's because I transport these from side to 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.470
 side 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.780
 I have them here in my house and then the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.100
 I take my work or I have to be 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.170
 moving cable but it moves 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.939
 Wears the wires in the inside 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.649
 of the wires is not a cable cited 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.740
 nothing else are several cables attached because 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.390
 they are audio and microphone then a lot 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.369
 a lot of what you have to do is 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.220
 they are not very good are from microsoft are 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.480
 excellent these so I said good if 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.850
 He has not bought me some I'm going to make 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.430
 they want the ones I already trust and this 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.159
 I sincerely trust these 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.629
 so let's see let's go back 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:26.200
 of two knives when it's going to be 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:30.340
 more or if 52 can I see let's check by 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.010
 here makes me 58 and 8 same x is fine and 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.890
 he got it out there that rich 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.190
 highway 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.290
 where I find a gift of this before 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.450
 that the first I buy it already have 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.550
 several several as it came a year not 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.350
 it came in this form the package came in 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.810
 another way in which there is a seal for 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.670
 break the whole box very well beautiful 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.190
 it's fine and we're going to jail to see if 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.440
 they see it is a very very good box 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.500
 before I came alone this was a 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.860
 very rigid plastic what came before 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.190
 They were the same but they came 1 br in 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.840
 one green color and it was very rigid this one 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.790
 It was very difficult to open or I took a good 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.130
 to open it with a knife and all this 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.190
 as he gave it is cardboard it can break 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.989
 a little easier as this one wants 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.970
 we can open it here we are going to open the 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.310
 stamps here have their sides like this 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.760
 that we're going to open the nothing else what 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.530
 we do so we do so sorry for 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.800
 this is the one that I am currently using 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.600
 yes already yesterday I went to the super said good and 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.870
 I'm going to buy these because the truth is 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.550
 I get tired of sticking tape to these and if the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.650
 you can use like that not in fact if you used it 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.960
 for telephone jokes and all this 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.690
 has very good for skype 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.910
 serves for your music is exclusively 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.430
 for pc in case I get to ask 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.170
 before this check of the whole video I'm going to 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.520
 answer several doubts that possibly 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.440
 may arise and be on the page where 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.670
 you can buy it you will be an official 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.700
 Microsoft based on the description of 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.010
 video or outside can go to samsa wolman 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.370
 we are afraid of office deep 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.430
 I do not know and they can buy it there 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.799
 so it's already very easy to 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.540
 really get him out that this time he was 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.239
 much easier than I loaded it the first 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.060
 Once we buy it, we are voting for it 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.680
 up here 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.500
 this 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.130
 let's take it out so as not to ruin the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.860
 cabling 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.930
 we have to open little brooches 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.210
 but none that I do not have the strength 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.000
 I'm good fucking man 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.060
 they do not open it here as they see it as a 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.490
 Old old old whore healthy not 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.490
 but if they are well thought out for things 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:50.030
 spare his life and here is already well 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.770
 his fucking nudito this if I'm going to take care 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.900
 this what they have office because they 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.539
 still serves a channel so see this 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.219
 useful for my taste this I will have 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.469
 my exclusive house for the game by 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:03.169
 success that roll I will try to take care 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:06.020
 to full see the differences between 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.580
 new and old this is totally black to 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.210
 This was already going to be downloaded by peeling a 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.560
 little black 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.360
 the gray 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.639
 like this one and it seems a little bit more 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.169
 new indeed the most important thing 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.660
 everything is the lobe wang that is this 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.630
 they feel even newer no 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.220
 you can open so many this imagine 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.130
 it came to a 90 degree turn that 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.760
 imputa has a head and 90 degrees turn 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.630
 90 degrees 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.450
 This does not exceed 15 20 degrees , 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.850
 can more where can more then is 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.040
 very very good I think a person 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.080
 normal has the ears like this is very very 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.090
 good so it 's the boxing review 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.580
 at once to raise it is what I 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.440
 that the good and the bad of these headsets 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.270
 not the only bad thing that I would do to him 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.170
 I would find is that they are exclusive 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.730
 for pc this would be the only bad thing would be 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.529
 very cool to use it for the box but then 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.239
 will be for pc is excellent sincerely 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.409
 I think the cable is a little bit more 

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.409
 long I do not remember very well 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.330
 of the usb door is pretty much what 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.710
 same are the same measure is totally 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.000
 totally the same maybe they can not reach 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.830
 see well on screen but it 's 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.569
 practically the same the most notorious 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.629
 what was he talking to them was this 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:28.630
 all this lining this whole forum if I 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:30.280
 I get on screen all this lining 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.660
 is going to be appealing with time 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.700
 but why because I had in my 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.800
 backpack always always what we know and 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.750
 the my home mind in my house my backpack 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.300
 backpack to work from work my house 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.070
 then it was very exhausting for my 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.960
 ion jon hearing aids and I would get into a 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.330
 backpack every day round trip this 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.300
 will also urge half school 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.439
 this will do something very interesting about these 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.360
 microphones the chat this the x 3,000 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:57.610
 are you can mutilate the microphone 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.560
 directly from this button we are going to 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.199
 show them that this button is already 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.770
 erased like the keys of a pc or a 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:08.229
 cellular had been deleted by the use but 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:12.009
 here is here you can mute you can 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:14.020
 silence here what is forgiveness the 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.819
 audio of the microphone in case it is a 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.050
 undue joke to laugh lobe mute as 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:21.389
 for example and you will not go anything 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.129
 these two turn up the volume or lower the 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.250
 volume is very very good made me 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:28.169
 this microphone is very very good 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.720
 even better than some turtle I would say 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:33.090
 that if the audio is excellent quickly 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.460
 I'm going to mention some of the youtubers 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:38.340
 who use good at least those that I 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.340
 I know what he uses the capon he uses 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.760
 Aegean cars use them there seems to be 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.320
 remix 

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.300
 this pawn several youtubers are 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.310
 honestly I think they were made 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.430
 these headphones these bosses are for 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.810
 youtube more than all this I think that 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.280
 that was all the same as in review if 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.230
 you have doubts comments or any 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.430
 Anything you have in mind you can tell me 

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.600
 leave in the description of the video a 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.820
 comment will not cost you 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.830
 practically nothing a minute and I'm going to 

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.480

 nothing if he is very very good this 

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.930
 mike I think I'm going to 

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.430
 consider my house very well and we 

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.720
