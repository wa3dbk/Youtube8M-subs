Chess Championships in 1927 and all game
from<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.600> Masters<00:00:25.220> from<00:00:26.220> which<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.609> hope<00:00:26.820> we

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
from the Masters from which I hope we

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.200 
from the Masters from which I hope we
can<00:00:27.090> learn<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.500> endgame<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.699> let's

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
can learn a lot in the endgame and let's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.990 
can learn a lot in the endgame and let's
just<00:00:30.420> see<00:00:30.599> how<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.869> enter<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.700> why<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.759> plays

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
just see how we enter this why it plays

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.660 
just see how we enter this why it plays
the<00:00:33.030> good<00:00:33.329> move<00:00:33.510> Queen<00:00:33.809> d4<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.160> forces

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the good move Queen d4 which now forces

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
the good move Queen d4 which now forces
an<00:00:35.760> Indian<00:00:36.090> because<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.110> rook<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.290> Queen<00:00:37.620> are

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
an Indian because the rook and Queen are

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.930 
an Indian because the rook and Queen are
pinned<00:00:38.059> Queen<00:00:39.059> takes<00:00:39.210> d4<00:00:39.629> rook<00:00:39.899> takes<00:00:40.110> d4<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
pinned Queen takes d4 rook takes d4 and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.810 
pinned Queen takes d4 rook takes d4 and
now<00:00:42.260> just<00:00:43.260> by<00:00:43.950> by<00:00:44.480> rook<00:00:45.510> a6<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.670> doesn't<00:00:47.670> work

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
now just by by rook a6 here doesn't work

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900 
now just by by rook a6 here doesn't work
because<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.450> King<00:00:48.660> f3<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.320> white<00:00:49.980> reaches<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
because of King f3 and white reaches the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.389 
because of King f3 and white reaches the
center<00:00:51.239> too<00:00:51.420> quickly<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:54.559> after<00:00:55.559> King<00:00:55.860> g7

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
center too quickly so after King g7

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.930 
center too quickly so after King g7
which<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> correct<00:00:57.210> move<00:00:57.449> a5<00:00:58.320> rook<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.430> 6th

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
which is the correct move a5 rook a 6th

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.479 
which is the correct move a5 rook a 6th
white<00:01:00.719> must<00:01:01.020> find<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> correct<00:01:01.590> move<00:01:01.859> rook<00:01:02.039> a4

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
white must find the correct move rook a4

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.500 
white must find the correct move rook a4
which<00:01:03.000> she<00:01:03.149> does<00:01:03.359> after

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
which she does after

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.830 
which she does after
this<00:01:06.230> repetition<00:01:06.940> so<00:01:07.940> now<00:01:08.060> we<00:01:08.120> reach<00:01:08.390> our<00:01:08.630> key

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
this repetition so now we reach our key

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840 
this repetition so now we reach our key
position

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
position

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.270 
position
speaking<00:01:10.850> about<00:01:11.060> rook<00:01:11.600> end<00:01:11.810> games<00:01:12.050> let's<00:01:12.890> try

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
speaking about rook end games let's try

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.430 
speaking about rook end games let's try
to<00:01:13.700> learn<00:01:14.030> from<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:15.370> White<00:01:16.370> has<00:01:17.440> correctly

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
to learn from this White has correctly

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.090 
to learn from this White has correctly
placed<00:01:18.860> his<00:01:19.160> rook<00:01:19.430> in<00:01:20.090> an<00:01:20.210> active<00:01:20.660> position

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
placed his rook in an active position

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.980 
placed his rook in an active position
whereas<00:01:22.100> black's<00:01:22.820> rook<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.330> passive<00:01:23.870> and

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
whereas black's rook is passive and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.850 
whereas black's rook is passive and
defending<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:26.360> is<00:01:26.480> a<00:01:26.540> sidenote<00:01:26.840> kind<00:01:27.740> of

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
defending and this is a sidenote kind of

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.480 
defending and this is a sidenote kind of
rule<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.250> thumb<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:29.150> is<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.450> in<00:01:29.540> working<00:01:29.900> games

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
rule of thumb it is the in working games

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.870 
rule of thumb it is the in working games
activity<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.700> part<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.390> paramount<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.890> really

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
activity is part is paramount so really

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.640 
activity is part is paramount so really
want<00:01:35.150> your<00:01:35.300> work<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.480> be<00:01:35.630> an<00:01:35.780> attacking<00:01:36.140> piece

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
want your work to be an attacking piece

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.700 
want your work to be an attacking piece
and<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.640> best<00:01:37.850> blockade<00:01:38.660> of<00:01:38.690> opponent<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.380> a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
and the best blockade of opponent is a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.790 
and the best blockade of opponent is a
king<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:41.450> that's<00:01:41.600> why<00:01:41.780> Black<00:01:42.050> has<00:01:42.229> some<00:01:42.350> films

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
king and that's why Black has some films

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.830 
king and that's why Black has some films
here<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.610> fact<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:44.000> objectively<00:01:44.510> lost

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
here and the fact is objectively lost

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.280 
here and the fact is objectively lost
because<00:01:45.710> ideally<00:01:46.550> he<00:01:46.910> needs<00:01:47.090> his<00:01:47.270> King<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.810> be

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
because ideally he needs his King to be

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.120 
because ideally he needs his King to be
placed<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.860> six<00:01:49.190> so<00:01:49.760> his<00:01:50.120> own<00:01:50.270> rook<00:01:50.570> can<00:01:51.320> get

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
placed on a six so his own rook can get

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.719 
placed on a six so his own rook can get
active<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.820> start<00:01:53.210> attacking<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:55.340> let's<00:01:55.520> see

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
active and start attacking so let's see

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.860 
active and start attacking so let's see
how<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.270> Masters<00:01:56.780> played<00:01:57.520> King<00:01:58.520> f6<00:01:58.940> black

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
how the Masters played King f6 black

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.420 
how the Masters played King f6 black
needs<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.320> get<00:02:00.440> active<00:02:00.770> with<00:02:00.800> at<00:02:00.979> least<00:02:01.070> one<00:02:01.310> of

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
needs to get active with at least one of

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.900 
needs to get active with at least one of
his<00:02:01.550> pieces<00:02:02.050> king<00:02:03.050> of<00:02:03.170> three<00:02:03.560> kingi<00:02:04.040> five<00:02:04.400> King

we can attack on the King side so black

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.199

zoo<00:03:23.450> slang<00:03:23.690> because<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.040> long<00:03:25.190> as<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.489> look

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
zoo slang because so long as this look

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.300 
zoo slang because so long as this look
doesn't<00:03:26.030> want<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.359> go<00:03:26.450> backwards<00:03:27.049> since<00:03:28.040> that

doesn't want to go backwards since that

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.819 
doesn't want to go backwards since that
just<00:03:28.489> wastes<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:29.090> movement<00:03:29.299> allows<00:03:29.690> us<00:03:30.410> to

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
just wastes a movement allows us to

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.420 
just wastes a movement allows us to
advance<00:03:31.670> our<00:03:31.879> pawn<00:03:32.150> he<00:03:33.109> can<00:03:33.349> only<00:03:33.470> go<00:03:33.739> sideways

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
advance our pawn he can only go sideways

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.449 
advance our pawn he can only go sideways
with<00:03:35.120> his<00:03:35.239> rook<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.629> in<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.379> case<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:37.220> still

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
with his rook and in that case we still

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.140 
with his rook and in that case we still
pushed<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:38.569> we<00:03:38.690> can<00:03:38.840> conclude<00:03:39.049> from<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.590> that

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
pushed so we can conclude from this that

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.970 
pushed so we can conclude from this that
blacks<00:03:41.150> rook<00:03:41.390> cannot<00:03:41.780> move<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.620> that<00:03:42.769> leaves

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
blacks rook cannot move and that leaves

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.910 
blacks rook cannot move and that leaves
only<00:03:43.190> his<00:03:43.489> king<00:03:43.790> since<00:03:44.480> making<00:03:45.049> useless<00:03:45.650> pawn

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
only his king since making useless pawn

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.770 
only his king since making useless pawn
moves<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.430> won't<00:03:46.700> help<00:03:47.000> his<00:03:47.239> cause<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.720> will

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
moves that won't help his cause it will

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.759 
moves that won't help his cause it will
just<00:03:47.840> make<00:03:48.319> them<00:03:49.209> even<00:03:50.209> weaker<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:51.019> that's

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
just make them even weaker and that's

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.000 
just make them even weaker and that's
why<00:03:51.950> black<00:03:52.190> must<00:03:52.400> move<00:03:52.579> his<00:03:52.760> king<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:54.010> after

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
why black must move his king so after

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.270 
why black must move his king so after
taking<00:03:55.160> c5<00:03:55.790> rook<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.180> -<00:03:56.500> we<00:03:57.500> see<00:03:57.709> black<00:03:57.950> has<00:03:58.160> this

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
taking c5 rook a - we see black has this

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.890 
taking c5 rook a - we see black has this
dilemma<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.780> lo<00:03:59.959> que<00:04:00.109> -<00:04:00.169> is<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.470> brilliant<00:04:00.889> move

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
dilemma and lo que - is a brilliant move

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.619 
dilemma and lo que - is a brilliant move
excuse<00:04:02.900> me<00:04:03.049> it<00:04:03.680> reinforces<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.549> idea<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.910> in

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
excuse me it reinforces the idea that in

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:06.129 
excuse me it reinforces the idea that in
the<00:04:05.750> endgame

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
the endgame

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.199 
the endgame
it's<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.769> good<00:04:07.069> thing<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.549> wait<00:04:07.989> because

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
it's a good thing to wait because

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.780 
it's a good thing to wait because
unlike<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.590> middle<00:04:12.010> game<00:04:12.159> we<00:04:12.370> might<00:04:12.610> have<00:04:12.700> an

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
unlike in middle game we might have an

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.910 
unlike in middle game we might have an
initiative<00:04:13.209> in<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.810> endgame<00:04:14.110> things<00:04:14.709> are

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
initiative in the endgame things are

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.409 
initiative in the endgame things are
bright<00:04:15.570> should<00:04:16.570> we<00:04:16.660> say<00:04:17.310> static<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:19.000> there

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
bright should we say static and there

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.840 
bright should we say static and there
are<00:04:19.479> some<00:04:19.600> static<00:04:20.169> advantages<00:04:20.979> here<00:04:21.220> which

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
are some static advantages here which

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.249 
are some static advantages here which
white<00:04:22.120> can<00:04:22.419> just<00:04:23.009> sit<00:04:24.009> down<00:04:24.039> on<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:25.259> relax

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
white can just sit down on and relax

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.920 
white can just sit down on and relax
with<00:04:26.500> comfortably<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:28.030> he<00:04:28.240> needs<00:04:28.449> to<00:04:28.600> do<00:04:28.780> this

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
with comfortably so he needs to do this

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.749 
with comfortably so he needs to do this
and<00:04:29.169> voce<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.740> great<00:04:29.949> example<00:04:30.070> because

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
and voce to is a great example because

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.219 
and voce to is a great example because
now<00:04:31.150> if<00:04:31.800> King<00:04:32.800> d5<00:04:33.300> then<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:34.539> enter<00:04:34.840> with<00:04:34.960> King

to king b5 is forced and now here's the

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:21.450 
to king b5 is forced and now here's the
point<00:05:16.349> first<00:05:17.349> white<00:05:17.620> just<00:05:18.360> let<00:05:19.360> us<00:05:19.510> say<00:05:20.460> delays

point first white just let us say delays

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.520 
point first white just let us say delays
his<00:05:22.180> plan

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
his plan

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.800 
his plan
because<00:05:24.100> let's<00:05:24.310> face<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.550> this<00:05:25.240> is<00:05:25.300> forced

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
because let's face it this is forced

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.430 
because let's face it this is forced
anyway<00:05:26.790> just<00:05:27.790> going<00:05:28.060> back

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.560 

black<00:05:30.860> can<00:05:31.070> never<00:05:31.250> take<00:05:31.550> this<00:05:32.120> point<00:05:32.449> of

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
black can never take this point of

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.090 
black can never take this point of
course<00:05:32.840> because<00:05:34.449> transposition<00:05:35.449> into<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.350> king

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
course because transposition into a king

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.590 
course because transposition into a king
ending<00:05:37.430> is<00:05:37.550> completely<00:05:38.090> game<00:05:38.270> of<00:05:38.449> them

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
ending is completely game of them

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.890 
ending is completely game of them
completely<00:05:39.080> lost<00:05:39.289> and<00:05:40.030> blacks<00:05:41.030> only<00:05:41.270> hope<00:05:41.630> is

completely lost and blacks only hope is

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.800 
completely lost and blacks only hope is
to<00:05:42.800> draw<00:05:43.039> the<00:05:43.100> look<00:05:43.340> endgame<00:05:43.699> since<00:05:44.600> there's

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
to draw the look endgame since there's

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.480 
to draw the look endgame since there's
that<00:05:44.930> famous<00:05:45.110> saying<00:05:45.530> over<00:05:45.949> can<00:05:46.130> get<00:05:46.340> the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
that famous saying over can get the

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.580 
that famous saying over can get the
drawn<00:05:46.729> of<00:05:47.449> course<00:05:47.720> that's<00:05:47.900> not<00:05:48.050> strictly<00:05:48.320> true

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
drawn of course that's not strictly true

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.300 
drawn of course that's not strictly true
but<00:05:48.919> it's<00:05:49.009> a<00:05:49.039> good<00:05:49.190> rule<00:05:49.370> of<00:05:49.400> thumb<00:05:49.550> and<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:51.320> by

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
but it's a good rule of thumb and I by

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.270 
but it's a good rule of thumb and I by
the<00:05:52.340> way<00:05:52.490> if<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.509> are<00:05:53.539> defending<00:05:54.050> a<00:05:54.530> calm<00:05:55.039> down

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
the way if you are defending a calm down

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.219 
the way if you are defending a calm down
I<00:05:55.310> recommend<00:05:55.789> you<00:05:55.880> keep<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.330> rooks<00:05:56.539> on<00:05:56.780> if<00:05:57.080> you

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
I recommend you keep the rooks on if you

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.629 
I recommend you keep the rooks on if you
have<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.440> opportunity<00:05:57.590> because<00:05:58.039> this

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
have the opportunity because this

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.050 
have the opportunity because this
increases<00:05:58.820> the<00:05:59.660> defenders<00:06:00.050> drawing<00:06:00.289> chances

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
increases the defenders drawing chances

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.529 
increases the defenders drawing chances
so<00:06:02.060> that's<00:06:02.240> why<00:06:03.669> black<00:06:04.669> had<00:06:04.910> to<00:06:05.030> go<00:06:05.150> in<00:06:05.360> for

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
so that's why black had to go in for

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.779 
so that's why black had to go in for
this<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:06.050> after<00:06:06.560> Kings<00:06:06.770> III<00:06:07.190> King<00:06:07.430> bee<00:06:07.550> five

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
this and after Kings III King bee five

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.879 
this and after Kings III King bee five
finally<00:06:08.509> white<00:06:09.020> plays<00:06:09.289> the<00:06:09.470> correct<00:06:09.710> move

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
finally white plays the correct move

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.570 
finally white plays the correct move
king<00:06:10.190> d4<00:06:10.840> so<00:06:11.840> he's<00:06:11.990> racing<00:06:12.500> towards<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:13.370> King

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
king d4 so he's racing towards the King

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.370 
king d4 so he's racing towards the King
side<00:06:13.820> more<00:06:14.000> to<00:06:14.180> weaken<00:06:14.599> and<00:06:15.160> target<00:06:16.160> f7<00:06:16.940> and

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
side more to weaken and target f7 and

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.740 
side more to weaken and target f7 and
now<00:06:18.380> if<00:06:19.009> King<00:06:19.340> before<00:06:19.520> them<00:06:19.880> broke<00:06:20.060> a1<00:06:20.360> is<00:06:20.479> next

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
now if King before them broke a1 is next

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.510 
now if King before them broke a1 is next
to<00:06:20.840> move<00:06:21.099> note<00:06:22.099> that<00:06:23.530> black<00:06:24.530> is<00:06:24.830> always<00:06:25.039> just

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
to move note that black is always just

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.110 
to move note that black is always just
one<00:06:26.120> square<00:06:26.449> too<00:06:27.139> far<00:06:27.440> away<00:06:27.590> to<00:06:28.340> attack<00:06:28.639> a<00:06:28.820> look

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
one square too far away to attack a look

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.409 
one square too far away to attack a look
we<00:06:29.300> have<00:06:29.330> sufficient<00:06:29.720> space<00:06:30.380> and<00:06:31.419> so<00:06:32.419> our<00:06:32.599> poem

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
we have sufficient space and so our poem

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.250 
we have sufficient space and so our poem
continues<00:06:35.419> being<00:06:35.900> quite<00:06:36.199> a<00:06:36.229> pest<00:06:36.680> for<00:06:37.639> black

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
continues being quite a pest for black

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.680 
continues being quite a pest for black
and<00:06:39.260> now<00:06:39.680> King<00:06:39.949> b3<00:06:40.340> wouldn't<00:06:41.000> attack<00:06:41.270> the<00:06:41.479> work

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
and now King b3 wouldn't attack the work

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.260 
and now King b3 wouldn't attack the work
so<00:06:42.199> we're<00:06:42.440> free<00:06:42.680> to<00:06:42.860> play<00:06:43.070> and<00:06:43.970> move<00:06:44.510> like<00:06:44.949> king

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
so we're free to play and move like king

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.170 
so we're free to play and move like king
