half<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> chapstick<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.500> don't<00:01:05.040> really

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
half is a chapstick so I don't really

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.420 
half is a chapstick so I don't really
count<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.729> makeup<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:07.590> good<00:01:08.159> number

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
count that as makeup and a good number

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.880 
count that as makeup and a good number
of<00:01:08.580> them<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.820> drug<00:01:09.390> store<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.590> doesn't

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
of them are drug store and it doesn't

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.149 
of them are drug store and it doesn't
even<00:01:10.920> use<00:01:11.100> any<00:01:11.430> brushes<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.170> very

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
even use any brushes so this is a very

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.060 
even use any brushes so this is a very

I think it's pretty affordable too so I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
I think it's pretty affordable too so I
took<00:01:20.340> off<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.670> makeup<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.509> side<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.110> it's

into the tutorial it's not very dramatic

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
into the tutorial it's not very dramatic

very<00:01:31.110> good<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.350> beginners<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.119> think

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
very good for beginners because I think

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
very good for beginners because I think
a<00:01:33.509> lot<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> younger<00:01:34.200> girls<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.040> not

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
a lot of younger girls are just not

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
a lot of younger girls are just not
allowed<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.790> wear<00:01:36.000> makeup<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.780> such<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> long

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
allowed to wear makeup for such a long

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
allowed to wear makeup for such a long
time<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.500> when<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:37.920> finally<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.400> allowed
