utilizing<00:00:39.550> biogas<00:00:40.000> in<00:00:40.270> vehicles<00:00:40.780> we<00:00:41.500> decided

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
utilizing biogas in vehicles we decided

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.250 
utilizing biogas in vehicles we decided
to<00:00:42.100> use<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.309> vehicle<00:00:43.120> as<00:00:43.300> proof<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:43.840> concept

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
to use a vehicle as proof of concept

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
resource futures at math university we

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.390 
resource futures at math university we
run<00:00:48.909> a<00:00:48.940> course<00:00:49.239> with<00:00:49.480> 150<00:00:50.260> students<00:00:50.800> looking

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.899 
at marketing and how they would design a
car<00:00:53.769> and<00:00:54.040> they<00:00:54.190> came<00:00:54.339> up<00:00:54.489> with<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.640> clever<00:00:54.730> idea

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909

of<00:00:55.449> we've<00:00:55.989> actually<00:00:56.170> got<00:00:56.379> bugs<00:00:56.650> in<00:00:56.860> the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
of we've actually got bugs in the

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.979 
of we've actually got bugs in the
digesters<00:00:57.579> so<00:00:57.970> why<00:00:58.120> don't<00:00:58.300> we<00:00:58.329> have<00:00:58.480> a<00:00:58.510> bug<00:00:58.809> on

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
digesters so why don't we have a bug on

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.139 
digesters so why don't we have a bug on
the<00:00:59.290> road<00:00:59.440> hence<00:01:00.129> we've<00:01:00.550> got<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.760> VAIO<00:01:00.879> bug

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
on either petrol or biogas which is a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.440 
on either petrol or biogas which is a
great<00:02:17.930> advantage<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.709> driver<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
great advantage to the driver the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.229 
great advantage to the driver the
systems<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.410> we<00:02:21.500> put<00:02:21.530> on<00:02:21.830> we<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.670> add<00:02:22.910> some

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
systems that we put on we just add some

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.080 
systems that we put on we just add some
injectors<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.290> microprocessor<00:02:25.129> controller

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
injectors a microprocessor controller

injectors a microprocessor controller
and<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.989> course<00:02:27.200> some<00:02:27.709> fuel<00:02:27.920> tanks<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
and of course some fuel tanks to the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.089 
and of course some fuel tanks to the
vehicle<00:02:29.290> LPG<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.470> mainly<00:02:30.980> propane<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:33.099> biogas

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
vehicle LPG is mainly propane and biogas

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.460 
vehicle LPG is mainly propane and biogas
is<00:02:34.340> mainly<00:02:34.760> methane<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.870> difference<00:02:36.290> is

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
is mainly methane and the difference is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.770 
is mainly methane and the difference is
that<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.980> methane<00:02:37.970> needs<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.299> be<00:02:38.390> compressed

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
that the methane needs to be compressed

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.110 
that the methane needs to be compressed
much<00:02:39.079> much<00:02:39.290> more<00:02:39.500> than<00:02:39.739> than<00:02:40.310> LPG<00:02:40.760> does<00:02:40.940> but

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
much much more than than LPG does but

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.180 
much much more than than LPG does but
essentially<00:02:41.569> they<00:02:41.720> do<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.049> same<00:02:42.260> job<00:02:42.590> we

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
essentially they do the same job we

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.449 
essentially they do the same job we
reckon<00:02:43.579> the<00:02:44.120> biogas<00:02:44.540> car<00:02:44.840> will<00:02:45.019> run<00:02:45.230> about<00:02:45.459> 230

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
reckon the biogas car will run about 230

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.150 
reckon the biogas car will run about 230
miles<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.030> full<00:02:47.090> tank<00:02:47.599> of<00:02:47.750> fuel<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.950> big

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
miles on a full tank of fuel the big

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.890 
miles on a full tank of fuel the big
advantage<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.819> going<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.060> be<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.660> fuel

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
advantage is going to be that the fuel

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.110 
advantage is going to be that the fuel
costs<00:02:51.379> will<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:51.590> much<00:02:51.709> much<00:02:52.400> lower<00:02:52.700> than<00:02:52.970> your

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120

conventional<00:02:53.660> fuels<00:02:54.099> one<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.280> unique

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
conventional fuels one of the unique

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.220 
conventional fuels one of the unique
things<00:02:55.790> about<00:02:55.879> this<00:02:56.120> project<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:57.019> we're

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
things about this project is that we're

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.530 
things about this project is that we're
purifying<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.799> gas<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.190> 99.9<00:02:59.120> percent

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
purifying the gas to 99.9 percent

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.900 
purifying the gas to 99.9 percent
methane<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.860> means<00:03:01.069> that<00:03:01.190> we<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.489> use<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.819> as

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
methane this means that we can use it as

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.699 
methane this means that we can use it as
a<00:03:01.940> direct<00:03:02.269> replacement<00:03:02.989> for<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.170> petrol<00:03:03.530> we

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
a direct replacement for the petrol we

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.229 
a direct replacement for the petrol we
don't<00:03:03.890> get<00:03:04.069> any<00:03:04.220> loss<00:03:04.400> in<00:03:04.430> performance<00:03:05.060> and

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
don't get any loss in performance and

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.910 
don't get any loss in performance and
also<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:05.989> doesn't<00:03:06.140> do<00:03:06.290> any<00:03:06.440> damage<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.739> the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
also it doesn't do any damage to the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.550 
also it doesn't do any damage to the
engines<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:08.420> biogas<00:03:08.750> for<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.019> project<00:03:09.440> is
