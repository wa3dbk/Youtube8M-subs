there's only really one way to get into
this<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.270> guess<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.930> could<00:00:52.079> say<00:00:52.260> getting

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
this I guess you could say getting

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
this I guess you could say getting
randomly<00:00:53.100> selected<00:00:53.640> by<00:00:53.760> Xbox<00:00:54.270> Live

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
randomly selected by Xbox Live

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.209 
randomly selected by Xbox Live
but<00:00:55.050> obviously<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.620> guys<00:00:55.770> don't<00:00:56.070> want<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
wait for that so the easy way to do this
