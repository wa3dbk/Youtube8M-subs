 rick uses a lot of craft a 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.380
 successively because we start with 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.620
 the foundry 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.870

 it's trades that have a real 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.310
 specialty that correspond to a stage 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 the manufacture and evolution of 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.540
 product 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 the historical headquarters of the company and

 here we are in his premises 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.740
 boulevard de la Bastille since about 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.220
 160 years but with the development of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.610
 now 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.690
 we were led to relocate a 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.550
 part of the touraine workshops in 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.980
 renault castle where we have a 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.620
 foundry and a processing workshop 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.050
 surface we're doing more and more on 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.240
 measure and even through our products 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.100
 the most classic ones that were created at 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.900
 19th and which are in our catalog 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.510
 since that time we are 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.040
 very often to adapt them to the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.570
 customer request 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.880
 we are obviously still at 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.990
 the listened to our customers that is to say that 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.790
 our decorator with whom at work he 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.550
 we submit drawings that we 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.290
 translate it electronically and we 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.020
 do prototypes before doing 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.709
 manufacturing products that enriches 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.530
 the collection requires us to adapt 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.560
 our ways of working and our modes of 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.410
 production under today's conditions 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.720
 it's very important to know that we have 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.510
 vis-à-vis the outside and vis-à-vis 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.160
 foreign customers who are essential 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.140
 for us because it's not the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.460
 French market that could continue to 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.740
 to make us live alone 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.090
 you have to go get the 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.190
 overseas customers writing on the other hand 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.580
 we can not go looking for customers 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.880
 abroad that if for them the products 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.200
 french french style products 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.940
 correspond to something so the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.880
 label living heritage company 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.520
 is essential for us for vis-à-vis 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.110
 abroad qualify our company 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.510
 it's a recognition I would say 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.070
 international and especially official on 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.400
 which we rely on more and 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.960
 more we must wish that the style of 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.060
 life the product site we 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.460
 represent that really fit 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.310
 to cultural artistic history 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.240
 French remains for the French and 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.700
 for foreigners 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.860
 a must because that's what makes the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.600
 renown behind actually what we 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.970
 may wish the company knows that 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.040
 his reputation against us being 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.230
 question as early as possible 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.850
 by prescribers for 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.350
 accompany throughout the 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.080
 maturation of their project and make 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.760
 so that their projects and our products 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.740
 on the best adapted to the conditions of 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.390
 life of today so that it lasts the 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.590
 as long as possible and that the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.260
 tools we can have 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.180
 really come to complete the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.630
 know-how of the companions of 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.630
 now
