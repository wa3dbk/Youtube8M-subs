 flat plate spread beets and 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.540

 a small mesh of mayonnaise 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.190
 Mayonnaise base precisely on its 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.190
 taste preferences with passion 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.619
 then I spread finely chopped 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.619
 prunes 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.220
 the next layer will be rubbed on 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.220
 fine grater yolks 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.700
 scatter yolks on the surface with us 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.310
 there is no problem with you absolutely 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 flat lettuce may be small 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:53.909
 such a mound layer and yolks i 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.690
 a little salt and then do again 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.690
 mesh from mayonnaise 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:07.429
 on the next 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.649
 chopped walnuts pour them 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.030
 top again 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.370
 neatly level the dad the world and 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.080
 then there will be a cheese layer as you see here 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.049
 I'm already rubbing two on a fine grater 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.799
 cloves of garlic and in order to more convenient 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.890
 was to mix 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.900
 I'm right on the plate, I will mix cheese with 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.769
 mayonnaise obtained cheese mass can 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.849
 lay out 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.849
 following words 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.980
 and again neatly leveling 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.420
 I try to tamp the cheese layer 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.940
 on the contrary I loosened it a little 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.769
 to make the salad more airy and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:52.480
 the last layer in this salad is 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:55.170
 grated squirrels and on 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.890
 gently level the layer of protein 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.980
 try to keep airiness and remember 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.440
 what is our topmost layer therefore 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.040
 everything must be extremely neat 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.230
 Russia and now our salad is ready to stay 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.239
 the last most important is probably so 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.480
 decorated to decorate my salad i 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.849
 I will use pomegranate seeds 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.400
 lettuce and cut from beetroot 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.890
 hearts and make a pomegranate I will make 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.299
 the edge of something so beautiful 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.160
 bright red rim 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.599
 pomegranate grains and all the components that 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.040
 present in this salad perfectly 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:38.040
 combined in the center I'll lay out a flower 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.030
 from pieces of beet 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.300
 and garnish it all with lettuce leaves 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.870
 from the center of the flower I will put one more 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.360
 Here's a grain salad was unsuccessful 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.070
