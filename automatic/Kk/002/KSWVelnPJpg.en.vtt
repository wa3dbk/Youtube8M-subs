00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
off so I wasn't sure which curves

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.160 
off so I wasn't sure which curves
supposed<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.880> but<00:02:26.210> overall<00:02:26.630> wasn't<00:02:26.990> too

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
supposed to be but overall wasn't too

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.380 
supposed to be but overall wasn't too
hard<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.500> build<00:02:27.800> on<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.760> instructions<00:02:29.210> are

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
hard to build on the instructions are

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.710 
hard to build on the instructions are
very<00:02:29.420> detailed<00:02:29.950> lots<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.070> steps<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
very detailed lots of steps and on the

very detailed lots of steps and on the
back<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.959> each<00:02:33.050> booklet<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.130> get<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
back of each booklet you get the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.400 
back of each booklet you get the
remaining<00:02:35.180> instructions<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.930> combine<00:02:36.260> all

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
remaining instructions to combine all

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.949 
remaining instructions to combine all
three<00:02:36.590> into<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.250> China<00:02:37.580> piece<00:02:37.970> which<00:02:38.780> I'll

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
three into this China piece which I'll

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.090 
three into this China piece which I'll
do<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.230> after<00:02:39.410> like<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.680> jump<00:02:39.950> color

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
do that after like a jump color

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.330 
do that after like a jump color
something<00:02:40.280> even<00:02:40.610> as<00:02:40.730> like<00:02:40.970> parts<00:02:41.900> list<00:02:42.340> or

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
something even as like parts list or

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.430 
something even as like parts list or

toys here for some small one verse I

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.610 
toys here for some small one verse I
think<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:14.690> Prince<00:03:14.989> actually<00:03:15.320> slightly

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
think this Prince actually slightly

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.949 
think this Prince actually slightly
Santa<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.640> instruction<00:03:17.150> manual<00:03:17.450> in<00:03:17.570> he<00:03:17.840> is

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
Santa in the instruction manual in he is

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.199 
Santa in the instruction manual in he is
slightly<00:03:18.410> slanted<00:03:18.650> as<00:03:19.010> well<00:03:19.250> but<00:03:19.519> this<00:03:19.970> one's

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
slightly slanted as well but this one's

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.910 
slightly slanted as well but this one's
really<00:03:20.360> scientist<00:03:21.080> I<00:03:21.200> think<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.440> printing<00:03:21.769> is

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
really scientist I think the printing is

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.880 
really scientist I think the printing is
slightly<00:03:22.280> off<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:22.959> then<00:03:23.959> do<00:03:24.350> anything<00:03:24.680> we

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
slightly off but then do anything we

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.220 
slightly off but then do anything we
know<00:03:25.670> this<00:03:26.000> this<00:03:26.239> piece<00:03:26.420> was<00:03:26.630> quite<00:03:26.840> hard<00:03:27.019> to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
know this this piece was quite hard to

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.890 
know this this piece was quite hard to
push<00:03:27.410> in<00:03:27.590> but<00:03:27.799> it<00:03:28.010> got<00:03:28.459> in<00:03:28.610> there<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
push in but it got in there and the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.140 
push in but it got in there and the
print<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.260> sharp<00:03:30.560> enough<00:03:30.650> on<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.640> this<00:03:31.910> piece

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
print is sharp enough on this this piece

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.910 
print is sharp enough on this this piece
so<00:03:32.890> hmm<00:03:34.810> into<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.900> back<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.200> go<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.530> little<00:03:36.830> on

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
so hmm into the back you go a little on

somewhere else the crimson red piece I
forgot<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.959> share<00:04:21.200> figure<00:04:21.560> easing<00:04:21.890> but<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.820> take

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
forgot to share figure easing but I take

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.730 
forgot to share figure easing but I take
this<00:04:23.240> out<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:23.539> can<00:04:23.570> see<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.960> it's<00:04:24.380> missing

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
this out you can see that it's missing

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.700 
this out you can see that it's missing
some<00:04:24.919> plastic<00:04:25.660> so<00:04:26.660> two<00:04:26.720> pieces<00:04:27.289> are<00:04:27.440> all<00:04:27.590> these

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
some plastic so two pieces are all these

and<00:04:50.470> turn<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:51.009> so<00:04:51.190> nice<00:04:51.400> hands<00:04:51.880> holding<00:04:52.240> a

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
and turn it so nice hands holding a

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.600 
and turn it so nice hands holding a
diffraction<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.919> there<00:04:54.070> goes<00:04:54.220> his<00:04:54.370> head

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
diffraction and there goes his head

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.879 
diffraction and there goes his head
again<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:55.720> that's<00:04:55.990> that's<00:04:56.259> not<00:04:56.470> good

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
again so that's that's not good

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.159 
again so that's that's not good
and<00:04:57.639> this<00:04:57.880> feet<00:04:58.120> on<00:04:58.270> little<00:04:58.479> ball<00:04:58.720> joins<00:04:59.020> it

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
and this feet on little ball joins it

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.300 
and this feet on little ball joins it
again<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.680> fit<00:04:59.860> just<00:05:00.250> fine<00:05:01.620> as<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:02.800> thought<00:05:03.010> that

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
again to fit just fine as I thought that

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.150 
again to fit just fine as I thought that
