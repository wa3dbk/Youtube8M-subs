00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
in phases because when I first did this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.500 
in phases because when I first did this
I<00:02:24.379> connected<00:02:25.379> all<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.890> them<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:27.090> took<00:02:27.330> about

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
I connected all of them and took about

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.949 
I connected all of them and took about
eight<00:02:27.720> minutes<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.200> Windows<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.620> start<00:02:29.690> as<00:02:30.690> it

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
eight minutes for Windows to start as it

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.559 
eight minutes for Windows to start as it
had<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.200> individually<00:02:32.120> connect<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.390> each

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
here we have the 10 ports on the board

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.979 
here we have the 10 ports on the board
we<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:48.989> our<00:02:49.230> two<00:02:50.000> USB<00:02:51.000> 3<00:02:51.269> headers<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.660> are

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
we have our two USB 3 headers that are

you know add another 20 or 30 seconds to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.940 
you know add another 20 or 30 seconds to
that<00:04:24.300> but<00:04:24.870> all<00:04:25.050> things<00:04:25.260> considered<00:04:25.410> that's

it can actually give you two drives of

it can actually give you two drives of

which<00:05:54.480> I<00:05:54.660> obviously<00:05:55.340> just<00:05:56.340> ripped<00:05:56.580> from<00:05:56.790> the

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
which I obviously just ripped from the

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.360 
which I obviously just ripped from the
blu-rays<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:57.630> I<00:05:57.660> own<00:05:57.950> um<00:06:00.260> and<00:06:01.260> you're<00:06:01.710> hot

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
blu-rays that I own um and you're hot

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.730 
blu-rays that I own um and you're hot
that's<00:06:02.610> just<00:06:03.060> terrible<00:06:03.390> alright<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.440> you're

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
that's just terrible alright so you're

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.280 
that's just terrible alright so you're
saying<00:06:05.010> I'm<00:06:05.190> averaging<00:06:05.910> somewhere<00:06:06.390> around<00:06:06.450> 45

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
saying I'm averaging somewhere around 45

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.850 
saying I'm averaging somewhere around 45
50<00:06:07.800> megabytes<00:06:08.160> a<00:06:08.310> second<00:06:08.700> which<00:06:09.060> I<00:06:09.860> don't

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
50 megabytes a second which I don't

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.190 
50 megabytes a second which I don't
consider<00:06:11.310> really<00:06:11.970> all<00:06:12.180> that<00:06:12.570> bad<00:06:15.080> let's<00:06:16.080> go

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
consider really all that bad let's go

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.170 
consider really all that bad let's go
ahead<00:06:16.350> take<00:06:16.530> a<00:06:16.590> look<00:06:16.830> up<00:06:17.040> here<00:06:17.100> you<00:06:17.700> should<00:06:18.150> see

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
ahead take a look up here you should see

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.830 
ahead take a look up here you should see
kind<00:06:18.750> of<00:06:19.370> various<00:06:20.370> technisat<00:06:21.060> technicolor

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
kind of various technisat technicolor

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.860 
kind of various technisat technicolor
blinking<00:06:22.260> lights<00:06:22.470> as<00:06:22.710> it<00:06:22.860> kind<00:06:23.130> of<00:06:23.870> passes

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
blinking lights as it kind of passes

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.250 
blinking lights as it kind of passes
those<00:06:25.050> bits<00:06:25.350> across<00:06:25.680> all<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.040> drives<00:06:27.260> so

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
those bits across all the drives so

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.850 
those bits across all the drives so
really<00:06:28.850> somewhere<00:06:29.850> I<00:06:29.880> you<00:06:30.300> know<00:06:30.390> I<00:06:30.710> looks<00:06:31.710> like

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
really somewhere I you know I looks like

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.240 
really somewhere I you know I looks like
I<00:06:31.950> go<00:06:32.070> down<00:06:32.280> to<00:06:32.660> 35<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:34.050> then<00:06:34.140> up<00:06:34.229> to<00:06:34.380> 60<00:06:34.830> and

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
I go down to 35 and then up to 60 and

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.579 
I go down to 35 and then up to 60 and
then

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
then

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.949 
then
this<00:06:37.589> does<00:06:38.519> not<00:06:38.549> seem<00:06:38.909> to<00:06:38.969> be<00:06:39.119> a<00:06:39.449> really<00:06:39.749> an

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:39.959 
this does not seem to be a really an

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:43.879 
this does not seem to be a really an
appreciable<00:06:40.549> drop<00:06:41.549> so<00:06:42.479> yeah<00:06:43.169> look<00:06:43.589> I'm<00:06:43.709> up<00:06:43.829> in

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
appreciable drop so yeah look I'm up in

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:51.469 
appreciable drop so yeah look I'm up in
the<00:06:44.009> 70s<00:06:44.629> already<00:06:45.629> um<00:06:47.539> beautiful<00:06:48.539> all<00:06:49.349> right
