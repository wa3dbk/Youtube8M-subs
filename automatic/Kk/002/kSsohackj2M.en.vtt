on<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.800> because<00:00:59.070> brass<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
on it because brass is one of the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
on it because brass is one of the
biggest<00:01:00.000> contributors<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.570> lead<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> think
