00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650 

the<00:00:25.660> fact<00:00:25.930> that<00:00:26.079> 2012<00:00:27.009> the<00:00:27.460> date<00:00:27.669> in<00:00:27.849> 2012<00:00:28.360> is

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
the fact that 2012 the date in 2012 is

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.140 
the fact that 2012 the date in 2012 is
close<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:29.259> 2014<00:00:30.130> is<00:00:30.310> completely<00:00:31.119> a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
close to 2014 is completely a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.690 
close to 2014 is completely a
coincidence<00:00:31.720> this<00:00:32.250> up-and-coming<00:00:33.250> solar

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
coincidence this up-and-coming solar

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.150 
coincidence this up-and-coming solar
cycles<00:00:34.180> roughly<00:00:34.600> 2014<00:00:35.230> it's<00:00:35.770> not<00:00:35.890> really

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
cycles roughly 2014 it's not really

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.360 
cycles roughly 2014 it's not really
going<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.370> be<00:00:36.489> significantly<00:00:36.820> different<00:00:37.570> than

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
going to be significantly different than

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.150 
going to be significantly different than
the<00:00:39.370> next<00:00:39.640> one<00:00:39.790> and<00:00:39.940> then<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.180> previous<00:00:40.600> one

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the next one and then the previous one

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.099 
the next one and then the previous one
the<00:00:42.160> Sun<00:00:42.519> is<00:00:43.000> what<00:00:43.210> we<00:00:43.269> call<00:00:43.420> an<00:00:43.510> active<00:00:43.840> star

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
the Sun is what we call an active star

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.189 
the Sun is what we call an active star
and<00:00:44.469> hit<00:00:44.800> as<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.920> cycle<00:00:45.460> of<00:00:45.579> activity<00:00:46.090> over<00:00:46.719> 11

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
and hit as a cycle of activity over 11

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.279 
and hit as a cycle of activity over 11
years<00:00:47.230> we<00:00:47.739> go<00:00:47.949> to<00:00:48.519> higher<00:00:48.820> activity<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:49.809> back

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
years we go to higher activity and back

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.650 
years we go to higher activity and back
down<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.769> lower<00:00:50.949> activity<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:51.609> so<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:51.910> 11

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
down to lower activity and so this 11

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.869 
down to lower activity and so this 11
years<00:00:53.079> is<00:00:53.410> fairly<00:00:53.769> steady<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.370> it's<00:00:54.730> been

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
years is fairly steady and it's been

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.579 
years is fairly steady and it's been
happening<00:00:55.059> through<00:00:55.629> time<00:00:55.870> as<00:00:56.109> far<00:00:56.289> as<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.469> can

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
a very thick atmosphere and so that

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.170 
a very thick atmosphere and so that

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
see that the effect is not enough to

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.370 
see that the effect is not enough to
damage<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.790> atmosphere<00:01:22.180> such<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.660> we<00:01:23.200> are

the time and they hit the earth once or
twice<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.530> week<00:01:32.860> sometimes<00:01:33.550> more<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.800> in

twice a week sometimes more and in

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.430 
twice a week sometimes more and in
general<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.610> effects<00:01:37.270> are<00:01:37.480> minimal<00:01:37.630> if<00:01:38.260> we

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
general the effects are minimal if we

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.620 
general the effects are minimal if we
have<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.620> really<00:01:38.890> big<00:01:39.130> one<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:40.030> have<00:01:40.210> very

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
have a really big one you can have very

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.410 
have a really big one you can have very
strong<00:01:40.900> Aurora<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:42.340> then<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.790> can<00:01:43.030> affect

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
strong Aurora but then you can affect

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.110 
strong Aurora but then you can affect
satellites<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.710> power<00:01:45.310> grids<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:45.970> these

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
satellites and power grids and so these

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.090 
satellites and power grids and so these
are<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.360> kind<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.600> things<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:47.050> people<00:01:47.950> who
