00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.280 
behind the ear and get a neat line there
let's<00:01:34.729> have<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.939> look<00:01:35.119> at<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.360> again<00:01:35.420> through

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
let's have a look at that again through

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.460 
let's have a look at that again through
the<00:01:36.439> other<00:01:36.560> side<00:01:36.920> we<00:01:37.610> use<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.180> layer<00:01:39.140> guide

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
the other side we use the layer guide

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.330 
the other side we use the layer guide
open<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.520> teeth<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:41.750> through<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.290> side<00:01:42.530> roll

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
open the teeth in through the side roll

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.560 
open the teeth in through the side roll
back<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.000> again<00:01:44.720> open<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.710> teeth<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:47.150> base

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
back and again open the teeth the base

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.990 
back and again open the teeth the base
of<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.110> layer<00:01:48.860> guide<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.460> goes<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.850> the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
of the layer guide it goes to the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.420 
of the layer guide it goes to the
hairline<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.780> then<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.740> roll<00:01:51.979> back<00:01:52.009> from

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
hairline and then you roll back from

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.880 
hairline and then you roll back from
there<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.240> creates<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:54.020> graduated

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
there and this creates that graduated

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.310 
there and this creates that graduated
shape<00:01:55.159> through<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> top<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.119> we're<00:01:56.869> keeping

get<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> perfect<00:02:10.390> shorter<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.599> longer<00:02:11.630> shape

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
get a perfect shorter to longer shape

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.750 
get a perfect shorter to longer shape
through<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.099> sides

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
through the sides

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.910 
through the sides
and<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.299> back<00:02:14.510> doesn't<00:02:15.409> matter<00:02:15.680> how<00:02:15.860> many

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
and the back doesn't matter how many

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.550 
and the back doesn't matter how many
times<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.430> go<00:02:16.549> through<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.209> overlap<00:02:17.989> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
times you go through it just overlap and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.500 
times you go through it just overlap and
you<00:02:18.709> get<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> perfect<00:02:19.250> shape<00:02:19.610> here<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:20.480> are

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
you get the perfect shape here we are

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.449 
you get the perfect shape here we are
again<00:02:20.840> with<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.260> number<00:02:21.530> four<00:02:21.769> trimming<00:02:22.370> up

on the free style of Spica

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.250 
on the free style of Spica
this<00:02:30.739> will<00:02:31.040> create<00:02:31.269> texture<00:02:32.269> through<00:02:32.989> that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
this will create texture through that

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.559 
this will create texture through that
through<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.739> top<00:02:34.099> hair<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:35.329> they<00:02:35.420> be

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
through the top hair we can they be

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.430 
through the top hair we can they be
using<00:02:35.959> this<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.879> crisscross<00:02:37.879> motion<00:02:38.720> like<00:02:39.230> us

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
using this a crisscross motion like us

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.580 
using this a crisscross motion like us
in<00:02:39.620> herringbone<00:02:40.420> shape<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:42.109> we're<00:02:42.260> going<00:02:42.349> from

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
in herringbone shape so we're going from

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.930 
in herringbone shape so we're going from
one<00:02:42.680> side<00:02:43.159> and<00:02:43.489> then<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.269> other<00:02:44.620> going<00:02:45.940> sort

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
one side and then the other going sort

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.039 
one side and then the other going sort
of<00:02:47.060> with<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.359> head<00:02:47.480> where<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.750> hair<00:02:48.019> grows

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
of with the head where the hair grows

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.130 
of with the head where the hair grows
but<00:02:48.560> across<00:02:49.010> them<00:02:49.280> cross<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.940> slightly<00:02:50.239> going

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
but across them cross it slightly going

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.080 
but across them cross it slightly going
backwards<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.829> forwards<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.609> creates

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
backwards and forwards that this creates

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.170 
backwards and forwards that this creates
that<00:02:53.389> lovely<00:02:53.870> spiky<00:02:54.769> texture<00:02:55.340> through<00:02:56.030> the

that lovely spiky texture through the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.930 
that lovely spiky texture through the

top on fine hair you only need to go

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.210 
top on fine hair you only need to go
through<00:02:59.239> once<00:02:59.510> but<00:03:00.079> on<00:03:00.109> thick<00:03:00.500> hair<00:03:00.739> like<00:03:00.980> this

through once but on thick hair like this

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.099 
through once but on thick hair like this
you<00:03:01.730> can<00:03:01.909> go<00:03:02.060> through<00:03:02.329> two<00:03:02.540> or<00:03:02.659> three<00:03:02.870> times

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
you can go through two or three times

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.680 
you can go through two or three times
and<00:03:03.500> create<00:03:04.040> keep<00:03:04.370> creating<00:03:04.700> more<00:03:05.120> texture
