00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that you will be able to make that

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.850 
that you will be able to make that
happen<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.750> yourself<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> same<00:01:37.680> thing

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
happen for yourself and the same thing

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.410 
happen for yourself and the same thing
with<00:01:37.979> Top<00:01:38.189> surgery<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.790> might<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.270> be

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
with Top surgery it might not be

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
with Top surgery it might not be
immediate<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.530> thing<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.829> want

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
immediate but if that's a thing you want

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
immediate but if that's a thing you want
ultimately<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.210> probably<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
ultimately you can probably get it and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.690 
ultimately you can probably get it and
it's<00:01:43.409> kind<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.979> distracting<00:01:44.549> yourself

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
it's kind of like distracting yourself

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.719 
it's kind of like distracting yourself
until<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> those<00:01:45.600> things<00:01:45.659> happen<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
until all of those things happen and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
until all of those things happen and
even<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.659> testosterone<00:01:49.290> even<00:01:49.619> having

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
even going out testosterone even having

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.590 
even going out testosterone even having
Top<00:01:50.220> surgery<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.119> say<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.450> from

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
Top surgery I can say this from

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.889 
Top surgery I can say this from
experience<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.350> does<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.710> alleviate<00:01:53.390> all<00:01:54.390> of

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
experience it does not alleviate all of

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899 
experience it does not alleviate all of
your<00:01:55.020> dysphoria<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.159> Lisa<00:01:56.340> didn't<00:01:56.729> for

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
your dysphoria there at Lisa didn't for

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.580 
your dysphoria there at Lisa didn't for
me<00:01:57.030> before<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.509> was<00:01:57.990> started<00:01:58.320> taking

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
me before I was started taking

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.440 
me before I was started taking
testosterone<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.280> had<00:01:59.490> chest<00:01:59.790> dysphoria<00:01:59.939> but

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
testosterone I had chest dysphoria but

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.120 
testosterone I had chest dysphoria but
not<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> kind<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.530> would<00:02:01.590> prevent<00:02:01.950> me<00:02:02.040> from

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
not the kind that would prevent me from

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.130 
not the kind that would prevent me from
doing<00:02:02.430> things<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.899> didn't

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
doing things and going out and I didn't

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.240 
doing things and going out and I didn't
even<00:02:04.200> bind<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.710> regular

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
even bind that regular

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.590 
even bind that regular
because<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:05.790> bad<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.150> hurt<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.420> just

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
because of how bad it hurt and it just

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.510 
because of how bad it hurt and it just
wasn't<00:02:06.780> worth<00:02:07.050> it<00:02:07.230> for<00:02:07.440> me<00:02:07.470> but<00:02:08.190> after<00:02:08.340> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
wasn't worth it for me but after I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.700 
wasn't worth it for me but after I
started<00:02:08.880> taking<00:02:09.030> testosterone<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.440> got

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
started taking testosterone I just got

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.550 
started taking testosterone I just got
the<00:02:11.250> worst<00:02:11.640> chest<00:02:12.240> dysphoria<00:02:12.420> ever<00:02:12.960> like<00:02:13.380> as

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the worst chest dysphoria ever like as

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
the worst chest dysphoria ever like as
things<00:02:14.430> are<00:02:14.580> getting<00:02:14.820> better<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.390> kind<00:02:15.750> of

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
things are getting better I kind of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
things are getting better I kind of
found<00:02:16.020> things<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.860> made<00:02:17.310> me<00:02:17.520> feel<00:02:17.700> worse

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
found things that made me feel worse

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.840 
found things that made me feel worse
which<00:02:18.530> wasn't<00:02:19.530> intentional<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.490> not<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:20.760> I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
which wasn't intentional it's not like I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.670 
which wasn't intentional it's not like I
did<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.240> it's<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.570> how<00:02:21.780> things<00:02:22.140> started

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
did it it's just how things started

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.260 
did it it's just how things started
feeling<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> same<00:02:23.850> thing<00:02:23.910> with<00:02:24.180> my

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
feeling and it's the same thing with my

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.790 
feeling and it's the same thing with my
top<00:02:24.480> surgery<00:02:24.660> after<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.110> got<00:02:25.230> Top<00:02:25.410> surgery<00:02:25.650> I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
top surgery after I got Top surgery I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.740 
top surgery after I got Top surgery I
was<00:02:26.070> like<00:02:26.190> yes<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.090> i'm<00:02:27.450> not<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.720> to

happy and feel comfortable in my body
but<00:02:31.770> that's<00:02:31.980> just<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:32.250> how<00:02:32.459> bodies<00:02:32.970> work<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390

of moved away from my chest amount of my
hips<00:02:38.880> which<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.209> something<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.750> was<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> little

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
hips which is something I was a little

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.040 
hips which is something I was a little
too<00:02:40.709> small<00:02:40.920> or<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.270> like<00:02:42.360> nothing<00:02:42.690> major<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
ripped abs because I'm afraid that my

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.990 
ripped abs because I'm afraid that my
hips<00:02:49.470> might<00:02:49.709> shine<00:02:49.980> through<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.790> know

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
hips might shine through so you know

we're just gonna for another day the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.100 
we're just gonna for another day the
biggest<00:02:54.150> thing<00:02:54.420> i<00:02:54.510> think<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:54.989> about

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
biggest thing i think you can do about

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.960 
biggest thing i think you can do about
your<00:02:55.290> dysphoria<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.830> kind<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.250> just<00:02:56.280> making<00:02:56.730> it

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
your dysphoria is kind of just making it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
your dysphoria is kind of just making it
through<00:02:57.239> i<00:02:57.450> still<00:02:57.959> haven't<00:02:58.170> gotten<00:02:58.320> over<00:02:58.440> it

through i still haven't gotten over it

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.810 
through i still haven't gotten over it
and<00:02:58.770> i<00:02:58.800> don't<00:02:58.830> think<00:02:59.130> anyone<00:02:59.310> really<00:02:59.520> gets

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
and i don't think anyone really gets

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.250
