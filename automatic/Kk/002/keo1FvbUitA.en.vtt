also been making quite a few repairs as
well<00:00:17.810> too<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.160> after<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.609> few<00:00:20.820> weeks<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
well too so after a few weeks of the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.460 
well too so after a few weeks of the
experience<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:23.010> couple<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.310> repairs<00:00:23.609> down

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
experience and a couple of repairs down

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.650 
experience and a couple of repairs down
and<00:00:25.470> then<00:00:26.369> also<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.180> ton<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> questions

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and then also with a ton of questions

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.740 
and then also with a ton of questions
from<00:00:28.170> guys<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> track<00:00:29.789> about<00:00:30.119> which<00:00:30.570> one

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
from guys at the track about which one

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.950 
from guys at the track about which one
was<00:00:30.990> better<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.890> why<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.270> each<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
was better and why we like each one I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
was better and why we like each one I
figured<00:00:34.380> we'd<00:00:34.559> make<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:35.030> video<00:00:36.030> comparing<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
figured we'd make a video comparing the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.610 
figured we'd make a video comparing the
two<00:00:37.219> to<00:00:38.219> vastly<00:00:38.640> different<00:00:39.030> screwdrivers<00:00:39.620> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
two to vastly different screwdrivers to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.410 
two to vastly different screwdrivers to
different<00:00:40.980> vastly<00:00:41.969> different<00:00:42.300> price<00:00:42.570> ranges

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
different vastly different price ranges

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.700 
different vastly different price ranges
whee-ha<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.850> cheaper<00:00:47.850> wrench<00:00:48.710> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
whee-ha is actually a cheaper wrench and

as<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.280> see<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> physical<00:00:56.699> size<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.449> we--how

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
as you see the physical size the we--how

hoodie is a much larger wrench you're

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.070 
hoodie is a much larger wrench you're
going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.830> torque<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:06.080> screw

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
going to get more torque when you screw

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.890 
going to get more torque when you screw
things<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.130> hoodie<00:01:08.689> than<00:01:09.689> the

the special spring steel tip there you

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.649 
the special spring steel tip there you
you<00:01:25.740> could<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> replacement<00:01:26.630> with<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
you could get a replacement with the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.140 
you could get a replacement with the
whee-ha<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:29.610> can't<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
whee-ha you really can't get a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.179 
whee-ha you really can't get a
replacement<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:32.210> but<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> we

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
replacement on it but I do like the we

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
replacement on it but I do like the we
hop<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.000> does<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> rotating

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
hop because it does have the rotating

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.950 
hop because it does have the rotating
end<00:01:37.560> cap<00:01:37.970> when<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.060> screw<00:01:39.299> things<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.720> it's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
end cap when you screw things in it's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.030 
end cap when you screw things in it's
pretty<00:01:40.229> nice

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
pretty nice

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.710 
pretty nice
I<00:01:41.070> wish<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.939> shaft<00:01:42.750> diameter<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.430> was<00:01:44.720> our

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
I wish the shaft diameter was was our

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
I wish the shaft diameter was was our
order<00:01:46.110> shaft<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.680> longer<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.180> could<00:01:48.329> get

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
order shaft was longer so I could get

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.429 
order shaft was longer so I could get
more<00:01:48.659> torque<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.290> screw<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.860> things<00:01:50.130> but

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
more torque was I screw in things but

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.530 
more torque was I screw in things but
there's<00:01:52.439> enough<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.040> about<00:01:53.329> both<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
there's enough to like about both of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.069 
there's enough to like about both of
them<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:55.969> it's<00:01:56.969> nice<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.479> both<00:01:57.689> really

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
them that it's nice to have both really

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.670 
them that it's nice to have both really
but<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.060> had<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.210> choose<00:02:00.390> between<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.960> two

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
but if I had to choose between the two

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.630 
but if I had to choose between the two
I<00:02:01.710> would<00:02:02.100> go<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:04.020> know<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.290> only<00:02:04.409> had

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
I would go you know if I only had

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.940 
I would go you know if I only had
stranded<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> desert<00:02:05.969> island<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
stranded on a desert island and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.350 
stranded on a desert island and
essentially<00:02:07.950> only<00:02:08.099> had<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.759> tool<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> I

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
essentially only had one tool that I

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.460 
essentially only had one tool that I
could<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:10.020> would<00:02:10.590> definitely<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.459> hoodie

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
could use I would definitely go hoodie

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.310 
could use I would definitely go hoodie
just<00:02:13.680> because<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.460> like<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.510> amount<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
just because I like the the amount of

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.650 
just because I like the the amount of
torque<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.830> could<00:02:16.980> get<00:02:17.160> out<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.550> hoody<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
torque I could get out of the hoody and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.320 
torque I could get out of the hoody and
also<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.100> longer<00:02:20.550> reach<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
also because the longer reach of the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.760 
also because the longer reach of the
shaft<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:23.880> all<00:02:24.240> in<00:02:24.660> all<00:02:24.750> both<00:02:25.050> our<00:02:25.380> mantra

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
shaft but all in all both our mantra
