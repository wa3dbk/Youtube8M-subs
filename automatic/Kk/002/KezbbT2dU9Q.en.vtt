00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
 aa good eating 

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.050
 for years this little one a member of the original 151 pokémon was 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.669
 commonly regarded as the last in terms of the history of the 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.599
 depressing backgrounds 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.549
 is saddened by the mother who will not see 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.789
 when seeing a portrait of his mother in the full moon 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.460
 the spots on the skull that he is wearing are of his tears he takes the skull of 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.649
 his mother never reveals his true face 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.839
 she cries because she misses her mother 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.849
 he misses his mother because she is dead 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.739
 and even worse in the original games you can actually find the ghost 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.690
 from the mother of a coupon of a long etc 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.270
 that was killed by the roque team 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 killed 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.400
 by roque team it seems that someone did not prepare for the problems 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.490
 there is a positive side however at the time of rising from bitter level to etc 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.740
 the pokédex informs you that it has grown hard to overcome the pain of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.500
 losing his mother tempered and hardened spirit does not break easily 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.550
 motivated and hardened by the death of his mother 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.300
 hardened spirit 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.600
 dishes of wild beatings to others 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.060
 that's basically pokémon batman 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.580
 vane that generates energy for the placement of strong curses 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.950
 pinning pins in his own body 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.920
 this pokémon was originally a stuffed animal that unfortunate 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.950
 they want 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.200
 looked for the child that the reduction 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.040
 yes as if the globes the shadows lamps and santa claus did not present 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.920
 enough of a threat on their own we now have to deal with the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.550
 toys that came out of a dumpster motivated by hatred could 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.550
 is the velvet rabbit brandy lantern well the sporting 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.400
 the lesson pokemones less and less with this one is clear never duncan never let 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.180
 of playing with many juveniles 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.500
 especially the video games about catching monsters 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.280
 by last 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.190
 we have our champion the new owner of the title for more disturbing 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.200
 pokémon of all time 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.400
 Of course, it does not seem like a big thing, as if I'm missing Super Mario Bros 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.950
 he had a couple of drinks and wants to enter a fist fight but wait 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.479
 these confirm arose from the spirits of the people buried in 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.039
 common graves in past eras 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.039
 each one keeps the memories of his previous life 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.879
 one of them wears a mask that used to be his face when that 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.669
 sometimes the mine does not cry 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.290
 very well 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.429
 let's do this by numbers 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:37.149
 first of all the idea that pokémon used to be people this gives a 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.459
 completely new approach to the very idea of ​​this game 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.049
 in which what is being done is to bottle the souls of the dead and 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.629
 send them to battle with your enemies 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.180
 us the data the televangelist is again in the nineties were in 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.249
 the truth all the time 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.869
 in second place they preserve the memories of their lives 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.839
 I used to have a wife 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:59.969
 children 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.709
 He spent a lot of time thinking about them asking if they miss me 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.759
 but sure 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.069
 I'm going to hit that electric knee for you 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.439
 it's not like I have another choice 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.620
 this is basically the conception of dante of hell 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:20.039
 in third place each of them wears a mask that used to be his face 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.469
 directly creepy 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.469
 fourth and last sometimes the 20 hours 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.269
 coupons for hours because he misses his mother 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.669
 that is understandable 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.239
 nevertheless fell the one of horrendous horror existence than it has become 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.079
 while looking at the face once it arrived as a human being before it 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.899
 his condition was reduced 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:45.899
 only to get rid of the weight and the indignity of all 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.689
 and then it becomes a conscious sarcophagus that kills the thieves of 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.959
 tombs 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.979
 I have not passed the game yet so I have not seen the credits but I'm 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.059
 Pretty sure that these characters were designed by Franz Kafka 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:05.159
 pokémon has changed a lot of the children's series that used to be or the game in 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.159
 black and white that came out for a portable pocket console 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.929
 amazing
