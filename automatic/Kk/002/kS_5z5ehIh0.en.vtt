00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.180 
easy to the creature in left it's a
little<00:03:10.760> bit<00:03:10.970> harder<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:11.660> still<00:03:12.560> easy<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:12.890> take

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
little bit harder but still easy to take

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.170 
little bit harder but still easy to take
down<00:03:15.040> as<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.190> can<00:03:16.340> see<00:03:16.490> every<00:03:16.700> time<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:16.940> kill
