00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
know okay so the cooler we're gonna be

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.440 
know okay so the cooler we're gonna be
using<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.990> video<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.830> cooler<00:02:18.100> master

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
using for the video is the cooler master

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.980 
using for the video is the cooler master
812<00:02:19.450> TPC<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:21.070> reason<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.460> like<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.270> cooler<00:02:22.570> it

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
812 TPC the reason I like this cooler it

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.690 
812 TPC the reason I like this cooler it
works<00:02:23.350> very<00:02:23.710> well<00:02:23.830> I've<00:02:24.130> actually<00:02:24.370> had<00:02:24.670> a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
works very well I've actually had a

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.150 
works very well I've actually had a
system<00:02:25.150> at<00:02:25.270> 5<00:02:25.420> gigahertz<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.800> know<00:02:26.920> it

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
system at 5 gigahertz on it so I know it

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.670 
system at 5 gigahertz on it so I know it
can<00:02:27.190> handle<00:02:27.820> higher<00:02:28.750> clock<00:02:29.020> speeds<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.560> what

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
can handle higher clock speeds and what

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.440 
can handle higher clock speeds and what
we'll<00:02:29.830> be<00:02:29.920> doing<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.310> I'll<00:02:30.459> actually<00:02:30.610> crank

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
we'll be doing is I'll actually crank

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.720 
we'll be doing is I'll actually crank
this<00:02:31.630> up<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.900> anywhere<00:02:32.740> between<00:02:32.890> 4<00:02:33.340> &amp;<00:02:33.550> 5

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
this up to anywhere between 4 &amp; 5

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.810 
this up to anywhere between 4 &amp; 5
gigahertz<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.590> fan<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.130> originally<00:02:36.550> comes

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
gigahertz the fan that originally comes

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.100 
gigahertz the fan that originally comes
with<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.709> cooler<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.670> cooler<00:02:40.090> master<00:02:40.360> I

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
with the cooler is a cooler master I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.630 
with the cooler is a cooler master I
feel<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.590> fan<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:41.980> actually<00:02:42.370> called

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
feel that this fan is actually called

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.300 
feel that this fan is actually called
because<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.030> does<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.570> name<00:02:44.100> but<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.220> a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
because it does have a name but it's a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.030 
because it does have a name but it's a
2,000<00:02:45.820> rpm<00:02:46.180> fan<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.780> pushes<00:02:47.080> probably<00:02:47.560> quite<00:02:48.010> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
2,000 rpm fan it pushes probably quite a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.790 
2,000 rpm fan it pushes probably quite a
bit<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.340> airflow<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:50.080> is<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> really<00:02:50.620> good

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
bit of airflow so it is a really good

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.270 
bit of airflow so it is a really good
fan<00:02:51.130> for<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:52.000> come<00:02:52.239> stock<00:02:52.750> with<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.260> cooler<00:02:53.470> so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
fan for to come stock with the cooler so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.410 
fan for to come stock with the cooler so
we're<00:02:54.520> gonna<00:02:54.610> go<00:02:54.820> ahead<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.030> use<00:02:55.150> this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
we're gonna go ahead and use this

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.670 
we're gonna go ahead and use this
because<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:56.290> didn't<00:02:56.980> have<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.870> my<00:02:59.140> desk<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.560> have

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
because I didn't have in my desk I have

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.380 
because I didn't have in my desk I have
a<00:02:59.739> bunch<00:02:59.920> of<00:02:59.980> Excalibur's<00:03:00.670> they<00:03:01.000> throw<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.330> lot

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
a bunch of Excalibur's they throw a lot

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.900 
a bunch of Excalibur's they throw a lot
of<00:03:01.570> air<00:03:01.780> out<00:03:02.020> there<00:03:02.980> they're<00:03:03.340> pretty<00:03:03.489> decent

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
of air out there they're pretty decent

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.300 
of air out there they're pretty decent
fans<00:03:04.120> too<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.739> would<00:03:05.739> have<00:03:05.860> liked<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.070> have

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
fans too I would have liked to have

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.630 
fans too I would have liked to have
compared<00:03:06.700> these<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.800> but<00:03:08.800> for<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.340> time

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
compared these to that but for the time

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.920 
compared these to that but for the time
being<00:03:09.670> we're<00:03:10.000> gonna<00:03:10.090> use<00:03:10.330> this<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.810> we're

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
being we're gonna use this and we're

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.250 
being we're gonna use this and we're
gonna<00:03:11.050> see<00:03:11.230> how<00:03:11.350> things<00:03:11.590> go

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
gonna see how things go

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.450 
gonna see how things go
so<00:03:14.260> let's<00:03:14.560> get<00:03:14.890> into<00:03:15.549> some<00:03:16.440> testing

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
so let's get into some testing

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:55.800 
so let's get into some testing
a<00:03:53.280> little<00:03:54.280> bit<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.490> speck<00:03:54.700> about<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.060> fans<00:03:55.300> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
a little bit of speck about the fans the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.150 
a little bit of speck about the fans the
fans<00:03:55.840> pull<00:03:56.520> 1.44<00:03:57.520> watts<00:03:57.990> there<00:03:59.020> loudness<00:03:59.770> that

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
fans pull 1.44 watts there loudness that

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.610 
fans pull 1.44 watts there loudness that
the<00:04:00.280> decibels<00:04:00.700> is<00:04:00.880> twenty<00:04:01.450> nine<00:04:01.480> point<00:04:02.290> five

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
the decibels is twenty nine point five

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.220 
the decibels is twenty nine point five
or<00:04:02.680> something<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:04.180> as<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.390> can<00:04:04.540> hear<00:04:04.600> back

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
or something but as you can hear back

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.930 
or something but as you can hear back
here<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.680> don't<00:04:05.980> even<00:04:06.250> know<00:04:06.340> if<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.490> can<00:04:06.610> hear

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
here I don't even know if you can hear

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.260 
here I don't even know if you can hear
it<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.950> doesn't<00:04:09.160> sound<00:04:09.400> like<00:04:09.670> twenty<00:04:09.940> nine<00:04:10.120> to

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
it it doesn't sound like twenty nine to

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.840 
it it doesn't sound like twenty nine to
me<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.900> sounds<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.200> lot<00:04:11.320> quieter<00:04:11.590> whereas<00:04:12.580> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
me it sounds a lot quieter whereas the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.060 
me it sounds a lot quieter whereas the
coolermaster<00:04:13.690> family<00:04:14.050> was<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.440> lot<00:04:14.860> louder

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
coolermaster family was a lot louder

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.479 
coolermaster family was a lot louder
than<00:04:15.430> this<00:04:15.580> one<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.800> this<00:04:17.800> right<00:04:18.160> now<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.370> think

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
than this one and this right now I think

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.060 
than this one and this right now I think
the<00:04:18.850> speed<00:04:19.210> is<00:04:19.540> like<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.680> want<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.460> say<00:04:23.070> 1750

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
the speed is like it I want to say 1750

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.210 
the speed is like it I want to say 1750
so<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.490> not<00:04:24.640> quite<00:04:24.880> at<00:04:25.000> eighteen<00:04:25.360> fifty

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
so it's not quite at eighteen fifty

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.100 
so it's not quite at eighteen fifty
meaning<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.280> cooler<00:04:27.550> master<00:04:27.730> fan<00:04:28.150> on<00:04:28.480> because

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
meaning the cooler master fan on because

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.840 
meaning the cooler master fan on because
I<00:04:29.200> just<00:04:29.380> have<00:04:29.530> them<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.860> CPU<00:04:30.280> header<00:04:30.430> so

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
I just have them to the CPU header so

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.880 
I just have them to the CPU header so
that's<00:04:31.000> another<00:04:31.240> thing<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.870> 4-pin<00:04:33.030> pwm<00:04:34.030> fan

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
that's another thing is a 4-pin pwm fan

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.110 
that's another thing is a 4-pin pwm fan
so<00:04:35.890> right<00:04:36.040> now<00:04:36.190> I'm<00:04:36.310> looking<00:04:36.430> at<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.790> speed

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
so right now I'm looking at the speed

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.950 
so right now I'm looking at the speed
yeah<00:04:37.360> I've<00:04:37.450> said<00:04:37.630> 1750<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:39.540> you<00:04:40.540> can<00:04:40.660> see<00:04:40.810> right

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
yeah I've said 1750 so you can see right

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.130 
yeah I've said 1750 so you can see right
here<00:04:41.200> it's<00:04:41.620> fluctuating<00:04:42.070> back<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.580> forth<00:04:43.140> but

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
here it's fluctuating back and forth but

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.920 
here it's fluctuating back and forth but
right<00:04:44.320> around<00:04:44.700> 1757<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.510> temps<00:04:46.840> are

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
right around 1757 and the temps are

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.210 
right around 1757 and the temps are
pretty<00:04:47.140> good<00:04:47.260> right<00:04:47.500> now<00:04:47.650> I'm<00:04:47.800> just<00:04:47.950> I'm<00:04:48.190> not

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
pretty good right now I'm just I'm not

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.010 
pretty good right now I'm just I'm not
running<00:04:48.670> any<00:04:48.790> benchmarks<00:04:49.420> but<00:04:49.570> I<00:04:49.600> did<00:04:49.840> run

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
running any benchmarks but I did run

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.620 
running any benchmarks but I did run
some<00:04:50.230> benchmarks<00:04:52.530> on<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.800> fans<00:04:54.040> this<00:04:54.970> one<00:04:55.270> is

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
some benchmarks on the fans this one is

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.400 
some benchmarks on the fans this one is
a<00:04:55.660> stock<00:04:56.200> fan

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
a stock fan

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.970 
a stock fan
and<00:04:57.920> let<00:04:58.520> me<00:04:58.580> go<00:04:58.700> ahead<00:04:58.730> and<00:04:58.850> open<00:04:59.030> this

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.010 

well<00:05:03.980> that's<00:05:04.160> hardware<00:05:04.640> mornin<00:05:05.210> sorry<00:05:05.480> wrong

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
well that's hardware mornin sorry wrong

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.840 
well that's hardware mornin sorry wrong
one<00:05:06.610> so<00:05:07.610> if<00:05:07.730> the<00:05:07.880> stock<00:05:08.180> fan<00:05:08.510> I<00:05:08.960> ran<00:05:09.850> prime95

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
one so if the stock fan I ran prime95

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.470 
one so if the stock fan I ran prime95
for<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.360> bit<00:05:11.570> so<00:05:12.500> decays<00:05:12.890> on<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.220> right<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.760> the

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
for a bit so decays on the right and the

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.210 
for a bit so decays on the right and the
Coolermaster<00:05:15.110> stock<00:05:15.320> fan<00:05:15.620> for<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:15.980> cooler

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
Coolermaster stock fan for that cooler

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.940 
Coolermaster stock fan for that cooler
is<00:05:16.490> on<00:05:16.670> the<00:05:16.850> left<00:05:17.290> so<00:05:18.290> as<00:05:18.380> you<00:05:18.470> can<00:05:18.590> see<00:05:18.770> the

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
is on the left so as you can see the

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.070 
is on the left so as you can see the
temps<00:05:19.370> they<00:05:19.550> kind<00:05:20.090> of<00:05:20.150> look<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.420> same<00:05:20.690> right

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
temps they kind of look the same right

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.240 
temps they kind of look the same right
here

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
here

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.300 
here
they're<00:05:23.000> both<00:05:23.150> had<00:05:23.390> 100%<00:05:24.110> they<00:05:24.710> both<00:05:24.920> hit<00:05:25.100> four

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
they're both had 100% they both hit four

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.660 
they're both had 100% they both hit four
point<00:05:25.580> five<00:05:25.730> gigahertz<00:05:26.830> they<00:05:27.830> both<00:05:28.070> ran<00:05:28.370> from

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
point five gigahertz they both ran from

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.400 
point five gigahertz they both ran from
about<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:29.030> same<00:05:29.270> 15<00:05:29.900> minutes

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
about the same 15 minutes

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.570 
about the same 15 minutes
well<00:05:30.770> this<00:05:30.890> 16<00:05:31.340> 15<00:05:31.880> 33<00:05:32.650> but<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.740> max<00:05:33.950> temp<00:05:34.340> that

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
well this 16 15 33 but the max temp that

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.230 
well this 16 15 33 but the max temp that
I'm<00:05:34.820> seeing<00:05:35.240> on<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.810> ek<00:05:36.200> fan<00:05:36.580> on<00:05:37.580> one<00:05:37.820> car<00:05:38.060> was

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
I'm seeing on the ek fan on one car was

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.950 
I'm seeing on the ek fan on one car was
71<00:05:38.750> whereas<00:05:39.650> on<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.520> cooler<00:05:41.180> master<00:05:41.390> fan<00:05:41.780> the

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
71 whereas on the cooler master fan the

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.160 
71 whereas on the cooler master fan the
max<00:05:42.140> temp<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.530> saw<00:05:42.740> was<00:05:42.950> 76<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.810> maximum

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
max temp I saw was 76 and the maximum

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.360 
max temp I saw was 76 and the maximum
temps<00:05:45.650> on<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.100> cooler<00:05:46.310> master<00:05:46.460> fan<00:05:48.280> 99%<00:05:49.280> of

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
temps on the cooler master fan 99% of

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.520 
temps on the cooler master fan 99% of
them<00:05:49.580> are<00:05:49.820> in<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.180> 70s<00:05:50.660> there's<00:05:50.990> one<00:05:51.230> that's<00:05:51.440> a

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
them are in the 70s there's one that's a

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.760 
them are in the 70s there's one that's a
69<00:05:52.240> whereas<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.630> EK<00:05:53.960> fan<00:05:54.260> is<00:05:54.680> 66<00:05:55.370> 69<00:05:55.730> 65<00:05:56.600> 65<00:05:57.290> 68

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
69 whereas the EK fan is 66 69 65 65 68

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.990 
69 whereas the EK fan is 66 69 65 65 68
and<00:05:57.980> 71<00:05:58.520> so<00:05:59.330> overall<00:05:59.960> I<00:06:00.410> would<00:06:00.470> say<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:01.220> EK<00:06:01.730> fan

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
and 71 so overall I would say the EK fan

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.120 
and 71 so overall I would say the EK fan
performed<00:06:02.600> a<00:06:02.750> lot<00:06:02.960> better<00:06:03.260> than<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.860> cooling

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
performed a lot better than the cooling

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.510 
performed a lot better than the cooling
master<00:06:04.430> fan<00:06:04.670> not<00:06:05.330> only<00:06:06.040> temporize<00:06:07.040> i<00:06:07.070> mean

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
master fan not only temporize i mean

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.980 
master fan not only temporize i mean
right<00:06:07.640> here<00:06:07.850> looking<00:06:08.360> at<00:06:08.420> these<00:06:08.570> temps<00:06:08.900> they

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
right here looking at these temps they

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.320 
right here looking at these temps they
look<00:06:09.200> pretty<00:06:09.440> close<00:06:09.620> to<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.890> same

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
look pretty close to the same

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.430 
look pretty close to the same
but<00:06:12.320> overall<00:06:12.890> maximum<00:06:13.430> temp<00:06:13.970> the<00:06:14.510> the<00:06:15.050> EK

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
but overall maximum temp the the EK

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.790 
but overall maximum temp the the EK
outperformed<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:17.030> cooler<00:06:17.450> master<00:06:17.660> and<00:06:18.170> it's

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
outperformed the cooler master and it's

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.110 
outperformed the cooler master and it's
also<00:06:19.010> quieter<00:06:20.020> it's<00:06:21.020> a<00:06:21.140> less<00:06:21.350> rpm<00:06:21.790> because<00:06:22.790> you

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
also quieter it's a less rpm because you

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.460 
also quieter it's a less rpm because you
could<00:06:23.270> actually<00:06:23.420> get<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:23.840> higher<00:06:24.020> rpm

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
could actually get the higher rpm

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.750 
could actually get the higher rpm
versions<00:06:25.280> so<00:06:25.880> I<00:06:25.910> mean<00:06:26.390> for<00:06:26.720> an<00:06:27.260> 1850<00:06:28.160> this<00:06:28.460> fan

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
versions so I mean for an 1850 this fan

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.670 
versions so I mean for an 1850 this fan
is<00:06:28.790> pretty<00:06:29.150> quiet<00:06:29.360> it's<00:06:29.810> I<00:06:30.200> I<00:06:31.900> don't<00:06:32.900> hear<00:06:33.140> 29

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
is pretty quiet it's I I don't hear 29

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.370 
is pretty quiet it's I I don't hear 29
point<00:06:33.980> whatever<00:06:34.430> decibels<00:06:35.300> that's<00:06:36.080> for<00:06:36.230> sure
