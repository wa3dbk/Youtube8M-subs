you<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.390> rapid<00:00:39.690> fire<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.920> as

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you with rapid fire so this is going as

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.690 
you with rapid fire so this is going as
fast<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.399> okay<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.980> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> what<00:00:47.309> rapid

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
fast as okay and then this is what rapid

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.060 
fast as okay and then this is what rapid
fire<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.780> wrap<00:00:48.930> fires<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.410> fourth<00:00:49.739> LED

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
fire when wrap fires on the fourth LED

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.810 
fire when wrap fires on the fourth LED
blinks<00:00:50.489> rapidly<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> now<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.789> with<00:00:53.789> our

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
blinks rapidly so now this is with our

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.119 
blinks rapidly so now this is with our
rep<00:00:54.090> fire<00:00:55.550> it's<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:56.940> faster<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.949> next

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
