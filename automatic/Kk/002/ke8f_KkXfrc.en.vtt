sometimes these fiberglass poles split
and<00:00:10.190> shatter<00:00:11.180> so<00:00:11.510> you<00:00:11.599> need<00:00:11.750> to<00:00:11.840> put<00:00:11.960> a<00:00:11.990> new

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.140 
and shatter so you need to put a new

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.780 
and shatter so you need to put a new
section<00:00:12.590> in<00:00:12.680> you<00:00:12.800> don't<00:00:12.950> always<00:00:13.220> need<00:00:13.550> to<00:00:13.610> buy

demonstration we're just going to

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.290 
demonstration we're just going to
pretend<00:00:33.830> that<00:00:34.160> this<00:00:34.370> yellow<00:00:34.640> pole<00:00:34.910> here<00:00:35.180> is

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300

pretend that this yellow pole here is
the<00:00:35.420> one<00:00:35.540> that<00:00:35.660> shattered<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.470> this<00:00:36.800> is<00:00:36.920> the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
the one that shattered and this is the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.860 
the one that shattered and this is the
section<00:00:37.400> we<00:00:37.490> need<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.760> change<00:00:38.060> and<00:00:38.420> we'll<00:00:38.690> put

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
section we need to change and we'll put

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.720 
section we need to change and we'll put
in<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.050> new<00:00:39.230> black<00:00:39.470> section<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.190> keep<00:00:40.640> the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
in a new black section and keep the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.760 
in a new black section and keep the
overall<00:00:41.030> length<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.360> same<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.410> first<00:00:42.650> thing

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
overall length the same so first thing

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.860 
overall length the same so first thing
to<00:00:42.860> do<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:43.340> make<00:00:43.520> your<00:00:43.610> poles<00:00:43.850> straight<00:00:44.210> so

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
to do is make your poles straight so

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:58.290 
to do is make your poles straight so
we'll<00:00:45.050> lay<00:00:45.200> out<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.560> whole<00:00:45.590> pole<00:00:46.870> magic

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.180 

that's<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.080> whole<00:00:59.230> pole<00:00:59.470> strike<00:00:59.800> I'll<00:01:00.010> put

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
that's the whole pole strike I'll put

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.100 
that's the whole pole strike I'll put
the<00:01:00.250> spare<00:01:00.490> section<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:00.970> one<00:01:01.090> side<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.989> do

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
the spare section to one side you do

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.960 
the spare section to one side you do
need<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.470> get<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.710> elastic<00:01:05.860> which<00:01:06.550> is<00:01:06.700> running

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
need to get the elastic which is running

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.500 
need to get the elastic which is running
through<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.150> middle<00:01:07.480> out<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:08.800> do<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:10.030> pull

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
through the middle out so we do is pull

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.770 
through the middle out so we do is pull
the<00:01:10.540> elastic<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:12.490> end<00:01:12.700> bearing<00:01:13.390> in<00:01:13.480> mind<00:01:13.510> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
the elastic one end bearing in mind the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.969 
the elastic one end bearing in mind the
yellow<00:01:13.990> section<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.530> section<00:01:14.680> we're

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
yellow section is the section we're

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.060 
yellow section is the section we're
changing<00:01:15.400> so<00:01:15.880> obviously<00:01:16.210> work<00:01:16.450> from<00:01:16.660> this<00:01:16.750> end

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
changing so obviously work from this end

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.770 
changing so obviously work from this end
get<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.160> nice<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.340> taut<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.360> we're<00:01:19.510> lucky

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
get it nice and taut and we're lucky

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.120 
get it nice and taut and we're lucky
they're<00:01:19.930> not<00:01:19.960> falling<00:01:20.500> out<00:01:20.620> but<00:01:20.890> sometimes

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
they're not falling out but sometimes

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.680 
they're not falling out but sometimes
they're<00:01:21.490> not<00:01:21.520> doesn't<00:01:21.940> fall<00:01:22.150> out<00:01:22.300> because<00:01:22.479> it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
they're not doesn't fall out because it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.960 
they're not doesn't fall out because it
might<00:01:22.810> be<00:01:22.930> caught<00:01:23.200> all<00:01:23.860> we<00:01:23.979> need<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.250> do<00:01:24.400> is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
might be caught all we need to do is

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.030 
might be caught all we need to do is
bang<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.360> knot<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.780> pole<00:01:25.990> against<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.590> put<00:01:26.800> a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
bang the knot the pole against you put a

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.520 
bang the knot the pole against you put a
few<00:01:27.670> short<00:01:27.940> steps<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.540> think<00:01:28.900> we'll<00:01:29.140> then<00:01:29.260> just

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
few short steps I think we'll then just

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.650 
few short steps I think we'll then just
drop<00:01:29.740> out<00:01:29.979> or<00:01:30.220> occasionally<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.240> might<00:01:31.450> need

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
drop out or occasionally you might need

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.969 
drop out or occasionally you might need
just<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.960> pick<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.229> out<00:01:32.320> with<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.530> crochet<00:01:32.770> hook

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
just to pick it out with a crochet hook

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.020 
just to pick it out with a crochet hook
or<00:01:33.250> something<00:01:33.580> like<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:34.830> then<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.759> pair<00:01:36.940> of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
or something like that then the pair of

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.730 
or something like that then the pair of
scissors<00:01:37.330> we<00:01:37.990> cut<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.320> knob<00:01:40.470> okay<00:01:41.470> we've<00:01:41.619> got

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
scissors we cut the knob okay we've got

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.020 
scissors we cut the knob okay we've got
our<00:01:41.770> pair<00:01:42.009> of<00:01:42.100> scissors<00:01:42.399> we're<00:01:42.729> now<00:01:42.850> going<00:01:42.970> to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
our pair of scissors we're now going to

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.600 
our pair of scissors we're now going to
cut<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.300> knot<00:01:43.390> off<00:01:44.430> nice<00:01:45.430> clean<00:01:45.729> cut<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:47.259> then

the<00:01:48.610> elastic<00:01:49.060> go<00:01:49.149> through<00:01:49.390> but<00:01:49.540> don't<00:01:49.720> let<00:01:49.930> it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
the elastic go through but don't let it
