00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
server itself the spawn area and a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.310 
server itself the spawn area and a
single<00:00:40.110> base<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.550> server<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.320> faction

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
single base now this server is a faction

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.720 
single base now this server is a faction
server<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.040> guys<00:00:44.160> don't<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.610> the

server and if you guys don't know the
faction<00:00:45.149> server<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> basically<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:47.100> kind<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
faction server is basically it's kind of

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
faction server is basically it's kind of
like<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> lord<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> rings'<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.570> think

amount I think it's like 10k you can buy
one<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.549> those<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.970> put<00:03:01.030> all<00:03:01.930> your<00:03:02.049> valuables
