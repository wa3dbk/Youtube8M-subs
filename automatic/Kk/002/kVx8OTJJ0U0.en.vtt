00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Ladies and gentlemen, 

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:08.501
 The winners of the 74th Hunger Games 

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:10.802
 Katniss Everdeen 

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:12.003
 and Peeta Mellark! 

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:20.404
 She is not the one they believe. 

00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:24.605
 She just wants to save her skin, it's as simple as that. 

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.006
 But she became their glimmer of hope 

00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:29.907
 that is why it must be eliminated. 

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:31.608
 What do you think? 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.309
 I agree, she must die, but in the right way, at the right time. 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.310
 Katniss Everdeen is a symbol, no need to destroy her, just her image. 

00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:43.911
 Show them that she is ours now. 

00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:47.112
 We must convince them. 

00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:53.413
 And they will hate her so much that they will kill her for you. 

00:00:54.214 --> 00:00:55.214
 No! 

00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:02.214
 Haymitch, please help me survive this tour! 

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:04.915
 This tour will not be finished when you return home. 

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:05.716
 So what do we do? 

00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:08.817
 From now on, your mission is to entertain the people, 

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:11.818
 so that people forget what their real problems are. 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:15.019
 Head high, big smile. 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.820
 Here it is, Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire! 

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:25.221
 People are watching you, Katniss! 

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:29.022
 You gave them an opportunity, they just have to be brave enough to grab it. 

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.923
 You saved my life, you gave me a chance! 

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.024
 Yes, to live! 

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:34.225
 No. To do something! 

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:37.726
 We have to go, Gale, before they kill us. 

00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:39.327
 They will kill us. 

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:45.328
 No! 

00:01:52.328 --> 00:01:53.828
 Go for it! 

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.229
 His entire species must be eradicated. 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.930
 His kind, sir? 

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:03.231
 The other winners! 

00:02:03.232 --> 00:02:05.532
 Because of her, they all represent a threat. 

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:11.533
 Because of her, they think they are all invincible.
