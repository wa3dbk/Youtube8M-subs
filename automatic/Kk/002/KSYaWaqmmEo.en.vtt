00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
my fingers from holding the fender well

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.910 
my fingers from holding the fender well
is<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.750> little<00:04:02.960> white<00:04:03.170> lid<00:04:03.440> it's<00:04:03.710> like<00:04:03.800> the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
is that little white lid it's like the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.040 
is that little white lid it's like the
top<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.430> jar<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.150> when<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:05.570> take<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.870> top

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
top of a jar and when you take the top

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.170 
top of a jar and when you take the top
of<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.290> jar<00:04:06.470> off<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.950> low<00:04:07.490> beam<00:04:07.700> headlight

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
of the jar off the low beam headlight

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.060 
of the jar off the low beam headlight
and<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.560> electrical<00:04:09.560> connections<00:04:09.950> will

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
and the electrical connections will

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.550 
and the electrical connections will
behind<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.520> so<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:10.670> makes<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:10.940> watertight<00:04:11.600> some

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
behind it so it makes it watertight some

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.110 
behind it so it makes it watertight some
may<00:04:12.770> or<00:04:12.860> may<00:04:12.950> not<00:04:12.980> have<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.520> black<00:04:13.730> Center

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120

button in it yeah hey mods owners I came

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.770 
button in it yeah hey mods owners I came
back<00:04:18.350> over<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.830> the<00:04:19.010> driver<00:04:19.400> side<00:04:19.640> I<00:04:20.090> have<00:04:20.660> the

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
back over to the driver side I have the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.000 
back over to the driver side I have the
wheel<00:04:20.960> on<00:04:21.230> this<00:04:21.470> side<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:23.090> put<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.390> bulb<00:04:23.630> in

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
wheel on this side and I put the bulb in

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.590 
wheel on this side and I put the bulb in
it's<00:04:25.010> hard<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.310> show<00:04:25.490> but<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:28.880> in<00:04:29.090> there<00:04:29.300> so

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
it's hard to show but it is in there so

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.140 
it's hard to show but it is in there so
it's<00:04:29.750> important<00:04:30.230> on<00:04:30.440> this<00:04:30.620> side<00:04:31.150> to

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
it's important on this side to

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.480 
it's important on this side to
understand<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.840> on<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:35.260> passenger<00:04:36.260> side<00:04:36.490> that

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
understand is on the passenger side that

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.550 
understand is on the passenger side that
the<00:04:37.760> passenger<00:04:38.300> side<00:04:38.450> if<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.110> look<00:04:39.260> at<00:04:39.410> this

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
the passenger side if you look at this

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.920 
the passenger side if you look at this
is<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.770> old<00:04:39.890> bulb<00:04:40.130> it's<00:04:40.490> burnt<00:04:40.760> out<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.750> see

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
is the old bulb it's burnt out you see

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.300 
is the old bulb it's burnt out you see
the<00:04:41.960> little<00:04:42.200> Spade<00:04:42.560> that's<00:04:42.800> on<00:04:42.980> there<00:04:43.130> on<00:04:43.220> the

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
the little Spade that's on there on the

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.750 
the little Spade that's on there on the
passenger<00:04:43.850> side<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.390> pointed<00:04:45.140> like

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
passenger side it pointed like

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.880 
passenger side it pointed like
horizontally<00:04:46.760> towards<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.270> engine<00:04:47.390> block

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
horizontally towards the engine block

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.590 
horizontally towards the engine block
however<00:04:48.890> on<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:50.530> driver<00:04:51.530> side<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.970> tab<00:04:53.240> is

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
however on the driver side the tab is

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.650 
however on the driver side the tab is
actually<00:04:54.520> points<00:04:55.520> down<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.850> little<00:04:56.330> bit<00:04:56.510> to

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
actually points down a little bit to

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.450 
actually points down a little bit to
like<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.960> eight<00:04:57.140> o'clock<00:04:57.410> position<00:04:58.070> on<00:04:58.280> the

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
like the eight o'clock position on the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.670 
like the eight o'clock position on the
so<00:04:59.180> it's<00:04:59.300> pointing<00:04:59.660> to<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.930> lower<00:05:00.170> left<00:05:00.470> if

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
so it's pointing to the lower left if

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.350 
so it's pointing to the lower left if
you<00:05:00.830> were<00:05:00.920> sitting<00:05:01.190> in<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.370> driver<00:05:01.610> seat<00:05:01.730> and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
you were sitting in the driver seat and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.600 
you were sitting in the driver seat and
that's<00:05:02.570> how<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:02.990> goes<00:05:03.140> in<00:05:03.380> make<00:05:03.620> sure<00:05:03.830> the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
that's how it goes in make sure the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.550 
that's how it goes in make sure the
light<00:05:04.880> is<00:05:05.120> fully<00:05:05.420> inserted<00:05:05.810> into<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.290> socket

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
light is fully inserted into the socket

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.150 
light is fully inserted into the socket
again<00:05:07.310> that<00:05:07.670> tab<00:05:08.620> kind<00:05:09.620> of<00:05:09.680> hard<00:05:09.830> to<00:05:09.890> show<00:05:10.040> it

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
again that tab kind of hard to show it

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.909 
again that tab kind of hard to show it
on<00:05:10.520> video<00:05:10.820> my<00:05:11.240> thumb<00:05:11.450> is<00:05:11.600> on<00:05:11.750> it's<00:05:12.710> about<00:05:12.860> a

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
on video my thumb is on it's about a

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.650 
on video my thumb is on it's about a
seven<00:05:13.340> thirty<00:05:13.640> eight<00:05:13.790> o'clock<00:05:14.000> position<00:05:14.540> it

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
seven thirty eight o'clock position it

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.540 
seven thirty eight o'clock position it
will<00:05:14.750> go<00:05:14.900> into<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.440> socket<00:05:16.040> on<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.280> driver

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
will go into the socket on the driver

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.610 
will go into the socket on the driver
side
