00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
wrong and they start to crumble what

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.540 
wrong and they start to crumble what
I'll<00:04:33.130> probably<00:04:33.370> end<00:04:33.730> up<00:04:33.910> doing<00:04:33.970> is

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
I'll probably end up doing is

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.400 
I'll probably end up doing is
shrink-wrapping<00:04:36.550> them<00:04:36.970> not<00:04:37.840> because<00:04:38.080> the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
shrink-wrapping them not because the

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.890 
shrink-wrapping them not because the
shrink-wrap<00:04:38.919> actually<00:04:39.580> prevents<00:04:40.300> the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
shrink-wrap actually prevents the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.720 
shrink-wrap actually prevents the
deterioration<00:04:41.820> but<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:43.060> will<00:04:43.240> hold<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.870> shoes

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
deterioration but it will hold the shoes

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.820 
deterioration but it will hold the shoes
together<00:04:45.730> like<00:04:46.150> without<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.410> shrink-wrap

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
together like without the shrink-wrap

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.220 
together like without the shrink-wrap
holding<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.430> upper<00:04:48.580> together<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.720> shoes<00:04:49.990> is

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
holding the upper together the shoes is

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.610 
holding the upper together the shoes is
gonna<00:04:50.440> continue<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:51.450> crumble<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:52.810> fall<00:04:52.870> apart

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
gonna continue to crumble and fall apart

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.909 
gonna continue to crumble and fall apart
so<00:04:53.940> once<00:04:54.940> I<00:04:55.060> get<00:04:55.210> these<00:04:55.330> open<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.500> check<00:04:56.710> them

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
so once I get these open and check them

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.630 
so once I get these open and check them
out<00:04:57.100> we'll<00:04:58.000> do<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.270> shrink-wrapping<00:04:58.870> thing

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
out we'll do the shrink-wrapping thing

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.690 
out we'll do the shrink-wrapping thing
here<00:05:00.640> they<00:05:00.850> are<00:05:01.090> oh<00:05:01.419> boy<00:05:02.400> original<00:05:03.400> everything

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
here they are oh boy original everything

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.870 
here they are oh boy original everything

there's<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.360> cracked<00:05:07.780> back<00:05:08.530> part<00:05:08.979> of<00:05:09.100> the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
there's the cracked back part of the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.650 
there's the cracked back part of the
shoe<00:05:10.530> there<00:05:11.530> we<00:05:11.650> go<00:05:12.000> they<00:05:13.000> definitely<00:05:13.360> look

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
shoe there we go they definitely look

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.980 
shoe there we go they definitely look
pretty<00:05:14.020> well<00:05:14.320> worn<00:05:14.880> at<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:15.940> first<00:05:16.270> glance<00:05:16.540> you

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
pretty well worn at a first glance you

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.320 
pretty well worn at a first glance you
can<00:05:17.050> see<00:05:17.200> that<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:18.280> toe<00:05:18.550> right<00:05:18.850> here<00:05:19.090> has<00:05:19.300> a

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
can see that the toe right here has a

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.900 
can see that the toe right here has a
lot<00:05:19.600> of<00:05:19.660> creasing<00:05:20.290> when<00:05:21.220> we<00:05:21.340> look<00:05:21.550> around<00:05:21.669> the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
lot of creasing when we look around the

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.540 
lot of creasing when we look around the
back<00:05:22.240> right<00:05:22.570> here<00:05:22.930> you<00:05:23.770> can<00:05:23.950> see<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.370> the

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
back right here you can see that the

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.870 
back right here you can see that the
foam<00:05:24.940> part<00:05:25.560> around<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.860> back<00:05:27.130> is<00:05:27.430> like<00:05:27.610> just

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
foam part around the back is like just

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.080 
foam part around the back is like just
barely<00:05:28.270> holding<00:05:28.630> itself<00:05:29.229> up<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:29.860> like<00:05:30.760> I<00:05:30.880> said

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
barely holding itself up and like I said

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.029 
barely holding itself up and like I said
there's<00:05:31.330> really<00:05:31.539> nothing<00:05:32.200> that<00:05:32.229> you<00:05:32.380> can<00:05:32.710> do

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
there's really nothing that you can do

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.200 
there's really nothing that you can do
to<00:05:33.970> prevent<00:05:34.600> this<00:05:35.430> cracking<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.640> chipping

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
to prevent this cracking and chipping

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.230 
to prevent this cracking and chipping
and<00:05:37.470> deterioration<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:38.950> it's<00:05:39.729> actually<00:05:40.090> one

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
and deterioration and it's actually one

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.409 
and deterioration and it's actually one
of<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.390> reasons<00:05:40.600> why<00:05:41.050> I've<00:05:41.410> decided<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:42.419> sell

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
of the reasons why I've decided to sell

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.690 
of the reasons why I've decided to sell
the<00:05:43.450> shoes<00:05:43.810> ium<00:05:44.140> is<00:05:44.440> I<00:05:44.620> can't<00:05:44.890> hold<00:05:45.130> on<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.490> this

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
the shoes ium is I can't hold on to this

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.100 
the shoes ium is I can't hold on to this
stuff<00:05:46.000> forever<00:05:47.460> until<00:05:48.460> it<00:05:49.150> completely<00:05:49.630> falls

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
stuff forever until it completely falls

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.760 
stuff forever until it completely falls
apart<00:05:50.729> let's<00:05:51.750> check<00:05:52.750> out<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.110> other<00:05:53.140> pair<00:05:53.680> of

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
apart let's check out the other pair of

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.640 
apart let's check out the other pair of
shoes<00:05:54.479> for<00:05:55.479> the<00:05:55.539> other<00:05:55.750> shoe<00:05:56.080> rather<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:56.470> don't
