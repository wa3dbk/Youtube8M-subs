00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.610
 we twist the cloths once 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:31.750

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.270
 provisions can be made for the uterus if we 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.640
 we sit on the left splits 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.160
 Tanaka goes to the left side 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.120

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.120
 right and 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.550

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.780
 hang free position 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.640
