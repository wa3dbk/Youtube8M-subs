00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
pack but I think there's 300 and almost

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.290 
pack but I think there's 300 and almost
400<00:03:11.280> cards<00:03:11.520> in<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.700> set<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:13.820> odds<00:03:14.820> aren't<00:03:15.090> too

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
400 cards in the set so odds aren't too

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.000
