became a steel type which would make

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.610 
became a steel type which would make
more<00:00:34.530> sense<00:00:35.239> but<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.510> doesn't<00:00:37.140> make<00:00:37.559> sense

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
more sense but what doesn't make sense
