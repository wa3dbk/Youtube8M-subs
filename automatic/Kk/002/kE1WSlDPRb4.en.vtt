United States and Europe it's not as if

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.580 
United States and Europe it's not as if
the<00:02:39.030> dollar<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.540> Euro<00:02:39.780> weren't<00:02:40.140> going<00:02:40.410> to

inflate rapidly in the future anyway but
I<00:02:43.860> think<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.400> trend<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.970> really<00:02:45.510> going<00:02:45.660> to

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
I think this trend is really going to

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.990 
I think this trend is really going to
accelerate<00:02:46.200> things<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.340> believe<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> or<00:02:47.850> not

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
accelerate things but believe it or not

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.640 
accelerate things but believe it or not
none<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.510> what<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.989> said<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.380> really

none of what I just said is really

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
value so if you do have a significant

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.720 
value so if you do have a significant
amount<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.320> savings<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:20.070> think<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.400> easiest

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
amount of savings I think the easiest

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.430 
amount of savings I think the easiest
thing<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.060> do<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:21.690> transition<00:03:22.200> over<00:03:22.410> a

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
thing to do is just transition over a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.069 
thing to do is just transition over a
small<00:03:22.860> percentage<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.610> your<00:03:23.910> savings<00:03:24.840> into

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
small percentage of your savings into

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.360 
small percentage of your savings into
precious<00:03:25.290> metals<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:25.950> haven't<00:03:26.220> done<00:03:26.310> so

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
precious metals if you haven't done so

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.280 
precious metals if you haven't done so
already<00:03:26.579> that<00:03:27.480> way<00:03:27.570> you're<00:03:27.720> less<00:03:27.750> likely<00:03:27.930> to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
already that way you're less likely to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.479 
already that way you're less likely to
feel<00:03:28.500> nervous<00:03:28.739> about<00:03:29.040> it

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
feel nervous about it

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.039 
feel nervous about it
and<00:03:29.730> people<00:03:30.000> have<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.150> lot<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.420> questions<00:03:30.840> about

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
and people have a lot of questions about

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.319 
and people have a lot of questions about
precious<00:03:31.440> metals<00:03:31.560> investing<00:03:32.370> there's<00:03:32.790> plenty

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
metals are tied together you don't

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.580 
metals are tied together you don't
really<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.590> worry<00:03:46.799> about<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.670> much<00:03:47.970> I

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
really have to worry about it so much I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.080 
really have to worry about it so much I
personally<00:03:49.590> preferred<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.489> invest<00:03:50.910> in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
personally preferred not to invest in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.670 
personally preferred not to invest in
gold<00:03:51.269> because<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.780> prefer<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.200> invest<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.620> a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
gold because I prefer to invest in a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.080 
gold because I prefer to invest in a
precious<00:03:52.980> metal<00:03:53.250> that's<00:03:53.400> gonna<00:03:53.549> actually<00:03:53.760> be

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
precious metal that's gonna actually be

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.120 
precious metal that's gonna actually be
used<00:03:54.299> for<00:03:54.450> something<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:55.170> society<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:55.920> day

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
used for something in society one day

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.979 
used for something in society one day
but<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.790> think<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.090> most<00:03:57.269> important<00:03:57.720> thing<00:03:57.870> is

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
but I think the most important thing is

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.110 
but I think the most important thing is
just<00:03:58.140> not<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.500> continue<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.130> be<00:03:59.250> paralyzed<00:03:59.820> by

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
just not to continue to be paralyzed by

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.780 
just not to continue to be paralyzed by
fear<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.420> indecision<00:04:01.010> because<00:04:02.010> even<00:04:02.579> if<00:04:02.670> you

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
fear and indecision because even if you

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.819 
fear and indecision because even if you
make<00:04:02.970> every<00:04:03.390> mistake<00:04:03.600> in<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.019> book<00:04:04.230> investing

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
make every mistake in the book investing

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.259 
make every mistake in the book investing
in<00:04:04.920> precious<00:04:05.070> metals<00:04:05.549> over<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> last<00:04:06.000> ten

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269

in precious metals over the last ten
years<00:04:06.480> for<00:04:06.630> example<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.140> still<00:04:07.560> would<00:04:07.769> have

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
years for example you still would have

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.380 
years for example you still would have
done<00:04:08.040> better<00:04:08.220> than<00:04:08.489> almost<00:04:08.880> anyone<00:04:09.329> who

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
done better than almost anyone who

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.900
