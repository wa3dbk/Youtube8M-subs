00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.389
 hi me if this month we're going 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.440
 to talk about a new difficulty a little 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.029
 we're going to say that we're going to talk about disassembling 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.990
 for sure that there the demonstrations I 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.640
 will show you it's going to be very 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.369
 impressive at first but actually 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.890
 it is to really explain to you that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.300
 with some trial technique 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.830
 just arrived a little enduro you 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.090
 will have to get into 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.099
 the focus as quickly as possible to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.770
 make a very big acceleration at 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.960
 foot of climb up a bit more than 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.280
 half to three quarters and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.379
 three quarters it will have to start at 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.260
 turn off the gas lightly to get 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.250
 at the top of the climb without gas and you 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.800
 see that that's what will you 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.590
 help pass that if you keep gas 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.930
 until have spent three quarters of the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.480
 ride the bike will start to skate and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.129
 you will lose very quickly to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.050
 adhesion and until the moment when the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.699
 wheel will go into water and there you will 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.260
 more grip than when you pull 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.010
 on the top or then you will be 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.840
 obliged to go back down 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.049
 so in fact we have to get to stay 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.820
 standing up at the feet being seated 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.920
 but get up in the middle of the climb 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.409
 why break a little the effect of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.220
 height at the top of the climb that will you 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.220
 help get past the obstacle 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.220
 so here we are going downhill 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.680
 different happiness so who has his dreams 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.490
 we must descend slowly up to stand 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.490
 in their sights and 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.890
 hop there is to go slowly tackle me 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.510
 on the front brake hop on wheeled place 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.630
 back via 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.140
 we will do the technique 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.760
 bergamasco pedal with people 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.430
 No, but you have to take a mix 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.120
 and from there I cut the gases for 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.120
 keep the traction 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.000
 going 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.959
 finally their big guns 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.959
 and then we run for my father 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.439
 we come back on the climbs it's a 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.299
 part that is who is really 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.120
 awesome for some people 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.950
 who have never done so that's for sure 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.319
 we exaggerate a bit like idir and mimi 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.700
 cook him to the point of crossing but 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.819
 in fact, it's just an exercise 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.170
 to learn how to manage his climbs that 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.640
 often we endure we find climbs 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.920
 very difficult with roots and everything 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.599
 that's it I 'll really show you 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.400
 because in fact you have to take the money 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.140
 where we can so for here it's houba 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.670
 houba East Coast after nearly 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.709
 two meters of the climb game 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.030
 practically I cut everything megas for 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.650
 that inertia of the rear wheel me 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.780
 raise the climb quite easily 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.220
 so it's sure that at the beginning it's 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.670
 difficult to do but you have to arrive 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.500
 pretty fast low regime and as long as we 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.959
 when we go up we cut the gases for 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.819
 get to pass pretty easily the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.870
 climb so here I make you a 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.870
 demonstration in pictures 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.940
 it's very simple, you have to put some guy 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.940
 right here 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.540
 and from there more nice guys 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.540
 easy sales 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.720
 from there we cut the gases to the world 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.720
 easy I was talking here 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.230
 three courses 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.400
 just go for the pleasure of the eyes 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.240
 so here we are at the last quarter of the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.890
 shows that the optical effect directly 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.310
 but hey we're three-quarters 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.140
 so I'm doing my big acceleration I 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.900
 begins to slow to cut gas 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.490
 done is practically here I pass that 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.200
 on theirs actually if we see the 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.510
 marks of 30 we fed up, even patinated 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.070
 not sell you up like that that's 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.160
 to tell you that it was technical in 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.420
 lends itself to all obstacles 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.650
 it's not because today we are 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.480
 on a climb that is pretty 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.460
 impressive and very big than that 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.230
 serves that there actually it's going to serve you to 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.580
 learn to master this technique 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.290
 on big climbs but after you 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.690
 go to the reporter on the 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.120
 crossing on slabs 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.600
 slippery any relationship with 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.450
 attraction 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.380
 this effect is there and you that helps you to 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.690
 to pass obstacles 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.870
 if one day you stumble on something 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.640
 is well tried to make the effort of the 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.020
 hit and cut the gas at least 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.490
 you pass this hurdle and you will see 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.990
 to make it easier to do 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.990
 more neatly your bag
