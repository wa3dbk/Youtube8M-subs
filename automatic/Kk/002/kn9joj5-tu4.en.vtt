00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 want to print at home 3d model now 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.590
 this technology is available to anyone 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.340
 we understand that and how all this hi 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.780
 ferra.ru 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.490
 today we are visiting the company then 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.310
 plinth and talk about the general 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.029
 director of constantin his new 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 rarity say at home yourself kampai 3d print 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.949
 us I am with partners for about a year 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.519
 back started the company 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.019
 then we did the skirting before 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.090
 business by digital agency and render 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 website creation services for 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.420
 branding 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.180
 even set up offices for several 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.219
 banks What are the advantages when printing 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.980
 difference from others but when compared 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 impart a part of other technologies then 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.829
 you can say something like this then 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 print 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.489
 additive technology that allows 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.930
 in fact put some things here 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 case of folding actually again 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.930
 layers layers can be powder can be 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.600
 polymers and the main difference is that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 with technology like a bit router 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 when from a big piece of something for example 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 wood or metal 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.439
 something subtracted cut it 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.689
 traditionally more traditional 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.640
 technology then priority with additive 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.450
 technology 3d printing about something 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.430
 constantly added grown 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.470
 glued together baked and then us 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.240
 interested in printers for the home which 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.869
 today there are systems and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 technology 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.979
 two main technologies home 3d 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.000
 print it 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.040
 where is this printer like maker year 3d 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.460
 touch 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.630
 picasso to wi-fi and quite a lot now 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.670
 enthusiast to invent them time after time 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.579
 new essentially technology lies in 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.579
 the fact that the thread melts them plastic 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.180
 melted and grown some 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.979
 object on the other hand exists and 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.189
 just started its development 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.200
 technology asala style stereo lithography 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.939
 this is technology support material so 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.520
 called photopolymer when when 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.210
 photopolymer liquid 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.420
 no there laser sintering laser 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.910
 sintering layer is also grown object 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.090
 here it is technology more already more 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.950
 flexible than daily printing it allows 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.410
 much more complex objects to grow 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.120
 more and more detailed more 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.000
 complex forms and she, too, now 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.660
 available in such printers as format 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.690
 say what kind of married 3d printing i would 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.819
 started with home printing first 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.099
 the main limitation is definitely 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.780
 the size of the printed objects is limited 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.420
 actually the size of the printer is not not 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.840
 very big second limitation is 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.310
 surface quality that can 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.709
 done with you are aiming increasingly 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.110
 Only one printer can be seen as 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.650
 called lamination visible layers with 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.150
 by which the object is built and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.989
 probably the last limitation is 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.750
 speed using home period 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.470
 print impossible to reach 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.720
 production is quite large 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.720
 the number of objects for some 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.359
 sane time every every object 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.980
 lined up in a few hours 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.290
 at least most often it is 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.810
 8-10 hours for more or less average 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.889
 objects in the industrial print a few 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.489
 less stage constraints as if 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.160
 all pretty large number 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:26.329
 technology is technology tears will power 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.980
 jed for print and they all have pretty 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.680
 wide wide range first 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.230
 materials this is plastics this is gypsum 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.410
 photopolymers are now metals in 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.280
 including powdered metals and 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.349
 accordingly restriction 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.670
 there in my opinion something like this 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.440
 cost definitely because 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.169
 cost of materials at the moment 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.990
 still pretty high 3d stuff 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.730
 print while 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.560
 we still have the opportunity 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.530
 optimize it using certain 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.000
 operations with 3d modeling and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.250
 reduce this cost than the pros and 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.800
 cons in it a seal in my opinion 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.540
 the main minus or 5 is that he 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.110
 it is possible to achieve certain properties 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.060
 exactly consumer print properties 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.870
 to make the object look like the one we 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.980
 Now we can not ready to buy in the store 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.140
 pretty smooth he's pretty nice 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.430
 has a pretty nice color and so on 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.620
 this does not seem to be the main minus for this 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.620
 moment technology is not yet so much 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.120
 developed and fails to force such 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.400
 qualities on the one hand on the other 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.310
 hand there is still a problem with certainly 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.470
 so that we see the printer are not like 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.450
 those simple gadgets that 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.530
 can be enjoyed every day and which 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.350
 do not cause problems with settings with nothing 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.850
 this problem because to 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.070
 roughly speaking experience to use 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.840
 a home printer is needed pretty 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.380
 a long time for his training 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.540
 This is probably the main disadvantage of the pros 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.360
 I am sure that in itself is homely 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.000
 print is good 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.430
 good development direction of such here 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.040
 development enthusiasts maybe not even 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.830
 maybe a little handicraft work when 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.900
 at home you can really do something 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.850
 make your own maybe later 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.680
 may even be sold 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.670
 but then there is that psychologists 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.880
 allows maybe this is almost 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.230
 creativity some develop altogether 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.070
 needy david reception 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.490
 I think that not everyone at least not 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.930
 each now that is in the fact that wearing 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.880
 it is reported that we have an internal 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.160
 printer all buy of course it is not 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.630
 so at least because they are expensive 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.530
 as maxim because reality 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.050
 at home they are not needed and in my opinion 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.330
 the main consumers are home 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.030
 printers these are enthusiasts these are designers 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.680
 which need some element 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.430
 who just came up here 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.600
 in just a few hours make it 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.970
 materialize and and his natural 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.910
 copy because the first for these therefore 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.280
 yet strong spread 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.960
 global i would low something possible 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.810
 thanks bone for 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.419
 mutually happy with you was ferra.ru and 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.320
 3d pranks sign up like 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:19.139
 until 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:22.139
 and how much I can covers for iphone and 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.139
 type
