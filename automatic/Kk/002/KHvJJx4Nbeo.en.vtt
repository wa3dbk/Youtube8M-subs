00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.099
 a priest subscribers and just 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.470
 who watch me in this video speech 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.700
 will go about cobalt 2 over 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:22.180
 3 or 3 by 3 by 2 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.119
 puzzle she's simple enough i 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.010
 didn't even know if it made sense 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.050
 tutorial videos on this column but then 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.320
 looked and saw that you do not have 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.390
 okay training video for this 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.790
 Russian column then I decided to do 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.510
 such a head 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.120
 going to just two algorithms you can 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.500
 basically three and collect on 3 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.160
 forgot but I have a little more about it 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.130
 I'll tell you now while I tell you about what 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.690
 this column has parity and immediately 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.170
 will show parity so that later process 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.440
 assembly 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.760
 it was clearer the squat is solved so 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.210
 way r22 r22 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.970
 tordan and 2 that is very easy to solve 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.570
 so that's the cyclic algorithms and he 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.549
 me two opposite edges here 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 actually remember it 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:21.100
 this is useful, and strictly speaking 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.580
 now well here we have a mixed three 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.330
 for three you need to start assembling it with 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.490
 build cross white or yellow let's start 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.920
 according to the standard of the white cross 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.150
 going exactly the same as 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.830
 on cubes 3 on 3 colors absolutely such 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.720
 therefore, there must be problems 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.640
 look to color correctly 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.020
 correlated each other because they 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.240
 can easily change like this 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.729
 four by four lips too not there 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.270
 will meet but in this case me 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.890
 positioned correctly so I will continue 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.690
 after the assembly of christ we must assemble 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.020
 all corners of the right word 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.979
 going very simply let's here 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.810
 this corner is blue-red we twist it on 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.460
 two turns that is, first we put on 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.439
 your slot boat two turns 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.439
 move our cross connect the corner and 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:17.049
 return it and just as we do with 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:21.860
 all other angles are orange see you 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:25.350
 are a 2yoon ra2 clothes r2 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.860
 next meadows orange green 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.400
 r two strokes two and so on and the last 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.580
 the angle is absolutely the same formula and we 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.790
 it turns out Russian is not here it is pavel 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.350
 because if we collect of course 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.550
 the word is automatically oriented 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.460
 top so the following that he already assemble 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.140
 it is to collect corners by the way constantly you 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.240
 there can be placed its essence 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.820
 ax here can be any 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.010
 arranged diagonally that is 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.670
 diagonals need to stop right here 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.220
 Here comes our reforms is hoarded 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.680
 opera mutation temperament i learned 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.530
 but I make a spear a couple of times and bodies 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.100
 will forget just how it is done it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.190
 algorithm 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.260
 hands done and maybe not collected to here 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.570
 so just show here the letters m 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.330
 just be twisted all twice 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:26.190
 you will need to assemble a cube 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.850
 done by such a module yes well observe in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.850
 general behind my movements 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.879
 as we can see the corners were oriented and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.069
 times were put correctly by the soloist 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.349
 further we may have different cases 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.549
 permutation of a series, that is, as usual 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:51.269
 cubes 3 by 3 it is either rarely or a cross 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.629
 full or whether the first, in this case, 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.349
 us zetka 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.349
 or dozens 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.810
 beckons you parity and 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.420
 max 1 hour show let's decide 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:11.790
 some parity that is you remember 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.239
 and we got an hour clock 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.959
 arrow 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:19.739
 in the office I solve it again 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.970
 everything is solved by parity just put two 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.270
 some elements opposite each other 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.570
 such here and we do our parity r2 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.240
 and 2r two and two and two and two are all with you 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.210
 two elements were put and stayed here 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.680
 soar in parity in balance is he 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.860
 two opposite each other 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.450
 element so we will stay so new 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.440
 opposite a friend in this case i put 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.580
 front 2nd bar fr n2 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.590
 I now have each other and 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.340
 do our algorithm 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:55.919
 ar two and two and two and two and two and two and 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:58.970
 We return our setup as you see to battle 3 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.870
 on 3 on 2 saba is a very simple puzzle 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.760
 actually the cross is done 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.650
 exactly the same as on the cubes 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.260
 3 by 3 by 3 that is, if you have 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.270
 cresta run boldly done it and you have it 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.030
 It works like this 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.700
 here's the uncomplicated way going cube 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.660
 if you want to try it yourself 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.870
 collect ie try to drive and 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.970
 to rearrange 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.060
 top layer a little bit different this 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.590
 Maybe I also thought of two ways but 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.250
 then I just saw that you can turn 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.790
 so I hope the video was 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.010
 interesting and informative 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.690
 Thank you all for your attention if you 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.500
 like it like subscribe to 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.500
 channel see you
