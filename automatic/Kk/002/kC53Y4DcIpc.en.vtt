00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.360
 to keep up with the weather 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.220
 on 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:18.300
 to keep up with big teams from the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.970
 switzerland today the pressure was one and 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.880
 me my newcomers still there you have to 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.010
 just step into the pedals and thereby 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.040
 simply with and then with the name al 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.320
 thani the departure has 1 5 seconds and 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.040
 The pressure was always there as I slowly turned off 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.010
 the 15 out but as soon as I get a bit 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.690

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.140

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.120

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.250
 has opened sections of the receiver 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.410
 From the pressure I can tell everyone about the 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.530
 I'm driving at the finish line 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.340
 at the audience's stretch 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.770
 window knocks and 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.910
 But everything was done before everything 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.040
 15 years but in the end I am 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.050
 Satisfied because when I wake up tomorrow 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.050
