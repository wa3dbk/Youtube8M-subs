00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
the camera which I have to look for

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.530 
the camera which I have to look for
somewhere<00:04:29.480> here<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.110> don't<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.710> can<00:04:31.070> find<00:04:31.340> it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
somewhere here I don't I can find it

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.030 
somewhere here I don't I can find it
should<00:04:32.540> be<00:04:32.720> at<00:04:32.840> sea<00:04:33.110> but<00:04:33.290> it's<00:04:33.440> only<00:04:33.560> calendar

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
should be at sea but it's only calendar

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.940 
should be at sea but it's only calendar
clock<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.610> so<00:04:34.790> on<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.000> there<00:04:35.930> might<00:04:36.230> not<00:04:36.290> be<00:04:36.680> a

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
clock and so on so there might not be a

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.850 
clock and so on so there might not be a
calendar<00:04:37.490> app<00:04:37.670> camera<00:04:38.660> app<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:38.990> here<00:04:39.230> which<00:04:39.710> is

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
calendar app camera app on here which is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.230 
calendar app camera app on here which is
quite<00:04:40.100> interesting<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.790> this<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.030> probably

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
quite interesting so this is probably

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.570 
quite interesting so this is probably
only<00:04:41.480> for<00:04:41.720> skyping<00:04:42.050> that's<00:04:42.830> really<00:04:43.280> quite

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
only for skyping that's really quite

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.960 
only for skyping that's really quite

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
strange either I am blind or really

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.260 
strange either I am blind or really
