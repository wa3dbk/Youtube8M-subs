 youth degrade and another box 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.399
 Is this not the embodiment of the manifestation of animals 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.950
 instincts it is clear that the sport but still 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.190
 huyarit on each other's heads will 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.550

 did you know what to answer that question 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.750
 about a kiss on the lips day knows everything and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.850
 even when it seems that the danchik does not know 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:04.920
 danchik anyway know just pretends 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:07.320
 that I watch a lot of things and even so 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.420
 more everything regarding in some kind 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.880
 I try to keep track of me 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.439
 in order not to get into the puddle it to me 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.920
 seems normal natural 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.500
 human desire second question by 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.180
 about boxing 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.900
 how do i take boxing to normal 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:30.119
 I treat boxing boxing is also a sport 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.170
 any sport is a struggle for 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.479
 dominance 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.250
 a way to prove you're better than 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.119
 rest raise your graphic 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.520
 status that is what you swing bitsuha 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.610
 in the gym what are you like you 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.649
 you say fuck and face each other you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.560
 Big try to prove that you are 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.890
 cooler male and all around 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.540
 it is recognized another thing that when you 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.810
 swing bitsuhu in the hall 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.200
 it 's still safer for your 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.250
 heads than when you beat a friend's face 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.750
 To a friend, that's boxing, you know. 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.790
 this is one of the most aggressive decisions 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.579
 to raise your archive 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.670
 fame dominant status one of the most 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.980
 hard and one of the most likely 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.560
 know the ancients that is using aggression 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.319
 using power confrontation 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.579
 prove that you're better yes it's called 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.250
 sport type 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.470
 but in fact physically apply 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.480
 their each other's violence and try 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.650
 using physical violence show that 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.359
 you are better than the rest of the memory can it 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.090
 do with the head that is possible 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.909
 There money to earn books smart 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.159
 write there as frowning girls 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.200
 differently you can raise your dominant 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.930
 status but when you using the physical 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.230
 violence towards other people is 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.840
 but you do it a little in my opinion 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.909
 Of course primitive but because 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.329
 human beings they are in principle 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:06.090
 very primitive in fact it is animals 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.590
 which a little bit there brain appeared for 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.650
 to serve the animals 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.200
 instincts something to be offended somehow there 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.099
 criticize the sense there is no such 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.909
 the essence of a person is someone more rigid 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.530
 trying to prove his ways 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.810
 hierarchy high status someone 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.790
 softer more intelligent 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.579
 ways but the meaning is the same all 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.790
 equal is the struggle for dominance 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.849
 so I am calm besides 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.699
 consider such a moment that boxing is not 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.919
 sure to constantly blows to the head not 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:44.790
 constantly you have a competition 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.949
 most often and most of the people who 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.519
 take up doing amateur confused 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:51.810
 see skim boxing it but i don't know 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.299
 not that f.p. 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.729
 This is such a light mode, that is, the one who 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.870
 went to boxing training know that 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:04.349
 this is a lot of cardio these are some options 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.300
 crossfit is some kind of bundle on pear 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.260
 whether there 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.600
 balapan but it is not constantly here in the face 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.600
 getting in the face has to get 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.130
 very very rarely if we speak 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.830
 just trainer in training for 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.080
 physical health and so on therefore 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:25.640
 there is nothing wrong with that 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.770
 I fully admit that many boxing as 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.490
 cardio as exercise will 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.560
 more enjoyable than running but running 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.110
 you run off there or tv 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.010
 I personally see it more pleasantly but 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.000
 there are people who need 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.070
 meaningfulness some here so as not to 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.230
 he just ran that he ran with some 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.840
 meaning there shied away gave someone 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.240
 surrender and most importantly he believed that 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.740
 he gets cool from this 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.850
 this is most often a person and 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.580
 spurs not just run but also there 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.350
 boxing is not a normal topic 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.860
 see nothing wrong with that if you 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.330
 like boxing if you like it 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.330
 do it
