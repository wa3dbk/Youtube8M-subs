00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.840 

see<00:00:00.450> I<00:00:00.480> don't<00:00:00.630> know<00:00:00.810> like<00:00:01.199> it's<00:00:01.520> the<00:00:02.520> would

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
see I don't know like it's the would

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.849 
see I don't know like it's the would
like<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.210> like<00:00:03.510> with<00:00:03.750> all<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.049> builders<00:00:04.440> now<00:00:04.620> it

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
like I like with all the builders now it

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.559 
like I like with all the builders now it
seems<00:00:05.100> like<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.910> base<00:00:06.089> has<00:00:06.270> become

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
seems like the the base has become

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.930 
seems like the the base has become
significantly<00:00:07.500> larger<00:00:08.400> than<00:00:08.429> they<00:00:08.670> used<00:00:08.880> to

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
significantly larger than they used to

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:20.090 
significantly larger than they used to
be<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:10.139> think<00:00:10.170> that's<00:00:10.500> kind<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.800> bad

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.370 

that's<00:00:20.910> that's<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:21.600> miss<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that's that's what I actually miss and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.170 
that's that's what I actually miss and
that's<00:00:22.500> why<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> decided<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.490> put<00:00:23.609> them<00:00:23.850> back<00:00:23.939> in

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that's why I decided to put them back in

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.670 
that's why I decided to put them back in
and<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.840> isn't<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> time<00:00:25.380> because<00:00:25.619> it

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and this isn't the time because it

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.769 
and this isn't the time because it
wasn't<00:00:25.920> unnecessary<00:00:26.430> cuz<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.689> had

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
wasn't unnecessary cuz like if I had

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.060 
wasn't unnecessary cuz like if I had
more<00:00:27.930> time<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.349> two<00:00:28.410> spent<00:00:28.619> more<00:00:28.710> time<00:00:28.769> for

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
more time or two spent more time for

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.200 
more time or two spent more time for

ether don't know this is what happens
when<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.150> start<00:01:15.180> doing<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:20.490> didn't<00:01:20.939> know

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
when we start doing that you didn't know

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.510 
when we start doing that you didn't know
you<00:01:22.740> did<00:01:26.180> it's<00:01:28.909> picking<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.030> what's<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
you did it's picking up what's going on

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.160 
you did it's picking up what's going on
I'm<00:01:32.520> shifting<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> case<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.869> don't<00:01:33.930> know

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
I'm shifting just the case I don't know

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.100 
I'm shifting just the case I don't know
what's<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.770> anymore<00:01:35.750> well<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> got

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
what's going on anymore well I got

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.800 
what's going on anymore well I got
launched<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:38.150> think<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.689> launch<00:01:41.810> participants

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
launched I think the launch participants

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660 
launched I think the launch participants
so<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> first<00:01:43.740> participant<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.369> move<00:01:44.520> when

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so the first participant don't move when

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.280 
so the first participant don't move when
you<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.570> announce<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.079> the
