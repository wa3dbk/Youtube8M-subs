fight was competitive it was good I felt
that<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.740> had<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:06.189> lease<00:02:06.459> be<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.759> drawer<00:02:07.209> or

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
that it had to lease be a drawer or

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.559 
that it had to lease be a drawer or
something<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.459> wasn't<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:09.910> goal<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
something but that wasn't the goal the

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.990 
something but that wasn't the goal the
goal<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.410> put<00:02:11.620> time<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.129> fight<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.640> look

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
goal is to put time in a fight to look

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.120 
goal is to put time in a fight to look
good

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.700 

but<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:17.940> funny<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.420> me<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:21.170> big<00:02:22.170> business

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.410 
but it's funny to me that big business
of<00:02:22.890> kicking<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.430> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.330 

I'll<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.410> forced<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.950> face<00:02:29.130> Mayweather

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340

a<00:02:34.430> fight<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.390> my<00:02:35.660> opinion<00:02:36.050> he<00:02:36.410> doesn't<00:02:36.830> deserve

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.790 

but

and<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.430> would<00:03:02.580> make<00:03:02.760> more<00:03:02.970> sense<00:03:03.030> who<00:03:03.840> killed

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
and it would make more sense who killed

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.650 
and it would make more sense who killed
worked<00:03:04.440> by<00:03:04.770> unemployed
