 this is the largest reptile 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.280
 the australian marine crocodile it 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.400
 three centimeters in length and 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.470
 can weigh up to one tonne segment of the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.840
 usual cup so it locates a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.990
 meal and potential is staring 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.220
 to the target and slide silently 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.220
 towards you 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:39.170
 a habit is of medium size for this 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:42.550
 crocodile in the year could be a bit 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.550
 but this does not 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.720
 The closer you get, the more you hide. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.720
 in the water 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 O 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.070
 if the cut area and hit serves to break 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.380
 the animal into smaller pieces spice 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.710
 common on the riverbank treats them 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.710
 family 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.350
 on subsequent days body parts and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.350
 clothes can be found downstream 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.400
 the boys have lived together with these 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.070
 crocodiles since the Australians 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.310
 natives appeared almost 50 thousand years ago 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:05.390
 which seem to have reached a 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.250
 understanding with them in a few billion 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.580
 say that crocodiles have agreed to 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.680
 leave people and almost so strange 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.760
 as it may seem these people base 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.760
 in their lives in this 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.730
 when the Europeans arrived in Australia 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.120
 find a more drastic solution 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.120
 activate them 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.319
 it's all service as soon as they 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.990
 searched and they were very close 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.030
 of ending them all in the middle of the century 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.709
 20 the marina group the australian 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.170
 was on the brink of extinction 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.239
 now the animals are protected and 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.200
 have also recovered that once again 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.200
 They are killing people.
