00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
attack it but in my experience it just

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
attack it but in my experience it just
plain<00:00:57.149> doesn't<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.719> that<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.530> have

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
plain doesn't do that you do have

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.529 
plain doesn't do that you do have
limited<00:01:02.010> ammo<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.359> run<00:01:03.510> out

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
limited ammo with this and you run out

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.859 
limited ammo with this and you run out
very<00:01:03.809> quickly<00:01:05.240> although<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.510> does<00:01:06.600> seem<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.780> be

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
very quickly although it does seem to be

crowd control option that uses up 6 or 7
out<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.959> your<00:02:37.080> ammo<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> didn't<00:02:37.500> really<00:02:37.709> look<00:02:37.890> so

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.640 

it's<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.390> little<00:02:42.510> bit<00:02:42.690> strange<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.470> is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
it's a little bit strange that this is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.470 
it's a little bit strange that this is
paired<00:02:43.890> up<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.220> field<00:02:44.520> medic<00:02:44.790> class<00:02:44.940> at

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
paired up with the field medic class at

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.090 
paired up with the field medic class at
first<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.260> me<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.560> didn't<00:02:46.770> make<00:02:46.830> any<00:02:46.890> sense

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
first to me that didn't make any sense

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.920 
first to me that didn't make any sense
but<00:02:47.760> after<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.090> played<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> little<00:02:48.570> bit<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.870> I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
but after it played a little bit and I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.270 
but after it played a little bit and I
know<00:02:48.959> what<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.350> supposed<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.680> do<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.920> kind<00:02:50.160> of

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
know what it's supposed to do it kind of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.430 
know what it's supposed to do it kind of
does<00:02:50.459> make<00:02:50.640> sense<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.600> hypothetically

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
does make sense so hypothetically

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.690 
does make sense so hypothetically
speaking<00:02:52.530> your<00:02:52.890> teammate<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.250> taking<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.580> lot

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
speaking your teammate is taking a lot

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.970 
speaking your teammate is taking a lot
of<00:02:53.850> damage<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.390> surrounded<00:02:54.600> by<00:02:54.930> zetz<00:02:55.290> so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
of damage and is surrounded by zetz so

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.310 
of damage and is surrounded by zetz so
you<00:02:56.070> can<00:02:56.280> pull<00:02:56.489> this<00:02:56.670> thing<00:02:56.910> out<00:02:57.170> pull<00:02:58.170> this

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
you can pull this thing out pull this

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.110 
you can pull this thing out pull this
thing<00:02:58.560> out<00:02:58.650> shoot<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.610> Zed's<00:02:59.820> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
thing out shoot one of the Zed's and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.490 
thing out shoot one of the Zed's and
then<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.420> set<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.750> attacked<00:03:01.019> by<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> others

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
then that set is attacked by the others

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.530 
then that set is attacked by the others
heads<00:03:01.739> making<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.430> diversion<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.420> your

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
heads making a diversion so that your

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.259 
heads making a diversion so that your
teammate<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:03.959> run<00:03:04.140> away<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.670> theory<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
teammate can run away so in theory it

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.520 
teammate can run away so in theory it
kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.570> makes<00:03:06.720> sense<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.080> why<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.320> would

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
kind of makes sense as to why this would

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.430 
kind of makes sense as to why this would
be<00:03:07.590> for<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.830> field<00:03:08.010> medic<00:03:08.220> class<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.730> in

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
be for the field medic class but in

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:43.990 
be for the field medic class but in
practice<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.590> just<00:03:10.620> doesn't<00:03:11.040> work<00:03:11.130> very<00:03:11.190> well

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:55.150 

I<00:03:44.350> hear<00:03:45.350> oh<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.210> just<00:03:47.330> tacking<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.780> bloat

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.060 

now<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.060> am<00:03:56.240> only<00:03:56.630> playing<00:03:56.900> solo<00:03:57.560> on<00:03:57.710> normal

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
now I am only playing solo on normal

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.800 
now I am only playing solo on normal
difficulty<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.940> enemies<00:03:59.240> are<00:03:59.420> quite<00:03:59.780> a

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
difficulty so the enemies are quite a

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.280 
difficulty so the enemies are quite a
bit<00:03:59.960> weaker<00:04:00.610> then<00:04:01.630> if<00:04:02.630> you're<00:04:02.810> playing<00:04:03.110> with

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
bit weaker then if you're playing with

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.660 
bit weaker then if you're playing with
the<00:04:03.380> whole<00:04:03.560> six-man<00:04:04.040> party<00:04:04.340> on<00:04:04.460> a<00:04:04.490> higher

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
the whole six-man party on a higher

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.750 
the whole six-man party on a higher
difficulty<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:05.360> keep<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.720> mind

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
difficulty so keep that in mind

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.540 
difficulty so keep that in mind
something<00:04:07.760> else<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.120> keep<00:04:08.240> in<00:04:08.360> mind<00:04:09.070> this<00:04:10.070> vile

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
something else to keep in mind this vile

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.950 
something else to keep in mind this vile
Thor<00:04:10.760> does<00:04:10.970> not<00:04:11.150> do<00:04:11.330> a<00:04:11.360> whole<00:04:11.540> lot<00:04:11.690> of<00:04:11.720> damage

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
Thor does not do a whole lot of damage

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:25.980 
Thor does not do a whole lot of damage
to<00:04:12.110> bloats<00:04:12.770> for<00:04:13.550> obvious<00:04:13.940> reasons

been<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.310> bloat<00:04:36.610> by<00:04:36.820> our<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.600> um<00:04:38.460> well<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.669> be

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
been the bloat by our it um well to be

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.670 
been the bloat by our it um well to be
honest<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.360> little<00:04:40.780> bit<00:04:40.900> underwhelming<00:04:41.500> it

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
honest is a little bit underwhelming it

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.140 
honest is a little bit underwhelming it
definitely<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.039> most<00:04:42.220> underwhelming<00:04:42.520> weapon

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
definitely the most underwhelming weapon

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.390 
definitely the most underwhelming weapon
of<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.539> new<00:04:43.780> weapons<00:04:44.470> added<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:44.919> now

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
of the new weapons added in now

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.070 
of the new weapons added in now
hypothetically<00:04:46.030> speaking<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.690> looks<00:04:46.960> like

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
hypothetically speaking this looks like

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.450 
hypothetically speaking this looks like
it<00:04:47.229> could<00:04:47.350> be<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.500> great<00:04:47.830> weapon<00:04:48.009> for<00:04:48.430> its

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
it could be a great weapon for its

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.400 
it could be a great weapon for its
advantages<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.360> making<00:04:49.720> sense<00:04:49.930> attack<00:04:50.259> each

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
advantages and making sense attack each

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.990 
advantages and making sense attack each
other<00:04:50.590> but<00:04:50.770> since<00:04:51.009> it's<00:04:51.160> not<00:04:51.310> reliable<00:04:51.639> in

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
other but since it's not reliable in

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.120 
other but since it's not reliable in
doing<00:04:52.389> that<00:04:52.509> it<00:04:52.720> almost<00:04:52.960> never<00:04:53.320> happens

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
doing that it almost never happens

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.460 
doing that it almost never happens
it<00:04:54.910> basically<00:04:55.389> is<00:04:55.810> going<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.110> be<00:04:56.199> a<00:04:56.229> gimmick

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
it basically is going to be a gimmick

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.879 
it basically is going to be a gimmick
and<00:04:56.860> awesome<00:04:57.460> toy<00:04:57.699> stranger<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:59.410> basically<00:04:59.770> I

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
and awesome toy stranger so basically I

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.529 
and awesome toy stranger so basically I
don't<00:05:00.130> really<00:05:00.340> see<00:05:00.580> people<00:05:00.850> using<00:05:01.120> this<00:05:01.360> when

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
don't really see people using this when

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:02.939 
don't really see people using this when
you're<00:05:01.690> playing<00:05:01.990> on<00:05:02.139> higher<00:05:02.320> difficulties

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
you're playing on higher difficulties

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.590 
you're playing on higher difficulties
with<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.190> full<00:05:03.370> squad<00:05:03.729> they're<00:05:04.300> probably<00:05:04.449> just

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
with a full squad they're probably just

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.200 
with a full squad they're probably just
gonna<00:05:04.720> go<00:05:04.900> with<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.050> regular<00:05:05.260> medic<00:05:05.860> gun<00:05:06.210> you

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
gonna go with the regular medic gun you

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.879 
gonna go with the regular medic gun you
can<00:05:07.360> heal<00:05:07.570> people<00:05:07.600> type<00:05:08.139> thing<00:05:08.500> instead<00:05:08.830> of

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
can heal people type thing instead of

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.860 
can heal people type thing instead of
just<00:05:09.010> going<00:05:09.370> with<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:09.880> thing<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.300> is<00:05:10.630> oddly

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
just going with this thing that is oddly

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.390 
just going with this thing that is oddly
tacked<00:05:11.289> onto<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.620> field<00:05:11.860> medic<00:05:12.100> class<00:05:12.160> to
