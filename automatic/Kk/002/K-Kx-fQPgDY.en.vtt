00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.450
 yes hello i am daniel brinkmann me 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.509
 I was born on 29th of June 680 in Detmold 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.400
 has been playing the family since 2004 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 already addressed I come from 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.539
 East Westphalia My parents live someone 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.460
 my grandparents live here my brother 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.890
 in- laws sister-in-law so me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.050
 have in principle all I somewhere 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.430
 you connect with home and therefore 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.399
 is yes that's the feeling that brings me 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.940
 with out of the 2 I actually hate it 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.350
 and I had to do that three times 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.899
 Now make a big move and good 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.820
 but as I said, I'm glad now that 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.180
 I'm back home and hope that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.010
 I did not just have to move yes that was 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.809
 two blocks either manually if five 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 or six can be ours then 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 female players, for example wolfsburg 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.200
 I think here was the elfenberg 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.430
 then the first game for wolfsburg 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.510
 made and shaken vigorously 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.390
 I remember that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.299
 and he is heavy in the climb 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.979
 for example, I was at that time to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.990
 other players are not their own 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.290
 us provider no injury well 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.310
 Remember a great deal of satisfaction 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.409
 me already because 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.490
 Finally, you have to see that I am 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:37.079
 in cottbus or in the second half 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 augsburg three and a half years ago no 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.890
 have done more in cottbus 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.979
 I made four or five duties 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.020
 and that's why I think I am 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.580
 already at 15 or 16 duty play 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.670
 this season and of course one 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.570
 huge step forward 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.369
 Personally, I also see one 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.399
 development does not see the first games 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.649
 and if I play the games now a lot 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.450
 Nevertheless, I also know that's for 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.610
 me is still a way around 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.350
 really 100 percent back to it 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.019
 be such a person injury break from 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.160
 over two and a half years you play 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.720
 Unfortunately not away from one day to the next 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.519
 and for me relatively colleagues people 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.420
 already very painful experience 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.630
 actually the miracle 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.610
 but work so long and hard 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.269
 has what I like I'm doing 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.799
 absolutely want to go back but would have 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.020
 maybe a bit before that 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.730
 lighter 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.140
 a cherished whole i need myself 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 that I put pressure on 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.150
 Of course, I have myself 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.940
 from me too that I that one me 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.330
 leader or will 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:50.420
 that is, I firmly ask 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.260
 only I would have then or then 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.630
 when I decided yet 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.520
 I also have to be a footballer 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.520
 that pressure situations come that 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.020
 not everything is running well and has since 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.560
 as a soccer player you can also live with it 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.940
 can and meanwhile definitely mine 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.290
 son a dog by a walk 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.030
 and more generally the family needs and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.550
 otherwise I like to play tennis 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.380
 in between, it was always difficult 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.510
 if you do not have any training then 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.680
 but escape and sport 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.540
 pursue 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.090
 but who wants to be fit the next day 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.600
 so I do that then more of a 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.970
 summer break or winter break and 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.400
 otherwise it was actually the woman 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.470
 child and dog 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.330
 some say yes, some people air 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.280
 I have to take along with you on such questions 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.180
 at least last page in the amis 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.220
 were heard from pascal testroet though 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.190
 that will definitely be if we have the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.310
 ask my three things because of that 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.480
 yes, very important things in life are 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.070
 very important people in my life 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.070
 to our creature 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.489
 absolutely good team performance 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.400
 We can certainly do better football 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.720
 play but we think of the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.270
 first to last minute everything in 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.980
 put the balance and that was then 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.519
 ultimately also crucial for one 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.540
 earned a successful win 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.570
 I personally have never against 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.570
 which played as a part but I think so 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.610
 It still has to be warm and respectful 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.100
 when teams are not actually one 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.790
 Germany knows professional football 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.130
 create and I just think about that 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.479
 closeness to team performance 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.690
 and not necessarily just about that 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.760
 individual and therefore I think 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.210
 that in any case a compact 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.770
 team before you will certainly 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.880
 from the first to the last minute 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:52.400
 will give everything and with arminia 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.150
 Bielefeld and in the stadium here of course 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.100
 also one of the absolute highlights 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.530
 what has where she thinks i have all these 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.810
 songs and also happy and therefore will 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.830
 I think that's a difficult game 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.900
 as in the game against dresden or against 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.870
 the subway or whoever the 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.560
 anyway up there and where everyone 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.169
 knows what comes but floodlight games 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.090
 are always something special so that can 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.789
 Nobody tells me that not everyone 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.700
 Football feels that way, so there's nothing 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.700
 more beautiful than floodlight play 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.880
 determinations success experiences already 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.880
 Great
