00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.919
 where did you see that we did not 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.660
 answered a number of remarks 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.809
 who made comparisons 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.869
 on the quality of cars 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.029
 we did not play in my place 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.320
 colleague roland romeyer who will surely 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.900
 receive a registered letter from the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 share of his goalkeeper tomorrow morning 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.050
 because it's true that he put him 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.400
 such pressure when speaking of ferrari 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.529
 that sometimes it's hard to arrive 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.410
 when the cars are on the side of Lyon 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.180
 with a shot of michel bastos all at 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.340
 exceptional fact not I am 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.640
 so happy for my supporters to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.370
 we to me who are so happy to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.700
 demonstrate that since actually 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.920
 almost two decades 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.260
 the olympique lyonnais flies over this derby 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.590
 but it's true that we do not build 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.840
 a future and a future by looking 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.390
 only the palmares when we were 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 good 30 years ago ben we were good ago 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.500
 30 years the important thing is to be good at 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 this moment I think we must aim 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.039
 as has been said since the beginning of 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.399
 season but at the time we were already 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.409
 not credible so we must aim to 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.810
 find the champion's league the most 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.630
 quickly possible and in any case the podium 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.060
 good from there we have a match that is 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.130
 very important against nancy Wednesday 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.509
 and then bah after the paris match 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 eventually there will be questions 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.299
 maybe different but until the match 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.979
 paris paris remains by far the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.009
 favorite on the one hand because he has a 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.380
 considerable budget and then that he has some 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.810
 qualities we saw against porto 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.329
 lately or even yesterday in his match 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.759
 of championship against evian which shows 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.780
 that he always remains the very tall 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.229
 favorite of the media and that's good like that 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.490
 it can be a possibility we can 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 would be very very happy we are 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.080
 two modest provincials that would 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.009
 very satisfied to be autumn champion 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.009
 if nothing else
