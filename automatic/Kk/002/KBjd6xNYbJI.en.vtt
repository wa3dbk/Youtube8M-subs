00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
the pentatonic scale starting the a

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.799 
the pentatonic scale starting the a
position<00:00:12.580> it's<00:00:12.699> called<00:00:12.910> pentatonic<00:00:13.539> because

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
position it's called pentatonic because

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.910 
position it's called pentatonic because
it<00:00:13.930> has<00:00:14.049> five<00:00:14.350> notes<00:00:14.590> in<00:00:14.770> it<00:00:15.209> and<00:00:16.920> it's

1st string 8th fret first string so all
together<00:01:14.830> that's<00:01:18.690> so<00:01:19.690> now<00:01:19.840> that's<00:01:20.080> actually

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
together that's so now that's actually

two<00:01:20.650> octaves<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.960> this<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
two octaves right so the just this the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.860 
two octaves right so the just this the
basic<00:01:28.030> scales<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:31.030> we've<00:01:31.090> used<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.660> we've

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
basic scales but we've used it we've

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.620 
basic scales but we've used it we've
extended<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.210> can<00:01:37.300> use<00:01:37.450> all<00:01:37.600> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
extended it so we can use all the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.500 
extended it so we can use all the
strings<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.460> cool<00:01:39.670> thing<00:01:39.700> about<00:01:39.940> guitar

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
strings now the cool thing about guitar

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.380 
strings now the cool thing about guitar
is<00:01:40.660> it<00:01:40.810> once<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.110> learn<00:01:41.290> a<00:01:41.940> scale<00:01:42.940> pattern<00:01:43.270> you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
is it once you learn a scale pattern you

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.970 
is it once you learn a scale pattern you
can<00:01:43.420> use<00:01:43.660> that<00:01:43.870> skill<00:01:44.020> pattern<00:01:44.440> anywhere<00:01:44.890> on

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
can use that skill pattern anywhere on

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.610 
can use that skill pattern anywhere on
the<00:01:45.070> net<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:46.510> can<00:01:46.630> just<00:01:46.810> as<00:01:46.930> easily<00:01:47.020> move

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
the net so we can just as easily move

00:01:47.620 --> 00:02:03.399 
the net so we can just as easily move
that<00:01:47.800> exact<00:01:48.070> same<00:01:48.220> pattern<00:01:48.490> up<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.970> 2<00:01:49.480> B<00:01:55.950> 4<00:01:56.950> DG

and<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.959> get<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:36.989> pattern<00:02:37.350> built<00:02:37.709> into<00:02:37.950> your

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
and to get that pattern built into your

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.770 
and to get that pattern built into your
hands<00:02:38.250> because<00:02:38.640> as<00:02:39.239> soon<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.570> get<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
hands because as soon as you get the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.130 
hands because as soon as you get the
pattern<00:02:39.989> built<00:02:40.410> into<00:02:40.620> your<00:02:40.709> hands<00:02:41.040> then

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
pattern built into your hands then

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.479 
pattern built into your hands then
memorized<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> speak<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:43.830> beyond<00:02:44.130> memory

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
memorized so to speak but beyond memory

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.800 
memorized so to speak but beyond memory
just<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.970> get<00:02:45.120> where<00:02:45.269> it's<00:02:45.390> instinctual

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
just to get where it's instinctual

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.630 
just to get where it's instinctual
that's<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.890> really<00:02:47.130> start<00:02:47.340> seeing<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
that's when you really start seeing the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.890 
that's when you really start seeing the
speed<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.269> where<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.450> really<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.870> a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
speed and that's where you really have a

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.410 
speed and that's where you really have a
lot<00:02:49.140> more<00:02:49.290> options<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:50.300> when<00:02:51.300> you're

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
lot more options when when you're

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.310 
lot more options when when you're
improvising<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.640> through<00:02:53.880> do<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.810> scale

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
improvising so go through do that scale

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.800 
improvising so go through do that scale
pattern<00:02:55.709> up<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.850> down<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.320> then<00:02:58.320> back<00:02:58.350> down

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
pattern up and down and then back down

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.479 
pattern up and down and then back down
go<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.110> way<00:03:01.140> through<00:03:01.470> from<00:03:01.500> from<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
go all the way through from from the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.000 
go all the way through from from the
open<00:03:02.730> position<00:03:02.880> which<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.720> e<00:03:04.080> all<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.860> way<00:03:04.950> up

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
open position which is e all the way up

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.170 
open position which is e all the way up
as<00:03:05.130> high<00:03:05.250> as<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.459> reach<00:03:05.730> on<00:03:05.910> your<00:03:05.940> prep

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
as high as you can reach on your prep

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.460 
as high as you can reach on your prep
work<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.600> then<00:03:06.720> go<00:03:06.840> back<00:03:06.959> down<00:03:07.019> again<00:03:07.350> and

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
work and then go back down again and

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.319 
work and then go back down again and
probably<00:03:07.650> take<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.130> maybe<00:03:08.280> 10<00:03:08.579> 15<00:03:08.760> minutes<00:03:09.239> to

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
probably take you maybe 10 15 minutes to

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.390 
probably take you maybe 10 15 minutes to
go<00:03:09.450> through<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.690> whole<00:03:10.049> process<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:11.250> it's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
go through that whole process but it's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.670 
go through that whole process but it's
great<00:03:11.760> learning<00:03:12.540> exercise<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.410> great

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
great learning exercise and it's great

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.920 
great learning exercise and it's great
practice<00:03:13.890> gets<00:03:14.880> your<00:03:15.030> fingers<00:03:15.390> used<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.780> doing

practice gets your fingers used to doing
that<00:03:16.110> scale<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.650> every<00:03:16.860> position<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
that scale in every position on the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.090 
that scale in every position on the
fretboard<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.959> can<00:03:19.530> guarantee<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:19.920> you're

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
fretboard and I can guarantee you you're

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.490 
fretboard and I can guarantee you you're
really<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.519> benefit<00:03:20.820> from<00:03:21.030> doing<00:03:21.150> that

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
really going to benefit from doing that
