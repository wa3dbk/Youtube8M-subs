this tank in a way to be suitable for
for<00:01:13.650> everything<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> fish<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:14.909> for

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
for everything for the fish in there for

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.539 
for everything for the fish in there for
the<00:01:15.180> turtles<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> swim<00:01:16.439> around

the turtles to swim around

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
the turtles to swim around
I<00:01:17.610> went<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.420> slate<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.080> time<00:01:19.350> instead<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
I went with slate this time instead of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.039 
I went with slate this time instead of
leaving<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> bare<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.420> thought<00:01:21.810> bear

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
leaving it bare because I thought bear

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.929 
leaving it bare because I thought bear
looks<00:01:22.290> very<00:01:22.680> ugly<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.909> know

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
looks very ugly and just and you know

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.630 
looks very ugly and just and you know
gravel<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.020> too<00:01:25.200> small<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
gravel was too small so this time I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
gravel was too small so this time I
thought<00:01:27.360> slate<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.869> give<00:01:28.110> enough<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> keep

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
thought slate would give enough to keep

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130 
thought slate would give enough to keep
all<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> dirt<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.490> dust<00:01:29.700> down<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:31.110> know

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
all the dirt and dust down but you know

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.960 
all the dirt and dust down but you know
it<00:01:31.290> wouldn't<00:01:31.560> look<00:01:31.650> too<00:01:31.890> bad<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.670> think<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it wouldn't look too bad and I think it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.679 
it wouldn't look too bad and I think it
looks<00:01:33.030> nice<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> think<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> good<00:01:33.869> effect

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
looks nice I think is a good effect

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
looks nice I think is a good effect
there<00:01:36.689> are<00:01:36.720> actually<00:01:37.159> clown<00:01:38.159> loaches<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.700> here

don't<00:01:50.159> go<00:01:50.340> after<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.820> fish<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
don't go after the fish they but the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.969 
don't go after the fish they but the
angelfish<00:01:52.799> did<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.250> after<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.579> neons<00:01:53.899> so

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
angelfish did go after the neons so

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.649 
angelfish did go after the neons so
there's<00:01:55.979> five<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> Clara<00:01:57.180> notches<00:01:57.479> one's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
there's five of the Clara notches one's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.039 
there's five of the Clara notches one's
out<00:01:57.899> once<00:01:58.469> inside<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.570> inside<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> log<00:02:00.869> got<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
out once inside the inside the log got a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.120 
out once inside the inside the log got a

moment the rest are in the log sorry

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.749 
moment the rest are in the log sorry
I'll<00:02:03.090> shake<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.780> second<00:02:04.610> I've<00:02:05.610> got

upside down Timon you probably can't see

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.610 
upside down Timon you probably can't see
that<00:02:13.379> as<00:02:13.920> good<00:02:14.099> as<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.370> come<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.730> camera

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
that as good as I come in this camera

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.119 
that as good as I come in this camera
they'll<00:02:16.620> shake<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.099> up<00:02:17.129> too<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:18.950> built<00:02:19.950> a

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
they'll shake that up too I built a

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:26.330 
they'll shake that up too I built a
platform<00:02:21.349> using<00:02:22.349> just<00:02:23.239> four<00:02:24.239> inch<00:02:24.450> pipe<00:02:25.340> two

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
platform using just four inch pipe two

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.890 
platform using just four inch pipe two
of<00:02:26.459> them<00:02:26.610> stuck<00:02:26.819> together<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.390> put<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
of them stuck together and put a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.059 
of them stuck together and put a
bathroom<00:02:28.709> tile<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.989> bathroom<00:02:30.989> tile<00:02:31.230> down<00:02:31.440> and

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
bathroom tile a bathroom tile down and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.550 
bathroom tile a bathroom tile down and
then<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:33.360> I've<00:02:33.450> got<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.629> bit<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.989> water<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
then so I've got a bit in the water and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.949 
then so I've got a bit in the water and
a<00:02:34.590> bit<00:02:34.739> after<00:02:34.829> just<00:02:35.129> water<00:02:35.690> then<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:36.810> can

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
a bit after just water then they can

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.610 
a bit after just water then they can
climb<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.099> they<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.239> go<00:02:39.359> onto<00:02:39.620> this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
climb out and they can go onto this

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.160 
climb out and they can go onto this
basket<00:02:41.099> area<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:42.720> quite<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> large

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
basket area here it's quite a large

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.059 
basket area here it's quite a large
Backson<00:02:43.620> area

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
Backson area

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.009 
Backson area
it's<00:02:44.670> an<00:02:44.760> old<00:02:44.879> Rufus<00:02:45.269> Lake<00:02:45.420> which<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.690> rounded

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
it's an old Rufus Lake which I rounded

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.860 
it's an old Rufus Lake which I rounded
the<00:02:46.140> edges<00:02:46.170> off<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.799> think<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:48.450> gives<00:02:48.599> them

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the edges off and I think it gives them

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.470 
the edges off and I think it gives them
the<00:02:49.940> room<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:52.099> to<00:02:53.099> get<00:02:53.280> hot<00:02:53.519> it's<00:02:54.030> about<00:02:54.180> six

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
the room to to get hot it's about six

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.569 
the room to to get hot it's about six
inches<00:02:54.720> away<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.190> roasting<00:02:56.190> hot<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.430> that

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
inches away it's roasting hot on that

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.520 
inches away it's roasting hot on that
slate<00:02:56.879> which<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.239> good<00:02:59.750> I've<00:03:00.750> gone<00:03:00.959> with<00:03:01.200> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
slate which is good I've gone with a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.629 
slate which is good I've gone with a
floating<00:03:02.489> log<00:03:02.760> also<00:03:03.799> this<00:03:04.799> is<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.280> we're

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
floating log also this is that we're

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.960 
floating log also this is that we're
actually<00:03:06.000> where<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:07.549> bottom<00:03:08.549> feeder<00:03:08.760> is

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
actually where the bottom feeder is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.580 
actually where the bottom feeder is
hiding<00:03:09.480> he's<00:03:09.930> come<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.230> say<00:03:10.319> hello

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
hiding he's come and say hello

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.199 
hiding he's come and say hello
you<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:11.489> she's<00:03:11.639> getting<00:03:11.790> fed<00:03:12.120> they<00:03:12.720> both<00:03:12.930> do

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
you think she's getting fed they both do

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.970 
you think she's getting fed they both do
just<00:03:15.209> try<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.480> shake<00:03:15.750> him<00:03:15.900> out<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:16.859> can

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
just try and shake him out so you can

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.099 
just try and shake him out so you can
have<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.129> look<00:03:17.250> at<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.430> size<00:03:17.669> of<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.940> thing<00:03:21.109> he

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
have a look at the size of the thing he

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.920 
have a look at the size of the thing he
doesn't<00:03:22.949> come<00:03:23.160> out<00:03:23.280> very<00:03:23.340> often

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.860 

and<00:03:28.590> you'll<00:03:28.709> probably<00:03:28.890> go<00:03:29.220> straight<00:03:29.280> back<00:03:29.760> in

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.589 

you<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:34.019> see<00:03:34.230> him<00:03:34.319> just<00:03:34.349> their<00:03:34.890> massive<00:03:35.640> under

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
you can see him just their massive under

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.869 
you can see him just their massive under
the<00:03:36.769> underbelly<00:03:37.769> he<00:03:38.310> doesn't<00:03:38.640> come<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:38.819> much

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
the underbelly he doesn't come out much

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.710 
the underbelly he doesn't come out much
he'll<00:03:39.360> go<00:03:39.510> straight<00:03:39.780> back<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.110> like<00:03:40.290> he<00:03:40.409> has<00:03:41.720> at

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
he'll go straight back in like he has at

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.179 
he'll go straight back in like he has at
a<00:03:42.780> moment<00:03:43.110> I've<00:03:43.170> got<00:03:43.200> two<00:03:43.470> heaters<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:44.010> there

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
a moment I've got two heaters in there

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.949 
a moment I've got two heaters in there
but<00:03:44.849> it's<00:03:44.970> such<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> big<00:03:45.329> tank<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.780> haven't

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
but it's such a big tank and I haven't

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.289 
but it's such a big tank and I haven't
got<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.500> right<00:03:46.709> size<00:03:47.099> of<00:03:47.280> them<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.430> mean<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
got the right size of them I mean so the

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.280 
got the right size of them I mean so the
temperatures<00:03:48.659> staying<00:03:48.840> at<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.079> cool

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
temperatures staying at a cool

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.210 
temperatures staying at a cool
seventy-five<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:49.920> eighty<00:03:51.769> I've<00:03:52.769> only<00:03:53.040> got<00:03:53.189> one

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
seventy-five to eighty I've only got one

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.890 
seventy-five to eighty I've only got one
filter<00:03:53.790> which<00:03:53.939> is<00:03:53.970> why<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.299> tank<00:03:54.599> looks<00:03:54.780> a

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
filter which is why the tank looks a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.530 
filter which is why the tank looks a
little<00:03:55.109> bit<00:03:55.409> a<00:03:55.650> little<00:03:56.250> bit<00:03:56.400> musky<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.090> need<00:03:57.299> to

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
little bit a little bit musky I need to

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.089 
little bit a little bit musky I need to

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590
