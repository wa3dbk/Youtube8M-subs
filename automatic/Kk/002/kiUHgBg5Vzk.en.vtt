come<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:29.939> piece<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.810> kind<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
come in one piece and they kind of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.880 
come in one piece and they kind of
remind<00:01:31.409> me<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.210> old<00:01:33.210> coke<00:01:34.200> bottle<00:01:34.650> cap

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
remind me of like a old coke bottle cap

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.060 
remind me of like a old coke bottle cap
when<00:01:35.340> they<00:01:35.990> when<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.049> snap<00:01:37.320> them<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.920> kind

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
when they when you snap them on and kind

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.179 
when they when you snap them on and kind
of<00:01:38.100> look<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.829> that's<00:01:40.829> what<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
of look like that but that's what the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.380 
of look like that but that's what the
airplane<00:01:41.610> looks<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:43.280> it's<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> totally

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
airplane looks like it's not a totally

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.380 
airplane looks like it's not a totally
accurate<00:01:45.630> version<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.920> b-17<00:01:47.340> bomber<00:01:48.060> but

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
accurate version of a b-17 bomber but

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.590 
accurate version of a b-17 bomber but
it's<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:48.990> close<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.420> nice

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
it's really close to it and the nice

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.889 
it's really close to it and the nice
star<00:01:52.670> right<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.799> American<00:01:58.820> star

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
star right there and then American star

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:07.130 
star right there and then American star
symbol<00:02:00.899> right<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:04.670> W<00:02:05.899> letter<00:02:06.899> right

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
symbol right there and W letter right

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
symbol right there and W letter right
there<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.629> doesn't<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.140> any<00:02:10.319> nose<00:02:10.619> art<00:02:10.950> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
there and it doesn't have any nose art I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.059 
there and it doesn't have any nose art I
think<00:02:11.489> most<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:12.030> these<00:02:12.319> airplanes<00:02:13.319> had<00:02:13.590> nose

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
think most of these airplanes had nose

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.089 
think most of these airplanes had nose
hard<00:02:14.189> on<00:02:14.340> them<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:16.019> show<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.709> different

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
hard on them to show that the different

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.690 
hard on them to show that the different
bomber<00:02:17.749> groups<00:02:18.749> that<00:02:19.049> they<00:02:19.260> were<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:20.489> one

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
bomber groups that they were in this one

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.149 
bomber groups that they were in this one
does<00:02:20.879> not<00:02:21.109> has<00:02:22.109> a<00:02:22.139> little<00:02:22.409> spinning<00:02:22.980> done

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
does not has a little spinning done

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.489 
does not has a little spinning done
right<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:26.629> that's<00:02:27.629> what<00:02:27.780> looks<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.049> on<00:02:28.319> the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
right here that's what looks like on the

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.640 
right here that's what looks like on the
front<00:02:29.359> then<00:02:30.359> you<00:02:30.480> have<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.689> gun<00:02:30.900> turret<00:02:31.409> thing

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
front then you have the gun turret thing

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.890 
front then you have the gun turret thing
on<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.889> top<00:02:33.079> except<00:02:34.079> it<00:02:35.060> kind<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.120> pops<00:02:36.389> out<00:02:36.689> on

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
on the top except it kind of pops out on

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.069 
on the top except it kind of pops out on
also<00:02:37.230> supposed<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:37.859> but<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> looks

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
also supposed to do that but so it looks

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.599 
also supposed to do that but so it looks
like<00:02:40.169> from<00:02:40.439> the<00:02:40.530> side<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.099> there's<00:02:41.219> a<00:02:41.280> gun

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
like from the side and there's a gun

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.140 
like from the side and there's a gun
right<00:02:41.790> here<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.389> on<00:02:43.169> the<00:02:43.349> real<00:02:43.530> one<00:02:44.150> there

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
right here and on the real one there

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.170 
right here and on the real one there

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
actually be a gun back here also but it

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.530 
actually be a gun back here also but it
does<00:02:48.389> not<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.609> has<00:02:50.790> folding<00:02:51.419> in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
does not have that and it has folding in

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.289 
does not have that and it has folding in
landing<00:02:51.989> gear<00:02:53.569> like<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.699> then<00:02:56.699> just

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
landing gear like that and then just

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.599 
landing gear like that and then just
like<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> real<00:02:57.810> one<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.919> can<00:02:59.099> fold<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.489> the

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
like a real one you can fold in the

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.709 
like a real one you can fold in the
landing<00:02:59.939> gear<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.939> and<00:03:02.939> it's

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
landing gear just like that and it's

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.289 
landing gear just like that and it's
made<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.019> China<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.500> course<00:03:04.909> and<00:03:05.909> it<00:03:06.000> has<00:03:06.120> the

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
made in China of course and it has the

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.729 
made in China of course and it has the
stamp<00:03:06.659> it<00:03:07.560> says<00:03:07.769> Flying<00:03:08.219> Fortress<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.739> you

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
stamp it says Flying Fortress and you

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.659 
stamp it says Flying Fortress and you
can<00:03:10.919> remove<00:03:11.189> it<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.489> course<00:03:15.169> so<00:03:16.169> if<00:03:17.129> that<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
can remove it of course so if that the

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.390 
can remove it of course so if that the
kids<00:03:17.969> into<00:03:18.509> airplanes<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.769> he<00:03:19.859> wants<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.220> play

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
kids into airplanes and he wants to play

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.050 
kids into airplanes and he wants to play
with<00:03:20.699> it<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.109> do<00:03:22.259> that<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:23.549> that's<00:03:23.699> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
with it you can do that and that's the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.089 
with it you can do that and that's the
nice<00:03:24.269> thing<00:03:24.299> about<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:25.079> is<00:03:25.470> unlike<00:03:26.069> a

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
nice thing about this is unlike a

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.629 
nice thing about this is unlike a
maystow<00:03:27.090> diecast<00:03:27.629> version<00:03:28.280> where<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.310> wheels

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
maystow diecast version where the wheels

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.670 
maystow diecast version where the wheels
are<00:03:30.919> preset<00:03:31.919> and<00:03:32.489> if<00:03:33.419> they<00:03:33.569> want<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.989> imagine

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
are preset and if they want to imagine

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.259 
are preset and if they want to imagine
it's<00:03:35.009> actually<00:03:35.340> flying<00:03:35.639> in<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:35.939> air<00:03:36.060> instead

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
it's actually flying in the air instead

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.569 
it's actually flying in the air instead
of<00:03:36.479> just<00:03:36.810> landing<00:03:37.470> cuz<00:03:37.739> that's<00:03:38.009> all<00:03:38.280> you

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
of just landing cuz that's all you

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.869 
of just landing cuz that's all you
really<00:03:38.849> get<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.930> for<00:03:40.439> instance<00:03:40.530> I'll<00:03:41.069> show

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
really get like for instance I'll show

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.439 
really get like for instance I'll show
you<00:03:41.939> the<00:03:42.060> comparison<00:03:42.389> with<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.900> b25<00:03:43.620> maystow

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
you the comparison with the b25 maystow

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.199 
you the comparison with the b25 maystow
see<00:03:45.449> how<00:03:45.599> this<00:03:45.750> has<00:03:45.989> fixed<00:03:46.349> landing<00:03:46.709> gear<00:03:47.209> and

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
see how this has fixed landing gear and

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.479 
see how this has fixed landing gear and
really<00:03:48.509> all<00:03:48.689> they<00:03:48.810> can<00:03:49.019> do<00:03:49.139> is<00:03:49.169> just<00:03:49.489> imagine

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
really all they can do is just imagine

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.460 
really all they can do is just imagine
that<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.879> airplane<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.449> gonna<00:03:51.659> land<00:03:51.930> all<00:03:52.409> the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
that the airplane is gonna land all the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.719 
that the airplane is gonna land all the
time<00:03:53.479> you<00:03:54.479> can't<00:03:54.750> really<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.290> mean<00:03:55.709> they<00:03:56.519> can

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
time you can't really I mean they can

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.429 
time you can't really I mean they can
imagine<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.359> there's<00:03:57.599> no<00:03:57.750> wheels<00:03:58.199> there<00:03:58.500> but

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
imagine that there's no wheels there but

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.490 
imagine that there's no wheels there but
it<00:04:01.439> is<00:04:01.560> cool<00:04:01.919> to<00:04:01.949> have<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.959> flipping<00:04:04.379> in

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
it is cool to have the flipping in

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.649 
it is cool to have the flipping in
landing<00:04:05.009> gear<00:04:05.219> I<00:04:05.430> think<00:04:05.909> that's<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.479> coolest

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
landing gear I think that's the coolest

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.949 
landing gear I think that's the coolest
part<00:04:07.079> about<00:04:07.139> it<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:08.790> it's<00:04:09.209> actually<00:04:09.659> this

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
part about it and it's actually this

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.279
