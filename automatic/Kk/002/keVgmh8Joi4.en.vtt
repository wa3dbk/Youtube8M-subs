 let's start with this delicious 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.030
 Sighs recipe for the day of love 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.030
 and friendship 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.620
 we will need a teaspoon of essence 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.809
 strawberry a sleeve with star duya 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.199
 120 grams of white granulated sugar and 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.199
 egg 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.729
 The first thing we are going to do is prepare 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.080
 the yolk of the clear only 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.080
 we need the egg white 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.430
 we poured the egg white into the goal of 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.600
 the blender or in a separate bowl to use 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.850
 the hand blender 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.799
 and we add a pinch of cremor is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.630
 but if they do not have we believe tartar not 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.820
 it only matters that I like to add it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.820
 because it makes the whites mount better 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.190
 when we have a consistency 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.320
 frothy we are going to add little to 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.750
 little the granulated sugar let it 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.200
 go dissolving as you go beating the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.200
 mixer 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.179
 Now let's add our 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.200
 teaspoon of strawberry essence too 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:01.600
 can use vanilla essence 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.600
 and in the end a little bit of coloring 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.920
 and now we keep beating this for 5 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.310
 minutes until we have a 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.470
 consistency of soft peaks 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.470
 we empty the mixture in the pastry bag 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.870
 and we prepare a tray for oven and 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.350
 either with silicon silpat or with paper 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.390
 star 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.520
 and the only thing that remains is to study 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.560
 our stars only from in 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.030
 little dots with small prisons 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.030
 fill the rest of the tray 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.379
 we're going to take them to the oven put the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.540
 lowest temperature they have and they are going 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.810
 to leave there for an hour nothing to be 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.670
 opening and closing the oven 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.110
 preferably let them cool 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.290
 inside if they want you not to believe that 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.290
 they read 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.420
 it only remains to accommodate them in a little bag 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.420
 cellophane 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.520
 is to take a nice ribbon and make them a 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.520
 monkey 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.940
 and they are ready to give 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.960
 and that's how these delicious are made 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.580
 sighs I love and are super 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.830
 nice if you do not want them to stay 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.020
 craquelados use a more finite sugar not 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.840
 icing sugar but a granulated sugar 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.640
 but with a very finite granite and takes care 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.560
 much the temperature of the oven always 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.780
 that is well short and they will stay 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.120
 ready visits but I loved them 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.590
 so very rustic they are just like the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.020
 from a store in mexico that is dedicated 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.910
 only to sell this kind of 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.330
 meringues and sell them from all 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.830
 chocolate coffee flavors and you too 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.590
 in fact you can change the color 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.930
 can use almond mint essence 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.570
 or your favorite flavor and you can also 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.150
 change the colors so you already know a 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.579
 practice idea and what I love most is 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:21.250
 that are truly delicious 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.250
 you do it in the mouth so you bite 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.740
 they are crispy but every time 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.449
 they start to undo in your mouth and I think 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.880
 that's what makes us magical that 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.039
 they are actually very light and it is a 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.350
 sweet snack that everyone will 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.540
 love 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.190
 You already know that you can send me all your 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.980
