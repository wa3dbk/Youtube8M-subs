00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.260 
back plant and the hair is swiping
constantly<00:00:43.590> right<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:43.980> creating<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.969> dry

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
constantly right here creating a dry

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.819 
constantly right here creating a dry
patch<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.960> when<00:00:46.050> something<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.500> dry

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
patch and when something is dry

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.720 
patch and when something is dry
especially<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.670> hair<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.770> fall<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.010> um

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
especially the hair it will fall out um

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.790 
especially the hair it will fall out um
so<00:00:51.800> what<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.489> two<00:00:54.329> times<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.840> day<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.559> time

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so what I do is two times a day one time

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.369 
so what I do is two times a day one time
before<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> spray<00:00:57.840> bottle<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
before then I get a spray bottle and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.139 
before then I get a spray bottle and
it's<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.859> water<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> spray<00:00:59.670> bottle

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it's just water in the spray bottle

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.439 
it's just water in the spray bottle
I<00:01:00.180> usually<00:01:00.870> warm<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.820> found

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
I usually warm it up because I found

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.830 
I usually warm it up because I found
that<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.610> spray<00:01:05.610> warm<00:01:06.030> water<00:01:06.360> onto<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that when you spray warm water onto the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.050 
that when you spray warm water onto the
hair<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:07.590> put<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> product<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.549> absorbs

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
hair and then put a product it absorbs

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
hair and then put a product it absorbs
better<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.500> spray<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:11.130> there

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
better that way so I spray right there

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.270 
better that way so I spray right there
in<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.640> spot<00:01:12.350> just<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.439> couple<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:14.040> enough

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
in that spot just a couple just enough

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380 
in that spot just a couple just enough
to<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.610> dance<00:01:15.560> then<00:01:16.560> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.570> moisturizes

and emulsifies and it's kind of liquidy
which<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.040> good<00:02:01.310> those<00:02:01.610> oils<00:02:02.240> are<00:02:02.450> better<00:02:02.660> to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
which is good those oils are better to

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.170 
which is good those oils are better to
use<00:02:03.110> because<00:02:03.500> they<00:02:03.620> absorb<00:02:03.740> within<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.970> hair

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
use because they absorb within the hair

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.020 
use because they absorb within the hair
and<00:02:05.860> strengthen<00:02:06.860> from<00:02:07.040> within<00:02:07.340> especially<00:02:07.940> if

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and strengthen from within especially if

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.460 
and strengthen from within especially if
the<00:02:08.119> hair<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.390> damp<00:02:08.690> before<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.080> always

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the hair is damp before I always

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.560 
the hair is damp before I always
recommend<00:02:09.619> putting<00:02:10.160> oil<00:02:10.429> on<00:02:10.790> or<00:02:11.030> moisturizer

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
recommend putting oil on or moisturizer
