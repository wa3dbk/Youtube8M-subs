today<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.110> want<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> talk<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.620> creatine<00:00:11.010> now

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
today I want to talk about creatine now

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.919 
today I want to talk about creatine now
I<00:00:11.820> know<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.030> you're<00:00:12.150> thinking<00:00:12.420> you've<00:00:12.809> done

I know what you're thinking you've done
a<00:00:12.960> lot<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.259> videos<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.679> creatine<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.370> past

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
a lot of videos on creatine in the past

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.700 
a lot of videos on creatine in the past
and<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.910> definitely<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.260> videos<00:00:16.560> on

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and I definitely have up in videos on

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.380 
and I definitely have up in videos on
the<00:00:16.800> basics<00:00:17.190> behind<00:00:17.310> creatine<00:00:17.940> whether<00:00:18.270> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the basics behind creatine whether you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.730 
the basics behind creatine whether you
need<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> cycle<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.109> whether<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.439> need<00:00:19.590> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
need to cycle it whether you need to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.560 
need to cycle it whether you need to
load<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.310> thought<00:00:20.850> I've<00:00:21.000> covered<00:00:21.180> all<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
load it I thought I've covered all the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.509 
load it I thought I've covered all the
bases<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.050> creatine<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:22.920> despite<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.460> fact

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
bases on creatine but despite that fact

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.580 
bases on creatine but despite that fact
I<00:00:23.970> still<00:00:24.240> get<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> lot<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.720> questions<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
I still get a lot of questions on it and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.080 
I still get a lot of questions on it and
I<00:00:25.650> wanted<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> make<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.310> video<00:00:26.550> today<00:00:27.060> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I wanted to make this video today to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.460 
I wanted to make this video today to
address<00:00:27.570> something<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.109> I've<00:00:28.199> been<00:00:28.320> getting

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
address something that I've been getting

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.130 
address something that I've been getting
asked<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.099> too<00:00:29.369> often<00:00:29.580> recently<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.929> is

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
asked all too often recently and that is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.319 
asked all too often recently and that is
how<00:00:31.410> come<00:00:31.619> creatine<00:00:32.130> isn't<00:00:32.579> working<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:32.940> me

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
how come creatine isn't working for me

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.450 
how come creatine isn't working for me
so<00:00:33.899> based<00:00:34.230> off<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.559> videos<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so based off my videos I get a lot of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.680 
so based off my videos I get a lot of
comments<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> people<00:00:36.270> saying<00:00:36.480> they're<00:00:36.600> gonna

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
comments of people saying they're gonna

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.630 
comments of people saying they're gonna
try<00:00:36.930> creatine<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:37.860> within<00:00:38.040> 2<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:38.340> 3

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
try creatine and then within 2 or 3

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
try creatine and then within 2 or 3
weeks<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.969> get<00:00:39.090> another<00:00:39.329> message<00:00:39.750> from<00:00:39.930> these

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
weeks I get another message from these

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
weeks I get another message from these
people<00:00:40.500> asking<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.309> come<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.820> working

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
people asking how come it's not working

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
people asking how come it's not working
for<00:00:42.270> them<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> take<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.739> time

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
for them so I want to take some time

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.069 
for them so I want to take some time
just<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.309> address<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.910> today<00:00:45.239> now<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.840> far<00:00:46.020> as

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
just to address this today now as far as

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.799 
just to address this today now as far as
creatine<00:00:46.469> goes<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.399> not<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.059> stimulant<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
creatine goes it's not a stimulant so

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.209 
creatine goes it's not a stimulant so
when<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> take<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
when you take it you're not going to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.549 
when you take it you're not going to
necessarily<00:00:50.370> feel<00:00:51.149> anything<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.260> major

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
necessarily feel anything now the major

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
necessarily feel anything now the major
benefit<00:00:53.039> behind<00:00:53.340> taking<00:00:53.579> creatine<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
benefit behind taking creatine is that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.360 
benefit behind taking creatine is that
it<00:00:54.570> helps<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.870> strength<00:00:55.410> production<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it helps with strength production in the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.520 
it helps with strength production in the
long<00:00:56.579> run<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.420> key<00:00:57.629> term<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.199> in

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
long run and the key term there is in

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
long run and the key term there is in
the<00:00:58.680> long<00:00:58.859> run<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.340> creatine<00:01:00.000> doesn't<00:01:00.420> have

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the long run so creatine doesn't have

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.869 
the long run so creatine doesn't have
any<00:01:00.719> acute<00:01:01.079> effects<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> beta

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
any acute effects it's not like a beta

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.460 
any acute effects it's not like a beta
alanine<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.840> take<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.320> might

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
alanine that when you take it you might

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.770 
alanine that when you take it you might
feel<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> tingles<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:06.060> caffeine<00:01:06.540> when

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
feel the tingles or like caffeine when

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.940 
feel the tingles or like caffeine when
you<00:01:06.869> take<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> where<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> might<00:01:07.590> feel<00:01:07.830> an

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
you take it where you might feel an

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.500 
you take it where you might feel an
energy<00:01:08.100> rush<00:01:08.549> you're<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
energy rush you're not going to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.240 
energy rush you're not going to
necessarily<00:01:09.600> feel<00:01:10.290> anything<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.890> taking

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
necessarily feel anything when taking

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.960 
necessarily feel anything when taking
creatine

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
creatine

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.910 
creatine
however<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.780> most<00:01:13.020> studies<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.500> shown<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
however when most studies have shown is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.399 
however when most studies have shown is
overtime<00:01:14.490> strength<00:01:15.360> production<00:01:15.869> from<00:01:16.080> people

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
overtime strength production from people

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.830 
overtime strength production from people
who<00:01:16.530> take<00:01:16.770> creatine<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.610> greater<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.570> those

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
who take creatine is greater than those

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
who take creatine is greater than those
who<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> same<00:01:19.590> type<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> training<00:01:20.220> without

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
who do the same type of training without

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
who do the same type of training without
supplementing<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.200> example<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
supplementing it in so for example a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
supplementing it in so for example a
very<00:01:22.799> popular<00:01:23.310> study<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:23.970> takes

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
very popular study out there takes

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
very popular study out there takes
athletes<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> takes<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.650> groups<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> these

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
athletes and takes two groups of these

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
athletes and takes two groups of these
people<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.600> group<00:01:27.750> they're<00:01:27.960> given

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
people in one group they're given

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.480 
people in one group they're given
creatine<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> other<00:01:29.070> group<00:01:29.310> they're

creatine and the other group they're

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.149 
creatine and the other group they're
given<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.820> placebo<00:01:30.210> now<00:01:30.960> over<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> span<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.890> 10

now<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.590> study<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.979> very<00:01:38.159> important

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
now for this study it's very important

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.830 
now for this study it's very important
to<00:01:38.549> look<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> context<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> numbers

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
to look at the context and the numbers

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
to look at the context and the numbers
behind<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.890> first<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> placebo

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790

behind it so first with the placebo
group<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.509> saw<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.990> over<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> 10<00:01:43.530> week

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770

group what they saw was over a 10 week
time<00:01:44.070> period<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.880> were<00:01:44.939> able<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.299> increase

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420

their benchpress an average of 6 pounds

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.280 
their benchpress an average of 6 pounds
now<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> creatine<00:01:48.780> group<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.229> were

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
now for the creatine group they were

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.980 
now for the creatine group they were
able<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.619> increase<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.100> by<00:01:50.220> 16<00:01:50.759> pounds<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.299> 10

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
able to increase it by 16 pounds or 10

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.149 
able to increase it by 16 pounds or 10
pounds<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.470> than<00:01:52.500> those<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.100> taking

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
pounds more than those not taking

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
pounds more than those not taking
creatine<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.780> look<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.140> study

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
creatine so when we look at this study

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
creatine so when we look at this study
we<00:01:55.619> saw<00:01:55.829> an<00:01:56.040> average<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.460> about<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> 10<00:01:57.030> pound

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
we saw an average of about a 10 pound

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.300 
we saw an average of about a 10 pound
increase<00:01:57.899> over<00:01:58.320> those<00:01:58.500> who<00:01:58.710> weren't<00:01:58.950> using

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
increase over those who weren't using

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.520 
increase over those who weren't using
creatine<00:01:59.520> now<00:02:00.299> again<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.079> key<00:02:01.259> thing<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
creatine now again the key thing to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.990 
creatine now again the key thing to
relate<00:02:01.740> back<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> fact<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
relate back to this is the fact that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.789 
relate back to this is the fact that
this<00:02:03.240> time<00:02:03.509> trial<00:02:03.810> took<00:02:04.020> ten<00:02:04.409> weeks<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
this time trial took ten weeks to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
this time trial took ten weeks to
complete<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.969> meaning<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:06.479> gained<00:02:06.659> an

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
complete so meaning they gained an

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719 
complete so meaning they gained an
average<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.619> pound<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.340> their<00:02:08.489> max

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
average of one pound on their max

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.029 
average of one pound on their max

have<00:02:13.040> been<00:02:13.130> taking<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.520> for<00:02:13.640> only<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.880> few<00:02:14.090> weeks

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
have been taking it for only a few weeks

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.820 
have been taking it for only a few weeks
and<00:02:14.570> don't<00:02:14.840> really<00:02:14.990> notice<00:02:15.260> any<00:02:15.590> necessary

strength output you can rely back on

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.140 
strength output you can rely back on
these<00:02:18.830> studies<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.370> research<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.850> show<00:02:19.880> that

these studies and research to show that

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.790 
these studies and research to show that
it<00:02:20.300> does<00:02:20.540> increase<00:02:20.900> your<00:02:21.080> strength<00:02:21.350> over<00:02:21.620> time

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
it does increase your strength over time

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400 
it does increase your strength over time
it's<00:02:22.010> been<00:02:22.160> proven<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.760> do<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.150> however<00:02:24.020> you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's been proven to do this however you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.230 
it's been proven to do this however you
need<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.830> give<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.100> time<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.490> actually<00:02:25.670> work

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
need to give it time to actually work

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.600 
need to give it time to actually work
and<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.200> short-term<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:28.160> pound<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.580> week

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
and in the short-term one pound a week

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.180 
and in the short-term one pound a week
might<00:02:29.030> not<00:02:29.240> sound<00:02:29.600> like<00:02:29.720> much<00:02:30.110> but<00:02:30.380> in<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
might not sound like much but in the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.860 
might not sound like much but in the
long<00:02:31.430> term<00:02:31.760> looking<00:02:32.240> at<00:02:32.390> creatine

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
to those not supplementing creatine can

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.770 
to those not supplementing creatine can
really<00:02:40.190> start<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.550> add<00:02:40.580> up<00:02:40.880> quick<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.600> is

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
really start to add up quick this is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.180 
really start to add up quick this is
also<00:02:41.959> going<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.290> really<00:02:42.470> relate<00:02:42.709> back<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.950> my

video on cyclone creatine and how it's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.960 
video on cyclone creatine and how it's
not<00:02:44.750> necessary<00:02:45.470> because<00:02:46.100> creatine<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.760> main

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
not necessary because creatine is main

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
seen in the long term usage so before

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.630 
seen in the long term usage so before
you<00:02:51.650> go<00:02:51.800> ahead<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.220> think<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.489> your

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
you go ahead and think that your

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.580 
you go ahead and think that your
creatine<00:02:52.970> isn't<00:02:53.390> working<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.930> highly<00:02:54.440> suggest

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
creatine isn't working I highly suggest

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.500 
creatine isn't working I highly suggest
you<00:02:54.890> give<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.190> some<00:02:55.370> time<00:02:55.550> one<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.330> nice

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
you give it some time one of the nice

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.150 
you give it some time one of the nice
things<00:02:56.540> about<00:02:56.900> creatine<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.010> get<00:02:58.130> a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
things about creatine that if you get a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.430 
things about creatine that if you get a
good<00:02:58.400> pure<00:02:58.760> creatine<00:02:59.060> monohydrate<00:02:59.570> you're

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
good pure creatine monohydrate you're

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.840 
good pure creatine monohydrate you're
not<00:03:00.620> gonna<00:03:00.770> spend<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.160> lot<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.340> money<00:03:01.640> you're

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
not gonna spend a lot of money you're
