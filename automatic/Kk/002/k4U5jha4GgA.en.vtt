00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.090
 in what would be action 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.690
 No smoking because this program 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.100
 and I do not know if I go to the boat 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.970
 you will see it in return 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.000
 second have I'm going to narrate a 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.000
 history 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.230
 depending on the duration 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.520
 of the internet those that seem very 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.560
 good 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.200
 here 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.320
 I will enjoy it even if I do not have 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.150
 it is essential that I give the cases 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.160
 of current patients the previous one for 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.160
 make a very good story that deserves 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.260
 be told 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.460
 there are some houses that want to add some 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 that if once is because the story 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.320
 is written in Latin or 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.089
 in Latin Spanish 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.310
 try to have faults by pressing the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.310
 words and it may take a tad 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.720
 logically 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.200
 there are times that you do not understand if you do not know 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.200
 of that 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.960
 a lot to get away by the word 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.960
 strange 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.509
 until I discovered that missing is to throw 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.509
 less 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.780
 and now 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.470
 until it is adding 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 and it's very good because we do not have the best 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.950
 way to write it 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.880
 but if it gets a bit repetitive he said 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.810
 such said what said such because really 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.810
 this too 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.720
 I did not like the story for its 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.080
 content not by the way it is 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.120
 written 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.790
 and without more then I'm going to start with the 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.310
 first and the first story is the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.020
 first chapter is titled the history of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.990
 fox 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.940
 let's start 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.130
 1987 historical 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.560
 at phoenix phoenix the animals 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.010
 animatronics have certain lives for 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.010
 so to speak 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:29.819
 and I think it's the man's couple go 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.840
 hear where is fox and he said to the support 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.890
 girl call 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.140
 until this year these days said 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.780
 if it's in the note maybe your system 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.680
 son is damaged but I hope it is 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.680
 well said girl 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.470
 called fox and attached to different 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.690
 own thoughts is fine because you 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.040
 follow the intent is something your head does 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.040
 it was heating up several days ago 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.040
 He said 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.950
 fox and valves where his 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.860
 partner and friend 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.310

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.470
 companions to the place where they were kept 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:27.860
 to pay yourself during the day if you do 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.989
 at night the next day the pizzeria 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.360
 again he was filled with cries and 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.280
 cheerful laughs of rings creative ni 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.620
 girls were on stage performing 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.160
 the usual song when they finished 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.890

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.629

 entry instructions 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.680
 but he did not notice 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.670
 since the year 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.430

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.580
 fox and companion and friend did 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.580
 thoughts 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.400

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.940
 at the foot of the stage 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.960
 yes dear is a very strange room to your 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.300
 mother although the girl does not care much 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.850
 sensory scenario a band is missing 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.280

 Fox care is very delicate and also not 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.830
 You can go on guard stage 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.720
 you are not my mom so they do not have no 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.840

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.450
 what to do said to the girl 200 lady but 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.650
 your daughter has to get off the stage go 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.650
 to leave fox impass 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:27.819
 they are a silly mechanical room that said 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.819
 worried 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.830
 to the girl 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:43.339
 at the time without wrapping the head the 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.080
 little girl damaging the body's frontal angle 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.610
 he fell bloody on stage and 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.589
 they all shouted and ran like that at the exit 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.550
 while I was boxing and I was in a class 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:51.860
 Show 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.509
 the other three animatronics were 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.149
 equally surprised by the action of 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.039
 his friend as god said the guard 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:59.680

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.550
 God 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.180
 oxy girl 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.180
 What have I done 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.690

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.750
 I was trying to ask, is it 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:19.070
 flips towards his friends 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:21.170
 I did not want to go from services to 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.570

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.750

 talking they go and they are sent no to the 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.280
 brava in none of the three 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.840
 the fox threw himself to the ground on his knees 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.500
 while a hot liquid was 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.760
 running his face was crying 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.810
 girls went for a rag and gave him the 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.870
 blood from the jaw and part of the chest 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.639
 crying said girl listen to this freddy 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.680
 guarÃ­n approach they did not know it was 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.210
 possible that an animatronic or cry 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.270
 once in a while medium girls crying 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:03.430
 they just cried because of sadness not fox and 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.010
 I was sad and confused and especially 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.820
 repented his friends approach and 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:12.070
 I managed to sharon trying it today just one 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.530
 picture guilt said freddy that girl did not have 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.360
 exhibited the only good you did not have 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.400
 intention to hurt her said girl 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.230
 for in the place they began to listen 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.500
 Sirens both the police and 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.350
 the operation 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:28.770
 and even here in chapter 1 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.900
 not a lot of history though if the 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.880
 part of the bite that speaks in the 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.190
 first episode is spoken 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.980
 then you understand all the bearing of all 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.770
 in upcoming entrepreneurs so if 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:44.400
 you want to know a story later 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.980
 give you lay video and so know that 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.960
 you want to keep listening to the story of 

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.250
 them and I promise you it's going to be a 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.250
 pretty important story 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.530
 and I think it's going to be very 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.530
 interesting 

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:02.539
 see you next video and up to 

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:02.539
 God
