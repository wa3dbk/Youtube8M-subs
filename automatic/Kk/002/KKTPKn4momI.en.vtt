00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.480 

binary<00:00:06.810> fission<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.380> a<00:00:07.410> word<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.980> might<00:00:08.220> come

binary fission is a word you might come

botulism and as I've already mentioned

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.909 
botulism and as I've already mentioned
this<00:05:50.770> when<00:05:51.010> bacteria<00:05:51.580> multiply<00:05:51.970> in<00:05:52.630> food<00:05:53.020> but

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
this when bacteria multiply in food but

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.790 
this when bacteria multiply in food but
it<00:05:54.040> gives<00:05:54.280> off<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.910> exudes<00:05:55.390> a<00:05:55.810> poison<00:05:56.500> called<00:05:56.680> a

it gives off it exudes a poison called a

briefly mentioned toxins in the last
couple<00:06:30.880> of<00:06:31.000> slides<00:06:31.180> so<00:06:32.140> let's<00:06:32.320> look<00:06:32.380> like<00:06:32.560> a

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
couple of slides so let's look like a

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.750 
couple of slides so let's look like a
toxins<00:06:33.160> in<00:06:33.340> more<00:06:33.520> detail<00:06:35.250> toxins<00:06:36.250> then<00:06:36.550> a

all bacteria and there are two types of
toxins<00:06:42.640> there<00:06:43.450> are<00:06:43.770> exotoxins<00:06:44.820> these<00:06:45.820> are

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
toxins there are exotoxins these are

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.450 
toxins there are exotoxins these are
produced<00:06:46.390> when<00:06:46.540> bacteria<00:06:46.900> growing<00:06:47.410> food<00:06:47.860> for

multiply<00:06:56.290> they<00:06:56.950> give<00:06:57.160> off<00:06:57.190> a<00:06:57.400> waste<00:06:57.610> material

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
multiply they give off a waste material

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.960 
multiply they give off a waste material
much<00:06:59.110> like<00:06:59.320> Isis<00:06:59.590> humans<00:07:00.010> give<00:07:00.220> up<00:07:00.340> feces<00:07:00.790> in

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
much like Isis humans give up feces in

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.750

using<00:07:01.360> his<00:07:01.450> base<00:07:01.630> material<00:07:02.320> the<00:07:02.980> toxins<00:07:03.580> the

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:05.980 
waste material of the bacteria and he's

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.660 
waste material of the bacteria and he's
a<00:07:06.010> poisonous<00:07:06.670> to<00:07:06.820> us<00:07:08.190> but<00:07:09.190> the<00:07:09.310> other<00:07:09.430> type<00:07:09.640> of

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:09.670 
a poisonous to us but the other type of

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.870 
a poisonous to us but the other type of
toxin<00:07:10.240> is<00:07:10.360> an<00:07:10.650> endotoxin<00:07:11.650> on<00:07:12.520> these<00:07:12.730> are
