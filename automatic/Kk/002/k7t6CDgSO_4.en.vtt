00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.850
 in this video we will try to explain 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.760
 the different types of rhinoplasty 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.680
 we on the web mention the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.360
 primary and secondary neoplasms or 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.270
 revision rhinoplasty that the same as in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.730
 secondary plant 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.350
 actually it refers to a nose 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.730
 he never had a surgery and a 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.030
 surgery for the first time that we call 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.040
 primary rhinoplasty and rhinoplasty 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.750
 secondary or revision is when 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.559
 had some surgical procedure the 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.559
 not plastic either one or more times what 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.190
 It makes revision rhinoplasty by 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.769
 course what 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.269
 is very different from the approach from the 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.519
 point of view complication and 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.530
 experience that are needed to 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.379
 address this type of pathologies because 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.570
 the secondary rhinoplasty in these cases 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 we do not have a normal anatomy 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.680
 but it has already been altered because it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.000
 the patient has been operated and really 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 we do not know what we are going to find 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.229
 then it is more difficult to make a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.840
 pretty approximate projection of what 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.630
 we will have and on the other hand neither 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.700
 we know that grafts are going to need 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 for that nose we're going to know what 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.700
 we speak very well with the patient a 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.700
 Once we are inside surgery 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.690
 besides that we also have another of the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.900
 primary and secondary they can 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.170
 be purely aesthetic rhinoplasty or 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.210
 Functional or functional aesthetics that 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.560
 means when the patient has a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 exclusively intended to make a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.310
 aesthetic change that is a rhinoplasty 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 aesthetically purely and has no problems 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.330
 respiratory diseases there are patients who have 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.759
 respiratory problems and also want 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.250
 have an aesthetic change to that we call 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.780
 aesthetic and functional rhinoplasty 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.610
 then we have a series of patients 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.509
 they do not want a change but the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.110
 condition of your deviated nose is 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.960
 too deflected or obstructed 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.930
 we need to make an aesthetic change 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 to improve the function or to go back to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.840
 the nose still and focus it to normalize it 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.580
 so that the patient has a good 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.869
 breath but invariably you're going to 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.090
 have a change that is the patient 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.180
 that seeks to improve your breathing with a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.739
 defect of the nose and that there is 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.410
 change the acid so that you can 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.410
 work your nose correctly
