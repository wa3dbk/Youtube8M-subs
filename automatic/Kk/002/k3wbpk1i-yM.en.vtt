weapon with rotating barrels most people
refer<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.489> minigun<00:00:35.870> one<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
refer to this as the minigun one of the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.389 
refer to this as the minigun one of the
old<00:00:37.230> fires<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> dread-nots<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
old fires for the dread-nots is a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
old fires for the dread-nots is a
toggleable<00:00:39.000> energy<00:00:39.480> shield<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> will<00:00:39.930> block

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
toggleable energy shield that will block

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
toggleable energy shield that will block
shots<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.920> possibly<00:00:41.520> reflect<00:00:41.940> them<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.210> well

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
shots and possibly reflect them as well

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.240 
shots and possibly reflect them as well
so<00:00:43.110> dreadknots<00:00:43.530> will<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.800> most<00:00:44.010> vulnerable

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so dreadknots will be most vulnerable

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.700 
so dreadknots will be most vulnerable
from<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> back<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> tank

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
from the back because they are a tank

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.529 
from the back because they are a tank

has tank like attributes in my opinion

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.510 
has tank like attributes in my opinion
but<00:02:46.350> he<00:02:46.440> obviously<00:02:46.620> won't<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> same

aspects<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.120> tank<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.510> an<00:02:48.630> MMO<00:02:49.020> because

be deadly and I think it will be used in
a<00:02:55.710> slow<00:02:55.980> push<00:02:56.220> type<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.700> offense<00:02:57.060> even<00:02:57.990> though

the<00:02:58.200> Dreadnought<00:02:58.560> will<00:02:58.650> be<00:02:58.770> slower<00:02:58.980> compared

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the Dreadnought will be slower compared

the Dreadnought will be slower compared
