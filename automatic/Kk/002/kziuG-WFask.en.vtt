all the other models this speaker works
because<00:00:18.970> underneath<00:00:19.630> it<00:00:20.019> it<00:00:20.949> has<00:00:21.130> a<00:00:21.160> vibrating

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
because underneath it it has a vibrating

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.060 
because underneath it it has a vibrating
plate<00:00:22.119> and<00:00:22.749> as<00:00:22.900> soon<00:00:23.050> as<00:00:23.230> this<00:00:23.409> plague<00:00:23.470> comes

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
plate and as soon as this plague comes

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.460 
plate and as soon as this plague comes
into<00:00:24.339> contact<00:00:24.550> with<00:00:24.820> any<00:00:25.029> flat<00:00:25.329> surface<00:00:25.599> so<00:00:26.079> it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
into contact with any flat surface so it

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.979 
into contact with any flat surface so it
can<00:00:26.619> be<00:00:26.739> a<00:00:26.769> table<00:00:27.039> it<00:00:27.640> can<00:00:27.880> be<00:00:27.970> glass<00:00:28.329> Italy

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
can be a table it can be glass Italy

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.890 
can be a table it can be glass Italy
level<00:00:29.409> than<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.130> entire<00:00:30.699> area<00:00:30.730> of<00:00:31.720> what

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
level than the entire area of what

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.810 
level than the entire area of what
you've<00:00:32.050> put<00:00:32.230> it<00:00:32.349> on<00:00:32.529> tues<00:00:32.770> becomes<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.310> speaker

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
you've put it on tues becomes a speaker
