00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
actually thought about it after i had

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.789 
actually thought about it after i had
this<00:02:30.629> gameplay<00:02:30.840> i<00:02:31.049> didn't<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.409> about<00:02:31.680> it

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
this gameplay i didn't think about it

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.110 
this gameplay i didn't think about it
right<00:02:32.010> away<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.219> i<00:02:32.489> thought<00:02:32.639> about<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.000> maybe

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
right away but i thought about it maybe

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.349 
right away but i thought about it maybe
like<00:02:33.389> a<00:02:33.719> week<00:02:34.109> later<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.439> i<00:02:34.500> thought<00:02:34.709> about<00:02:34.920> it

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
like a week later and i thought about it

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.240 
like a week later and i thought about it
this<00:02:36.359> was<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:37.230> gameplay<00:02:37.469> it<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:37.739> before<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
this was this gameplay it was before the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.440 
this was this gameplay it was before the
time<00:02:38.430> when<00:02:38.609> everybody<00:02:38.819> was<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.329> into

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
time when everybody was going into

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.839 
time when everybody was going into
search<00:02:39.689> and<00:02:39.840> Roy<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.230> getting<00:02:40.560> an<00:02:40.849> getting

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
search and Roy and getting an getting

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.309 
search and Roy and getting an getting
friends<00:02:42.209> getting<00:02:42.540> their<00:02:42.659> friends<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:42.989> come<00:02:43.139> in

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
friends getting their friends to come in

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.119 
friends getting their friends to come in
like<00:02:43.560> spa<00:02:44.250> other<00:02:44.519> people<00:02:44.939> and<00:02:45.680> just<00:02:46.680> column<00:02:47.010> it

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
like spa other people and just column it

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.860 
like spa other people and just column it
so<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.430> could<00:02:47.639> get<00:02:48.000> killed<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.450> try<00:02:48.689> and<00:02:48.750> get

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
so they could get killed and try and get

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.270 
so they could get killed and try and get
a<00:02:48.930> nuke<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.379> search<00:02:49.590> destroy<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.159> did

happen for a few people but I didn't
really<00:02:53.010> think<00:02:53.280> about<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.549> at<00:02:53.730> time<00:02:53.970> but<00:02:54.239> if<00:02:54.359> I

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
really think about it at time but if I

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.500 
really think about it at time but if I
really<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.409> try<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.859> extend<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.849> match<00:02:57.180> at

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
playing the game and they're not just

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.050 
playing the game and they're not just
like<00:03:10.709> telling<00:03:11.129> me<00:03:11.219> where<00:03:11.370> people<00:03:11.700> are<00:03:11.849> at<00:03:11.879> all

like telling me where people are at all
some<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.209> guys<00:03:15.299> may<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:15.989> believe<00:03:16.260> that

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
some of you guys may not believe that

some of you guys may not believe that
but<00:03:16.739> i<00:03:16.799> guess<00:03:17.310> that's<00:03:17.790> your<00:03:17.909> own<00:03:18.030> personal

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
but i guess that's your own personal

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.270 
but i guess that's your own personal
opinion<00:03:19.260> whether<00:03:19.409> or<00:03:19.590> not<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.859> think<00:03:19.889> that

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
opinion whether or not you think that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.539 
opinion whether or not you think that
but<00:03:21.090> they're<00:03:21.599> just<00:03:21.780> playing<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.049> game<00:03:22.139> and

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549

they're<00:03:23.549> not<00:03:23.669> really<00:03:23.819> taking<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.299> overly

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
they're not really taking it overly
