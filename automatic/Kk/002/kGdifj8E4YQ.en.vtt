00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.830
 so much of everything 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.670
 Greetings to all of us, we are here 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.490
 new with challenge elba this week 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.760
 this time we are going to try to finish one 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.640
 Forza Motorsport 5 race without aid 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.670
 of any kind nothing at all nor at bs and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.100
 so slow down to attend anything because I 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.600
 I do because you are sovereigns and 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.480
 so you have wanted it so take 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.110
 our helmet shoes your tourism and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.110
 let's go forward 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.850
 Well, you see that we do not have any 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.940
 aid of any kind or birds in the 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.190
 optimal tracing all simulation in order goes 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 to be quite complicated we are going to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.460
 start the race the race is going to 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.950
 be the circuit d 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.090
 the Czech Republic I want to remember that 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.990
 is 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.470
 I have to say that I have this path 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.810
 I've played it a couple of times and with help 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.300
 assisted so let's see how 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.090
 will be the truth is that when the game is 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.920
 it becomes difficult where they put simulation 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.510
 to the game and just for that reason it becomes 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.820
 quite difficult then it takes a lot 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.790
 you have to capture many of the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.440
 tracings you make in each curve look 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.869
 attitude that I go in second and I'll go 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.010
 it has gone back to me for god is already 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.229
 world 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.420
 notice that a prettier lovely one does not 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.149
 I want to give it to rewind because no 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.310
 I want no help, let's continue 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.040
 for this good line you already see up to the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.009
 left that I have put on 8 of 8 that 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.370
 It is a beautiful and beautiful round number 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.700
 it's a number 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.290
 for any blog I'm already going 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.910
 much the pot but good here comes a 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.670
 uphill that is quite challenging you 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.170
 grill the curve without the catwalks 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.050
 trick but pretty good I think you go 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.690
 to go to play the problem and I'm gone 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.280
 again the car the truth is that the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.800
 car is usually going pretty much anything 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.620
 the triggers also to vibrate look at you 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:15.450
 I give a skating rink but good and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.820
 we are here with the wonderful view of 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.530
 the Czech Republic that is counted as 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.640
 away if it 's in river by helicopter and 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.120
 all 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.760
 and that is very nice because we are going to 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.440
 focus on the circuit circuit and on 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.250
 the race and the challenge that is quite 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.990
 jodidillo not because not to say it 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.650
 it is already that it can not be found 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.080
 see what lovely prices he has 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.790
 it was beautiful for the base side room 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.090
 of these a little bit but passed in this 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.270
 curve will not climb the car enough 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.700
 indeed good good good good I 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.020
 normal that I have the kers because if not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.660
 I would end up with a neck version 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.870
 reversible from so many hits that 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.480
 I 'm giving myself as well as it looks 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.870
 light there at the bottom of how the light shines 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.830
 bodywork 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.890
 look, look again, nothing either 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.750
 can reverse I'll go further here 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.700
 me by throwing hours and hours and hours and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.650
 nothing does not happen 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.739
 look at the painting as it has begun to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.290
 to go or good that you not the most beautiful with 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.830
 the shade dynamic state lovely but 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:30.760
 it is also quite difficult 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.810
 little by little in public there also I 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.190
 appeared to see one of the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.190
 game developers yes 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.260
 and let's get out of here 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.170
 for this 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.690
 it's a little cheating but remembered with 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.400
 they 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.490
 I totally wish I could not catch the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.650
 comrades to the rivals because he is very 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.020
 away and has passed the finish line by 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.610
 hundred and this street that is full of 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.220
 who was called up 38 effective of 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.200
 500 was training a lot of land and is 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.710
 Well, I have not managed not to find the 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.320
 lateral 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.220
 that is saying a lot , I think I'm 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.220
 making time 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.880
 there has been a moment I thought I saw 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.250
 CÃ¡ceres and Mariachi among the public 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.890
 will be biting with envy or not who 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.770
 know then let's see look at the cathedral 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.060
 up there is a beautiful whore and she is but 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.830
 the penalty has appeared because it makes 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.120
 wonderful views and the burden of 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.040
 absence mikael every dream game 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.230
 in front the alca under the direction to 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.420
 Fuck but no, he said, look, I'll go 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.600
 to restriction to the right listener if we 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.180
 we fix that it is giving us a lot of open 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.180
 again they are cheering my name 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.220
 because I'm a stoic uncle and that has 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.010
 made himself 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.400
 please I will not get in shape 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.009
 basic in the race to the right of the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.110
 car 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.689
 and that's where I just got to finish the 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.059
 race in eighth position the car is 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.830
 shattered everywhere the bad but 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.180
 well the important thing is to participate and that 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.210
 finished the challenges that is what it is 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.819
 deal so that the challenge overcome finished 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.800
 a race to the force with three by 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.960
 five without aid of any kind the 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.960
 last but finished the effort 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.330
 well you have seen the challenge overcome 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.969
 of managed to finish the race as 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.159
 well you have challenged 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.409
 from here I call you to send me 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:48.149
 more challenges to the directions that they put 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.049
 down here and of course leave us your 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:50.939
 comments 

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:52.519
 below the video and a good like for 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.169
 help the community to keep growing 

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:57.179
 be careful with the polvorones that yes 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.309
 they do not swallow well they stay there in 'alicia 

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:01.409
 that do not happen and we spend the holidays and 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:04.969
 ojito with the crochet a greeting and we 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.969
 we hear merry christmas 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.069
