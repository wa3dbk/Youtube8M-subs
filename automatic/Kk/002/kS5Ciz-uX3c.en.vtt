00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.619 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:02.730> we're<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.149> answer<00:00:03.510> the

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
segment we're going to answer the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.130 
segment we're going to answer the
question<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.310> string<00:00:05.819> bean<00:00:06.270> now

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
question what is a string bean now

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.560 
question what is a string bean now
string<00:00:07.589> bean<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.099> just<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.460> green<00:00:08.790> bean<00:00:09.210> and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
string bean is just a green bean and

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.780 
string bean is just a green bean and
it's<00:00:09.990> called<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.410> string<00:00:10.769> bean<00:00:11.070> because<00:00:11.610> it

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it's called a string bean because it

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.049 
it's called a string bean because it
grows<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.599> vine<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.009> many<00:00:14.429> times<00:00:14.790> it's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
grows is a vine and many times it's

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.570 
grows is a vine and many times it's
grown<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.540> garden<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> string<00:00:17.190> so

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
grown in the garden on a string so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.090 
grown in the garden on a string so
they'll<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:17.880> put<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> stick<00:00:19.170> up<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.740> string

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
they'll just put a stick up with string

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.359 
they'll just put a stick up with string
onto<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:21.060> stick<00:00:21.539> or<00:00:21.840> pole<00:00:22.529> called<00:00:23.039> pole

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
onto that stick or pole called pole

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.630 
onto that stick or pole called pole
beans<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.850> well<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:24.960> it'll<00:00:25.289> vine<00:00:25.680> up<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
beans as well and then it'll vine up the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.089 
beans as well and then it'll vine up the
string<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:27.960> eventually<00:00:28.050> produce<00:00:28.650> these

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
string and then eventually produce these

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.790 
string and then eventually produce these
wonderful<00:00:29.910> string<00:00:30.269> beans<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.960> green<00:00:31.439> beans

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
wonderful string beans or green beans

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190 
wonderful string beans or green beans
and<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.969> they're<00:00:33.149> easy<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.540> grow<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.899> long<00:00:34.050> as

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and so they're easy to grow as long as

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.160 
and so they're easy to grow as long as
they're<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.469> sunny<00:00:34.739> spot<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:36.450> string

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
they're in a sunny spot and a string

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.500 
they're in a sunny spot and a string
bean<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.860> related<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> sweet<00:00:38.760> peas<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.300> many

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
bean is related to sweet peas and many

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.900 
bean is related to sweet peas and many
other<00:00:39.750> vining<00:00:40.290> plant<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.579> start<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
other vining plant and you can start it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940 
other vining plant and you can start it
by<00:00:42.030> seed<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> spring<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.739> plant

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
by seed in the spring or you can plant

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.250 
by seed in the spring or you can plant
it<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.219> outdoors<00:00:44.730> after<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> last<00:00:45.809> frost

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it right outdoors after the last frost

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.100 
it right outdoors after the last frost
but<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.100> an<00:00:47.190> easy<00:00:47.399> plant<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> grow<00:00:48.149> now

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
but it's an easy plant to grow now

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
but it's an easy plant to grow now
string<00:00:49.469> bean<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.100> eaten<00:00:50.460> raw<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
string bean can be eaten raw and the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
string bean can be eaten raw and the
trick<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:51.840> cut<00:00:52.260> off<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.649> ends<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
trick is just cut off the ends and you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.990 
trick is just cut off the ends and you
can<00:00:53.640> eat<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> raw<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.320> barely<00:00:56.280> boil<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
can eat it raw or you can barely boil it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.049 
can eat it raw or you can barely boil it
and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.719> eat<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.140> or<00:00:58.379> blanch<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.430> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and then eat it or blanch it and it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
and then eat it or blanch it and it
stores<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.840> well<00:01:01.020> when<00:01:01.170> frozen<00:01:01.500> too<00:01:02.010> so

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
stores really well when frozen too so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969 
stores really well when frozen too so
the<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> freeze<00:01:03.390> them<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.870> boil<00:01:04.739> them

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the way to freeze them is just boil them

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.740 
the way to freeze them is just boil them
for<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.670> two<00:01:05.700> minutes<00:01:06.119> turn<00:01:06.479> around

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
for just one or two minutes turn around

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
for just one or two minutes turn around
and<00:01:06.960> put<00:01:07.080> them<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.799> into<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> freezer<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and put them right into the freezer and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
and put them right into the freezer and
then<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.210> way<00:01:09.360> they'll<00:01:09.600> hold<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.200> they'll

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
then that way they'll hold and they'll

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
then that way they'll hold and they'll
stay<00:01:10.619> crisp<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.760> eat<00:01:11.970> them<00:01:12.180> all

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
stay crisp so that you can eat them all

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.050 
stay crisp so that you can eat them all
winter<00:01:13.080> long<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:14.130> they're<00:01:14.369> called<00:01:14.640> snap

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
winter long now they're called snap

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.570 
winter long now they're called snap
beans<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.750> well<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.470> when<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.830> snap

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
beans as well because when they snap

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.390 
beans as well because when they snap
open<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> noise<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:20.189> when

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
open they make a noise so you know when

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700 
open they make a noise so you know when
they're<00:01:20.549> ready<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.939> harvest<00:01:21.290> because<00:01:22.290> they're

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
they're ready to harvest because they're

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.100 
they're ready to harvest because they're
growing<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.549> they're<00:01:23.729> very<00:01:23.759> green<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
growing and they're very green and you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
growing and they're very green and you
can<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.799> seed<00:01:26.009> pods<00:01:26.280> barely<00:01:26.790> developing

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
can see the seed pods barely developing

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.300 
can see the seed pods barely developing
they're<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.540> too<00:01:27.840> big<00:01:28.110> yet<00:01:28.799> when<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.159> get

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
they're not too big yet when they get

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
they're not too big yet when they get
really<00:01:29.490> big<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:29.909> start<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> break<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> they

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
really big they start to break and they

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.319 
really big they start to break and they
get<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.159> meaty<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.790> don't<00:01:32.939> taste<00:01:33.119> as

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
get kind of meaty so they don't taste as

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
get kind of meaty so they don't taste as
good<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.320> soon<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
good so as soon as they get to that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.850 
good so as soon as they get to that
snapping<00:01:35.759> stage<00:01:36.329> they're<00:01:36.900> ready<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> harvest

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
snapping stage they're ready to harvest

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.230 
snapping stage they're ready to harvest
now<00:01:38.850> string<00:01:39.240> beans<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.259> cold<00:01:40.710> climate

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
now string beans are a cold climate

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
now string beans are a cold climate
vegetable<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> gets<00:01:42.840> over<00:01:43.170> 80<00:01:43.409> degrees

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
vegetable so if it gets over 80 degrees

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.460 
vegetable so if it gets over 80 degrees
outside<00:01:44.189> they'll<00:01:44.790> quit<00:01:45.090> producing

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
outside they'll quit producing

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.950 
outside they'll quit producing
vegetables<00:01:46.470> all<00:01:46.979> together<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.060> make<00:01:48.390> sure<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
vegetables all together so make sure and
