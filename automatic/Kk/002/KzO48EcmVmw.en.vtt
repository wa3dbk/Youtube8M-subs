 describes the communities of fish that 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.559
 they inhabit along the water column 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.559
 deep in the Mediterranean from the 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.450
 surface up to 1000 meters 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.099
 the work confirms the importance of 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.650
 these species in the transport of 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.480
 matter and energy from the surface 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.680
 up to deep ecosystems

 Oceanography and Senior Council 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.960

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.880
 analyzed diversity abundance and 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.970
 distribution of fish stocks 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.160
 month or pelagic those who live at 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.989
 length of the water column from the 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.660
 surface up to two thousand meters of 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.120
 depth whose vertical migrations 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.239
 daily are keys for networks

 dips magazine and research work 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.050
 titled vertical distribution

 university and assemblage off shore 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.640

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.830
 mediterranean 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.600
 for the first time in the Mediterranean 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.040
 Western has studied this 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.140
 community of fish using 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.020
 simultaneously eco scientific probes 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.300
 multi-frequency and the use of gear 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.630
 ars of large pelagic trawls 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.040
 dimensions and other smaller networks 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.740
 with the echo sounders it has been possible to locate 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.930
 and characterize the so-called layers of 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.759
 deep reflection that are at 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.130
 along the water column already 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.170
 different depths according to the time 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.659
 of the day while with the networks has been 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.789
 been able to capture and study the species 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.460
 that these layers form both the 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.320
 species with higher swimming capacity 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.820
 as smaller species than even 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.710
 they are part of zooplankton 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.750
 the month or pelagic fish of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.700
 Mediterranean ' are characterized by 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.590
 present a relatively diversity 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.140
 low compared to other regions 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.300
 the world's main ocean 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.480
 groups that form these populations are 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.580
 the thousand topics or lantern fish and 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.490
 stones reports among which fits 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.140
 highlight the tomato and two of 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.150
 Smallest size a few 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.730
 centimeters but with a very large mouth 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.650
 and endowed with numerous teeth that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.800
 allows to capture prey relatively 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.860
 big ax fish and species 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.560
 larger chauliodus is long line 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.709
 and this makes me look like an aggressive boa 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.330
 by the large size of its teeth and mouth 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.550
 all these fish have the ability to 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.170
 produce light through some organs 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.380
 specials that they have throughout the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.880
 body called photo forums has been 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.250
 determined that the depth is the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.400
 most important factor that determines the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.900
 associations of these fish in fact the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.519
 main differences have been observed 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.459
 between the populations of the margin of 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.549
 platform approximately 250 meters 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.569
 of depth and slope up to 900 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.090
 meters deep 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.159
 and along the water column between 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.439
 the surface the reflection layer 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.349
 deep located 400 meters from 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.760
 depth has also been found that 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.579
 some of these species perform 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.719
 important daily migrations 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.280
 moving up to several hundred 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:22.209
 meters along the water column 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.829
 in this sense the bonus is split 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.870
 brawn cyclotone and it is a little species 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.120
 migrant and probably one of the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.579
 main responsible for the layer of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.780
 permanent deep localized reflection 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.209
 between 400 and 600 meters deep 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.920
 on the contrary the youthful phases and 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.709
 adults of small-sized species and 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.440
 median of myths and two as cerato scope 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.270
 Maderenses perform important 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.430
 migrations along the column of 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.930
 water and in this way contribute to 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.510
 form the reflection layer that is 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.940
 detects on surface at night and 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.650
 that disappears at sunrise the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.390
 exception to this behavior are the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.970
 larger specimens of some 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.730
 myths phyla such as anp and stroke with 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.820
 crocodylus that are distributed closer 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.440
 of the background the 2 mati 2 bonuses together with 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.450
 the thousand toxic are the marine fish 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.150
 most abundant and cosmopolitan of all

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.709
 migratory of these species have claimed 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.830
 a huge importance in the past 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.360
 years since their vertical movements to 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.520
 along the water column are from 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.100
 great ecological importance for 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.630
 deep ecosystems these fish 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.820
 act at night to the layers 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.770
 productive areas where 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.900
 they feed and during the day they descend 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.150
 hundreds of meters to be placed in the 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.030
 middle layers of the water column where 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.370
 they are accessible to their predators 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.270
 coming from the deepest layers 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.310
 therefore constitute a flow of 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.930
 matter and energy between the layers 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.169
