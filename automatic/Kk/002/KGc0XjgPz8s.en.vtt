fur some of them may look white but you

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.059 
fur some of them may look white but you
can<00:03:52.120> come<00:03:52.389> along<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:52.930> just<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.439> can<00:03:53.620> pull

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
can come along and you just you can pull

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.949 
can come along and you just you can pull
out<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:54.310> fur<00:03:54.459> quite<00:03:54.760> easily<00:03:54.969> and<00:03:55.299> in<00:03:55.540> fact<00:03:55.810> a

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
out the fur quite easily and in fact a

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.780 
out the fur quite easily and in fact a
lot<00:03:56.349> of<00:03:56.439> it<00:03:56.530> comes<00:03:56.709> away<00:03:56.950> near<00:03:57.189> in<00:03:57.370> your<00:03:57.549> hands

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
lot of it comes away near in your hands

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.640 
lot of it comes away near in your hands
and<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.239> they're<00:03:58.810> going<00:03:58.989> through<00:03:59.230> their<00:03:59.379> molt

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
and so they're going through their molt

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.319 
and so they're going through their molt
at<00:03:59.829> that<00:03:59.980> stage<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.519> at<00:04:00.609> that<00:04:00.760> stage<00:04:00.939> they're

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
at that stage and at that stage they're

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.229 
at that stage and at that stage they're
legal<00:04:01.569> to<00:04:01.719> hunt<00:04:02.129> up<00:04:03.129> until<00:04:03.519> very<00:04:03.549> recently

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
when most of the hunt was for the pelts

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.699 
when most of the hunt was for the pelts
they<00:04:07.269> would<00:04:07.419> wait<00:04:07.599> until<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.109> molt<00:04:08.469> was

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
they would wait until that molt was

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.099 
they would wait until that molt was
completed<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.459> they<00:04:09.909> entered<00:04:10.540> into<00:04:10.719> what<00:04:10.989> is
