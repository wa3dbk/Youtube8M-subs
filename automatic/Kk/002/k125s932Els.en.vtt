00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.309
 hello we are in one of the venues of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.709
 Latin American installation festival 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.600
 of free software that in peace has 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.520
 as the seat of the state vice-presidency 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.710
 plurinational of bolivia 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.419
 we come to find out how easy is the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.419
 installing linux on a laptop 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.780
 good today we brought a one netbook intel 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.420
 atom with windows 7 to install 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.640
 some linux distribution and see how 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.670
 we can improve this system we are with 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.800
 Carlos who is going to be our guru the day 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.530
 today is going to be our guide that is going 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.330
 to take step by step about how we can 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.610
 install a Linux distribution in 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.739
 this computer that we brought today what 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.410
 Linux version we should install 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.620
 for this computer because by the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.110
 team requirement I think that 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.430
 it's going to be for someone who does not have much 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.399
 contact with what is free software 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.759
 with linux then I would recommend a 1 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.560
 point is more like 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.520
 commercial software that we knew we can 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.229
 keep our windows with having linux 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.210
 at the same time clear that yes there are two 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.420
 options one that is making a dual 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.070
 boot and the other is erasing directly 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.690
 in another good operating system in this 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.429
 case what we want is to get rid of 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.830
 windows and leave the latest version 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.390
 of ubuntu to be able to use it and that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.130
 so that it works better our 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.479
 computer so big 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.479
 without insurance wines 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.790
 we went 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.740
 ok once the initial drip is done 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.259
 gives the welcome screen to be able 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.090
 perform the installation of the world 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.409
 we have the screen on the left 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.390
 all the languages ​​in which you 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.070
 they cost at the interface with which 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.280
 you can perform the installation in this 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.009
 case let's use the Spanish one ok now 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.970
 gives you the option of being able to connect to 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.380
 a wifi connection to be able to do 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 same time of my installation the 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.280
 download of updated packages 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.019
 then we connect because now we 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.670
 informs that we have the necessary space 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.440
 for the installation that we are 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.300
 connected with the laptop charger 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.730
 and that we are also connected to 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.110
 internet at the same time we can give 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.390
 the option to download the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.519
 updates while they are installed and 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.730
 Likewise also install your software 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.730
 of treasures where it would be in mp3 and others 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.650
 now if they give you the options to be able 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.599
 perform type of installation type of 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.590
 actually the type of partitioning of the 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.870
 disk for 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.790
 and proceed with installation you have the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.890
 option to install the hidden along with 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.050
 windows 7 to that is called the dual vote 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.760
 you also have the option to replace 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.030
 the windows 7 with ubuntu that will be a 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.129
 clean installation ok but you have here 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.620
 one one or the other option that says more 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.720
 options 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.190
 what is it that we are going to use 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.830
 to start what I do 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.340
 is to create a partition this team 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.880
 it only has one gig of ram then 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.200
 let's proceed to create a partition 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.450
 swap that is called that is for 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.069
 memory exchange I keep it 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.069
 as an exchange area 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.840
 and proceed to create the partition and we have 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.390
 the free space to continue with the 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.780
 installation in this free space 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.060
 I return to create another partition there 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.270
 by style I always put him of the 10 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.000
 gigas 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.380
 you take in this case 15 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.380
 in which will be 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.860
 all our operating system that is 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.290
 symbolize with this is the one that comes 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.170
 being the root then now we proceed 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.600
 with the installation it will automatically go to 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.460
 be the formatting of the partitions 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.140
 and well after having put the 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.500
 username the owner of the machine 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.410
 data and he asked us now 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.400
 started the installation as such that it 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.400
 fully automatic way 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.790
 good once he completed the 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.190
 installation and updating of the 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.900
 packages through the internet we give 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.260
 to restart now the last one will start 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.260
 He passed 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.930
 because linux is better than windows 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.229
 when reality is not about whether it is 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.540
 better or worse power what it is 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:05:01.040
 what is ethics 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.730
 because one has that need to say 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.780
 that knowledge belongs to everyone and not 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.330
 close 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.870
 that is to say that one person only one 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.409
 person has all the knowledge just 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.689
 for him 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.779
 one of the great advantages it has in 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.430
 linux is the linen genre is the 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.720
 stability 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.970
 they were the 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.870
 in power to have total control 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.870
 about text 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.580
 well after a process that we 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.820
 It took about half an hour 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.940
 change this computer with a 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.550
 atomizer processor of windows 7 now to the 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.890
 latest version of ubuntu we find you 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.170
 that the process is quite simple but 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.340
 yes it took us a bit of time it was a 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.110
 little more than we expected 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.060
 but it was quite simple we would like 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.770
 thank Carlos from the community of 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.080

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.610
 helped in the whole process and that we 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.710
 has also helped us to be 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.450
 will remove the fear of trying to work 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.450
 with free software thank you carlos 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.919
