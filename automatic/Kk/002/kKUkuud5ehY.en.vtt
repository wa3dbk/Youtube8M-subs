00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.180
 it is the fifth time that the customer of the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.410
 name seems that you finally see the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.799
 client of the vouchers I will be able to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.360
 explain or make the video that is like the 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.860
 eighth time he tries to start 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.200
 evaluation and they all lived the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.740
 customer in black and good can finally 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.150
 do what 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.070
 what is said we are here in this video very 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.630
 good very good afternoon to all guys and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.150
 we are in this video of tips for 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.340
 upload it 2 this what is good 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.199
 explain is my trick home a trick that 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 I used for quite some time and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 It must be said that I do not always apply it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.570
 because it's not always so simple 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.370
 apply but when I get it applied 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 the truth that he noticed a lot and I'm going 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.760
 great this little trick is a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.350
 foolishness many will seem like an act 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.789
 so silly is to say to see what 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.399
 pussy do you a video to tell us this 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.500
 but I the truth that my opinion to me 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.360
 It serves quite a lot and many people also 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.649
 It serves well, well, if there is someone 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 What can this trick be for me? 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.460
 I will not say if it goes well 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.500
 great and if not then 200 guys will have 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 that find another way to upload it and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.690
 good this trick is based on the focus 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.680
 the sun and in a very different way 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.000
 usually always in solution foci 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.379
 as we are playing with four 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.080
 people in our team and against 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.450
 five people from the enemy what is 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.650
 people and with five people but I what 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 that you do in soccer only that of a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.070
 way totally different approaches 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.690
 just as if he were playing altar 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.880
 show road and a game of these that is a 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.330
 game of a person and that simply 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.400
 what there are are items and things like 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.530
 game already prepared not what you want to be 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.090
 so no, I do not think I'm playing 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.520
 with four people but I'm good 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.440
 14 votes against 5 bots that have a 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.960
 difficulty and that the game has x 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.960
 difficulties x difficulty includes me 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.240
 vote can go 0 6 what myth can go 0 4 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.160
 and whoever sees me carry can become a 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 20 0 also what I have to do 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.330
 is to be good enough 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 to win the game and taking 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.600
 realize that my team is going to do what 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.920
 they do not I can not change what 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 they make from car play simply 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.260
 my departure then what I do is like 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.640
 that the rest is the same 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.200
 of people I just look at my 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.580
 character and I'm constantly thinking 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.260
 let's see what I can do to get 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.000
 advantage I'm playing from it was destroyed to 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.070
 with medium, no matter how much the game 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.210
 let's do about 7 I think to see what 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.830
 I could do now to try 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.600
 Going back the game to see could buy 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.070
 2 or 3 Suarez so they do not give us that 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.440
 do more or if I see that he has nothing 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.500
 give I do not know to questions 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 do not take into account anyone from the team or 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.530
 of nobody from the enemy team as if 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.000
 we were playing a game played 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.620
 like just saying give a game 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 totally of a player and not a 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.950
 multiplayer that what it does is that we 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.420
 will allow us to concentrate very much 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.760
 so the game is just going to try 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.720
 in ours and in our mistakes as 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.210
 what do I mean if you go to any 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.850
 half as jungle and suddenly the middle what 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.260
 does not kill fatal and for then 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.930
 blame is not the means that has made 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.970
 missing but the fault is yours for not having 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.290
 done well enough something that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.700
 you could have done to be able to kill or 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.080
 but he could simply have gone to 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.940
 bleach there because maybe it's forced 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.950
 too much or maybe that kid is not 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.510
 playing medium therefore simply 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.220
 what you have to do is at least just 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.980
 fun for me to focus the game 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.960
 as if you were playing a game of 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.760
 only one player as if there were no more 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.050
 people in the game then like that 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.820
 they are not people you can not take the 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.220
 you are not going to be able to crack you are not going to 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.530
 to be able to say at this time is lost 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.120
 heading not because they are bots they are 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.620
 machines that are playing and being 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.150
 playing how are they programmed to 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.530
 play open games that are going to be 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.540
 very easy to win and there will be games 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.820
 that are going to be impossible or very, very 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.450
 hard to win but good 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.760
 you learn more in a game than standing 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.110
 in a game that you win so that's 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.720
 something very important that is something that the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.280
 people understand they get angry many 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.200
 people are paid a lot for losing 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.970
 games and I understand that you can 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.910
 get discouraged a little but get angry not 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.440
 because really to see if we want here 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.010
 become something in this game we want to 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.480
 get to improve never good we're not going to 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.550
 have to lose many many games 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.769
 and we are going to have to win many other 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.599
 it's true but the question is that if I go 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.810
 to have to win a thousand games and lose 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.099
 900 games we will learn more in 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.540
 each of those games that we lose 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.069
 that in each of those games that 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.690
 we win because when we win everything is 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.760
 very beautiful and nobody notices things 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.079
 but when we lose if you're not critical 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.730
 with yourself you can look at your 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.590
 mistakes and you're going to be like you 're really going to 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.390
 improve and good that's all that's the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.579
 small tip of the little homemade trick 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.890
 of playing the game I say growing in 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.599
 just as if it were a game of just one 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.640
 player and not 10 players really 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.220
 It is good to see if it serves you and if it serves you 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.600
 then comment melo and let me know if 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.799
 It really has been used for something 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.109
 it really is nonsense and it is already 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.389
 I hope you liked it I will do 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.800
 the relationship was a little tip and 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.600
 that you know that the next video that 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.460
 I will make tips to upload 3 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.530
 is going to be about how it is to stay as it is 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.270
 create a line and try to explain 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.400
 some more things out there for what 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.050
 serves how to do it from some little thing that 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.490
 I can learn, I have not remembered 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.810
 that with a like you help a lot to that 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.010
 the channel continues to grow because if I do not 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.140
 I mistake the fact that a video has 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.030
 enough likes makes more people can 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.960
 watch the video the video comes to more people 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.850
 from youtube itself like what 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.050
 we share exactly how it goes but with 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.970
 an issue that many times people 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.250
 that you share dais like if 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.570
 you want a friend and all these things 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.410
 thank you very much for supporting my work 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.410
 up other people
