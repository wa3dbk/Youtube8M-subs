00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.039
 if that's the market there 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.800
 currently on the treadmill 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.860
 We now have a fourth shot 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.780
 since the deaf recovery in work this 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.519
 Of course we should do that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.989
 help the players fit with moderately 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.110
 constantly evolving that horst 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.969
 and to bring the new level and the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.509
 better trainings control 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.770
 that they are more powerful 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.259
 but that one on the regeneration 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.110
 Watch our served test 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.490
 Everyone has due to the evaluation and 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.409
 especially from the test at the pulse factory 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.289
 every human is different everyone has that 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.450
 other pools and thereby can the 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.000
 train the training plan better 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.250
 shape and thereby get efficient 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.909
 work and for him in one direction 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.679
 who made the best of it 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.679
 here determines how we in the first 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.540
 as it looks currently is not 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.450
 only the biscuits but we have a 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.580
 program with over winter so it would be 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 certainly not useful if we 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.000
 Do not do that because you are the patent 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.070
 Of course this is how it works 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.820
 but as it looks now believe 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.020
 they are very well on the way and am 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.460
 at the end of the week you will be the one 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.680
 whole evaluations on pinpoint 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.960
 of course there is always a lot in football 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.479
 position-dependent midfield engine 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 in midfield, the engine just plays 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.570
 the team that he allows more 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.300
 kilometer that we defended them but 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.310
 nevertheless, georgi milosevic is me 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.600
 pretty far in front is now natural 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.820
 hard of 20 players but the cut 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.590
 is is remarkably good and and that is 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.050
 something that is very important to me, yes 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 so now the fed with 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.480
 Body fat measurement fabricated sourced 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.670
 the players would be on the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.040
 connection and there's but you can yes 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.040
 a lot in fat and water at the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.630
 read out muscle because it 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.880
 may be may be worth the increased 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.670
 somewhere that's his feelings 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.870
 its up four important natural four 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.040
 player very well and to know or 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.480
 Turning families around to know that one 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.920
 required in the physical area 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.750
 has to work even more 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.489
 that means maybe if he is too much 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.590
 weight around that one has that 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.440
 come down that one has the ideal 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.019
 area is where they always so angeieÃŸen 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.730
 There are parameters and the apps there but 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.510
 Singing is all the more powerful I am 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.510
 then in the square
