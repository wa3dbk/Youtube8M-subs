00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.630 
case is actually on your desktop I say
this<00:02:19.110> because<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.890> battery<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:20.610> a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
this because the battery is actually a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.670 
this because the battery is actually a
little<00:02:20.700> heavy<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.720> hold<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.230> your<00:02:22.260> hand<00:02:22.530> for

dropping it a we have at the bottom of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.050 
dropping it a we have at the bottom of
ACN<00:02:28.349> it's<00:02:28.470> not<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.769> bad<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.579> hold<00:02:29.730> iPad

to be up at a stand angle and you pretty

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.759 
to be up at a stand angle and you pretty
much<00:02:56.639> will<00:02:56.940> use<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:57.359> this<00:02:57.599> again<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.620> can

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
much will use it like this again you can

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.379 
much will use it like this again you can
hold<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.069> for<00:02:59.099> short<00:02:59.400> periods<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.670> time<00:02:59.790> as<00:03:00.150> the
