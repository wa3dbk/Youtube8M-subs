00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
in the team if I like a get home in one

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.860 
in the team if I like a get home in one
there<00:02:26.409> similar<00:02:26.769> okay<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:27.370> as<00:02:27.579> a<00:02:27.670> customer

there similar okay just as a customer

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.589 
there similar okay just as a customer
say<00:02:28.870> hey<00:02:29.079> it's<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.709> same<00:02:30.180> yes<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.359> definitely

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
say hey it's the same yes I definitely

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.869 
say hey it's the same yes I definitely
bet<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.409> will<00:02:32.590> win<00:02:32.829> we<00:02:33.370> need<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.670> three

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
bet that will win we need the three

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.610 
bet that will win we need the three
points<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.599> it's<00:02:34.810> fundamental<00:02:35.439> that<00:02:35.470> we

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
points and it's fundamental that we

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.500 
points and it's fundamental that we
continue<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.220> be<00:02:36.340> unbeaten<00:02:36.879> at<00:02:37.000> home<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.450> think

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
continue to be unbeaten at home I think

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:48.839 
continue to be unbeaten at home I think
I<00:02:46.409> hear<00:02:47.409> a<00:02:47.560> thing<00:02:47.769> absolutely<00:02:48.310> anything<00:02:48.609> is

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
I hear a thing absolutely anything is

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.759 
I hear a thing absolutely anything is
possible<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.359> football<00:02:49.780> but<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.349> think<00:02:50.590> need<00:02:50.739> to

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
possible in football but I think need to

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.679 
possible in football but I think need to
pick<00:02:51.069> up<00:02:51.220> as<00:02:51.340> many<00:02:51.459> points<00:02:51.790> as<00:02:52.000> they<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.419> and

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
pick up as many points as they can and

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.179 
pick up as many points as they can and
it<00:02:52.989> would<00:02:53.139> be<00:02:53.260> great<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:53.709> they<00:02:53.829> could<00:02:53.859> help

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
it would be great if they could help

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:55.949

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
around Madrid out in the process it

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.390
