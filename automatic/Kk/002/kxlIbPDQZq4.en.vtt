00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
paddock dimensions and the way that your

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.830 
paddock dimensions and the way that your
paddocks<00:00:10.349> are<00:00:10.590> set<00:00:10.950> up<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.480> when<00:00:12.480> your<00:00:12.599> grazing

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
paddocks are set up on when your grazing

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.350 
paddocks are set up on when your grazing

a herbivore like that the the shape and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.630 
a herbivore like that the the shape and
size<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.779> your<00:00:18.930> paddock<00:00:19.289> makes<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.710> lot<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
size of your paddock makes a lot of a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.029 
size of your paddock makes a lot of a
difference<00:00:21.260> depending<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.859> your<00:00:23.010> goals

are and the way that you have your

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.300 
are and the way that you have your
animals<00:00:26.970> enter<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.990> paddocks<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.830> also<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
animals enter the paddocks can also have

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.010 
animals enter the paddocks can also have
a<00:00:29.550> huge<00:00:30.119> effect<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:31.850> what<00:00:32.850> you're<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
a huge effect on what you're going to

what kind of results are going to get

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.319 
what kind of results are going to get
either<00:00:36.120> via<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:37.410> either<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:38.070> your<00:00:38.100> sheep<00:00:38.579> let's

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
either via or either on your sheep let's

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.560 
either via or either on your sheep let's
say<00:00:39.540> or<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.829> grass<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.190> I've<00:00:41.879> drawn<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> few

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
say or or the grass so I've drawn a few

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.010 
say or or the grass so I've drawn a few
little<00:00:42.690> diagrams<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.430> goal<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
little diagrams here so if your goal is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.190 
little diagrams here so if your goal is
to<00:00:46.020> maximize<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.610> forage<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.480> your<00:00:48.660> animals

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to maximize the forage that your animals

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.240 
to maximize the forage that your animals
are<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> eat<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.610> paddock<00:00:52.070> first<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
are going to eat in a paddock first of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.150 
are going to eat in a paddock first of
all<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.670> more<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.300> paddock<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.440> more<00:00:55.649> square

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
all a more a paddock that is more square

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.180 
all a more a paddock that is more square
would<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.210> ideal<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.870> forge<00:00:58.320> efficiency

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
would be ideal for forge efficiency

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.700 
would be ideal for forge efficiency
however<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.149> drawn<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.230> diagram

is a more of a square shape and all

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
is a more of a square shape and all

or sheep okay and all the dotted lines
that<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.630> horizontally<00:01:28.500> across<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that are going horizontally across the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.380 
that are going horizontally across the
page<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.810> my<00:01:31.680> symbol<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.759> poly<00:01:33.090> wire

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
page that is my symbol for a poly wire

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.050 
page that is my symbol for a poly wire
poly<00:01:33.810> braid<00:01:34.200> okay<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.490> your<00:01:35.610> electric

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
poly braid okay so that's your electric

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.950 
poly braid okay so that's your electric
fence<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:38.490> you're<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.329> when

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
fence so what you're going to do is when

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
fence so what you're going to do is when
your<00:01:40.110> cattle<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> sheep<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.460> paddock

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
your cattle and sheep are in a paddock

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.450 
your cattle and sheep are in a paddock
like<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.140> want<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> maximize<00:01:43.950> forage

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
like this if you want to maximize forage

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880 
like this if you want to maximize forage
utilization<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.110> move<00:01:46.290> your<00:01:46.409> poly<00:01:46.649> wire

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
utilization you just move your poly wire

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.960 
utilization you just move your poly wire
down<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.180> down<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
down like this down like this so the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.719 
down like this down like this so the
animals<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.649> spread<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.680> over<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.250> wider

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
animals are spread out over a wider

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.050 
animals are spread out over a wider
distance<00:01:54.450> which<00:01:55.380> means<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.460> they

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
distance which means they can just they

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.950 
distance which means they can just they
can<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.420> move<00:01:57.659> down<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.500> grace<00:01:59.460> okay<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
can just move down and grace okay so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.300 
can just move down and grace okay so
they're<00:02:01.110> not<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.530> trampling<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
they're not going to be trampling that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
they're not going to be trampling that
much<00:02:02.520> grass<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.600> such<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> wide

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
much grass because they have such a wide

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.690 
much grass because they have such a wide
area<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.880> move<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.630> New<00:02:06.810> forage<00:02:07.320> okay<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
area to move down to New forage okay so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.809 
area to move down to New forage okay so
this<00:02:09.119> entire<00:02:09.390> line<00:02:09.989> right<00:02:10.379> here<00:02:10.770> let's<00:02:11.670> say

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
this entire line right here let's say

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.680 
this entire line right here let's say
that's<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.150> hundred<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.540> fifty<00:02:12.870> feet

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
that's a hundred and fifty feet

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.080 
that's a hundred and fifty feet
that's<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.530> hundred<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.040> fifty<00:02:15.340> feet<00:02:15.610> that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
that's a hundred and fifty feet that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.110 
that's a hundred and fifty feet that
let's<00:02:16.480> say<00:02:16.750> you're<00:02:17.080> 200<00:02:17.800> head<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.010> cattle<00:02:18.190> can

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
let's say you're 200 head of cattle can

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.500 
let's say you're 200 head of cattle can
then<00:02:19.300> graze<00:02:19.770> alright<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.280> there<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.880> downward

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
then graze alright so there the downward

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.300 
then graze alright so there the downward
the<00:02:22.750> direction<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.290> your<00:02:23.620> cattle<00:02:24.160> or<00:02:24.280> sheep

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
the direction that your cattle or sheep

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.570 
the direction that your cattle or sheep
are<00:02:24.610> going<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> go<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.210> downward<00:02:26.080> okay<00:02:26.980> so

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
are going to go is downward okay so

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.370 
are going to go is downward okay so
you're<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:28.180> are<00:02:28.210> giving<00:02:28.690> them<00:02:28.840> long<00:02:29.080> narrow

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
you're you are giving them long narrow

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.590 
you're you are giving them long narrow
strips<00:02:29.800> but<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.550> way<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:31.180> which<00:02:31.360> you're

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
strips but the way in which you're

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.960 
strips but the way in which you're
moving<00:02:31.960> them<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.590> key<00:02:32.770> difference<00:02:33.220> okay

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
moving them is the key difference okay

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.650 
moving them is the key difference okay
so<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:35.260> explain<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.300> little<00:02:37.300> bit<00:02:37.480> better

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
so to explain that a little bit better

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.530 
so to explain that a little bit better
let's<00:02:38.050> go<00:02:38.230> over<00:02:38.530> here<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:39.220> page<00:02:39.610> which

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
let's go over here to this page which

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.560 
let's go over here to this page which
the<00:02:41.080> goal<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:42.100> trample<00:02:42.640> as<00:02:42.880> much<00:02:43.180> grass

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
the goal is to trample as much grass

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.590 
the goal is to trample as much grass
onto<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.290> ground<00:02:44.640> now<00:02:45.640> we<00:02:45.700> want<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.210> trample

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
onto the ground now we want to trample

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.840 
onto the ground now we want to trample
grass<00:02:47.080> onto<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.710> ground<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.280> feed<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.670> soil

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
grass onto the ground to feed the soil

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.570 
grass onto the ground to feed the soil
life<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.630> keep<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.960> soil<00:02:50.200> cover<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:51.370> is

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
life and to keep the soil cover this is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.160 
life and to keep the soil cover this is
how<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.790> build<00:02:52.120> organic<00:02:52.720> matter<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.140> your

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
how you build organic matter in your

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.390 
how you build organic matter in your
soils<00:02:53.710> so<00:02:54.580> if<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.360> our<00:02:55.750> goal<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.950> cattle

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
soils so if that is our goal the cattle

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.910 
soils so if that is our goal the cattle
are<00:02:57.430> going<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.060> enter<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.540> paddock<00:02:58.960> in<00:02:59.140> this

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
are going to enter the paddock in this

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.200 
are going to enter the paddock in this
direction<00:03:00.720> okay<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:02.740> before<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.970> last

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
direction okay so before in the last

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.140 
direction okay so before in the last
paper<00:03:04.540> they<00:03:04.780> were<00:03:04.840> coming<00:03:05.290> down<00:03:05.590> now<00:03:06.580> cattle

paper they were coming down now cattle
are<00:03:07.270> going<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.720> enter<00:03:08.020> in<00:03:08.320> this<00:03:08.800> direction

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
are going to enter in this direction

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.990 
are going to enter in this direction

boundaries are and then they're going to

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.350 
boundaries are and then they're going to
start<00:03:30.520> feeding<00:03:30.910> okay<00:03:32.130> now<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.850> for<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.330> next

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
start feeding okay now so for the next

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.199 
start feeding okay now so for the next
paddock<00:03:35.080> move<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.950> might<00:03:36.250> want<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:36.790> go<00:03:37.000> down

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
paddock move you might want to go down

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.650 
paddock move you might want to go down
here<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.160> move<00:03:39.160> them<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.550> that<00:03:39.760> way<00:03:39.790> again<00:03:40.330> so

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
here and move them in that way again so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.380 
here and move them in that way again so
they're<00:03:41.320> going<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.500> be<00:03:41.620> trampling<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.670> lot<00:03:43.209> of

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
they're going to be trampling a lot of

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.600 
they're going to be trampling a lot of
this<00:03:43.600> grass<00:03:44.130> because<00:03:45.130> they're<00:03:45.280> not<00:03:45.400> going<00:03:45.519> to

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
this grass because they're not going to

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.400 
this grass because they're not going to
be<00:03:45.760> able<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.030> utilize<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.750> because<00:03:47.050> it's<00:03:47.230> been

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
be able to utilize it because it's been

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.800 
be able to utilize it because it's been
trampled<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.070> cattle<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.090> chief<00:03:49.269> generally

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
trampled and cattle and chief generally

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.110 
trampled and cattle and chief generally
will<00:03:49.989> not<00:03:50.200> eat<00:03:50.500> grass<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.459> has<00:03:51.580> been<00:03:51.760> fouled

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
will not eat grass that has been fouled

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.509 
will not eat grass that has been fouled
and<00:03:52.480> trampled<00:03:52.989> so<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.950> direction<00:03:54.340> that

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
and trampled so the direction that

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.940 
and trampled so the direction that
they're<00:03:54.790> moving<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.390> more<00:03:55.989> of<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.230> horizontal

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
they're moving is more of a horizontal

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.160 
they're moving is more of a horizontal
direction<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.519> again<00:03:58.269> that<00:03:58.480> comes<00:03:58.750> down<00:03:58.959> to

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
direction and again that comes down to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.880 
direction and again that comes down to
how<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.470> cattle<00:04:00.070> enter<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.060> paddock

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
how the cattle enter the paddock

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.550 
how the cattle enter the paddock
entering<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.100> way<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:03.970> as<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.930> can<00:04:05.080> see<00:04:05.350> on

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
entering this way so as you can see on

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.410 
entering this way so as you can see on
this<00:04:06.160> one<00:04:07.260> there's<00:04:08.260> not<00:04:08.560> going<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:08.890> be<00:04:08.950> this

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
this one there's not going to be this

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.720 
this one there's not going to be this
