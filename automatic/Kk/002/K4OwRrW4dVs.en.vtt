Pernell<00:04:16.400> Whitaker<00:04:16.430> boots<00:04:17.060> because<00:04:17.450> for<00:04:17.810> no

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
Pernell Whitaker boots because for no

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.650 
Pernell Whitaker boots because for no
will<00:04:18.170> occur<00:04:18.410> want<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:18.920> be<00:04:19.180> aggressive<00:04:20.180> so

will occur want you to be aggressive so
he<00:04:20.810> can<00:04:21.020> attack<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:22.250> know<00:04:22.310> I'm<00:04:22.610> coming<00:04:23.000> off<00:04:23.300> of

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
he can attack you know I'm coming off of

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.080 
he can attack you know I'm coming off of
his<00:04:23.630> deep<00:04:23.900> so<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:24.920> think<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.460> Piniella<00:04:25.910> will

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
his deep so I think that Piniella will

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.610 
his deep so I think that Piniella will
occur<00:04:26.330> would<00:04:26.450> be<00:04:26.660> for<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.170> Mayweather

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
occur would be for it Mayweather

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.490 
occur would be for it Mayweather
unanimous<00:04:28.280> decision<00:04:28.880> I<00:04:29.120> think<00:04:30.080> he<00:04:30.170> would<00:04:30.260> beat

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
unanimous decision I think he would beat

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.620 
unanimous decision I think he would beat
them<00:04:30.620> because<00:04:30.950> it's<00:04:31.610> just<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:32.120> would<00:04:32.270> be<00:04:32.420> just

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
them because it's just it would be just

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.660 
them because it's just it would be just
like<00:04:32.810> glove<00:04:33.170> will<00:04:33.770> because<00:04:34.010> of<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.280> flesh<00:04:34.490> you

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
like glove will because of the flesh you

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.980 
like glove will because of the flesh you
know<00:04:34.760> who'll<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.180> three<00:04:35.420> shots<00:04:35.690> for

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
know who'll and three shots for

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.680 
know who'll and three shots for
Mayweather<00:04:36.380> land<00:04:36.710> none<00:04:36.980> you<00:04:37.910> know<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.060> think<00:04:38.210> I

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
Mayweather land none you know I think I

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.600 
Mayweather land none you know I think I
think<00:04:39.230> that<00:04:39.380> Mayweather<00:04:39.770> will<00:04:40.040> land<00:04:40.310> some

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
think that Mayweather will land some

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.930 
think that Mayweather will land some
good<00:04:40.790> shots<00:04:41.000> on<00:04:41.330> but<00:04:42.160> it'll<00:04:43.160> be<00:04:43.280> hard<00:04:43.520> for<00:04:43.670> me

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
good shots on but it'll be hard for me

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.210 
good shots on but it'll be hard for me
with<00:04:44.120> Orlando<00:04:44.660> shots<00:04:44.990> on<00:04:45.380> with<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.890> pair<00:04:46.190> i

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
with Orlando shots on with a pair i

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.730 
with Orlando shots on with a pair i
think<00:04:46.550> will<00:04:46.760> occur<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.120> i<00:04:47.540> just<00:04:48.290> think<00:04:48.680> that

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
think will occur is i just think that

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.170 
think will occur is i just think that
will<00:04:49.190> occurs<00:04:49.490> reflexes<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.720> its<00:04:51.380> hand<00:04:51.920> speed

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
will occurs reflexes and its hand speed

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.260 
will occurs reflexes and its hand speed
um<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.080> fact<00:04:54.320> that<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.889> coming<00:04:55.610> off<00:04:55.789> you

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
um and the fact that you coming off you

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.629 
um and the fact that you coming off you
know<00:04:56.389> same<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.289> world<00:04:57.530> misses<00:04:57.949> a<00:04:57.979> shot<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.430> even

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
know same a world misses a shot and even

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.460 
know same a world misses a shot and even
though<00:04:58.729> he's<00:04:58.910> accurate<00:04:59.120> very<00:04:59.630> precise<00:05:00.110> I

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
though he's accurate very precise I

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.200 
though he's accurate very precise I
think<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.610> Pannell<00:05:02.300> will<00:05:02.509> occur<00:05:03.310> will<00:05:04.310> swim

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
think that Pannell will occur will swim

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.240 
think that Pannell will occur will swim
him<00:05:05.419> with<00:05:05.630> shots<00:05:05.660> you<00:05:06.229> know<00:05:06.350> every<00:05:06.680> 10<00:05:06.949> make

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
him with shots you know every 10 make

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.550 
him with shots you know every 10 make
Mayweather<00:05:07.729> pain<00:05:08.060> when<00:05:08.300> he<00:05:08.419> misses<00:05:08.690> because

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
Mayweather pain when he misses because

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.620 
Mayweather pain when he misses because
that's<00:05:09.830> just<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.130> type<00:05:10.280> of<00:05:10.340> fighter<00:05:10.669> Whitaker

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
was and sometimes he just didn't stop

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.210
