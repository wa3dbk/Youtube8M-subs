00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.710
 I'll show you in detail how I have it 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.219
 realized the support i found this 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.820
 these hobby components the hardware store 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.109
 present in practically all of Italy 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.900
 are components to make one 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:28.169
 tubular bookcase in these tubulars 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:34.530
 from 25 mm and these elbows and I have 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:36.600
 replaced a balloon with with this 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.840
 to which I applied instead of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.789
 nut a butterfly for nigro phonic rods 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.340
 I had one that I didn't use so 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.820
 this os apply it to the support of the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.980
 keyboard without using keys then due 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 make a change on the support because the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.660
 tubular of the keyboard support e 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.379
 from 30 mm instead these tubes are from 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.440
 25 so I put on a piece of sawn wood 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.519
 of the support of the tubular of the site the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.910
 keyboard support 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.610
 I entered this from 25 Nov locked it 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.220
 made a hole stuck with a bully 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.490
 the berry to which I applied is forgotten a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.780
 knob in case you want to remove it but 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.580
 it is also possible for those who are able to weld it to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.590
 this point the game is simple because 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:31.020
 once cut to size this 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 tubular fits this now I have 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.760
 just a hand because I'm reading the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.360
 phone with the other then a little vi 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.980
 I assure you it is very simple 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:49.310
 below for the game 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.710
 I then purchased this tray 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.830
 support for notebook drilled then i 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.450
 notebook breathe to which I applied 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.620
 this small glass that is always part 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.590
 of the components of the library that 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.550
 I bought these components as a hobby 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.810
 I applied it with gods 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.350
 data bolts as you also see 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.510
 this this screw to stop it me 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.790
 I apply it this way I keep it 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:28.430
 he does n't need it because I prefer it low 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.770
 I rotate freely on the support 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.330
 easily removable one very stable 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:40.720
 once the evening closes the butterfly below 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.350
 really immovable in this is how much 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.350
 totti
