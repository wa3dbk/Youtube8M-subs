00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
distorted I have a test online since

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.840 
distorted I have a test online since
reason<00:01:10.650> why<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.860> should<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> haven't

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
reason why you should so if you haven't

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.980 
reason why you should so if you haven't
watched<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.360> check<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> out

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
watched it go check it out

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
watched it go check it out
number<00:01:13.770> four<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.220> barely<00:01:14.549> noticed<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.090> but

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
number four I barely noticed this but

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
number four I barely noticed this but
the<00:01:15.390> laptop<00:01:15.810> does<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.170> close<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> way

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the laptop does not close all the way

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130 
the laptop does not close all the way
it's<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.700> magnetic<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> top<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> bottom

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it's not magnetic on the top and bottom

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.960 
it's not magnetic on the top and bottom
so<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.380> won't<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.799> shut<00:01:20.130> down<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> way

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so it won't really shut down all the way

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.120 
so it won't really shut down all the way
but<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.020> said<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.409> doesn't<00:01:22.590> close<00:01:22.830> all<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
but like I said it doesn't close all the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
but like I said it doesn't close all the
way<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.520> leaves<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.420> gap<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
way so it leaves just a little gap and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.480 
way so it leaves just a little gap and
that's<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:25.979> bummer<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.340> my

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that's just a little bummer in my

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
that's just a little bummer in my
opinion<00:01:26.850> number<00:01:27.780> five<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.320> laptop<00:01:28.680> itself

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
opinion number five the laptop itself

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
gets pretty dang high guess from about

80 Celsius to even higher depending on

at<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> same<00:01:35.939> time<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:36.869> recommend<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
at the same time so I really recommend a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
at the same time so I really recommend a
little<00:01:38.340> cooling<00:01:38.939> pad<00:01:39.119> doesn't<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> be

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
little cooling pad doesn't have to be

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.330 
little cooling pad doesn't have to be
the<00:01:39.930> most<00:01:40.079> expensive<00:01:40.380> cooling<00:01:40.920> pad<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the most expensive cooling pad but a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.830 
the most expensive cooling pad but a
definitely<00:01:41.759> good<00:01:41.939> cooling<00:01:42.270> pad<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.630> add

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
definitely good cooling pad that add

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230 
definitely good cooling pad that add
some<00:01:43.320> cool<00:01:43.530> air<00:01:43.680> into<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.159> fans<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.090> your

some cool air into your fans of your
laptop<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.259> my<00:01:46.439> opinion<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.950> much<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
laptop and in my opinion this is much a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.310 
laptop and in my opinion this is much a
bummer<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:48.119> when<00:01:48.540> you're<00:01:48.689> traveling<00:01:49.170> you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
bummer because when you're traveling you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.810 
bummer because when you're traveling you
want<00:01:49.470> yourself<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.399> light<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.790> possible

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
want yourself to be as light as possible

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090 
want yourself to be as light as possible
but<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.229> want<00:01:52.439> your<00:01:52.590> laptop<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
but you don't want your laptop to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.530 
but you don't want your laptop to
overheat<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> bring<00:01:54.360> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
overheat so you have to bring that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.020 
overheat so you have to bring that
cooling<00:01:54.869> pad<00:01:55.049> along<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.920> number<00:01:56.640> six

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the weapon quality is pretty bad it's

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.800 
the weapon quality is pretty bad it's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the contrast is very low and I really

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.929 
the contrast is very low and I really
would<00:02:03.659> recommend<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.380> external<00:02:05.219> webcam<00:02:05.579> if

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
very heavy so you have to think about

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.300 
very heavy so you have to think about
that<00:03:05.569> when<00:03:05.750> you're<00:03:05.930> traveling<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.680> bringing

that when you're traveling and bringing
it<00:03:07.430> around<00:03:07.519> because<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.329> very<00:03:08.450> heavy<00:03:08.689> and<00:03:08.989> if

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
it around because it's very heavy and if

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.929 
it around because it's very heavy and if
you're<00:03:09.409> gaming<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> go<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.790> have<00:03:10.909> to

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
you're gaming on the go you have to

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.910 
you're gaming on the go you have to
bring<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.420> cooling<00:03:11.870> pad<00:03:12.079> you<00:03:12.470> don't<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.769> to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
bring a cooling pad you don't have to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.830 
bring a cooling pad you don't have to
but<00:03:13.159> it's<00:03:13.310> best<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.939> not<00:03:14.299> overheat<00:03:14.720> your

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840

but it's best to not overheat your
laptop<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.680> just<00:03:15.889> adds<00:03:16.099> a<00:03:16.419> 1/2<00:03:17.419> pound

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
laptop and that just adds a 1/2 pound

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.409 
laptop and that just adds a 1/2 pound
extra<00:03:18.379> so<00:03:18.650> it's<00:03:18.859> not<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.430> most<00:03:19.639> light<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.150> set

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
extra so it's not the most light is set

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.379 
extra so it's not the most light is set
up<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.810> finally<00:03:21.739> number<00:03:21.949> 10<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.669> personally<00:03:23.239> do
