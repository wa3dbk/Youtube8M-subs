receiving all these boxycharm boxes so I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.130 
receiving all these boxycharm boxes so I

any<00:01:04.710> pretty<00:01:05.070> much<00:01:05.220> anyone<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.850> can

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
any pretty much anyone I think can

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270 
any pretty much anyone I think can
probably<00:01:06.210> use<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.350> three<00:01:07.950> shades

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
probably use one of these three shades

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.510 
probably use one of these three shades
for<00:01:08.580> their<00:01:08.700> eyebrows<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.950> fun<00:01:11.310> one

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
for their eyebrows so that's a fun one

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
for their eyebrows so that's a fun one
and<00:01:11.790> I'm<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.119> gonna<00:01:12.390> try<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and I'm just gonna try that because I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.550 
and I'm just gonna try that because I
have<00:01:14.030> sparse<00:01:15.030> brows<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.229> brush

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
have sparse brows and then this brush

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.359 
have sparse brows and then this brush
goes<00:01:17.220> along<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> looks<00:01:18.509> like

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
goes along with it and it looks like

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
goes along with it and it looks like
these<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.430> ends<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.659> used<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.049> shape<00:01:22.290> your

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
these two ends can be used to shape your

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.460 
these two ends can be used to shape your
brows<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.850> fill<00:01:24.030> them<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> that's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
brows and to fill them in so that's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.969 
brows and to fill them in so that's
really<00:01:25.590> nice<00:01:25.799> brush<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:28.860> we've

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
really nice brush and then I think we've

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.010 
really nice brush and then I think we've
actually<00:01:29.130> received<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.880> model<00:01:30.240> Co<00:01:30.450> product
