00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
good for like free ride is because it is

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.450 
good for like free ride is because it is
pretty<00:00:48.390> heavy<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.670> can't<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:52.460> do

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
pretty heavy it and you can't like do

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
pretty heavy it and you can't like do
any<00:00:53.670> cool<00:00:54.030> tricks<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.719> because<00:00:54.989> it's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
any cool tricks with it because it's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.240 
any cool tricks with it because it's
heavy<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.739> mean<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.840> downfall<00:00:58.530> but

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
heavy I mean so that's a downfall but

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.200 
heavy I mean so that's a downfall but
otherwise<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> great<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.789> drop

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
otherwise it is great it's like drop

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.750 
otherwise it is great it's like drop
through<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> plus<00:01:04.519> make<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> more

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
through so that's a plus make it more

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
through so that's a plus make it more
stable<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.220> I'm<00:01:09.200> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.439> a
