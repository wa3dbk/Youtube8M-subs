00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.800
 without a little bit of agitation when 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.800
 even unlike other races 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.300
 I think on the Tour de France this 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.900
 year we have a good workforce a good 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.670
 collective 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.670
 ayew who knows himself well 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.440
 I told anyone but it's 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.270
 true that this passage will protect itself 60 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.860
 days his side a little in the head 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.210
 it's a day where I wanted 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.110
 world pile up go on there was 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.970
 in front and 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.060
 so I think we will start again at 10 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.060
 hours 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.990
 my ambitions in the tour this year 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.400
 are obviously the overall ranking 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.210
 it is something that is important to me 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.160
 but mostly I still dream of going 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.050
 look for that stage win that me 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.940
 lack I think that as long as I have not 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.979
 go through this plateau there I will not be 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.050
 satisfied but the other side is a little 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.040
 in competition with my desire to do 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.040
 the general classification 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.750
 a balance sheet can we do a he is a step 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.630
 very glorious it was not a good 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 week for me many falls 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.780
 who finally made me lose 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.380
 time first of all I wanted to tried a 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 poker shot on the stage that was coming 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.710
 in Switzerland we would absolutely like to take 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.380
 the breakaway to try to replace me 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.790
 in general 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.350
 it's a cost that unfortunately has not 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.330
 worked I teach him the breakaway 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.450
 but I left too much strength for 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.160
 to be able to go through so that was 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.140
 totally crippling for my 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.880
 overall ranking so I focus 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.080
 now for two weeks to 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.080
 to come it's a victory 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.430
 rap 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.940
 I'm still coming 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.270
 every kilometer traveled will bring 1 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.130
 euros to the Pastor Institute to help 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.030
 precisely basic research so 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.240
 it's a nice initiative eiti I'm in pain 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.240
 on the legs 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.190
 witness of my son for the holiday of 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.810
 fathers 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.890
 18 and again you win in the course of the water 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.890
 so not even what good 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.530
 stormy compared to no like 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.140
 usually I have a flight dfr on important 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.230
 today by accor the goal of the 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.640
 stage victory is that it's going to be 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.110
 important 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.630
 then we have it here it's gone drawing 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.000
 and we fall, it's good to have 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.069
 agricultural world his descent there is a 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.600
 fall a puncture for not that it takes 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.290
 self alone also the basis of the money and 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.290
 of the world with nick
