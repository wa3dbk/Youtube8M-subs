00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and now we have six that are labeled

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.740 
and now we have six that are labeled
with<00:01:56.130> 2010<00:01:57.030> let's<00:01:57.360> add<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:57.719> more

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
with 2010 let's add some more

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
with 2010 let's add some more
descriptions<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.530> these<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.920> also<00:01:59.399> know<00:01:59.700> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
descriptions to these I also know that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
descriptions to these I also know that
they'll<00:02:00.030> same<00:02:00.270> six<00:02:00.570> images<00:02:00.960> were<00:02:01.170> taken<00:02:01.229> in

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
they'll same six images were taken in

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.639 
they'll same six images were taken in
Maine<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.700> already<00:02:03.240> added<00:02:03.450> Maine<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.350> here

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
Maine so I already added Maine up here

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.770 
Maine so I already added Maine up here
with<00:02:05.130> Acadia<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.060> were<00:02:06.149> also<00:02:06.509> taken

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
with Acadia because they were also taken

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
with Acadia because they were also taken
into<00:02:06.960> Cadia<00:02:07.259> National<00:02:07.710> Park<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.160> we'll<00:02:08.280> check

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
into Cadia National Park so we'll check

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
into Cadia National Park so we'll check
both<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.119> those<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.599> you'll<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.110> they

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
both of those and you'll see that they

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.500 
both of those and you'll see that they
get<00:02:10.379> added<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:11.099> over<00:02:11.370> here<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.819> once<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
get added right over here so once you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.850 
get added right over here so once you
have<00:02:12.629> these<00:02:12.810> set<00:02:13.050> up<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.290> really

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
have these set up is really

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.530 
have these set up is really
and<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.250> easy<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.610> add<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.390> can

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and it's easy to add so then you can

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.330 
and it's easy to add so then you can
start<00:02:15.690> sorting<00:02:16.080> your<00:02:16.170> images<00:02:16.500> faster<00:02:16.980> now<00:02:17.280> we

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
start sorting your images faster now we

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.130 
start sorting your images faster now we
do<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> category<00:02:18.240> called<00:02:18.420> animals<00:02:18.930> and
