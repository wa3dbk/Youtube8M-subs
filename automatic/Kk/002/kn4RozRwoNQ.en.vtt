00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
as where would you have it together it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.020 
as where would you have it together it
kind<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.710> combines<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.399> actually<00:01:13.579> got<00:01:13.850> some

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
kind of combines I actually got some

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.929 
kind of combines I actually got some
bacon<00:01:14.390> mushroom<00:01:15.429> balsamic<00:01:16.429> glaze<00:01:16.609> they<00:01:16.789> have

on there and I think it combines well
maybe<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.679> would<00:01:18.829> be<00:01:18.859> weirder<00:01:19.310> with<00:01:19.909> no

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
maybe it would be weirder with no
