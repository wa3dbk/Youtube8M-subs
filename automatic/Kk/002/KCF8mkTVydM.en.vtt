traveling I couldn't believe how easy it
was<00:05:05.350> to<00:05:05.380> stop<00:05:05.889> buying<00:05:06.160> useless<00:05:06.490> things<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.270> to

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
was to stop buying useless things and to

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.960 
was to stop buying useless things and to
save<00:05:07.630> money<00:05:07.860> because<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.100> had<00:05:09.430> that<00:05:09.639> big<00:05:09.850> goal

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
save money because I had that big goal

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.240 
save money because I had that big goal
in<00:05:10.150> mind<00:05:10.300> I<00:05:10.510> was<00:05:10.630> like<00:05:10.660> you<00:05:11.350> know<00:05:11.470> these<00:05:11.860> flimsy

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
in mind I was like you know these flimsy

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.860 
in mind I was like you know these flimsy
dresses<00:05:12.850> that<00:05:12.970> I'm<00:05:13.090> probably<00:05:13.300> never<00:05:13.660> gonna

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
dresses that I'm probably never gonna

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.370 
dresses that I'm probably never gonna
wear<00:05:14.169> or<00:05:14.680> this<00:05:15.669> amazing<00:05:16.330> trip<00:05:16.600> which<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.930> know<00:05:17.020> I

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
wear or this amazing trip which I know I

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.469 
wear or this amazing trip which I know I
want<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.770> go<00:05:17.890> on<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:18.280> I<00:05:18.340> can't<00:05:18.640> wait<00:05:18.880> for<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:19.330> it

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
want to go on and I can't wait for so it

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.390 
want to go on and I can't wait for so it
really<00:05:19.690> made<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:20.169> decision<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.800> lot<00:05:20.979> easier

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
really made that decision a lot easier

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.940 
really made that decision a lot easier
for<00:05:21.729> me<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.240> I<00:05:22.720> find<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.110> if<00:05:23.320> you<00:05:23.470> don't<00:05:23.680> have

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
for me and I find that if you don't have

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.200 
for me and I find that if you don't have
anything<00:05:24.190> in<00:05:24.400> particular<00:05:24.550> that<00:05:24.970> you're

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
anything in particular that you're

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.690 
anything in particular that you're
saving<00:05:25.630> for<00:05:25.870> it<00:05:26.169> can<00:05:26.530> be<00:05:26.650> easy<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.010> just<00:05:27.310> say<00:05:27.460> oh

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
saving for it can be easy to just say oh

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.670 
saving for it can be easy to just say oh
why<00:05:28.000> not<00:05:28.180> spend<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.570> $30.00<00:05:29.110> on<00:05:29.229> this<00:05:29.380> or<00:05:29.590> why

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
why not spend the $30.00 on this or why

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.790 
why not spend the $30.00 on this or why
not<00:05:29.740> spend<00:05:30.070> the<00:05:30.160> $50<00:05:30.760> on<00:05:30.910> this<00:05:31.090> but<00:05:31.810> if<00:05:32.620> you

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
not spend the $50 on this but if you

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.380 
not spend the $50 on this but if you
kind<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.130> have<00:05:33.310> that<00:05:33.340> something<00:05:33.970> in<00:05:34.210> mind

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
kind of have that something in mind

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.540 
kind of have that something in mind
whether<00:05:34.750> it's<00:05:35.020> you<00:05:35.620> maybe<00:05:36.039> it's<00:05:36.250> not<00:05:36.490> a

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
whether it's you maybe it's not a

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.580 
whether it's you maybe it's not a
specific<00:05:37.450> item<00:05:37.810> in<00:05:37.870> mind<00:05:38.080> but<00:05:38.200> you<00:05:38.260> really

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
specific item in mind but you really

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.860 
specific item in mind but you really
want<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.830> save<00:05:39.060> $10,000<00:05:40.060> to<00:05:40.330> have<00:05:40.479> like<00:05:40.750> an

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
want to save $10,000 to have like an

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.320 
want to save $10,000 to have like an
emergency<00:05:41.350> fund<00:05:41.500> for<00:05:41.770> yourself<00:05:42.070> or<00:05:42.330> whatever

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
emergency fund for yourself or whatever

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.630 
emergency fund for yourself or whatever
it<00:05:43.479> may<00:05:43.660> be<00:05:43.690> but<00:05:43.930> having<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:44.710> specific<00:05:45.400> goal

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
it may be but having that specific goal

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.900 
it may be but having that specific goal
in<00:05:45.669> mind<00:05:45.850> can<00:05:46.750> really<00:05:47.080> outweigh<00:05:47.680> making<00:05:48.400> small

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
in mind can really outweigh making small

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.570 
in mind can really outweigh making small
frivolous<00:05:49.479> purchases<00:05:49.720> of<00:05:50.320> things<00:05:50.680> that<00:05:50.950> are

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
frivolous purchases of things that are

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.219 
frivolous purchases of things that are
gonna<00:05:51.760> probably<00:05:52.000> end<00:05:52.240> up<00:05:52.479> in<00:05:52.630> your<00:05:52.660> house<00:05:52.900> for
