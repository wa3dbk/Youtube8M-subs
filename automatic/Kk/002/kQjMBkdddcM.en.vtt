00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.089
 about how will play manga 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.919
 through a link with the program the meetings to maxi 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.669
 remember 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.789
 I will try to solve the maximum possible doubts that you have sent me 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.439
 long all these days through private message 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.890
 and since I received 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.869
 excessively many 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.460
 many messages about the island 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.770
 I have been persecuted since I believe that I must resolve each and every one of the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.500
 doubts that you have 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.860
 The first thing we need is to enter our browser 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.530
 we hope that there will be this 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 a tad slow 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.450
 opens and we have to go to the official website of an entity 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040
 what is albert 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.480
 the event goes this 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 there are no tickets a toner 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.740
 once we give 20 points less 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.210
 we'll have to make an account that rival attack 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.560
 what we will do and we have to buy the game 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.590
 this owl can only be purchased digitally there is no disc form 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.360
 you can not buy any establishment 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.399
 but yes the thunder is the x2 only netbooks 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.740
 from Christmas 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.250
 but we are going to make the paseÃ­llo the version that touches today that is the one of pc 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.320
 once we have bought things from this same work 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.440
 to play so much the aviator 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.520
 as for when from the organism we give everything to the high 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 and the first thing we have to do is download your task boxes in this first 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640
 link and if you have very cute 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.280
 in this opposition ismac 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.970
 Ines jobs and tennis linux or another operating system like I have a 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.500
 teacher highlighted the first 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.670
 and what comes out 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.670
 this type in which up that is the focus 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.090
 on this page 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.799
 if we go down below we have the multiplayer fervent goals power that we have to 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.390
 we were this first that I am that sincerely 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 I recommend for vicente min 100 auction of spur operated 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.420
 although we have previous work families in recommended the 1st quarter while 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.870
 that rebounded 3 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.700
 the third thing we issue this is my country in google and just be able to download 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.909
 what the rally 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.609
 never and not only 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.709
 and once we have these three things we will proceed to proceed 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.189
 show you how to play 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.189
 Hi thanks for 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.969
 The first thing we have to do is stay at the desk 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.019
 a folder called mantras cervera 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.029
 and put 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.399
 the intras server dot exe theme I'm here 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.009
 in the folder there is no need to 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.790
 Obviously this folder is empty at first 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.849
 in fact the file is this only three months file 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.929
 the first time we run the file 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:41.129
 we have to let it load until the end and put us 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.699
 that what this art does all these these 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.919
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.689
 these let's say from text documents 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:51.829
 these files 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.659
 to be able to play and be able to join the boss and create a good server tomorrow 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.819
 once all these files are created they go the first time we give the mec the 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.139
 cerve and pos' this comes out 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.769
 we close it completely 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.529
 and we go to the folder sorry thing to the archive file properties server and what 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.499
 we open 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.499
 per hundred the notes panel 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.509
 and we leave it open because if I'm going to teach 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.509
 right now loja him what milks the ocp my daughter maxi 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.729
 the fuel 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.799
 the 2000 we were never going to see 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.659
 a network from scratch 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:32.819
 us when 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.079
 low eyes and ungrateful selma thing but of the thousand beds and for the first time passed 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.790
 that little window we're going to defend 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.559
 from which you put and your name the one that you want 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.629
 once you ll ll or it will come down here 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.150
 if you want to create a new little network join a different network a network already 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.710
 created 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.790
 us what you have to do that is to stay this time I wanted to create in 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.610
 exclusive for you and you can be all together but the same reform 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.090
 chis 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.779
 obviously the servers 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:02.329
 will be in charge of you those that 3 will play invites to people who from 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.419
 within that network 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.419
 but that's going to be your thing but I'm not going to make you worth it 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.389
 the other three were American I will remember but I'm going to create it for 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.230
 that you 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.899
 know state they do not want to leave the network leader 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.730
 you have to put this channel 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.870
 capitalize it will sell 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.870
 posted wanted and wanted 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.749
 exactly the same as what you put and hotels that you put it you want 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:28.870
 password 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.950
 one two three four five or six exactly it is worth remembering that you have 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.259
 to give even a reception center 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.159
 and you already know inside this network of never and that created simply for 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.719
 you writers and you can play among yourselves and well ask 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.219
 doubts and and other 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.490
 once this is done 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.789
 we come back 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.219
 percent once you're inside the maxi fence we go back 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.879
 amaya rebounded ex 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.309
 the person that 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.319
 want to create a server to play with other people 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.409
 what you have to do is fine this common properties file like the 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.409
 defeats and this screen is high here 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:10.269
 you will have to put the level that you want in this section level 

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:13.680
 lewis the name that you want 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.289
 the one that gives you the real one wins 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.370
 if you have people who have the version or premium chase other two lots buyer 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:22.569
 and there are people friends of yours or that the network of ever was and that it is not 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:23.189
 have 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.189
 you have to get on online moto 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.969
 and if instead of playing with people 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.729
 that he thinks bought everything only bought tennis for it recommended that by the 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.379
 structure that under you propose huge piles 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.539
 whoever believes the server is worth 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.559
 have to 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:46.629
 in its own name click right and copy address and pv 4 and put it where 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.349
 it is relevant 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.949
 once you do this' 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:51.860
 land 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.990
 and it will tell you that it is to save the titled data that is equal 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.810
 once done this you return to open the sleeves serra the set point 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.710
 and you will be created 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.610
 with the name that you have put 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.020
 in this case I put him 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.820
 world envisions a versus piratilla com because we are when a person who does not 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.599
 I had bought it 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.639
 i your ip 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.169
 what now has to undo with it worth 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.889
 Once you have it, it is obviously created, the first is that you create it, it will take 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.499
 a lot of good goes like 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:27.090
 two percentages comes it prevents it percent and good to start at 1 and then already 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.369
 the second time 

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:31.069
 you will go to this once you leave because the cadet 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:33.490
 this sport interrogation 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.699
 we leave it minimized 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.699
 and we go to the game itself 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.680
 let's open the game 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.680
 let's move 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.399
 we were going down multiple already 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.240
 remember 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.869
 the one that works the cicr the server has to be minimized 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:59.959
 and it's the multiple erc and put your own ip in the 2000's never and remember 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.150
 We are not going to the only matshiqi rights on styling copy itv address 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.139
 4 that must be done by each and every one of the people who are going to get 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.369
 to your server 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:12.770
 'each and every one and even san jose for example you say look 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.129
 the other two who play with me still 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.399
 now in this mangrove world it is worth yes 

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:21.969
 percent those people when the game comes in and the server is created 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.059
 have to copy 

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:28.189
 to be right click on your name since you have created server 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:32.869
 and in fact copy itv 4 and that is the index as the stamp to multiple already erc 

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.999
 and put your ip address here 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:36.129
 once you enter 

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:37.379
 you are inside the game 

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:40.740
 and it is perfectly possible to play with you 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.669
 ibarra is simply this for commenting 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:45.669
 I know it may seem like a mess perrone the sun 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:47.839
 very simple once you do it's the first time 

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:51.679
 I hope you liked that it has been especially useful this world is 

00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:55.029
