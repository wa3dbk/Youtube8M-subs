00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
what's changed well I'm just worried

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.670 
what's changed well I'm just worried
that<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.300> Altima<00:00:18.840> might<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.290> a<00:00:19.320> little<00:00:19.590> bit

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that the Altima might be a little bit

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
that the Altima might be a little bit
too<00:00:19.830> small<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.430> me<00:00:20.610> so<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.360> kind<00:00:21.810> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
too small for me so I was kind of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.529 
too small for me so I was kind of
considering<00:00:22.410> maybe<00:00:22.740> doing<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> Maxima<00:00:24.150> just

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
considering maybe doing the Maxima just

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.320 
considering maybe doing the Maxima just
a<00:00:24.630> little<00:00:24.900> bit<00:00:25.020> larger<00:00:25.470> sedan<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.850> I'm<00:00:27.000> Axl

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330

yeah yeah so this is actually going to
have<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.399> horsepower<00:01:01.100> getting<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.339> speed

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
have more horsepower getting up to speed

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.979 
have more horsepower getting up to speed
on<00:01:02.579> highways<00:01:03.089> a<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.449> bit<00:01:03.569> safer

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
on highways a little bit safer

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.359 
on highways a little bit safer
especially<00:01:04.440> around<00:01:04.530> Atlanta<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.250> not

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
especially around Atlanta if you're not

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.770 
especially around Atlanta if you're not
getting<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.700> getting<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.539> speed<00:01:06.750> on

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
getting up getting up to speed on

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.660 
getting up getting up to speed on
highways<00:01:07.289> you're<00:01:07.799> gonna<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.039> someone<00:01:08.430> we've

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
highways you're gonna have someone we've

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.160 
highways you're gonna have someone we've
all<00:01:08.789> had<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:08.969> so<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.539> on<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.810> rear<00:01:09.960> end

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
all had it so what on your rear end

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.770 
all had it so what on your rear end
pushing<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:11.610> thing<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.570> little

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
pushing you one thing so it's a little

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
pushing you one thing so it's a little
bit<00:01:12.899> safer<00:01:13.079> in<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.469> aspect<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:15.000> I've

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
bit safer in that aspect also as I've

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420 
bit safer in that aspect also as I've
mentioned<00:01:15.390> last<00:01:15.750> time<00:01:15.899> this<00:01:16.649> still<00:01:16.950> does<00:01:17.189> have

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
mentioned last time this still does have

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
mentioned last time this still does have
the<00:01:17.880> continuously<00:01:18.750> variable<00:01:19.009> transmission

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the continuously variable transmission

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.099 
the continuously variable transmission
so<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.119> accelerating<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.930> one

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
so when you're accelerating it's one

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.920 
so when you're accelerating it's one
seamless<00:01:22.759> transition<00:01:23.759> through<00:01:24.000> gears<00:01:24.420> it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
seamless transition through gears it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.010 
seamless transition through gears it's
actually<00:01:25.289> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.530> smoother<00:01:26.189> Drive<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.570> that's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
actually a lot smoother Drive and that's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
actually a lot smoother Drive and that's
going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.320> compared<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.950> BMW<00:01:29.640> BMW

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
going to be compared to like BMW BMW

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.179 
going to be compared to like BMW BMW
still<00:01:30.539> has<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:30.929> automatic<00:01:31.070> transition<00:01:32.070> for

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
still has the automatic transition for

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
still has the automatic transition for
transmission<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.719> still<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:34.109> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
transmission so you do still have that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.099 
transmission so you do still have that
shift<00:01:34.619> shot<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.609> not<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.090> say<00:01:36.270> BMWs<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:36.990> as

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
shift shot so not to say BMWs not as

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.590 
shift shot so not to say BMWs not as
smooth<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.590> yeah<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.539> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
smooth right yeah but that is one of the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
smooth right yeah but that is one of the
differences<00:01:40.049> between<00:01:40.109> the<00:01:40.560> maxima<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
differences between the maxima and the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.499 
differences between the maxima and the
BMW<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.109> also<00:01:43.649> going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.859> have<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.880> lot<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
BMW this is also going to have a lot of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.130 
BMW this is also going to have a lot of
the<00:01:45.689> luxury<00:01:46.229> feature

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
the luxury feature

access you ever done that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.220 
access you ever done that
oh<00:02:36.239> never<00:02:36.870> yeah<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.950> don't<00:02:38.129> believe<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.269> when

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
oh never yeah I don't believe so when

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.530 
oh never yeah I don't believe so when
you're<00:02:40.349> backing<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.160> back<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.330> when

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
you're backing up the back or the when

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.890 
you're backing up the back or the when
rear<00:02:43.110> view<00:02:43.319> mirror<00:02:43.560> actually<00:02:43.799> tilts<00:02:44.519> down<00:02:44.900> so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
rear view mirror actually tilts down so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.449 
rear view mirror actually tilts down so
you<00:02:45.989> can<00:02:46.140> actually<00:02:46.319> see<00:02:46.709> what's<00:02:46.920> behind<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
you can actually see what's behind you

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.339 
you can actually see what's behind you
on<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.819> ground<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.720> little<00:02:48.930> bit<00:02:49.049> above<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
on the ground and a little bit above the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.940 
on the ground and a little bit above the
ground

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
ground

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.830 
ground
so<00:02:50.400> that's<00:02:50.579> right<00:02:50.819> that's<00:02:51.120> less<00:02:51.420> backup

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
so that's right that's less backup

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.270 
so that's right that's less backup
accidents<00:02:52.440> less<00:02:52.590> money<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.980> have<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.160> spend

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
that curve checks curb checks exactly so

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.190 
that curve checks curb checks exactly so

the<00:03:41.240> appeal<00:03:41.600> of<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.110> maximum<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.950> do<00:03:43.069> have<00:03:43.250> 8

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
the appeal of the maximum you do have 8

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.180 
the appeal of the maximum you do have 8
18<00:03:44.060> inch<00:03:44.240> rims<00:03:44.360> there<00:03:44.780> at<00:03:44.990> steel<00:03:45.319> alloy<00:03:45.709> rims

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
18 inch rims there at steel alloy rims

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.330 
18 inch rims there at steel alloy rims
I'm<00:03:46.700> sure<00:03:47.060> looks<00:03:47.810> are<00:03:47.990> somewhat<00:03:48.950> important

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
I'm sure looks are somewhat important

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.610 
I'm sure looks are somewhat important
UVA<00:03:49.760> alright<00:03:50.180> yeah<00:03:50.510> okay<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:50.990> you<00:03:51.200> have<00:03:51.380> that

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
UVA alright yeah okay so you have that

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.350 
UVA alright yeah okay so you have that
on<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.310> front<00:03:52.520> you're<00:03:52.730> also<00:03:52.880> going<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.209> have

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
on the front you're also going to have

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.960 
on the front you're also going to have
your<00:03:53.420> fog<00:03:53.870> light<00:03:54.110> standard<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.820> don't

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
your fog light standard so you don't

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.430 
your fog light standard so you don't
have<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.240> worry<00:03:56.420> about<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:57.020> helps<00:03:57.290> with

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
have to worry about that that helps with

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.250 
have to worry about that that helps with
vision<00:03:57.830> also<00:03:58.760> in<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.000> event<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.480> you<00:03:59.959> do<00:04:00.110> run

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
vision also in the event that you do run

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.229 
vision also in the event that you do run
into<00:04:00.440> some<00:04:00.590> fog<00:04:00.950> which<00:04:01.160> happens<00:04:01.760> in<00:04:01.880> Atlanta

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
into some fog which happens in Atlanta

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.449 
into some fog which happens in Atlanta
and<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:02.959> can<00:04:03.110> see<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.380> lines<00:04:03.620> on<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:03.980> Maxima

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
and you can see the lines on the Maxima

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.229 
and you can see the lines on the Maxima
are<00:04:04.580> very<00:04:04.760> distinct<00:04:05.510> very<00:04:05.900> distinct<00:04:06.380> lines

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
are very distinct very distinct lines

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.750 
are very distinct very distinct lines
again<00:04:08.239> appeals<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.810> kind<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.230> more<00:04:09.380> stop

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
again appeals to kind of more stop

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.920 
again appeals to kind of more stop
juncture<00:04:10.760> you're<00:04:10.970> looking<00:04:11.480> for<00:04:11.630> that<00:04:11.750> shoe

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
juncture you're looking for that shoe

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.650 
juncture you're looking for that shoe
right<00:04:12.140> I<00:04:12.800> am<00:04:13.430> any<00:04:13.760> questions<00:04:14.209> so<00:04:14.390> far<00:04:14.420> about

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
right I am any questions so far about

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.020 
right I am any questions so far about
anything<00:04:15.200> back<00:04:15.380> here<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:16.370> only<00:04:16.549> question<00:04:16.970> I

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
anything back here the only question I

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.870 
anything back here the only question I
want<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.269> have<00:04:17.450> is<00:04:17.840> as<00:04:18.829> far<00:04:19.130> as<00:04:19.280> gas<00:04:19.489> mileage

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
want to have is as far as gas mileage

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.580 
want to have is as far as gas mileage
because<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.180> noticed<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:20.660> is<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:21.079> little<00:04:21.470> bit

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
because I noticed it is a little bit

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.290 
because I noticed it is a little bit
bigger<00:04:21.799> than<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.220> Altima<00:04:22.669> it's<00:04:22.970> still<00:04:23.150> going

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
bigger than the Altima it's still going

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.720 
bigger than the Altima it's still going
to<00:04:23.360> get<00:04:23.450> good<00:04:23.690> gas<00:04:23.840> mileage<00:04:23.900> okay<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:24.950> will<00:04:25.220> but

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
to get good gas mileage okay it will but

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.820 
to get good gas mileage okay it will but
that<00:04:26.540> compared<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.110> Altima<00:04:27.470> I'm<00:04:27.530> glad<00:04:27.710> you

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
that compared to the Altima I'm glad you

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.650 
that compared to the Altima I'm glad you
brought<00:04:27.980> that<00:04:28.040> up<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.490> does<00:04:28.790> get<00:04:29.060> less<00:04:29.300> fuel

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
brought that up it does get less fuel

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.110 
brought that up it does get less fuel
economy<00:04:29.900> but<00:04:30.590> as<00:04:30.890> far<00:04:31.250> as<00:04:31.280> but<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:32.090> a

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
economy but as far as but it is a

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.480 
economy but as far as but it is a
full-size<00:04:32.480> sedan<00:04:33.110> bigger<00:04:33.890> engine<00:04:34.340> more

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
full-size sedan bigger engine more

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.210 
full-size sedan bigger engine more
horsepower<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.480> it's<00:04:35.600> giving<00:04:35.900> take<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.830> a

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
horsepower so it's giving take so a

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.000 
horsepower so it's giving take so a
little<00:04:37.430> bit<00:04:37.580> different<00:04:38.330> driving<00:04:39.320> experience

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
little bit different driving experience

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.590 
little bit different driving experience
but<00:04:40.100> you<00:04:40.280> still<00:04:40.760> even<00:04:41.270> though<00:04:41.360> it's<00:04:41.510> a

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
but you still even though it's a

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.940 
but you still even though it's a
full-size<00:04:42.020> sedan<00:04:42.440> get<00:04:42.919> up<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.190> 23<00:04:43.490> City<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.950> 31

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
full-size sedan get up to 23 City and 31

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.740 
full-size sedan get up to 23 City and 31
on<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.100> highway<00:04:46.520> as<00:04:46.970> far<00:04:47.210> as<00:04:47.300> miles<00:04:47.510> per

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
on the highway as far as miles per

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.659 
on the highway as far as miles per
gallon<00:04:48.080> now<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.710> course<00:04:48.890> that's<00:04:49.130> relative

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
gallon now of course that's relative

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.170 
gallon now of course that's relative
based<00:04:49.940> on<00:04:50.180> how<00:04:50.450> fast<00:04:50.780> or<00:04:51.110> non<00:04:51.290> fast<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.800> drive

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
based on how fast or non fast you drive

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.550 
based on how fast or non fast you drive
so<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.270> does<00:04:53.419> fluctuate<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.930> little<00:04:54.229> bit<00:04:54.350> but

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
so it does fluctuate a little bit but

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.260 
so it does fluctuate a little bit but
that's<00:04:54.680> still<00:04:54.950> very<00:04:55.280> good<00:04:55.430> fuel<00:04:55.700> economy<00:04:55.880> for

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
that's still very good fuel economy for

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.290 
that's still very good fuel economy for
a<00:04:56.330> full-size<00:04:56.900> sedan

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
a full-size sedan

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.750 
a full-size sedan
so<00:04:58.900> again<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.860> little<00:04:59.980> bit<00:05:00.100> less<00:05:00.310> fuel<00:05:00.580> economy

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
so again a little bit less fuel economy

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.900 
so again a little bit less fuel economy
but<00:05:01.270> you're<00:05:01.930> getting<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.140> faster<00:05:02.560> car<00:05:02.740> bigger<00:05:02.910> a

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
but you're getting a faster car bigger a

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.550 
but you're getting a faster car bigger a
little<00:05:04.330> bit<00:05:04.450> more<00:05:04.600> appealing<00:05:04.840> as<00:05:05.140> far<00:05:05.350> as<00:05:05.470> that

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
little bit more appealing as far as that

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.790 
little bit more appealing as far as that
goes

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
goes

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.220 
goes
okay<00:05:06.580> how<00:05:06.730> about<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:07.030> trunk<00:05:07.270> space<00:05:07.390> trunk

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
okay how about the trunk space trunk

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.320 
okay how about the trunk space trunk
space<00:05:08.350> good<00:05:08.740> question

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.960 

now<00:05:12.840> this<00:05:13.020> being<00:05:13.229> a<00:05:13.349> full-size<00:05:13.889> sedan<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:14.759> is

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
now this being a full-size sedan it is

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.969 
now this being a full-size sedan it is
going<00:05:15.150> to<00:05:15.240> have<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.389> larger<00:05:15.780> truck<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:18.979> compared

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979
