00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 clean natural stone clean sanitize 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.720
 This is our metier 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.519
 In this video I show you how to do it 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.130
 a natural stone terrace perfect 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.380
 can clean and then so 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 It can not be a chance to protect spots 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.279
 more have to penetrate the lining 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.980
 if you do not watch the movie the clock 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.050
 turn back in reality but with 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.769
 we get the stain from our workmanship 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.769
 also gone again 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.240
 We solve your problem within 24 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.070
 hours 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.360
 even if my coworkers 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.850
 actually all are busy 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.350
 he must be the boss himself to the individual 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.059
 I'll explain the steps right now 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.070
 at the same time the first 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.070
 tip at the beginning of summer are the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.989
 Temperatures at the natural stones at the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.970
 surface is very hot that is if we 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.329
 Now apply our cleaning chemistry 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.800
 then it can be very fast 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.870
 evaporates and penetrates the stones 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.270
 That's why it's important to fire the stone 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.869
 So let the chemistry do it 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.390
 can really work with it 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.740
 Cleaning is a must, too 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.040
 pay attention to four things 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.420
 Once the chemistry is, what a 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.520
 We take detergent or in 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.009
 what concentration if you 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.810
 detergent from the hardware store or 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.479
 where else do you get the very cheap 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.060
 are on then you have a cleaner 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.700
 with a low concentration so 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.490
 with a low cleaning performance 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.490
 Here you have to go to the second point 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.680
 the time plays with pure that is ever 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.960
 the longer a chemistry can do that 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.450
 The third point is better for you, too 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.070
 is the temperature when you try in the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.659
 winter to calculate your terrace at zero 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.180
 grad will not work 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.950
 that's too cold and in the summer you have to 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.150
 take care that I am really 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.869
 can work and does not evaporate and 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.790
 evaporates just like me already 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.330
 said and the last one last 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.710
 the point is the mechanics and there we see 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.110
 Clean with a single-disc floor 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.170
 machine and not with a kÃ¤rcher 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.119
 more about that right now 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.700
 our a shampoo machine optional 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.880
 with cleaning pads or 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.440
 provided cleaning brush 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.830
 a natural stone is flamed 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.480
 stopped or renovated so the r take 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.299
 we brush because we get better 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.630
 still in the lining come in here the 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.610
 We also clean the plant quartz terrace 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.040
 with a brush with a white nylon 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.040
 But could also with a brush 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.750
 loop brush work 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.400
 So with a silicon factory sanding 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.370
 Buses are also available in different 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.650
 grains of coarse it is very fine and so 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.239
 you can see the natural stone in hindsight 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.099
 make it a bit finer again 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.689
 we can sign antique works 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.150
 Now look good as the cleaning chemistry 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.620
 with the corresponding impression time and 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.620
 the corresponding mechanics with the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.139
 brush and the temperature works and the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.489
 terrace is cleaned 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.870
 after the terrace is clean again 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.889
 Of course she has to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.370
 to be protected 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.560
 and here we impregnate the natural stone 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.659
 that an impregnation always penetrates into 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.150
 the stone and protects it from inside 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.430
 so no seal or no 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.290
 Growth on top of everything 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.510
 outdoor area in no case too 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.260
 recommend 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.150
 yes apply well and also the surplus 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.069
 then again take away nothing 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.900
 So the surface does not dry up 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.139
 Apply thickly one of the most common 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.150
 mistakes that are made 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:37.150
 They then have the choice their 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.150
 Impregnation neutral in color or color 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.109
 So choose the colors of the 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.780
 Stone is a bit more beautiful 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.419
 come out and you can choose 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.729
 between an impregnation 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.709
 water base and a medium resolution 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:53.109
 base with the impregnation on 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.299
 solvent base deeper in the stone 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.879
 penetrate and thus better 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.229
 protect 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.229
 one takes water-based impregnation 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:05.199
 for sucking natural stones so flamed 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:07.150
 solidly ground and for dense 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:10.359
 natural stones my veins on 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.069
 Solvent base to suck the 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.750
 Underground it can happen that one 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.250
 apply the impregnation more often 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.199
 that really understand really nice 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.169
 is saturated and by that then 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.389
 becomes dirt repellent and here we see 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.110
 Now again the dirty terrace 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:29.080
 which we use with a basic cleaner 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.820
 have cleaned and here the result 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.700
 after cleaning and after 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.120
 impregnate 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.460
 if you have a test of water coffee 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.910
 draufgekommen red wine of the stone 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.540
 is now effortless with a cloth 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.540
 remove again
