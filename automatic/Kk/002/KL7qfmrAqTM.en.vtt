00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
let's do it again which I love of course

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.069 
let's do it again which I love of course
but<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.950> mean<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.700> know<00:03:42.849> when<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:43.599> know<00:03:43.840> you've

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
but I mean you know when you know you've

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.800 
but I mean you know when you know you've
got<00:03:44.409> it<00:03:44.620> but<00:03:45.189> yet<00:03:45.459> she<00:03:45.760> just<00:03:45.790> keeps<00:03:46.329> going<00:03:46.689> and

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
got it but yet she just keeps going and

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.349 
got it but yet she just keeps going and
invents<00:03:47.379> as<00:03:47.590> she<00:03:47.769> goes<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.970> go<00:03:49.150> along

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
invents as she goes so you you go along

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.270 
invents as she goes so you you go along
for<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.629> ride<00:03:49.870> because<00:03:50.140> she<00:03:50.409> keeps<00:03:50.560> inventing

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
for the ride because she keeps inventing

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.520 
for the ride because she keeps inventing
and<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.879> think<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> character<00:03:52.689> she<00:03:52.900> plays<00:03:52.930> is

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
and I think the character she plays is

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.619 
and I think the character she plays is
got<00:03:54.310> up<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:54.609> kind<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.879> got<00:03:55.359> her<00:03:55.450> own

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
got up it's kind of got her own

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.490 
got up it's kind of got her own
quirkiness<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.680> her

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
quirkiness to her

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.850 
quirkiness to her
it's<00:03:59.310> funny<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.760> play<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> singer<00:04:00.860> it's

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
it's funny to play a singer it's

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.340 
it's funny to play a singer it's
interesting<00:04:02.220> because<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.900> know<00:04:04.020> no<00:04:04.200> matter

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
interesting because you know no matter
