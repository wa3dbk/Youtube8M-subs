00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
going or miss means nothing at the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.689 
going or miss means nothing at the
schedule<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.320> know<00:00:25.529> yeah<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.640> it's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
schedule you know yeah I know but it's

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.250 
schedule you know yeah I know but it's
just<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.390> things<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.050> look

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
just one of these things where you look

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.259 
just one of these things where you look
at<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> graphs<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.970> hard<00:00:30.210> not

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
at the graphs and it's it's so hard not

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.700 
at the graphs and it's it's so hard not
to<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.869> an<00:00:30.960> even<00:00:31.170> game<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to think it's an even game but then you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.139 
to think it's an even game but then you
look<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> base<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.250> Navi<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:32.940> not

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
look at the base of Navi and it's not

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.240 
look at the base of Navi and it's not
what<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.450> couldn't<00:00:33.719> know<00:00:33.809> um<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.110> them

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
what you couldn't know um for them

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.350 
what you couldn't know um for them
argenal<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.430> there's<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> gaping

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
argenal that there's a there's a gaping

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.740 
argenal that there's a there's a gaping
hole<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.809> Navi<00:00:37.200> space<00:00:38.480> there<00:00:39.480> should<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
hole in Navi space there should be a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600 
hole in Navi space there should be a
graph<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.469> map<00:00:40.680> control<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.280> something

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
graph for like map control or something

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.680 
graph for like map control or something
I<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.239> pretty<00:00:42.360> cool<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
I think that would be pretty cool to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.229 
I think that would be pretty cool to
have<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.050> well<00:00:43.460> Michelle<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.760> which<00:00:44.940> team<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
have as well Michelle so which team is

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
have as well Michelle so which team is
having<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.690> especially<00:00:46.200> Bragg's<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.680> down

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
having the especially Bragg's go down

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.880 
having the especially Bragg's go down
big<00:00:47.510> bright<00:00:48.510> red<00:00:48.690> flashing<00:00:49.140> lights<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
big bright red flashing lights on the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
big bright red flashing lights on the
Navi<00:00:50.190> side<00:00:50.430> light<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.760> heaven<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
Navi side light of heaven it's going to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
Navi side light of heaven it's going to
go<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> bit<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.530> he<00:00:52.620> picks<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> demon

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
go a bit all in here he picks up a demon

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
go a bit all in here he picks up a demon

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
still to Waddle over there maybe even

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
still to Waddle over there maybe even
tpn<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.140> that's<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> other<00:01:02.010> thing<00:01:02.129> we

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
haven't talked about too much this game

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.210 
haven't talked about too much this game
is<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.019> not<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.229> clink<00:01:04.680> sioux<00:01:04.799> falls<00:01:04.830> off
