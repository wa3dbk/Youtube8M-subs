00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
maybe I should actually change a little

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.399 
maybe I should actually change a little
bit<00:01:39.710> maybe<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> Archer<00:01:42.119> tower<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
bit maybe this a Archer tower with the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.580 
bit maybe this a Archer tower with the
wizard<00:01:43.740> tower<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.110> cover<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
wizard tower so that you can cover the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
wizard tower so that you can cover the
ghost<00:01:46.829> stories<00:01:47.100> over<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> top<00:01:47.700> side<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.030> well

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
ghost stories over the top side as well

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.530 
ghost stories over the top side as well
in<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.290> sense<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.860> should<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.250> able<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
in a sense it should be able to have a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.010 
in a sense it should be able to have a
better<00:01:51.869> coverage<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.390> currently<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.810> see

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
better coverage and currently I can see

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.929 
better coverage and currently I can see
the<00:01:55.140> Wizard<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.920> archer<00:01:56.310> tower<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> little

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the Wizard the archer tower is a little

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.630 
the Wizard the archer tower is a little
bit<00:01:57.030> unbalanced<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.930> should<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> little

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
bit unbalanced so I should do a little

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.749 
bit unbalanced so I should do a little
bit<00:01:59.939> change<00:02:00.360> over<00:02:00.869> here<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:01.979> cover

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
bit change over here so that I can cover

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.330 
bit change over here so that I can cover
a<00:02:02.969> little<00:02:03.180> bit<00:02:03.329> more<00:02:03.649> assists<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.100> two

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
a little bit more assists you have two

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.459 
a little bit more assists you have two
archers<00:02:05.790> over<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.299> maybe<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.630> should<00:02:06.899> take

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
archers over here maybe I should take

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.240 
archers over here maybe I should take
out<00:02:07.680> wow<00:02:07.829> these<00:02:08.099> are<00:02:08.369> arches<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:10.250> replace

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.110 
it with the wizard tower
so<00:02:14.500> whenever<00:02:14.950> there's<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:16.230> cop<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.260> rush<00:02:17.650> I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
so whenever there's a cop in rush I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.850 
so whenever there's a cop in rush I
should<00:02:19.120> be<00:02:19.150> able<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.569> cover<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.170> much<00:02:20.560> better

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
should be able to cover it much better

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.170 
should be able to cover it much better
and<00:02:22.349> looking<00:02:23.349> at<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.709> seems<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.849> little

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and looking at this seems to be a little

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.460 
and looking at this seems to be a little
bit<00:02:26.099> over<00:02:27.239> focus<00:02:28.239> on<00:02:28.420> Canon<00:02:28.720> over<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.230> side

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
bit over focus on Canon over that side

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.300 
bit over focus on Canon over that side
maybe<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.459> choose<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:31.269> change<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:32.019> over<00:02:32.470> do

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
maybe I choose to change this over do

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.030 
maybe I choose to change this over do
replace<00:02:33.760> with<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> canonry<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.379> cannon

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
replace with the canonry so the cannon

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.330 
replace with the canonry so the cannon
will<00:02:36.280> have<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.610> little<00:02:36.940> bit<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:38.069> spread<00:02:39.069> out

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
will have a little bit of spread out

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.670 
will have a little bit of spread out
effect<00:02:39.849> so<00:02:40.090> he<00:02:40.360> got<00:02:40.540> one<00:02:40.720> cannon<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.319> Canon

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
effect so he got one cannon to Canon

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.399 
effect so he got one cannon to Canon
tree<00:02:41.950> cannon<00:02:42.280> for<00:02:43.000> canon<00:02:43.390> falcon<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.260> it's

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
tree cannon for canon falcon and so it's

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.949 
tree cannon for canon falcon and so it's
like<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.560> pentagon<00:02:45.370> kind<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.879> ship<00:02:46.180> which<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.930> a

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
like a pentagon kind of ship which is a

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.750 
like a pentagon kind of ship which is a
much<00:02:47.379> more<00:02:47.670> mmm<00:02:48.670> balance<00:02:49.299> in<00:02:49.599> a<00:02:49.720> way<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.760> what

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
much more mmm balance in a way and what

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.500 
much more mmm balance in a way and what
else<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.150> also<00:02:52.829> what<00:02:53.829> up<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.640> site<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.480> that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
else I also what up this to site so that

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.569 
else I also what up this to site so that
you<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.019> better<00:02:56.379> chance<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.890> stopping<00:02:57.370> the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
you have a better chance of stopping the

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.819 
you have a better chance of stopping the
wall<00:02:57.760> breakers<00:02:58.120> well<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:58.840> see<00:02:59.079> this<00:02:59.200> is<00:02:59.379> how<00:02:59.799> i

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
wall breakers well I see this is how i

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.690 
wall breakers well I see this is how i
change<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.489> strategy<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:02.700> actually

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
change this strategy so that actually

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.670 
change this strategy so that actually
solve<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.480> my<00:03:04.870> viewers<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.349> has<00:03:05.470> already

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
solve of my viewers that has already

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.000 
solve of my viewers that has already
wore<00:03:06.190> up<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.760> area<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:08.829> know<00:03:08.950> to

wore up this to area to you know to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.640 
wore up this to area to you know to
protect<00:03:09.579> against<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.420> wall<00:03:10.629> breakers<00:03:11.019> from

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
protect against the wall breakers from

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.899 
protect against the wall breakers from
attacking<00:03:12.209> inside

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.759
