00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:13.040
 So from the challenge of so 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.099
 what had to do his own himself 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.289
 I think Olympic games more intense 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.050
 So a working because you so that's 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.679
 already preparation without end broadcast 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.699
 without end and somehow with it 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.710
 deals with no end 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.759
 when football is so but that's 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 then again almost a bit 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.910
 relaxed because it is just always 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.800
 just this one sport in between and 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.660
 at the latest after two days one is 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.100
 completely in it and knows everything about all 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.020
 teams or what you have there 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.470
 has to work and can then 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.150
 really just picks up what is coming and 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.340
 try to implement that so far 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.810
 I would say something professionally 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.290
 greater challenge for olympic 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.390
 games 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.579
 beautiful stories are both always me 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.440
 I love you both because you love me 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.000
 art to this and also as a 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.590
 is a bit longer in one place and 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.020
 actually something like that is 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.790
 not only flair but also like that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.189
 our country works and how it works 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.579
 So it's really so short otherwise 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.579
 insights 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.810
 By the way, they have the same time together 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.710
 Year in review made at that time with tom 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.080
 buhrow together 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.460
 for the ard and we have quite round 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 made around the berlin train station 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.260
 also mehdorn as a guest 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.790
 For example , we have that way before 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.470
 get an insight like a train station 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.990
 overall works and straight in 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.970
 big in front of everything 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.510
 otherwise I go in there as possible 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.640
 fast 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.840
 but I can do that already with so 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.150
 Example hamburg dammtor is a very 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.800
 nice station I think so 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.060
 strangely, it also attracts me as 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.410
 first always there if not from 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.480
 drive somewhere in hamburg and then 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.920
 the fast food always quite 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.380
 quickly need something and so and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 of course, I also got 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.320
 and very important when I go to it 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.370
 come home and had bad 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.750
 have some because I once again 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.470
 I can come home late 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.610
 of course, also fast in the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.610
 shoot flower garden over 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.760
 because I believe that you are like in the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.080
 years before that should be allowed 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.090
 will make that look so good 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.140
 prepare and so on the point 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.920
 so they are prepared 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.660
 have a real chance and actually 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.550
 then they would have to if they 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.989
 actually have until then already 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.880
 so if you are in the semifinal final 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.760
 then you have to stand the bag actually 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.870
 It would also be nice to do that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.150
 at any rate, appreciates are because 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.340
 then probably in the semifinals 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.480
 or final opponents have been too strong 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.320
 his good day shape may have 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.239
 always happen 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.620
 but still I think so 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.650
 this team come very very far 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.650
 It will be a real chance
