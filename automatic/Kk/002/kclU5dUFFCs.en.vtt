00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.309
 but I think playing it can build on it 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.420
 of the experience accumulated during the year e 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.130
 half passed in Italy to cantÃ¹ for 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.770
 have an appropriate approach in this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.480
 new experience goes a long way from 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.400
 he has lived until today 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.769
 expectations are quite different 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.230
 the exposure is quite different and then there is 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 this great stimulus represented by 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 a chance to play the Euroleague 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 where for physical characteristics e 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.910
 technical 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.200
 his game absolutely needs 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.670
 to rise but we like the idea of 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.950
 bet on players who should 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.610
 still reach its maximum 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.750
 level of performance and therefore we have 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.770
 the vision that this can become a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.629
 tight turn an important player 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.960
 also for a very high level 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.989
 which milan with qualcomm for mission 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.800
 the last arrival is a player of which 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.380
 we have 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.980
 the need when you are 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.620
 daniel's condition fulfilled 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.620
 hackett and adding a player 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.130
 we were looking for features a 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.140
 its so unique and i think thirty years e 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.670
 embodies itself as a player 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.920
 expert who has the ability to valorize i 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.260
 comrades than next 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.030
 I believe his maturity is his 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.040
 experience will allow him to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.980
 best represent my role 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.170
 has been designed of marching brooks itself 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.080
 already talked a lot in the light of the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.030
 career and the fact that I was n't from 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.900
 frequent of the chosen players to the first one 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.640
 around arrive in Italy or in Europe 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.160
 so early 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.230
 surely he is a player who has 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.360
 already accepted a major challenge 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.780
 that of facing an experience 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.120
 European with the desire to elevate 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.229
 even more your own game 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.460
 possibilities that have already made it 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.560
 protagonist but is now called to a 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.200
 very important examination of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.590
 compete at the highest European levels 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.370
 and then his side we hope to live 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.600
 an important season but as said 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.610
 nobody discusses his qualities 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.210
 techniques on his talent 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.520
 we should be able to make it perform 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.040
 to the needs of the team taken is 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.460
 that direction of experience I believe 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.790
 which I think the team needed 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.770
 also brings that whit of 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.680
 motivation in more dictated by a 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.930
 season certainly disappointing anyway 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 below his expectations and 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.160
 those of basketball fans who 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.680
 they know him with a potential star 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.959
 we would like the idea that this 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.010
 explosion and verify just a 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.930
 Milan 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.640
 shawn james has returned from a season 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.640
 complicated by injuries e 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.820
 the intervention he had to undergo but it 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.010
 we know to be a player who 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.420
 can bring in dowry to this team 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.409
 those qualities of rapidity verticality 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.230
 unpredictability that I have 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.299
 features I believe is mass 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.060
 murdo somewhere they can represent 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.250
 an ideal pair of long ones 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.989
 will allow to have variable assets a 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.230
 depending on the characteristics of ours 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.230
 opponents
