and 1/4 of a cup of all we don't have to
use<00:01:59.490> much<00:01:59.850> because<00:02:00.479> we're<00:02:00.690> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.900> add<00:02:01.080> two

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
use much because we're going to add two

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.800 
use much because we're going to add two
bananas<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.729> will<00:02:02.940> add<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.479> lot<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
bananas and that will add a lot of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.260 
bananas and that will add a lot of
moisture<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> quarter<00:02:06.210> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
moisture to it so that's the quarter of

that little trick we talked about a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.750 
that little trick we talked about a
while<00:02:39.269> ago<00:02:39.769> always<00:02:40.769> break<00:02:41.040> your<00:02:41.069> eggs<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.670> a

cup before adding it to the main

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.090 
cup before adding it to the main
ingredient<00:02:45.000> pot<00:02:45.470> because<00:02:46.470> what<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.890> got<00:02:47.040> a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
ingredient pot because what if you got a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.860 
ingredient pot because what if you got a
bad<00:02:47.340> egg<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.000> you've<00:02:48.090> dumped<00:02:48.360> them<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.600> in

bad egg and you've dumped them all in

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.820 
bad egg and you've dumped them all in
there<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:50.280> ruins<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.819> whole<00:02:50.850> mixture<00:02:51.830> now

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
there it ruins the whole mixture now

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.030 
there it ruins the whole mixture now
like<00:02:53.100> we<00:02:53.280> talked<00:02:53.550> about<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.880> minute<00:02:54.060> ago<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.720> know

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.979 
and they're going to kind of melt in the
cake<00:03:37.829> mix<00:03:37.859> as<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.549> bakes<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.720> would

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
cake mix as it bakes and I would

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.069 
cake mix as it bakes and I would
recommend<00:03:40.260> after<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.480> take<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.660> out<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
recommend after you take this out of the

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.400 
recommend after you take this out of the
oven<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.790> slice<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.030> up<00:03:45.180> for<00:03:45.570> your<00:03:45.750> first<00:03:45.989> meal

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
oven and slice it up for your first meal

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.759 
oven and slice it up for your first meal
that<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.739> would<00:03:47.130> put<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.730> rest<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.769> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
that I would put the rest of it in the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.190 
that I would put the rest of it in the
refrigerator<00:03:50.549> since<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.390> does<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.840> think<00:03:51.900> it

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
refrigerator since it does I think it

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.920 
refrigerator since it does I think it
would<00:03:52.320> keep<00:03:52.530> better<00:03:52.859> if<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.130> kept<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.400> cold

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
would keep better if you kept it cold
