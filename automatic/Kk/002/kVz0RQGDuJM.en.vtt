00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.520
 Believe me it's worth what we're going to do good 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.490
 the first screen 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.200

 the four digits of the pin that can usually be four bonuses 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.520
 or four zeros in my case are four about 2 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.380

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.199
 you get distracted, and in the next screen we hesitate to cancel two 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:19.559
 months 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.099
