 pokémon ranger traces of light that I will make 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 me during the month of July and maybe 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.769
 even in August it is good to start with the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.689
 first first which is the number 51 assignment 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.270
 assignment that will be released only after 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 having made all 50 remaining 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 assignments so let's see what 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.350

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.379

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.809
 dribbling somewhere near the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.399
 dangerous cliff that I remind you of is found 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.710
 east of patrol 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.629
 we will of course accept the commission e 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.559
 so we will go hunting for fiom towels 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.350

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.100

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.339

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.240
 I'll give you this job as well a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.909
 sadly then sadly it begins 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.049
 very well 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:22.350
 let's see where this man will take us 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.420
 and the rangers wanted to tell the rangers 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.409
 here is where you look at them from there 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.689
 june ranger cda but there is some 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 little problem with the language apparently 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.100
 it looks like there are four of them playing 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.520
 we all recover in a more buffon place 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.810
 my sister is more satisfied 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.520
 bitter sister is not brother not 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.500
 will be a bit for the whole family in 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.170
 there are so many backgrounds 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.670
 okay these tense nintendo i will you 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.439
 I wait here to decide to interrupt 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.009
 the job comes to tell me 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.430
 do not leave without saying anything right 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:03.680
 44 we'll take the tree from behind 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.680
 then let's move on 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.149
 here is the first of the three ones then 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.370
 practically there we will have to try to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.620
 to reason not only by making them 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.890
 just run away from with our stink 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.750
 I'm kidding of course they will be 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.000
 frightened by what seems to be the crowd 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.090
 our presence and those will be enough 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.220
 simple to be able to group them not 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.819
 just place how you are seeing i'm not there 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.930

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.080

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.069
 game that nusco type well i guess 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.019
 I can stop pretending to pretend 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.280
 he is also a land recruit for that 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.280
 peta rg air 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.709
 I can't hold back the ranger laughter 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.260
 our plan worked at 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.280
 perfection 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.280
 not bad my acting skills 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.730
 but what do you say you can't even say 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.530
 correctly the word ranger you did 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.250
 a lot of mistakes frankly has me 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.810
 made cold sweat but yes it does 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.670
 we managed to keep the river after 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.410
 all not now we give there is the legs 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.299
 thanks a lot rangers is you feel me 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.250
 think you keep this busy 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.959
 ranger and so that he does not chase us there 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.730
 let's see ranger tail my mom 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.920
 terrifying these pokemon 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.000
 so now we will face them in a 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.650
 duel in a challenge and we will succeed in 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.489
 catch them with our styler from 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.440
 capture 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.870
 I really think of silicon that are born to 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.420
 a very low level then circle 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.900
 after circle we double them and there 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.269
 4 capture nose stopping 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.240
 of course as b must give us 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.650
 minimum s for this capture 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.979
 so I made it two seconds 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:35.330
 oh well let's follow our own 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:37.220
 prisoners air and blue eye to stop it 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.490
 of drayson paper mills with which hands 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.220
 Graffin thou hast hands for the film 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.840
 it's not with things that aren't sharp 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.659
 at this point we have no choice 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.469
 armaldo you come out 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:54.300
 covered it turns out you don't 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:57.900
 believe that they are the same as last year 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.180
 once there for having been conflicts from 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.129
 none of them made you any stronger 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:08.129
 pity armald no mercy swan much 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.289
 well often struggle with on these two 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.479
 just waves bacon yesterday that will be a 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.490
 more difficult to defeat e 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:18.750
 in fact it took us not two but well 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.650
 three seconds then we get one this time 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.550
 vote to capture but we succeed in 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.810
 completely throw them out and then 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.340
 I would say that our bacon yesterday 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.139
 they will have to surrender we have been defeated 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.180
 again at the end we always lower the 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.620
 guard our head blue eye there 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.490
 he always said not to lower the 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.770
 guard 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.710
 it always said I ca n't leave date 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.789
 steering wheel in the hands of guys like you 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.599
 who knows where ours is now 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.039
 head 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.750
 according to what is said around the 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.050
 submarine faced at the bottom of the sea 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.310
 and the team was disbanded 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.719
 enough with the complaints on the right not 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.650
 we'll do nothing but throw ourselves down 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:57.810
 rather we have a big one 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.810
 please ask us, we would like 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.729
 go away from olive trees and go home for 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.409
 we little fish that we don't have the 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.180
 allowed to drive by flying e 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.889
 the only way to get home e 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.629
 rely on the pokémon for help 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.659
 this we would have thought to capture of 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.889
 rope escaping but ended up as heirs well 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.229
 sure they enjoy just one 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.240
 consideration by their lawn managers 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.889
 unbelievable therefore I do the favor 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.949
 explains I 'll let you go home 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.770
 just maximum when you learn good 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.650
 manners think our position a little 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:32.009
 ranger please let us go home 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:37.090
 buffoons thrown back into the ravine but come on 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:41.139
 I am good and therefore they are better 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:44.800
 the reason joyful you want to arrive 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.330

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.840

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:58.169
 start over in a new life thanks of 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.169
 more a great florence than a moving scene 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.169
 tearjerker 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:07.360
 the fact is that we have completed 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:09.879
 the job number 51 and now there is 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:14.379
 there remains one last assignment that I 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:16.569
 I usually define extra because it will be there 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:19.089
 one there will be small guest stars 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:21.330
