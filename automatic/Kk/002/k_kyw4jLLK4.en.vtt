the odds had it like that even though

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.220 
the odds had it like that even though
things<00:04:19.910> played<00:04:20.360> out<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.720> way<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:21.019> everybody

things played out the way that everybody
expected<00:04:21.890> yeah<00:04:22.130> but<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.430> mean<00:04:22.550> that's<00:04:22.760> good

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
expected yeah but I mean that's good

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.000 
expected yeah but I mean that's good
odds<00:04:23.270> making<00:04:23.810> that's<00:04:23.990> good<00:04:24.200> analysis<00:04:24.470> that's

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
odds making that's good analysis that's

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.130 
odds making that's good analysis that's
good<00:04:25.220> predicting<00:04:25.760> everybody<00:04:26.510> saw<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:26.840> that

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
good predicting everybody saw it that

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.370 
good predicting everybody saw it that
way<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.530> we<00:04:28.010> try<00:04:28.520> our<00:04:28.550> best<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.330> go<00:04:29.570> okay<00:04:30.260> we

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
way and we try our best to go okay we

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.450 
way and we try our best to go okay we
could<00:04:30.470> just<00:04:30.650> say<00:04:30.890> what<00:04:31.070> everybody's<00:04:31.430> saying

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
could just say what everybody's saying

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.550 
could just say what everybody's saying
but<00:04:31.790> then<00:04:31.880> why<00:04:32.060> would<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.330> need<00:04:32.660> to<00:04:33.080> look<00:04:33.380> for

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
but then why would you need to look for

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.770 
but then why would you need to look for
our<00:04:33.650> perspective<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.640> try<00:04:35.030> as<00:04:35.300> hard<00:04:35.330> as

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
our perspective so you try as hard as

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.120 
our perspective so you try as hard as
you<00:04:35.900> can<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.260> find<00:04:36.440> something<00:04:36.710> else<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.100> look

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
you can to find something else to look

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.860 
you can to find something else to look
at<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.550> fight<00:04:37.880> as<00:04:38.060> hard<00:04:38.270> as<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.840> possibly

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
at in that fight as hard as you possibly

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.900 
at in that fight as hard as you possibly
can<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:39.920> looked<00:04:40.190> at<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.340> I'm<00:04:40.520> thought<00:04:40.700> what

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
can and I looked at it I'm thought what

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.120 
can and I looked at it I'm thought what
other<00:04:41.120> perspective<00:04:41.810> could<00:04:42.020> we<00:04:42.140> give<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.560> one

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
other perspective could we give and one

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.280 
other perspective could we give and one
of<00:04:43.250> them<00:04:43.340> is<00:04:43.490> well<00:04:43.880> if<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.510> true<00:04:44.780> what

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
of them is well if this is true what

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.040 
of them is well if this is true what
could<00:04:45.710> Faber<00:04:46.220> do<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.790> win<00:04:46.970> this<00:04:47.150> fight<00:04:47.420> what<00:04:47.840> if

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
could Faber do to win this fight what if

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.530 
could Faber do to win this fight what if
he<00:04:48.530> really<00:04:48.860> is<00:04:49.010> out<00:04:49.340> gaand<00:04:49.670> what<00:04:50.180> can<00:04:50.390> this

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
he really is out gaand what can this

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
feeling was he needs to be a higher risk

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.850 
feeling was he needs to be a higher risk
taker<00:04:55.970> but<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.750> watched<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.320> fight<00:04:57.620> and

taker but I watched that fight and
higher<00:04:58.520> risk<00:04:58.820> taker<00:04:59.060> wasn't<00:04:59.540> going<00:04:59.720> to<00:04:59.810> do<00:04:59.960> it

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
higher risk taker wasn't going to do it

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.380
