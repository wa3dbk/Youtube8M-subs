00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.169 

we're<00:02:08.560> trying<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.920> design<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.550> fastest

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
we're trying to design the fastest

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.330 
we're trying to design the fastest

vehicle on human power in the world and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.699 
vehicle on human power in the world and
we<00:02:12.880> do<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.209> with<00:02:13.270> advanced<00:02:14.110> aerodynamic

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
we do this with advanced aerodynamic

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.710 
we do this with advanced aerodynamic

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
design very efficient drivetrain

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.990 
design very efficient drivetrain
low-rolling-resistance<00:02:17.470> tires<00:02:18.000> really

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.760 

just<00:02:53.730> being<00:02:54.030> able<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.360> go<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:54.810> fast<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.470> a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
just being able to go so fast in a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.949 
just being able to go so fast in a
bicycle<00:02:56.220> under<00:02:56.490> your<00:02:56.670> own<00:02:56.760> power<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.330> really

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
bicycle under your own power is really

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.100 
bicycle under your own power is really
unique<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:59.280> fact<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.940> go<00:03:00.540> faster

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
unique the fact that you can go faster

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.480 
unique the fact that you can go faster
than<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.380> car<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.819> fairly<00:03:03.300> amazing
