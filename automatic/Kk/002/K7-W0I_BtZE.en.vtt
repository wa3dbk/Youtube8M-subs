00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.450
 Mariana had difficulty breastfeeding the figueirense sum world made by a 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.340
 I did not have a very specific meeting 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.340
 How long does this title have to be another child? 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.939
 antiglobalization of how nutella the old teacher's advice 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.609
 enable 90 are to lose 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.050
 so that makes it a bit difficult because then I did not have 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.490
 a beak so he could if I win it is believed that she is so 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.539
 Create alert 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 the mother believes that the lack of breast milk caused him to develop 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.320
 lactose intolerance at three months symptoms began to appear and had 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.370
 with the note they were with certain schedules 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.579
 he continues to have as clients a diarrhea 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.330
 it will be very easy from Colombia Farc after seven years to the cities with it 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.390
 that the ministry 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.350
 I was able to develop incentive programs for breastfeeding 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.770
 we work with the municipal and national police 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.510
 throughout the year 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.510
 the farms the capacities involving materials 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.150
 it is training the people who are there at the tip to be able to develop more 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
 that we can increase breastfeeding rates 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.670
 the maternity milk bank 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.680
 only serves about three hundred women 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.150
 the main function is to stimulate this same leg then care - my 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.060
 mother son 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.700
 the woman tries with difficulty increases her own child she can connect 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.720
 and will come milk bank to be attended breastfeeding strengthens the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.020
 system calls for help to prevent other chronic diseases 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.400
 the debate of the event 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.130
 lookouts 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.890
 but without the practice of breastfeeding improves the quality of life 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.880
 Improving Your Baby's Health Reduces Medical Expenses 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.670
 - beds are used and on the money for the work 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.700
 it's not little money 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.270
 because if you will think about how much a hospital bed costs and will fail to be 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.930
 signed and approved 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.930
 of course it would be much better than the price of your father here 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.449
 in technology another for who in fact needs 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:20.099
 he can account for this in many ways wins that for a child she 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.429
 is dormant and who end up being hospitalized is not only the ones that spend 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:29.019
 It's not a question of where we came from, it's not your people here. 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.759
 How cute you have a mother who needs to stay out of her job. 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.339
 to take care of this child 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.439
 you end up compromising the whole community where you 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.839
 This child saw 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.549
 ten years ago, the health institute of são paulo 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.489
 rates of breastfeeding and present state cities 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.140
 in the first year the research showed results the idea of ​​the banking project 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.689
 to make this diagnosis of the situation of 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.299
 both municipal managers can formulate 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.659
 it is in the proposals policies to encourage breastfeeding 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:11.869
 and are monitoring the results of the proposals to be implemented 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.849
 with this project we could hear quantify 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.889
 the importance of these actions 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.719
 we develop a 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:26.340
 a work with the nascent 11 counties that did the research in 99 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:31.419
 this signals years that factors that influence the practice of breastfeeding 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.359
 in these municipalities 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.109
 this support 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.489
 one of the strategies for which mayors perceive the importance of 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.349
 breast-feeding 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.189
 Santos is an example of cities invested in incentive programs and already 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.209
 Gifted devices 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.239
 in the first year of the program one thousand five hundred children under 5 years 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.419
 died from diarrhea and respiratory problems in the Santos basin 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.719
 In the last tabulation of sus, this number fell to one thousand and one hundred children. 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.219
 reduction was 20 9% 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.459
 the g20 also reduced the impetus of the state of São Paulo ten years ago. 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.319
 successor to around thirty-one thousand deaths caused by the same 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.969
 after seven years this number fell 40% 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.180
 We know today that 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.250
 is the kinsella intervention of the mind has more impact on the output 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.580
 different 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.160
 I think hand in hand 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.470
 it is able to reduce by 13% the adults and children under five years 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.809
 it is much more than this to the basic procedure other course 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:35.659
 actions 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.450
 but we analyze 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.689
 that the programs that give results today 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.499
 she also had difficulty marking 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.200
 Rodrigo's son could not get to the front. 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.580
 but she did not give up and sought help 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.849
 received guidance and was able to breastfeed the easy way said in 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.120
 time that he does not want 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.169
 keita - and you see that it is made as he lost a lot of weight then 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.860
 the former almost went unnoticed to the milk one of the finalists of the award in 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.610
 money 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.240
 I was sitting on a chair 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.240
 the marking collaborated for health 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:17.050
 it's an incredible thing alone every time you've been feeling guilty downey 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.659
 if the candidate does not need anything else 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.529
 goal at the time he wakes up at dawn and still feels third he wants him to 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.469
 You're not breastfeeding It's also you giving love to him You make a 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.210
 link even with him 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.999
 so it's a very crazy absence 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:37.409
 and I do not mean you can not even explain a wonderful thing even though 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.060
 I advise everyone there is no explanation. 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:43.559
 compared 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:44.449
 there
