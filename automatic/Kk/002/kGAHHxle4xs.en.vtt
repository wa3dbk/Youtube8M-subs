 remained an empire ruled by a galaxy 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.990

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.660
 lotal that in the outer ring 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.780
 gloomy shadows hanging over the planet not

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.470
 to find out what awaits him at all 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.150
 another fate meeting with a group 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.529
 the rebels who dared 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.090
 resist the empire 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.800
 forever change his life difficult 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.050
 think about officially playing on 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.590
 star wars did not appear on android 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.530
 device 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.629
 and this moment came created by 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.210
 popular TV series star 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.710
 of war she will take you 6 years before 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.289
 yavin battles 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.510
 and at the heart of the storyline are actions 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.000
 a small detachment of rebels bravely 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.309
 tea act which gave impetus to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.199
 the beginning of the uprising you also have to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.750
 join the rebel ranks and take 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.570
 participation in the struggle to save the inhabitants

 latala channel under alive represents 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.290
 star wars lable video game review top 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.570
 I would like to start my story in communication 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.939
 they are me with a philosophical view of the plot 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.460
 this is not specific to this game to 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.500
 star wars universe in general and what 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.930
 then the empire is so black 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.390
 a spot in the galaxy with everything in it as we go 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
 lives badly though we donâ€™t see it 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.799
 heroes include various rebel farmers 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.750
 and smugglers among the rebels themselves 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.670
 heaps of people with rottenness and that's it 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.850
 brave guard are you fighting against 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.220
 empire question astana you better live in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.500
 galaxy if all this rabble gets 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.329
 before the authorities hi the events began 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.710
 twentieth century in the Russian Empire 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.850
 but it is so little lyrical 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.040
 retreat to think back to the game 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.110
 the very same game came out very controversial 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.899
 although it must be confessed very 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.299
 quality creator listed office 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.460
 disney who just couldn't 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.909
 release frank consumer goods for 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.590
 basis taken popular 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.890
 plot among the characters figure 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.140
 popular characters and the game itself is made 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.780
 god in the form of a platformer 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.879
 I waited but not for years any further 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.700
 figli-migli game a bit of success or 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.980
 on the contrary caused a lot of indignation but here 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.620
 who as many would like to see this 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.900
 the game in the form of say mass effect to others 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.360
 lovers of platformer whom I and myself 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.760
 I put in principle everything is fine 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.890
 hotel for the mass effect gameplay was 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.730
 it would seem to me more to the topic but what 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.400
 it came out it came out the first thing you need 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.250
 firmly realize ride this game 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.310
 not quite familiar to us fritupley 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.310
 Well, do not fail to download and play scoring 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.140
 you stupidly need to buy more missions 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.040
 but or download the necessary files in the right 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.200
 the location of which 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.450
 and no one official for a license 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.549
 Of course I regret the type in general 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.359
 the right move tie the donat on 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.730
 content 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:00.459
 it is much better than any gasoline 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.220
 kerosene canisters booster played 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.410
 looked liked ward dear yes 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.690
 and there is something to pay for if you look at 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.000
 the game from the point of view of the platformer then he 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.010
 made on a solid four me 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.109
 for example, there was not enough detailing 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.900
 characters faster gameplay 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.639
 such a feeling especially when shooting that 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.389
 everything happening on the screen is stupid 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.400
 slowed down 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.470
 somehow sluggishly react the character to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.900
 shooting and aiming jumps like 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.540
 on the planet of lunar gravity by the way by 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.209
 about jumping here is simply absurd 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.190
 ridiculous look double jumps of 20 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.440
 meters up like a serious game 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.690
 brings us back to the casual games of the times 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.030
 eight bits but with all this not 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.489
 can neither please the background and the levels yes 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.400
 In general, their implementation is this one on the top five 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.260
 but the sound is slightly annoyed if 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.139
 play in headphones then distinctly 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.400
 rushes to the brain a mono signal and 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.430
 low bitrate of music 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.890
 now on the gameplay your main task 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.260
 go through the whole map in the game by key 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.180
 points to go fly on the boat 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.430
 new flight remains beyond the limits 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.950
 what is happening your fantasy just 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.470
 took and type fly and here you need 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.989
 go through all the key points and fight 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.750
 the main protagonist of the game and who is it 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.299
 guess yourself and everything would be clear if 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.060
 would disney have gone further and besides just 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.400
 platformer they added a role moment 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.139
 here in between the passage 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.789
 key points you have the opportunity 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.880
 build and upgrade your own 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.120
 bungalow in a rebel settlement 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.340
 interact with different 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.770
 characters most of which 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.500
 free yourself to buy new skills 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.570
 take jobs this steering moment 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.580
 dilutes the gameplay of the game allowing you 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.910
 take a break from the little shells and a little 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.930
 to do peaceful deeds 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.090
 so she is a new game about star wars 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.729
 very very contradictory repeat and 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.520
 even ratings in the market echo this or 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.639
 five or average points almost 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.590
 No, someone is yelling shit up bullshit full someone 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.510
 defends the game as something brilliant 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.610
 but how did you react to such 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.130
 implementations I ask you to write in 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.710
 comments on the sim was all with you 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.039
 Kinat see and our other videos on
