at<00:00:41.460> least<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:42.000> idea<00:00:42.329> since<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
at least this was idea since that it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
at least this was idea since that it
didn't<00:00:43.320> succeed<00:00:43.500> much<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> making<00:00:45.059> it

didn't succeed much in it making it

have the perfect example of a stealth
jet<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.149> usefulness<00:00:51.719> they<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.170> 35<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> s

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
jet on usefulness they have 35 of the s

team<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:54.120> jet<00:00:54.390> turns<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:55.079> slow<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.039> it's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
team this jet turns really slow and it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.580 
team this jet turns really slow and it's
not<00:00:56.370> able<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> deal<00:00:57.149> any<00:00:57.449> substantial<00:00:58.230> damage

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
not able to deal any substantial damage

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.750 
not able to deal any substantial damage
with<00:00:58.770> his<00:00:58.980> main<00:00:59.250> weapon

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
with his main weapon

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
with his main weapon
my<00:01:00.090> suggestion<00:01:00.480> avoid<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:02.840> this<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> j-20

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
my suggestion avoid it this is a j-20

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.130 
my suggestion avoid it this is a j-20
the<00:01:05.280> Chinese<00:01:05.670> stealth<00:01:06.060> jet<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.869> mid

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the Chinese stealth jet is a mid

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.350 
the Chinese stealth jet is a mid
grounder<00:01:07.650> pretty<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.580> turning<00:01:08.760> speed

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
grounder pretty good at turning speed

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
grounder pretty good at turning speed
but<00:01:10.080> deals<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.650> same<00:01:10.890> amount<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.369> damage<00:01:11.670> of

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
but deals the same amount of damage of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.830 
but deals the same amount of damage of
the<00:01:12.210> previous<00:01:12.659> f-35<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.340> useful<00:01:15.119> only<00:01:15.479> in

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the previous f-35 so it's useful only in

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
the previous f-35 so it's useful only in
air-to-air<00:01:16.439> situations<00:01:17.159> since<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.939> quick

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
air-to-air situations since it's quick

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.450 
air-to-air situations since it's quick
enough<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.540> stay<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.780> enemy's<00:01:19.290> tail<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.220> even

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
enough to stay on enemy's tail but even

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.249 
enough to stay on enemy's tail but even
so<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.970> will<00:01:21.090> take<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.630> bullets<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.080> take

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so it will take a lot of bullets to take

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.420 
so it will take a lot of bullets to take
the<00:01:22.409> enemy<00:01:22.680> down<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.159> king

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the enemy down and here we have the king

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.050 
the enemy down and here we have the king
of<00:01:26.610> dark<00:01:27.030> fighting<00:01:27.570> battle<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.710> SU<00:01:29.430> 50

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
of dark fighting battle for the SU 50

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.249 
of dark fighting battle for the SU 50
this<00:01:30.360> jet<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.159> insanely<00:01:32.159> fast<00:01:32.880> has<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.750> turning

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this jet is insanely fast has a turning

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.740 
this jet is insanely fast has a turning
speed<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.130> awesome<00:01:35.820> probably<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
speed that is awesome probably the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.840 
speed that is awesome probably the
highest<00:01:37.170> I've<00:01:37.590> ever<00:01:37.829> seen<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> mean<00:01:38.670> it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
highest I've ever seen it I mean it's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.580 
highest I've ever seen it I mean it's
even<00:01:39.240> better<00:01:39.570> than<00:01:39.869> even<00:01:39.960> better<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.350> free

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
even better than even better for free

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.690 
even better than even better for free
and<00:01:41.119> it's<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.630> overpowered<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.159> regards

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and it's so overpowered for what regards

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.050 
and it's so overpowered for what regards
the<00:01:45.000> air<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.570> air<00:01:45.780> supremacy<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.490> don't

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the air to air supremacy that I don't

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.819 
the air to air supremacy that I don't
think<00:01:48.329> Thais<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.990> done<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> great<00:01:49.470> work

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
think Thais have done a great work

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
think Thais have done a great work
balancing<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> literally<00:01:51.180> can't<00:01:51.509> turn

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
balancing it up it literally can't turn

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.920 
balancing it up it literally can't turn
on<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.140> spot<00:01:52.770> without<00:01:53.159> moving<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.090> awesome

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
on the spot without moving it's awesome

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.050 
on the spot without moving it's awesome
only<00:01:55.229> penalize<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.860> by<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> damage<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.909> its

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
only penalize it by the damage of its

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.810 
only penalize it by the damage of its
main<00:01:57.270> guard<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.020> same<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.820> j-20

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
main guard which is the same as a j-20

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.270 
main guard which is the same as a j-20
and<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> f-35

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
and those were the stealth planes now

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.140 
and those were the stealth planes now
switching<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.380> attack<00:02:05.650> Jets<00:02:06.130> we<00:02:06.610> have<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
switching to the attack Jets we have the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.359 
switching to the attack Jets we have the
Russian<00:02:07.600> frog<00:02:07.869> foot<00:02:08.170> which<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.740> really

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
Russian frog foot which is really

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.370 
Russian frog foot which is really
powerful<00:02:09.610> for<00:02:10.060> what<00:02:10.420> regards<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.929> damage<00:02:11.260> of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
powerful for what regards the damage of

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.080 
powerful for what regards the damage of
his<00:02:11.530> main<00:02:11.709> gun<00:02:11.980> but<00:02:12.250> unfortunately<00:02:12.970> it's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
his main gun but unfortunately it's

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.360 
his main gun but unfortunately it's
really<00:02:13.270> slow<00:02:13.630> compared<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.380> for<00:02:14.800> example<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
really slow compared to for example the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.460 
really slow compared to for example the
Thunderbolt<00:02:16.000> which<00:02:16.420> deals<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.870> same<00:02:17.140> amount

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
Thunderbolt which deals the same amount

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.559 
Thunderbolt which deals the same amount
of<00:02:17.620> damage<00:02:17.980> with<00:02:18.190> main<00:02:18.489> gun<00:02:18.760> but<00:02:19.090> at<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.390> same

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
of damage with main gun but at the same

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.970 
of damage with main gun but at the same
time<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.230> useful<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:21.010> dogfights<00:02:22.709> unless<00:02:23.709> we

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
time it's useful in dogfights unless we

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.130 
time it's useful in dogfights unless we
have<00:02:24.190> probably<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> most<00:02:24.760> versatile<00:02:25.569> chatham

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
have probably the most versatile chatham

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.190

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
Chinese attack jet this jet is pretty

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.340 
Chinese attack jet this jet is pretty
good<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.489> probably<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.420> best<00:02:34.660> set<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.140> can

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
good it's probably the best set you can

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.770 
good it's probably the best set you can
fly<00:02:35.620> because<00:02:36.070> has<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.310> really<00:02:36.940> high<00:02:37.120> damage<00:02:37.630> on

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
fly because has a really high damage on

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.990 
fly because has a really high damage on
the<00:02:37.870> main<00:02:38.080> gun<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.800> can<00:02:38.950> take<00:02:39.160> out<00:02:39.370> ground

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
the main gun so you can take out ground

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.820 
the main gun so you can take out ground
vehicles<00:02:40.420> effectively<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.290> at<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.590> same

vehicles effectively and at the same

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.680 
vehicles effectively and at the same
time<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.430> even<00:02:42.550> duck<00:02:42.880> fire<00:02:43.209> because<00:02:43.600> if

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
time you can even duck fire because if

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.870 
time you can even duck fire because if
it's<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.170> high<00:02:44.380> turn<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.190> speed<00:02:45.310> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
it's really high turn of speed the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.550 
it's really high turn of speed the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
scissor approach to the game and I'm not

scissor approach to the game and I'm not
saying<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.980> didn't<00:02:51.310> turn<00:02:51.430> out<00:02:51.640> very<00:02:51.700> well

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
saying that it didn't turn out very well

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.170 
saying that it didn't turn out very well
because<00:02:52.690> we<00:02:53.080> have<00:02:53.500> planes<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.760> f-35

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
because we have planes like the f-35

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.320 
because we have planes like the f-35
that<00:02:56.110> doesn't<00:02:56.860> have<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.430> purpose<00:02:57.880> in<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.150> game

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
that doesn't have a purpose in the game

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.020 
that doesn't have a purpose in the game
they<00:02:58.660> are<00:02:58.690> completely<00:02:59.650> useless<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.000> I

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
they are completely useless and so I

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.110 
they are completely useless and so I
hope<00:03:01.450> they<00:03:01.660> fix<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.350> thing<00:03:02.620> because<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.910> no

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
hope they fix this thing because it's no

which is unuseful at the same time

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.100 
which is unuseful at the same time

having an Opie playing like the su 50 of
the<00:03:11.230> Russians<00:03:11.620> or<00:03:11.890> for<00:03:12.760> example<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.540> q5

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290

phantom<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.160> Chinese<00:03:15.579> because<00:03:15.970> those

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
phantom of a Chinese because those

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.479 
phantom of a Chinese because those
planes<00:03:16.930> can<00:03:17.140> dominate<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.620> map<00:03:17.799> air<00:03:18.100> and

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
planes can dominate the map air and

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.460 
planes can dominate the map air and
ground<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.390> will<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> jet<00:03:20.230> player

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
ground so you will have a jet player

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.830 
ground so you will have a jet player
having<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.250> score<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.549> 20<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.150> 0<00:03:22.180> without

anyone being able to do anything not

anyone being able to do anything not

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
because there are and jet players able

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.340 
because there are and jet players able
to<00:03:27.310> stop<00:03:27.549> them<00:03:27.850> but<00:03:28.299> because<00:03:28.780> they're<00:03:28.989> flying

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
to stop them but because they're flying

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.650 
to stop them but because they're flying
simply<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.920> better<00:03:30.220> jet<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:31.090> that's<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.480> for

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
simply a better jet and that's it for

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.660 
simply a better jet and that's it for
today's<00:03:31.900> video<00:03:32.079> guys<00:03:32.440> I'll<00:03:32.890> come<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.340> next

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.539 
today's video guys I'll come the next
days<00:03:33.850> with<00:03:34.269> some<00:03:34.660> jet<00:03:35.230> tutorials<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.220> guides

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
days with some jet tutorials and guides

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.300 
days with some jet tutorials and guides
to<00:03:37.030> make<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.600> better<00:03:37.989> jet<00:03:38.260> player<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.829> really

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
to make you a better jet player I really

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.310 
to make you a better jet player I really
love<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.760> Jets<00:03:40.030> how<00:03:40.269> they<00:03:40.510> are<00:03:40.720> alright<00:03:41.110> need

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
love the Jets how they are alright need

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.590 
love the Jets how they are alright need
just<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.769> little<00:03:41.829> bit<00:03:42.070> of<00:03:42.220> fixing<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:43.090> little<00:03:43.510> bit

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
just a little bit of fixing a little bit

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.360 
just a little bit of fixing a little bit
of<00:03:43.720> tweaking<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.320> I<00:03:44.530> think<00:03:44.799> we<00:03:44.950> have<00:03:45.130> this

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
of tweaking and I think we have this

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.250 
of tweaking and I think we have this
things<00:03:45.700> with<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> next<00:03:46.329> batch<00:03:46.510> until<00:03:47.140> next

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
things with the next batch until next

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.319 
things with the next batch until next
time<00:03:47.530> guys<00:03:47.859> have<00:03:48.310> fun<00:03:48.579> and<00:03:48.820> see<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.090> on<00:03:49.180> the
