barely touching it makes it slide that's

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:52.450 
barely touching it makes it slide that's
it<00:00:41.300> starting<00:00:49.239> and<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.530> can<00:00:51.859> kind<00:00:52.129> of<00:00:52.219> see

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
if this was the left spin it would

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.770

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
look at that

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.320 
look at that
let's<00:02:16.290> spin<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.800> would<00:02:16.980> just<00:02:17.160> eat<00:02:17.430> eat<00:02:18.000> your

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
let's spin that would just eat eat your

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.800 
let's spin that would just eat eat your
pay<00:02:18.540> blade<00:02:18.810> alive<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:19.950> cool<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.630> just

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
pay blade alive that is cool and I just

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.160 
pay blade alive that is cool and I just
like<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> way<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.319> looks<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:24.020> think<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.110> was

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
like the way it looks it I think it was

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.260 
like the way it looks it I think it was
a<00:02:25.230> good<00:02:25.410> idea<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.890> make<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.160> poison<00:02:26.730> Scorpio

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
a good idea to make it poison Scorpio

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.520 
a good idea to make it poison Scorpio
the<00:02:27.660> color<00:02:28.319> combination<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:30.080> even<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.290> makes

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
the color combination and even it makes

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
the color combination and even it makes
it<00:02:31.680> look<00:02:31.830> even<00:02:32.069> more<00:02:32.459> like<00:02:32.520> little<00:02:33.030> stingers

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it look even more like little stingers

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.300 
it look even more like little stingers
and<00:02:33.569> stuff<00:02:34.160> it's<00:02:35.160> cool<00:02:39.860> not<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.100> go<00:02:41.190> into

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
and stuff it's cool not going to go into

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.979 
and stuff it's cool not going to go into
