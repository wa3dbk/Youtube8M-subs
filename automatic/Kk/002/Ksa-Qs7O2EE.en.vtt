00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 make this color or what do we have to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 do to be able to put this color that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.640
 it's pretty good the truth quite 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.900
 striking for our vehicle what 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.390
 first thing we have to do is repair 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.250
 ok we repair the same vale 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 Well first of all let's start with 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 the painting is worth let's start with the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.920
 paint and we 're going to go to color 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.660
 main and inside there we 're going to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 put in metallic the first thing we're going 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.610
 to do is to put a metallic vale 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.280
 the metalized that we are going to put is going to 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.200
 be the green sea ​​that is going to be the first 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.789
 color that we are going to put to our 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.219
 car inside primary color and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.350
 metallized green more once we have 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.379
 placed the green sea we're going to go to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.969
 nacreous colors are worth pearly and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.059
 in nacreous we are going to put a 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.190
 yellow career voucher yellow career 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.650
 that is his name and that is the color that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.550
 let's put him inside what would be 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.070
 the pearl part 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.280
 and we have it racing yellow 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.960
 we put this yellow well now what 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.310
 what we are going to do is the following for 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.780
 it is a little better what the car 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.670
 let's tune then somehow 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.440
 special is worth before anything 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.200
 put the secondary color the color 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.200
 secondary we will place a red 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.430
 is worth a red metallic vale and then the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.550
 color of the tires also what 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.170
 we will change to a red color is good 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.910
 secondary as you are seeing then you 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.500
 We put the red value, we can put the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.970
 red the red torino we are going to put 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.010
 better the torino red that looks like 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.080
 it is a little more striking no more 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.690
 striking good once we have 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.060
 placed that I'm going to advise a little bit 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.710
 that we have something the car so that 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.600
 of better we are not going to put 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.160
 skirts with the secondary color for 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.440
 give a little more color in the part 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.390
 low on the bottom of the car and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.520
 we are also going to put the spoiler that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.740
 also use the secondary color voucher 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.600
 this spoiler that uses that we are 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.010
 coloring and has the secondary color not 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.440
 so that it is better not to give 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.360
 also more color of secondary color 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.220
 to give it a little bit more tones well 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.899
 once we have done this we are going to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.220
 go to the wheels and let's change the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.270
 wheels so that to leave us 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.710
 Coloring the Alliance 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.970
 so he can let us color the 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.640
 tires because the wheels that come by 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.830
 defect in the car are not colored 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.000
 well once we have chosen in 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.260
 our tires we can put 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.880
 any luxury vehicle tire in 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.010
 the one that we like the most, that goes to our 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.560
 like for once let him have it 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.420
 to place a color we will not place 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.490
 a color on the rims is worth for example 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.230
 the fire red is worth nothing when 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.820
 let's go out with our vehicle because 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.800
 we have this vehicle of this color that 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.570
 it's pretty pretty eye-catching not for 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.430
 have then a few more colors 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.650
 different color combination more 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.060
 more special not for our vehicle if 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.560
