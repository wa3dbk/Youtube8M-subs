idea of how the hair is holding up but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.830 
idea of how the hair is holding up but
so<00:01:37.500> far<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.430> feels<00:01:38.700> great<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
so far so good it feels great like I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
so far so good it feels great like I
said<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> has<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> lot<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.680> movement<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.549> as

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
said it has a lot of movement to it as

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.270 
said it has a lot of movement to it as
you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.689> lot<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.200> balance<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you can see a lot of balance a lot of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.789 
you can see a lot of balance a lot of
body<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.210> think<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
body and I think that has to do with the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.510 
body and I think that has to do with the
