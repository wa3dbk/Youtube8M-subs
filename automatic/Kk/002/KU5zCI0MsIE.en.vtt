with<00:03:09.100> this<00:03:09.190> guitar<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.640> we're<00:03:09.730> going<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.880> find

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
with this guitar and we're going to find

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.180 
with this guitar and we're going to find
out<00:03:10.299> about<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.870> think<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.530> sounds<00:03:11.680> good<00:03:11.980> when

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
out about it I think it sounds good when

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.949 
out about it I think it sounds good when
you<00:03:12.280> don't<00:03:12.459> plug<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.239> one<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
you don't plug it in and one of the

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.210 
you don't plug it in and one of the
problems<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.440> is<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.680> when<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.829> have<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
problems is is that when you have the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.490 
problems is is that when you have the
you<00:03:15.489> know<00:03:15.519> these<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.420> know<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.989> ugly

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500
