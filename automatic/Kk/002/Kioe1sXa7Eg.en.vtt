lunar orbiter photographs now if you
look<00:00:09.300> at<00:00:09.420> one<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.719> four<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.559> will<00:00:10.679> find<00:00:11.010> this

here's<00:01:11.189> another<00:01:11.310> structure<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
here's another structure here on the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160 
here's another structure here on the
right<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> far<00:01:13.560> left<00:01:13.770> side<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.630> zoom

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
right on the far left side you can zoom

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.380 
right on the far left side you can zoom
in<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> mater<00:01:16.950> there's<00:01:17.729> another<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.210> up

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
in on the mater there's another one up

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.440 
in on the mater there's another one up
here<00:01:19.280> notice<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.430> there<00:01:20.640> are<00:01:20.759> bends<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
here notice that there are bends and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.370 
here notice that there are bends and
turns<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.790> craters<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> look<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
turns to the craters if you look at that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100 
turns to the craters if you look at that
you<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.979> bends<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.460> turns<00:01:27.049> on<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
you see the bends and turns on the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.130 
you see the bends and turns on the
craters<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.700> means<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> object<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.750> on

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
craters here that means the object is on

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.050 
craters here that means the object is on
the<00:01:31.380> surface<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> moon<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:32.880> an

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the surface of the moon it is not an

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.480 
the surface of the moon it is not an
anomaly<00:01:34.610> mistake<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> photography<00:01:37.490> now

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
anomaly mistake in the photography now

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.710 
anomaly mistake in the photography now
you're<00:01:38.670> probably<00:01:38.850> wondering<00:01:39.270> where<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> got
