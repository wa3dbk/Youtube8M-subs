 Of course they could buy it 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.109

 and planes at the same time and it's a car like 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.090
 I tell them that it fits any 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.579
 standard parking space 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.190
 uses regular gasoline and can be 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.340
 used in road traffic as 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.989
 any other car like airplane 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.910

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.890
 and mentioned with a few hundred meters of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 long since it has a team of 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.350
 very advanced avionics autopilot 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.930
 of advanced parachute by the way now 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.880
 is already finished and has already been in the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.159
 regular flight test program in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.600
 actual flight conditions from 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.670
 October 2014 that chulada the aero 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.850
