00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.379 
there were a couple things they did that
I<00:00:10.260> thought<00:00:10.440> was<00:00:10.590> really<00:00:10.830> weird<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.370> go<00:00:12.120> back<00:00:12.269> to

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
I thought was really weird so go back to

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.549 
I thought was really weird so go back to
game<00:00:12.540> went<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> little<00:00:12.900> bit<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.200> they<00:00:13.290> banned

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
game went a little bit and they banned

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.829 
game went a little bit and they banned
out<00:00:13.740> Lee<00:00:14.009> sin<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.549> then<00:00:15.210> they<00:00:15.509> go<00:00:15.630> into<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
out Lee sin and then they go into the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.510 
out Lee sin and then they go into the
second<00:00:16.109> game<00:00:16.230> like<00:00:16.500> actually<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.220> want<00:00:17.400> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
second game like actually we want to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.670

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.290 
take away shyvana but leave Leeson up
which<00:00:20.010> meant<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.670> didn't<00:00:20.910> really<00:00:21.090> know<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
which meant they didn't really know it
