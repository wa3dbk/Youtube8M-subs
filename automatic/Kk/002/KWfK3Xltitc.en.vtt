00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
able to happen but at the same time is

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.910 
able to happen but at the same time is
like<00:01:45.920> but<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.189> break<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:48.140> we're<00:01:49.140> both<00:01:49.320> dead

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
like but if we break up we're both dead

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.810 
like but if we break up we're both dead
anyway<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.170> what<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.700> an

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
anyway so what can you do it's like an

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.130 
anyway so what can you do it's like an
impossible<00:01:54.119> situation<00:01:56.689> which<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.840> yeah<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
impossible situation which is yeah I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
impossible situation which is yeah I
think<00:01:58.560> hasn't<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.159> been<00:01:59.250> done<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.640> such<00:01:59.820> an

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
think hasn't really been done to such an

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.770 
think hasn't really been done to such an
extreme<00:02:00.360> extent<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.130> quite<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> while<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
extreme extent and quite a while so it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719 
extreme extent and quite a while so it
was<00:02:03.990> quite<00:02:04.140> interesting<00:02:04.290> about<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.799> yeah<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
was quite interesting about it yeah and

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.240 
was quite interesting about it yeah and
also<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.360> kind<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.200> difficult<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.799> believe<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
also is kind of difficult to believe it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.940 
also is kind of difficult to believe it
when<00:02:08.399> he's<00:02:08.550> seen

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
when he's seen

make<00:03:13.930> him<00:03:15.870> especially<00:03:16.870> in<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.079> scenes<00:03:17.320> with

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
make him especially in the scenes with

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.870 
make him especially in the scenes with
Bella<00:03:17.829> like<00:03:18.280> have<00:03:18.880> some<00:03:19.180> elements<00:03:19.840> of

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
Bella like have some elements of

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.740 
Bella like have some elements of
unpredictability<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:25.180> be<00:03:25.359> actually

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
unpredictability and and to be actually

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.990 
unpredictability and and to be actually
genuinely<00:03:26.290> frightening<00:03:26.730> sometimes<00:03:27.730> because

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
genuinely frightening sometimes because

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.400 
genuinely frightening sometimes because

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
chance he has much less control over

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.900 
chance he has much less control over
himself<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.750> he<00:03:56.260> could<00:03:56.440> like<00:03:57.130> bury<00:03:57.519> what<00:03:57.790> he's

are<00:05:11.330> vampires<00:05:11.750> or<00:05:11.930> predators<00:05:12.349> at<00:05:12.500> all<00:05:12.650> you

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
are vampires or predators at all you

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.749 
are vampires or predators at all you
just<00:05:13.220> think<00:05:13.520> they're<00:05:13.669> just<00:05:13.759> weird<00:05:13.970> kids<00:05:15.759> and
