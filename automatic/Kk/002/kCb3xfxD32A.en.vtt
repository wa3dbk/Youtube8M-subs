00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
number three I'm going to show you how

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.940 
number three I'm going to show you how
to<00:03:46.240> do<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.810> exact<00:03:47.200> same<00:03:47.320> thing<00:03:47.740> without

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
to do the exact same thing without

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.850 
to do the exact same thing without
having<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.730> incorporate<00:03:49.060> sections<00:03:50.020> instead

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
having to incorporate sections instead

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.920 
having to incorporate sections instead
of<00:03:51.100> leaving<00:03:51.340> out<00:03:51.640> sections<00:03:52.209> from<00:03:52.420> your<00:03:52.660> braid

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
of leaving out sections from your braid

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.449 
of leaving out sections from your braid
you<00:03:52.959> just<00:03:53.170> do<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.590> regular<00:03:53.890> braid

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
you just do a regular braid

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.490 
you just do a regular braid
pinch<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.390> little<00:03:55.750> bit<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.020> give<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.320> volume

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
pinch it a little bit to give it volume

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.920 
pinch it a little bit to give it volume
and<00:03:56.980> next<00:03:57.700> thing<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:57.880> want<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.239> do<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.660> your

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
and next thing you want to do is your

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.720 
and next thing you want to do is your
braid<00:03:59.230> either<00:03:59.560> if<00:03:59.890> you're<00:04:00.040> doing<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.520> rope

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
braid either if you're doing the rope

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.690 
braid either if you're doing the rope
braid<00:04:01.000> or<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.540> three<00:04:01.810> strand<00:04:02.140> braid<00:04:02.410> but<00:04:03.340> in

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
braid or the three strand braid but in

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.790 
braid or the three strand braid but in
this<00:04:04.000> case<00:04:04.330> your<00:04:04.870> braid<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.320> going<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.680> be

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
this case your braid is going to be

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.280 
this case your braid is going to be
detached<00:04:06.220> from<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.090> bigger<00:04:07.540> one<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:07.900> it's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
detached from the bigger one so it's

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.260 
detached from the bigger one so it's
easier<00:04:08.680> for<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.280> achieve<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.910> don't<00:04:10.090> need

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
easier for you to achieve you don't need

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.060 
easier for you to achieve you don't need
to<00:04:10.450> incorporate<00:04:10.780> sections<00:04:11.500> or<00:04:11.680> whatsoever

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
to incorporate sections or whatsoever

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.310 
to incorporate sections or whatsoever
you<00:04:12.880> just<00:04:13.120> need<00:04:13.300> to<00:04:13.450> braid<00:04:13.630> your<00:04:13.810> hair<00:04:13.840> as<00:04:14.290> you
