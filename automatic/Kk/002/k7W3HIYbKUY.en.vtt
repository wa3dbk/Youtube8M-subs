00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
plexiglass tubes is installed directly
in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> support<00:01:00.989> structure<00:01:01.640> there's<00:01:02.640> been

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
in the support structure there's been

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.759 
in the support structure there's been
quite<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> lot<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.899> different<00:01:04.409> kinds<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
quite a lot of different kinds of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640 
quite a lot of different kinds of
challenges<00:01:05.090> I<00:01:06.090> come<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.170> design

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
challenges I come from the design

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.500 
challenges I come from the design
background<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.850> been<00:01:08.909> important

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
background so for me it's been important

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.050 
background so for me it's been important
to<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:10.380> keep<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> aesthetics<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
to to keep the aesthetics and the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.990 
to to keep the aesthetics and the
experience<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.650> fact<00:01:14.070> even<00:01:14.430> though<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.880> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
experience in fact even though there is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.840 
experience in fact even though there is
structural<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.409> engineering<00:01:17.159> issues<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
structural and engineering issues and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.330 
structural and engineering issues and
because<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:18.750> been<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.100> it's<00:01:20.100> been<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
because that's been a it's been a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
because that's been a it's been a
challenge<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.570> space<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.560> want<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
challenge like with the space we want to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.789 
challenge like with the space we want to
have<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> evenly<00:01:23.729> spaced<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.509> grid<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> not

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
have a evenly spaced out grid and not

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.340 
have a evenly spaced out grid and not
too<00:01:26.070> much<00:01:26.250> spacing<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.939> between<00:01:26.970> all<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
too much spacing in between all of the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.390 
too much spacing in between all of the
pipes<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.979> there's<00:01:30.229> there's<00:01:31.229> quite<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.040> clever

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
pipes so there's there's quite a clever

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.640 
pipes so there's there's quite a clever
solution<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.210> how<00:01:33.360> all<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.930> servos<00:01:34.409> were

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
solution to how all of the servos were

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.880 
solution to how all of the servos were
placed<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> diagonal<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.200> between<00:01:37.650> all

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
placed like at a diagonal in between all

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.520 
placed like at a diagonal in between all
of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.159> pipes<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.900> cabling<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
of the pipes and the cabling and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.260 
of the pipes and the cabling and
everything<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.040> done<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> manner<00:01:41.670> that's

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
everything is done in a manner that's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.749 
everything is done in a manner that's
just<00:01:43.140> perfectly<00:01:44.009> fitted<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.549> this

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the Plexiglas tubes I think the main

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.460 
the Plexiglas tubes I think the main
challenge<00:02:35.310> there<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.690> getting<00:02:37.290> all

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
challenge there is that is getting all

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.160 
challenge there is that is getting all
the<00:02:37.620> data<00:02:37.800> out<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.430> servos<00:02:39.090> fast<00:02:39.780> enough

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the data out to the servos fast enough

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.290 
the data out to the servos fast enough
and<00:02:40.470> that's<00:02:40.620> where<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.430> backup<00:02:41.610> system<00:02:42.180> is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
and that's where the backup system is

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.199 
and that's where the backup system is
really<00:02:42.930> great<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:44.010> also<00:02:44.190> been<00:02:44.459> really

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
really great and it's also been really

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.850 
really great and it's also been really
great<00:02:45.390> for<00:02:45.420> me<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> software<00:02:46.230> developer

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
great for me as a software developer

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.949 
great for me as a software developer
actually<00:02:47.520> getting<00:02:47.760> into<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.150> new<00:02:48.330> system<00:02:48.810> I

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
actually getting into the new system I

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.960 
actually getting into the new system I
haven't<00:02:49.260> worked<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:49.530> before<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.850> was

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
haven't worked with before but it was

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.790 
haven't worked with before but it was
really<00:02:51.269> easy<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.810> get<00:02:51.989> into<00:02:52.410> because<00:02:52.560> it's

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
really easy to get into because it's

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.090 
really easy to get into because it's
integrated<00:02:53.489> into<00:02:53.730> visual<00:02:54.060> studio<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.530> work

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
still hasn't done unless we want it to

still hasn't done unless we want it to
the<00:03:27.750> pipes<00:03:28.050> will<00:03:28.459> come<00:03:29.690> softly<00:03:30.690> in<00:03:30.750> contact

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
with you and then retracts so this is

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.020 
with you and then retracts so this is
basically<00:03:34.200> because<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.400> twin<00:03:35.640> cat3

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
basically because of the twin cat3

basically because of the twin cat3
technology<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.860> has<00:03:38.010> basically

technology and that has basically

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.600
