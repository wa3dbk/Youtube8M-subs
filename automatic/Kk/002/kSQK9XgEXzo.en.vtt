00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.160
 we'll need chicken this time 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.160
 I'm occupying wings I'm occupying 3 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.520
 and only what I did was split them in 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.720
 3 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.290
 we will also need two tomatoes 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.990
 matches a garlic clove consommÃ© 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.760
 chicken a cube this is optional as it goes 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.780
 to also take the pieces of the chicken 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.120
 but if it gives another flavor 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.120
 a little oil and pasta from your 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 preference on this occasion I'm going to 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.150
 occupy this of conchitas 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.330
 but you can occupy what you 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.500
 prefer in the blender we are going to 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.500
 add the tomatoes 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250
 what 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.700
 and the clove of garlic 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.150
 Later we will also add 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:08.470
 a little water 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.470
 and we 're going to liquefy it 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.450
 well once the smoothies are going to 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.310
 reserve for the moment well in a pot 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.520
 or pan let's add some 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.520
 oil 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.100
 and let's wait for it to be hot 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.560
 well once the oil heats up 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.790
 what we are going to do is add the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 troops to the pasta 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.220
 We will extend and wait for it to start 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.220
 to brown 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.030
 As you can see, it begins to change color 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.549
 you have to be moving so you do not 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.549
 it comes but it asks us for a color 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.580
 well once we have already browned it 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.920
 golden that we want we are going to 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.640
 Add the tomatoes we will go through 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.640
 a colander 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.240
 later they added 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.240
 l 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.950
 do not believe 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.690
 we will add more water 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.129
 because we are going to add the pieces of 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.129
 support for 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.239
 why 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.980
 and finally we will add the game of nor 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.040
 Switzerland and we will wait for it to start 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.900
 boil down from the fire and wait 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.269
 to cook completely 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.939
 well once it begins to boil 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.220
 what we are going to do is take out the fire to 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:17.200
 that cooks completely and we do not know 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.200
 our shadow is without broth 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.920
 and let's wait like this until the 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.920
 perfectly cooked pasta and chicken 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.330
 well before it is completely 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.340
 our pasta that is already cooked by 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.890
 complete and the chicken what we're going to do 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.080
 is to rectify the taste since only 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.470
 add a cube of chicken broth 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.300
 this time he needs salt like that 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.300
 that we are going to add a very little 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.140
 and we're going to wait until it's over 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.900
 cook completely but you have to 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.850
 rectify the flavor to boil and 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.850
 get a good taste 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.010
 well once the soup is already cooked 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.769
 completely and chicken too as 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.290
 will be ready to serve I hope that 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.519
 this recipe is useful to you as it is 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.599
 very easy to do and then we will serve 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.579
 Well, that's how we have left 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.320
