00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 I'm glad the beauty is talking 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.900
 Juan, how are you? Welcome. 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.269
 a more video and this video here more 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.269
 an episode of our series knowing the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.699
 characters and is the last episode of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 game comes to the end of colossi like me 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.720
 I told you I'm going to continue this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.680
 series with other characters and without 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.869
 wrapping 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:33.690
 let's go to the video sleeps is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.510
 entity that resides in the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.270
 forbidden lands to communicate with 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.180
 o under that opening the sanctuary 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.940
 of worship and during battles against 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.210
 the colossi where he helped under with 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 tips if he is having 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.949
 difficulty sleeps is voiced by kazuhiro 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.649
 in the letter is that the cuca and cami beauty 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.219
 before the game's events not 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.979
 we have nothing concrete from who or what 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.650
 sleep she speculates that she sleeps 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.799
 a god for these lands and he would be 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.110
 two entities in one even because it 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.850
 speaks with two tones of voice and one male 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.070
 it's a girl 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.770
 I have no idea why. 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.200
 But I do not think 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 relevance and someone has some idea and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.939
 any theory please 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.299
 writes there in the comments and is from 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.909
 Moreover, we have two principles, one 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.820
 already existed together with a 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.020
 civilization and other than just 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.180
 It ruled these lands with the people 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.430
 starting from the idea that the colossi already 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.159
 existed the sleeping would be like a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.770
 colossus only much more developed 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.869
 where even he could talk 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.540
 was very intelligent and had a 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.450
 supernatural strength he had skill 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.530
 and to bring souls back to bodies 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.290
 of dead people 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.960
 so he was considered a 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.540
 God with that sleep has become with the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.340
 time being a dark and always wanting 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.500
 more and more power 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.360
 he caused the colossi to become 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.120
 slaves and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.300
 launched the whole population and seeing this 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.820
 would put a whole shaman out of a village nearby 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.280
 of these forbidden lands where we do not know 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.910
 whether they were emo north or some ancestor 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.530
 he arrived and banished sleep within the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.600
 dividing colostrums and 16 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.570
 annihilating all his power and called himself 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.850
 emptied the whole city and that for many 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.640
 years it remained so totally 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.700
 empty until a boy called under 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.420
 arrived and that's where the story really begins. 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.060
 of the game 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.220
 a theory of mine is about why he 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.770
 still able to communicate 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.640
 even after it has been banned is the 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.280
 Following 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.489
 For me, he can only communicate with 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.709
 the people who have the sword that banished 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.560
 it is the case of the under of some 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.450
 it's still connected 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.700
 spiritually or not with this sword and 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.250
 that's why he owns it 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.440
 Can you hear him think of something of mine? 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.300
 I do not know if you agree if you 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.860
 has another theory of why he still 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.600
 Can communicate 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.720
 tell us in the comments and from the other 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.750
 principle did not exist. 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.290
 same thing without the colossi and the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.560
 The shaman who banished sleeps had to 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.640
 from the idols that were 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.340
 in the sanctuary 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.160
 this is most likely because 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.190
 a game says that colossi are 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.280
 incarnations of titles but like you 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.910
 already know we have much controversy in this 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.950
 story 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.500
 and I will not go into detail here and 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.019
 if you want to know more about this 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.299
 I have also made a 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.480
 video about it and it's in the description 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.160
 of this video here 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.100
 ok sleep now 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.320
 after all he was completely wrong in 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.750
 my opinion is not like any god 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.989
 mythological he had his share of 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.750
 goodness also up because it warns 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.079
 under that he would pay a high price for 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.620
 revive the monkey and even being banned in 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.900
 Finally, again he ended up reviving her. 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.060
 but then we also have that 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.940
 right thing was it even love 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.340
 woke up and not the female part of sleep 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.320
 so we have some more controversy there 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.620
 in my opinion it was not there 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.600
 completely wrong and a really cool thing 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.580
 this image there 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.150
 This is what you see. 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.550
 beta version of sleep and the interesting is 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.940
 that it seems that he sleeps as a 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.580
 colossus in which we face type 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.710
 a final boss because you are seeing 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.800
 down there the warriors of the north and 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.740
 brown and the andrÃ© there in front or be the 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.110
 sleep not incarnated in the under then 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.740
 So we can say that sleeping was a 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.580
 colossus discarded maybe that's me 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.680
 I do not know 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.190
 can be so tell in the comments the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.410
 What do you think about it? 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.840
 so summarizing sleeps was a god for 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.360
 those lands on which it has become 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.050
 more obscure until he rebelled 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.930
 against the people and or the colossians a shaman 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.780
 arrived and banished him inside the colossi 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.870
 or he created the colossi from the 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.280
 for these colossi to protect without 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.830
 your essence 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.070
 many years have passed and the 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.970
 under arrives in these forbidden lands ecad 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.789
 all in all, right? 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:48.240
 the rest you already know and about the relationship 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.400
 between sleeps in hod the tower of babel I 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.710
 I also made a video about it and 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.289
 I did not have to repeat here either. 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.449
 the older video, you can have 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.150
 a notion and who has an interest too 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.520
 is in the description of this video here 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.490
 in the hope that you have 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.099
 liked in the video and if it was the last one 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.440
 video of the shadow of the colossus 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.570
 calm in the last video about the show 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.909
 channel of the series because the 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.949
 characters are over and as I already said 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.860
 I'm going to continue this series with the 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.789
 other characters from the world of 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.680
 games 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.169
 I already have a character scaled to 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.810
 the next episode and after him I go 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.190
 see if I do a sort of draw in the 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.680
 face or something 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.120
 for you to have the opinion of 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.060
 What character am I going to talk to? 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.190
 but finally tell us in the comments that you 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.689
 found on the video and also on that 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.909
 content 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.199
 I got up on it so lets olic 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.779
 favorite 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.329
 without registering in the channel you enter beauty 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:49.459
 follow me on twitter like the page on 

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:54.399
 face and I'll be back with the next video 

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:54.399
 beauty to the camera
