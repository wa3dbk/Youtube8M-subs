00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.040
 hey people welcome to the part 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.840
 2 of our series my angel year that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.970
 last time were on the edersee on the way 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.369
 I hope we did that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.810
 could catch some nice fish 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.340
 We have done a lot with dropshot 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.750
 have the two cops and caught 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 and now you just mixed times 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.730
 briefly show how i build the montage 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.770
 a knot that I use he gives 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.750
 There are many different possibilities 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.530
 but I'll show you how I do 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.530
 do the whole thing 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.620
 for my dropshot 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.840
 I need a dropshot hook 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.140
 I always pay attention that the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.850
 Hook bow is pretty big then piece 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.620
 flow carbon before fold I have here 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.150
 already knotted and a top shot 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.879
 Meat likes to use the narrow ones 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.740
 because in my opinion that hangers 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.580
 risk is lower I take now here 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.300
 my profession before 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.520
 if I have already indicated that 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.869
 funny that I right from the front 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 hook by noble so that it 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.540
 the hagen is already straight 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.740
 now i'm going about halfway or 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.860
 into the top third 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.290
 that fits then I take that now 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.649
 the back end put a loop drum and 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.869
 simply wrap the hook several times 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.869
 around both fast 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.290
 move the whole thing to 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.869
 now come two knots from both 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.369
 sides of the hook is in one 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.219
 optimal 90 degree angle and can 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.659
 optimal grip 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:07.679
 After that, I'll end up doing yours 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.679
 simple knot purely 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.340
 here my dropshot lead up and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.350
 I can do that now in the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.020
 deep where I would like to lay down 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:33.880
 here a clamp then I have always 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.880
 the appropriate depth for fishing 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.520
 Unfortunately nothing worked here anymore 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.260
 dropshot i go here again 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.850
 a few places further 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.710
 Attendee I wish you 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.840
 Everyone enjoy the water until the 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.930
 next part of our series does it 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.930
 Well
