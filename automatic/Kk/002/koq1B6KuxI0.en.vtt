00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.050
 today's topic is very special because it is 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.820
 halloween then we have a 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.680
 very cool inspiration that to me 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.390
 love are the zombies for that 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.640
 invited the laura quintero that 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.740
 love that you are here today laura today 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.630
 I am very happy to be with 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.420
 all of you thank you very much for 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.290
 invite us details 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.210
 tell us a little about which crist was good 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.670
 in this makeup what we are going to see is 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.260
 Like half doll that I like 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.860
 very much also here and what we did 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.510
 was the other half of zombies that he would 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.270
 I really like Vicente 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.280
 we wanted that like a month the whites 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.950
 then also today in the workshop 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.500
 we will make a special design for zombies 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 and then laura escort all 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.730
 well welcome as I told you before 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.950
 today's design is inspired by the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 zombies so I will use a green that is a 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.780
 color as if it were already dead 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.940
 our skin does not paint it in all 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.190
 nails because I will make different designs in 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.800
 each one of them then we start is 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.260
 very simple in general so let's go 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.240
 very fast for the first one I will make a 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.790
 open wound has returned to the middle 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.500
 with a fuchsia I do this in this way 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.260
 I can make thicker or thinner 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.630
 after this I delineate it with black and 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.759
 some seams pass over this 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.490
 way to make it look like it 's a 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.920
 wound that was healing but then 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.690
 He could not heal for the next 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 design what you are going to do is the brain 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.399
 then my texture is like it stirred the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.450
 brush from one side to the other so that 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.220
 look like that brain effect 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.970
 this color background can happen 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.180
 different for my next nail I will make a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.909
 nail found dead unbroken full 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.149
 of earth and therefore dark 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:02:00.280
 we make this bad half frame and as some 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.260
 lines that are cracked and very dry 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.200
 for the next nail what I will do is 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.590
 like I'll vote a little blood on 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.179
 she then I do it in this way waved 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.860
 the brush also to make it look like 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.680
 is a little blood falling on me 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.000
 and finally on the thumb I chose to do 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.240
 a very big eye jumping zombie 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.710
 then it is on the white background as 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.800
 I always tell them is what I'm using 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.560
 that glaze I chose for the pupil or for 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.660
 the blue iris but you put it to be 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.910
 of the color they want coffee or greens 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.230
 now I'm making the veins sprouted 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.150
 and deep zombie eye now with 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.310
 black we make a circle that bases 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.250
 our pupil so with white we will do 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.260
 a little glint to the eye I hope you have 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.990

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.700

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.040
