rotation<00:02:18.950> basically<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:19.980> think<00:02:20.430> at<00:02:20.550> this

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
rotation basically I think at this

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.590 
rotation basically I think at this
potations<00:02:21.090> called<00:02:22.010> 393<00:02:23.010> rotation<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:24.360> it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
down like a constant creation to that

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.030
