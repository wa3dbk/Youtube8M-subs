00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
much different to that however I think
he's<00:01:34.799> got<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.130> low<00:01:35.460> free-kick<00:01:35.820> stats<00:01:36.360> as

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
he's got really low free-kick stats as

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.749 
he's got really low free-kick stats as
far<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.869> I'm<00:01:36.990> aware<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.409> pretty<00:01:38.369> sure<00:01:38.490> they'll

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
far as I'm aware I'm pretty sure they'll

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.660 
far as I'm aware I'm pretty sure they'll
drag<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> down<00:01:39.689> his<00:01:40.049> finishing<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.770> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
drag that down his finishing is is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.580 
drag that down his finishing is is
higher<00:01:42.000> i'm<00:01:42.240> pretty<00:01:42.479> sure<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.840> after

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
higher i'm pretty sure on that after

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.740 
higher i'm pretty sure on that after
getting<00:01:43.619> exact<00:01:44.040> stat<00:01:44.310> actually<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.630> look

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
getting exact stat actually or just look

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080
