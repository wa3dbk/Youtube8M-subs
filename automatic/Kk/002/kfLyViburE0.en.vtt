00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:09.920
 Hello everyone welcome to my garage 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:13.190
 it's a mess not possible but me 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.380
 I find myself in this video I'm going 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.619
 introduce you to my new forge 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:25.220
 so here's so good it was the noise 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.760
 it's the fan it's normal that it was 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.260
 so the rest of what I had two 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.320
 words from my torch 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.579
 so he allowed me to spin 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.840
 the first forget I had made and 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:42.020
 who was not powerful enough oms incited 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.540
 the first she has just served 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.790
 made four knives but in the end 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.320
 it was not powerful enough so we 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:55.190
 forget the new forge 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.710
 so it's just stones 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.940
 refractory with angles 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.210
 steel and threaded rods so these 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.340
 assembled these assemblies for those who 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.259
 are on the group so some of the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.070
 amateur cutlers on facebook have it 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.170
 already seen so it's simple 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.310
 this is a replacement brick for the case 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.299
 where it's really all that is that 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.549
 bricks that are held together 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.920
 they are not yet glued gilles 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.329
 cement there I do not know what I'm waiting for 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.729
 to definitely paste them again 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.659
 some tests to verify that what 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:40.149
 is saying here he is correct and then I 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.530
 would look like that so for for 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.530
 to avoid this kind of thing by 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.579
 example 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.060
 so here and the little forge we could 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.479
 see in 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.069
 there is nothing for now we're going 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.899
 take out the lighter arm cut the ventillo 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.899
 to light it will be easier 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:24.160
 it's gone to louvres you that of the few 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:26.879
 too much too much too much but it's not 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.879
 possible this thing 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:46.680
 that's to prevent me from burning 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:55.790
 fingers just open his kippah 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.790
 roller hockey is gone 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.469
 and it's going very quickly thought rough but 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.469
 it's going very fast 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.260
 but I 'm not crazy 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
 Oh 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.490
 years 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.849
 after a few seconds 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.199
 it's already warm 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.199
 and it goes up again 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.610
 the bottle the return to chaos 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.280
 and since it's hot, there's the ventillo 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.729
 the ip is very hot 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.770
 we see love 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.070
 we 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:25.789
 and here we are, we can see 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.740
 really hot and I think it 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.279
 will be enough so for for the 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.289
 knives little purchase of the day I do not know 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:35.979
 what it's worth at all I got that 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.979
 at brico deposit 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:46.020
 I know more and bigger I think that 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:49.530

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.320

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.990
 will not do I can not finishes with 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.620
