his go home for this build again Huck
has<00:00:13.500> been<00:00:13.740> pulling<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.639> belt<00:00:14.910> off<00:00:15.120> against

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
has been pulling this belt off against

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.630 
has been pulling this belt off against
cold<00:00:15.900> I've<00:00:16.170> seen<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:16.770> over<00:00:16.800> read<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> I

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
cold I've seen it all over read it and I

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.400 
cold I've seen it all over read it and I
wanted<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> watch<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.720> Nate<00:00:18.900> I've<00:00:19.080> been<00:00:19.230> so

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
wanted to watch it but Nate I've been so

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.019 
wanted to watch it but Nate I've been so
busy<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.830> haven't<00:00:19.980> even<00:00:20.189> been<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:20.520> home<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
busy I haven't even been at home so I

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.359 
busy I haven't even been at home so I
couldn't<00:00:21.359> watch<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.660> yet<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> idea<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
couldn't watch it yet but the idea is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.060 
couldn't watch it yet but the idea is
that<00:00:23.519> either<00:00:24.359> Taryn<00:00:24.840> loses<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> lot<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.650> income

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that either Taryn loses a lot of income

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
that either Taryn loses a lot of income
and<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> will<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.699> pylons<00:00:27.240> probably<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.810> up

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and it will be pylons probably going up

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.169 
and it will be pylons probably going up
as<00:00:28.050> well<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> corner<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.070> village<00:00:29.369> base<00:00:29.580> or

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
as well in a corner of a village base or

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.120 
as well in a corner of a village base or
he<00:00:30.480> ignores<00:00:30.929> his<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.410> he<00:00:31.500> ignores<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
he ignores his but if he ignores this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
he ignores his but if he ignores this
there's<00:00:32.700> probably<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.210> mother<00:00:33.600> ship<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.290> on

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
there's probably a mother ship or out on

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.020 
there's probably a mother ship or out on
the<00:00:34.590> map<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.800> could<00:00:35.100> potentially<00:00:35.760> cast

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the map that could potentially cast

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.880 
the map that could potentially cast
photon<00:00:36.450> overcharge<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.140> how<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.770> going

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
photon overcharge and how are you going

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.530 
photon overcharge and how are you going
to<00:00:37.950> kill<00:00:38.160> Nexus<00:00:38.640> my<00:00:38.850> eyes<00:00:39.030> don't<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to kill Nexus my eyes don't want to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.319 
to kill Nexus my eyes don't want to
believe<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.110> Kevin<00:00:40.680> huh<00:00:41.040> hey<00:00:41.760> I'm

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
schoolgirl this is yeah the Nexus will

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.529 
schoolgirl this is yeah the Nexus will
complete<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> donkey<00:00:50.850> cancels<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
complete but a donkey cancels it at the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
complete but a donkey cancels it at the
very<00:00:51.870> last<00:00:52.140> second<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.590> mothership<00:00:52.920> core<00:00:53.129> was

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
very last second the mothership core was

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.889 
very last second the mothership core was
pretty<00:00:53.579> close<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.660> still<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
pretty close but you know it's still a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.200 
pretty close but you know it's still a
four<00:00:55.230> gateway<00:00:55.590> follow-up<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.190> ve'lo<00:00:56.640> has<00:00:56.879> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
four gateway follow-up a ve'lo has I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
four gateway follow-up a ve'lo has I
mean<00:00:57.510> I'd<00:00:57.780> say<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> pieces<00:00:58.500> necessary<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
mean I'd say all the pieces necessary to

mean I'd say all the pieces necessary to
defend<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.730> four<00:00:59.940> gate<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> bunker<00:01:01.079> at

defend a four gate you have a bunker at

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.779 
defend a four gate you have a bunker at
the<00:01:01.350> front<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.739> ramp<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> you've<00:01:02.520> got<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the front of your ramp and you've got a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.950 
the front of your ramp and you've got a
good<00:01:03.000> number<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.300> Marines<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.719> he's<00:01:03.809> moving

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
good number of Marines but he's moving

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.570 
good number of Marines but he's moving
out<00:01:04.110> onto<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> map<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> here's<00:01:05.400> the

important thing for a ve'lo that
engineering<00:01:07.409> Bay<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.710> still<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.280> me

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
engineering Bay is still there which me

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.270 
engineering Bay is still there which me
what<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:09.630> he's<00:01:09.750> pulling<00:01:10.049> his<00:01:10.170> SC<00:01:10.470> DS<00:01:10.680> does<00:01:11.040> uh

what what he's pulling his SC DS does uh

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.539 
what what he's pulling his SC DS does uh
yeah<00:01:12.060> oh<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.840> god<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.439> no<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
yeah oh my god what no this is like the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.980 
yeah oh my god what no this is like the
absolute<00:01:14.700> worst<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:15.840> could

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
absolute worst thing that they could

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840 
absolute worst thing that they could
ever<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.560> against<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> four<00:01:17.220> gate<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.640> Huck

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
ever do against the four gate and Huck

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
ever do against the four gate and Huck
is<00:01:17.970> probably<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> sculpt<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.560> he

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
is probably if you go to sculpt what he

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.550 
is probably if you go to sculpt what he
sees<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.700> SUV<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> he<00:01:21.869> sees<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> marine

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
sees one SUV and he sees the marine

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.050 
sees one SUV and he sees the marine
where<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.890> probe<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.369> gonna<00:01:23.610> head<00:01:23.729> into<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
where this probe is gonna head into the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
where this probe is gonna head into the
main<00:01:24.210> base<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.869> they'll<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.460> marine

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
main base will they'll be a marine

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.710 
main base will they'll be a marine
sniping<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> nope

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
sniping it nope

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.340 
sniping it nope
so<00:01:28.080> right<00:01:28.350> now<00:01:28.560> Hawk<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.509> oh<00:01:30.780> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
so right now Hawk is going to see oh you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.350 
so right now Hawk is going to see oh you
don't<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> whole<00:01:32.189> lot<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.400> us<00:01:32.579> V's<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.950 
crazy but this is going to be a very
very<00:01:38.009> short<00:01:38.340> game<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:39.210> should<00:01:39.240> enjoy<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.750> as

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
very short game we should enjoy it as

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.359 
very short game we should enjoy it as
long<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.320> allows<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
long as it allows because all that the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.770 
long as it allows because all that the
hawk<00:01:41.490> has<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.909> right<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.570> drop

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
hawk has to do right now is just drop

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
hawk has to do right now is just drop
one<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.110> two<00:01:43.200> force<00:01:43.470> fields<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:43.979> he'll<00:01:44.310> be

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
one or two force fields and he'll be

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.460 
one or two force fields and he'll be
more<00:01:44.729> than<00:01:45.030> fine<00:01:45.420> first<00:01:45.780> force<00:01:46.020> field<00:01:46.229> lands

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
more than fine first force field lands

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.560 
more than fine first force field lands
at<00:01:46.740> Villa<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.119> work

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
at Villa this is not going to work

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.710 
at Villa this is not going to work
I<00:01:48.600> mean<00:01:49.110> he<00:01:49.610> defended<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:50.970> well<00:01:51.149> at<00:01:51.329> first

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I mean he defended really well at first

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.800 
I mean he defended really well at first
but<00:01:52.110> he<00:01:53.100> knows<00:01:53.369> his<00:01:53.579> opponent<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.509> base

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
but he knows his opponent is on one base

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.530 
but he knows his opponent is on one base
he's<00:01:55.200> he<00:01:55.619> built<00:01:55.860> extra<00:01:56.310> gates<00:01:56.549> now<00:01:57.090> he's<00:01:57.329> going

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
he's he built extra gates now he's going

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.740 
he's he built extra gates now he's going
back<00:01:57.659> home<00:01:58.110> i<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:59.610> don't<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.240> how<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> feel

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
back home i I don't know how I feel

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.120 
back home i I don't know how I feel
about<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.409> wanted<00:02:01.680> we'll<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:01.920> bored

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
about what I just wanted we'll be bored

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.679 
about what I just wanted we'll be bored
I've<00:02:02.250> seen<00:02:02.549> Kevin<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.390> mean<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> think

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
I've seen Kevin this is I mean I think

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.300 
I've seen Kevin this is I mean I think
in<00:02:03.930> retrospect<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.799> say<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.189> was<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
in retrospect we can say that it was a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.300 
in retrospect we can say that it was a
bad<00:02:05.520> idea<00:02:05.810> try<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> expand<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.069> Marine

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
bad idea try to expand but this Marine

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.930 
bad idea try to expand but this Marine
it's<00:02:10.240> going<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:11.010> fall<00:02:12.010> as<00:02:12.220> well<00:02:12.400> scouting<00:02:12.850> this

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
it's going to fall as well scouting this

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.490 
it's going to fall as well scouting this
fight<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.360> he<00:02:13.690> doesn't<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:14.020> bunker<00:02:14.319> thought

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
fight and he doesn't have bunker thought

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.930 
fight and he doesn't have bunker thought
mr.<00:02:14.650> Elson<00:02:15.010> normally<00:02:15.340> he<00:02:15.430> should<00:02:15.610> be<00:02:15.760> more

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
mr. Elson normally he should be more

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.750 
mr. Elson normally he should be more
