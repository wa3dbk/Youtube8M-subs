the<00:01:26.159> first<00:01:26.430> part<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:26.939> playing<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.270> melody

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
the first part I was playing a melody

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.149 
the first part I was playing a melody
and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.080> was<00:01:31.229> pretending<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.800> I<00:01:31.890> was<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and then I was pretending that I was the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.770 
and then I was pretending that I was the
guitar<00:01:32.490> player<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.630> playing<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> chords

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
then I joined them play that melody

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
then I joined them play that melody
again<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> that's<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.710> technique<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.550> I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
again so that's one technique that I

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.969 
again so that's one technique that I
like<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.570> use<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.170> playing<00:02:01.410> solo

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
trying to be creative and figure out how

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.460 
trying to be creative and figure out how
you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.850> go<00:02:08.970> back<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.390> forth<00:02:09.600> between<00:02:10.110> the
