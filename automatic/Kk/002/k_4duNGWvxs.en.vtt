00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.050
 garages ok not so good to do that 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.990
 glitch we will occupy the arrival of a friend 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.730
 bicycles and then street cars that 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.800
 which we want to put in our 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.780
 garage not and so good to start 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.489
 this clip we simply bring to our 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.980
 garage that we will do 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.750
 glitch and we will go by any bicycle 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.210
 or that I recommend you do so 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.760
 one by one in a goddess that in this 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.980
 case the first and here simply the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.719
 we take out as I told them and here comes the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.239
 help from our friend in which he is 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.070
 minimum we will ask him to get on 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.199
 the bicycle and it will stay in the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.750
 bicycle is not going to go down at all ok 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.210
 and after this we will go for the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.070
 street vehicle that by which 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.140
 we want to put in our garage for 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.420
 that they are more space in my garage or that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.340
 be 13 in this case was I grabbed 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.560
 any of the street and we go to the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.150
 just saints and after this we 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.320
 we will go here in anticipation of 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.730
 lost and reds and we're going to put the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.950
 locator ok simply the 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.170
 secure locator not simply the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.940
 locator and with psoe it's enough if 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.310
 you if you want to put insurance 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.690
 well, it depends on you, ok and so 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.030
 good and we just let 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.530
 directly to our garage to our 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.410
 friend will have been made invisible 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.030
 vision that is something important after 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.920
 a here we just cancel we do not go 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.350
 to replace for nothing or that here so what 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.630
 we leave and well then now we go to 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.940
 place of bicycles and we take that 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.890
 same bicycle as friends and we will give ourselves 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.979
 with the great surprise that instead of 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.330
 a bicycle is a truck ok and then 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.850
 this will work with any vehicle 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.280
 friends who can get into our 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.680
 garage ok you can turn it as 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.830
