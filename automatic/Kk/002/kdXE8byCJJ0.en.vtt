00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.350
 First to thank everyone and all 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.910
 what are you here second tell you for 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.700
 that we do not get fumes to those who 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.259
 we are here that we are not doing 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.960
 nothing extraordinary companions and 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.210
 mates we are fulfilling 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.970
 our duty 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.560
 understanding of the works councils is not 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.839
 tell workers when they have 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.970
 a problem that this is what there is 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.919
 comrades what they have to do is 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.919
 fight and if they do not fight that excesses 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.530
 I'm seeing them are saying that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.930
 they wanted a referendum the two big 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.190
 confederations for the issue of 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.190
 raids how many times we and others 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.840
 many of you start here we have had 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.220
 to sign an ere on telephone do 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.080
 a referendum to the staff that does not 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.170
 we agree that a company 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.870
 like this one sends the house to the people to 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.650
 home with eating is when you have thousands of 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.720
 millions of benefits and what we know 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.220
 is what we usually work for 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.190
 who want to replace us with the pre 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.600
 quality unions are not for 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.150
 collaborate with companies to 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.950
 Fixed transform precarious employment by 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 Please becomes a union without command that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.830
 and so 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.780
 that history will judge us 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.980
 because today's workers do not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.830
 we are at the height of 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.200
 circumstances we give ourselves to the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.940
 young people what you deserve I have a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.090
 job that you do not conquer me 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.970
 I gave it to my previous ones and I 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.820
 I had the duty, I have delivered you 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.600
 new others in the best conditions 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.600
 Because you need 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.610
 humility 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.230
 tranquility we are not doing anything 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.329
 extraordinary by ariosa mates 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.069
 you have to demand of each other in each company 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.760
 in every place that council 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.730
 be that or throw or limit and we choose to 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.239
 another because those do not represent and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.280
 tell you what it is I have a huge pain 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.620
 so we are delivering them 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.629
 attached and I have responsibility in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.609
 this because I did not do what I had to 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.459
 do to stop your feet on time and 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.500
 we are still on time and you want the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.050
 torch that we have to catch and the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.410
 crisis 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.450
 they are using them but if we read 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.900
 our classics tell us one thing 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.360
 is in an economic crisis when 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.569
 we can fix the system let's go for 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.569
 it
