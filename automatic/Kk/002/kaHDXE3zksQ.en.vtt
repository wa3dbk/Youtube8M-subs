really<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:01.979> he's<00:02:02.130> making<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.549> up<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.939> I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
really think he's making it up now I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
really think he's making it up now I
think<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.960> could<00:02:04.140> make<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> case<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.009> hey

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
think you could make a case that hey

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.130 
think you could make a case that hey
maybe<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.850> experience<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.020> it's

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
maybe that's this experience but it's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.779 
maybe that's this experience but it's
not<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> experience<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> all<00:02:08.069> all<00:02:08.310> blacks<00:02:08.580> in

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
not the experience of all all blacks in

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.979 
not the experience of all all blacks in

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
or by a long shot right but I think he

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.720 
or by a long shot right but I think he
genuinely<00:02:17.230> experienced<00:02:18.069> those<00:02:18.250> things<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.640> I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
genuinely experienced those things and I

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.180 
genuinely experienced those things and I
think<00:02:18.879> it's<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.140> serious<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.319> genuine<00:02:20.709> problem

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
think it's a serious and genuine problem

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.070 
think it's a serious and genuine problem
and<00:02:21.459> instead<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.000> dismissing<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.750> they<00:02:22.900> should

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and instead of dismissing it they should

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.690 
and instead of dismissing it they should
address<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.409> right<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:24.129> they<00:02:24.220> are<00:02:24.250> addressing

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
address it right and they are addressing

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.979 
address it right and they are addressing
it<00:02:24.940> they're<00:02:25.120> fit<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:25.510> know<00:02:25.629> they're<00:02:25.780> facing

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
it they're fit you know they're facing

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.780 
it they're fit you know they're facing
the<00:02:26.170> federal<00:02:26.560> lawsuit<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.519> know<00:02:27.640> we'll

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the federal lawsuit and you know we'll

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.160 
the federal lawsuit and you know we'll
see<00:02:27.940> what<00:02:28.090> happens<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.599> what<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> outcome

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
see what happens and what the outcome

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.420 
see what happens and what the outcome
will<00:02:29.290> be<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:29.860> think<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.310> an

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
will be of that but I think it is an

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.280 
will be of that but I think it is an
important<00:02:30.819> thing<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.090> investigate<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.900> again

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
important thing to investigate and again

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.210 
important thing to investigate and again
it's<00:02:32.530> another<00:02:32.680> one<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.280> those<00:02:33.430> issues<00:02:33.790> where

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
it's another one of those issues where

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.559 
it's another one of those issues where
the<00:02:36.220> population<00:02:36.819> in<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> United<00:02:37.150> States

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
the population in the United States

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.820 
the population in the United States
thinks<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.959> we<00:02:38.080> don't<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> race<00:02:38.709> problem

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
thinks that we don't have a race problem

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.670 
thinks that we don't have a race problem
at<00:02:39.280> all<00:02:39.310> when<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:39.940> do<00:02:40.120> we<00:02:40.510> do<00:02:40.660> have<00:02:40.870> situations

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
at all when we do we do have situations

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.710 
at all when we do we do have situations
where<00:02:42.280> racism<00:02:42.730> does<00:02:43.030> occur<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.480> those

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
where racism does occur and those

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.420 
where racism does occur and those
situations<00:02:44.319> need<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.590> be<00:02:44.680> investigated<00:02:45.340> and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
situations need to be investigated and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.640 
situations need to be investigated and
not<00:02:45.549> brushed<00:02:45.879> off<00:02:46.090> as<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:46.540> racism<00:02:47.379> is<00:02:47.500> not<00:02:47.590> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
not brushed off as if racism is not a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.199 
not brushed off as if racism is not a

and<00:02:49.390> let<00:02:49.599> me<00:02:49.690> explain<00:02:49.930> as<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.530> why<00:02:50.890> there<00:02:51.129> might

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
and let me explain as to why there might

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.190 
and let me explain as to why there might
be<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:51.609> inherent<00:02:52.540> conflict<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.079> first

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
right but firefighters went through it

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.689 
right but firefighters went through it
just<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.049> much<00:04:11.169> like<00:04:11.440> firefighters<00:04:12.099> did<00:04:12.370> so

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699

that's just not you doubly screwed ya
know<00:04:15.040> once<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.400> think<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:16.030> fire

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
know once I think that the fire

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.509 
know once I think that the fire
department<00:04:16.630> itself<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.019> India<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.709> it<00:04:17.859> has

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
department itself the India of it has

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.210 
department itself the India of it has
done<00:04:18.760> anything<00:04:18.970> wrong<00:04:19.299> ya<00:04:19.870> know<00:04:20.769> it's<00:04:20.949> true<00:04:21.190> I

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
done anything wrong ya know it's true I

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.279 
done anything wrong ya know it's true I
bet<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.729> becomes<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.300> bit<00:04:22.690> of<00:04:22.719> a<00:04:22.870> factor

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
bet that that becomes a bit of a factor

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.020 
bet that that becomes a bit of a factor
right<00:04:23.320> but<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.130> know<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.370> drives<00:04:24.520> me<00:04:24.789> crazy

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
right but you know it drives me crazy

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.180 
right but you know it drives me crazy
when<00:04:25.180> people<00:04:25.300> can't<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:26.469> separate
