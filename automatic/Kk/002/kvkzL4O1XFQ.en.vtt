00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.440
 Hello 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.810
 early May, just such a cold yet 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.150
 spring and now we have a story about 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.259
 the very first things that are necessary 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:31.500
 do with grapes here many I still 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:34.830
 dreamed that grape is winter 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.860
 shelter there and lies on the ground there 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.040
 we with you emissions exemplary garden y 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.220
 we donâ€™t 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 caught in the garden but I already pre 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.239
 talk from the hosts in the world they are not 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 explained that they had already done that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.559
 need to make grapes look in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.729
 first as well as I will plant this 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:03.659
 trellis single-row landing and this one 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:06.210
 trellis it is located to the south that is 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.750
 this one is the whole plane 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.930
 sub 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.299
 it is very very important for growing 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.689
 grape is the middle lane 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.119
 that is, we must do our best 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.950
 so that our awards receive 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.860
 maximum is the sun and contribute 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.620
 vine ripening and ripening in 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.470
 further harvest so here it is 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.710
 direction in your garden if you 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.680
 only planted grapes 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.680
 be sure to choose it was 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.380
 here is the location to the south if you 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.810
 right now there is no such place and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.640
 you want Ahaia now I will plant later 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.060
 somehow there transplant so on 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 don't necessarily do that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.780
 free this place something 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.420
 transplant il to another place but precisely 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.360
 choose such a site where your 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.640
 the grapes will be illuminated to the maximum 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.710
 the sun and nothing obscures it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.129
 look here near there is no 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.289
 buildings and no trees 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:12.409
 This is the first second look how 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.730
 ground here 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.430
 we carry grapes here 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.650
 and humus and rotted manure that is 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.610
 it was done naturally in the summer 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.920
 Last year 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.220
 and this is my hour guarded and this 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.560
 here 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.270
 shelter it helps to 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.550
 the root system wintered well and 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.730
 finally i want to see exactly now 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.750
 note dry and garter vines 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.090
 this is the so-called procedure which 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.200
 need to hold in the spring it is dry and 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.280
 garter 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.910
 here here was done already pruning 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.330
 this grape that is after winter and 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:04.570
 driest some tips were looking for 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:09.130
 explored although you can already see what 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.770
 here are the living buds here here they are please 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.690
 already starting to wake up here 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:19.660
 clearly seen so big bud 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.590
 dry garter she just now need for 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.450
 there is no leaf yet 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.320
 shoots on this vine 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.530
 she was well tied up and distributed 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.709
 see here shoots with distance each from 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.650
 a friend so that they also do not shade themselves 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.739
 yourself and they are on the same plane like this 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:47.140
 distributed again south if you 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.540
 make this suspension shoots that 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.760
 You go from these kidneys here we are with you 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.350
 let's look here 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.440
 look here already what's good 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.350
 sprouts went on grapes ie this 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.440
 point is very easy to miss here is 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.019
 day 2 will have a nice warm weather 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.720
 and this grape is very very fast 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.390
 will begin to grow so here you need this dry 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.090
 garter must make a look 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.359
 tied all the rags no mini 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.940
 narrow twine them so that the grapes we have with 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.060
 you are not pinned when he is in summer 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.320
 grow and thicken yet what I want 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.340
 show you here look how low 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.370
 grapes are cut 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.919
 we have so many gardeners wrong 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.280
 make it worth it leaves very big 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.100
 vines believe that there is here in front of these eyes and 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.260
 will ripen greater yield she 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.020
 The average dress is absolutely perfect. 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.600
 not necessary because the whole crop which 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.419
 can lay a vine bush he just 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.360
 simply will not draw heat to him 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.120
 warm enough for the amount of active temperatures 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:04.660
 and now these are very good now 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:07.080
 visible main vines they are the main sleeves 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.840
 the so-called and not see how 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.090
 sent to the side low to the ground so that 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.930
 in the winter, again, it was all convenient 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.720
 bend down such a formation Vladimir 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.360
 nikolaevich I'm doing the very beginning as 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.190
 only a young plant is planted i.e. 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.830
 he tilts this little vine 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.650
 and it gradually grows like this 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.340
 look here how it was done 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.830
 autumn crop here these otplodonosivshie 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.710
 the vines were all removed only 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.350
 here are the small sleeves on which 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.340
 fruit twigs are laid and here 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:51.460
 look already bunches grow from 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.330
 the grounds here of this vine that is here 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.849
 will be 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:06:00.760
 and the replacement of fruit-bearing shoots and here 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.190
 on these here on these shoots will 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.400
 we are obliged to ripen in summer 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.430
 visit this garden again and see 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.440
 what crop ripens what good 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.000
 tassels weld on this grape 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.000
 come to us garden world
