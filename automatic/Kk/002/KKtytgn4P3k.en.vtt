00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.299
 hello to all happy to receive you 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.830
 on this beautiful and big place d'arras 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.370
 we chose to dedicate this 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.320
 magazine 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.599
 a subject rather connected the vehicle 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.250
 electric a clean mode of transportation 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.170
 certainly but that feeds a lot 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.340
 of interrogations then to try to 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.060
 shed light on the vehicle 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.410
 electric 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.029
 we simply submitted it to 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.029
 a battery of tests and comparisons 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.800
 for more and more crosses on our 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.080
 roads electric vehicles 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.820
 are experiencing a real boom in the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.380
 north no calais this market benefits 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.170
 constant application of the council 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.090
 despite this favorable context 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.390
 many drivers still remain 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.920
 reluctant to this mode of transport 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.080
 the trend is very real the vehicle 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 electric is not unanimous far 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.410
 from there several obstacles stand out 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720
 in the minds of drivers like 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.280
 as many psychological barriers 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.650
 autonomy for example only is this 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
 really a problem everyday is 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.880
 true the autonomy of the vehicles 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.050
 electrical power and from 130 to 400 km which 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.060
 may seem limited 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.660
 yet in our country the average of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.810
 daily journeys of 34 km and 87% of 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.400
 our journey does not exceed 60 km finally 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.810
 the electric vehicle is suitable for 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.810
 most everyday uses 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.850
 it is even an alternative 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.990
 interesting in a professional environment 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.240
 since for some companies 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
 the journeys never exceed 100 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.350
 more daily kilometers the region 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 north no calais grant help 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.950
 financial support to tradespeople for 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.990
 the purchase of an electric vehicle 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.640
 so we can use the vehicle 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.679
 electric every day without having 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.940
 laurentiis of the breakdown however the 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.890
 haunting the recharge 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.840
 and yes that says electrical necessarily says 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.700
 equipment connection one franc 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.929
 additional to the transition to this type of 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.929
 vehicle can be understood 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.470
 a simple electrical outlet on the place 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.540
 working a simple electrical outlet 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.310
 at home it does not take more for 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.259
 charge an electric vehicle 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:17.300
 it's not more complicated than 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:19.130
 charge a smartphone in our 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.020
 local authorities and private actors 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.330
 develops a network of 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:30.590
 accelerated charging to make it easier 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:32.150
 still the daily life of drivers of 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.670
 obviously the electric vehicle 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.440
 can adapt to our daily life is a 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.970
 Priori not our wallet 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.920
 the cost of the purchase creaks 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.400
 teeth of many of the drivers that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.400
 is it really 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.880
 today the manufacture of a vehicle 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.890
 electric represents an additional cost 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.930
 apparent however once the bonus 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.670
 Ecological deducts the proposed rates 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.450
 are equivalent to those of vehicles 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.340
 thermal 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.170
 finally they benefit from offers in 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.670
 long term rental even more 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.030
 competitive than thermal vehicles 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.030
 conventional 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.970
 surprising buying a vehicle 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.099
 electric is not more expensive 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.550
 that the purchase of a classic vehicle and to 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.930
 use 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.849
 how much does it cost to drive to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.030
 the electric she engulfs as 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.830
 many drivers say 1.5 to 2 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.840
 euros is the cost of a journey of 100 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.760
 kilometers in electric vehicles either 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.190
 five to eight times cheaper than for a 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.459
 classic vehicle no consumption to 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.459
 stop the 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.330
 at the maintenance the electric vehicle is 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.820
 also much more advantageous 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.460
 simpler design helps reduce 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.570
 the garage bill of 30 to 40% by 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.570
 compared to a classic vehicle 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.900
 Yes 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.439
 the cities of the north not calais 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 will even offer an hour and a half 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.510
 free parking for vehicles 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.159
 ecological 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.599
 a daily bonus that benefits 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.439
 obviously to the drivers of vehicles 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.439
 electrical 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.150
 there is no doubt 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.579
 driving on the electric is cheaper 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.259
 and frankly what changes and what 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.459
 driving comfort comparatively a 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.180
 classic vehicle 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.100
 it's a pleasure 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.990
 the electric vehicle offers every 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.389
 driver the opportunity to participate in the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.220
 energy and ecological transition of 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.900
 also enjoy performance outside the 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.900
 common without any noise pollution 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.530
 its use is perfectly adapted to 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.000
 our daily reloading ultra 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.800
 simple its cost to purchase 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.599
 in the end identical to the vehicles 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.039
 Conventional consumption and 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.900
 much more advantageous maintenance in 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.389
 however it is ecological and its 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.030
 very pleasant conduct a council 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.050
 buy the the electric vehicle is 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.449
 more of science fiction 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.189
 he exists and does not wait for you anymore 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.189
