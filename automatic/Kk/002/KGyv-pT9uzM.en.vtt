the jumping aspect of the Grand National
as<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.659> work<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.439> recent<00:01:40.860> times<00:01:41.040> personally

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
as I work was in recent times personally

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.020 
as I work was in recent times personally
so<00:01:41.790> those<00:01:42.600> at<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> top<00:01:43.140> long<00:01:44.130> run<00:01:44.369> would<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.820> my

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
so those at the top long run would be my

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.670 
so those at the top long run would be my
tentative<00:01:45.470> fancy<00:01:46.500> how<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:48.380> yeah<00:01:49.380> it's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
tentative fancy how about yeah it's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
tentative fancy how about yeah it's
important<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.340> emphasize<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.420> isn't

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
important to emphasize that this isn't

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.010 
important to emphasize that this isn't
the<00:01:52.049> race<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.250> remember<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the race that I remember it as as a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990 
the race that I remember it as as a
youngster<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.799> mean<00:01:55.950> I've<00:01:56.159> been<00:01:56.189> sitting<00:01:56.729> stand

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
youngster I mean I've been sitting stand

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.300 
youngster I mean I've been sitting stand
in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> stands<00:01:57.509> last<00:01:57.960> year<00:01:58.409> watching

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
in the stands last year watching

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.300 
in the stands last year watching
virtually<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.659> whole<00:02:00.689> field<00:02:01.170> get<00:02:01.950> over

virtually the whole field get over

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.700 
virtually the whole field get over
virtually<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> first<00:02:03.630> circuit<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.320> don't<00:02:04.530> ever

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
virtually the first circuit I don't ever

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.929 
virtually the first circuit I don't ever
remember<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.219> happening<00:02:05.520> before<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
remember that happening before in a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.910 
remember that happening before in a
Grand<00:02:06.180> National<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.560> might<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.770> possible

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
Grand National so it might be possible

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.430 
Grand National so it might be possible
for<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.550> cities<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.970> tidal<00:02:09.360> Bay

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
been the most and may

in jumpers to blunder their way around
and<00:02:16.849> their<00:02:17.510> class<00:02:17.750> might<00:02:18.079> still<00:02:18.349> come<00:02:18.620> through

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
and their class might still come through

having said that I think as Ted has
alluded<00:02:23.689> to<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.170> extremely<00:02:24.680> difficult<00:02:24.890> to

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
alluded to it's extremely difficult to

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.649 
alluded to it's extremely difficult to
come<00:02:25.400> from<00:02:25.549> a<00:02:25.700> long<00:02:25.879> long<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.209> off<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.480> pace

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
come from a long long way off the pace

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.209 
come from a long long way off the pace
which<00:02:26.989> is<00:02:27.140> going<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.319> be<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.500> plan<00:02:27.680> with<00:02:27.890> tidal

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
which is going to be the plan with tidal

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.830 
which is going to be the plan with tidal
Bay<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.549> will<00:02:28.640> also<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:28.969> the<00:02:29.299> plan<00:02:29.480> form<00:02:29.719> on

Bay and will also be the plan form on
big<00:02:30.079> dude<00:02:30.319> who's<00:02:31.189> one<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.909> favorites<00:02:32.560> and

big<00:03:16.790> dude<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.450> he<00:03:17.870> traveled<00:03:18.590> very<00:03:18.829> very<00:03:19.190> well

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
big dude and he traveled very very well

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.270 
big dude and he traveled very very well
into<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.879> race<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.120> coming<00:03:20.659> down<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.930> hill

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
into the race and coming down the hill

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.339 
into the race and coming down the hill
look<00:03:22.280> like<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.639> winner<00:03:23.109> probably<00:03:24.109> just

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
look like the winner probably just

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.080 
look like the winner probably just
needed<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.709> need<00:03:24.889> of<00:03:24.919> the<00:03:25.099> realm<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.579> faded<00:03:26.000> a

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
needed in need of the realm and faded a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.080 
needed in need of the realm and faded a
little<00:03:26.299> bit<00:03:26.479> up<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.440> hill<00:03:27.760> disappointed<00:03:28.760> next

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
little bit up the hill disappointed next

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.420 
little bit up the hill disappointed next
time<00:03:29.299> when<00:03:29.629> pulled<00:03:29.930> up<00:03:30.139> but<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.680> think<00:03:31.310> it's

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
time when pulled up but I think it's

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.479 
time when pulled up but I think it's
well<00:03:31.549> worth<00:03:31.609> forgiving<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.389> run<00:03:33.159> we<00:03:34.159> showed

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
well worth forgiving that run we showed

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.199 
well worth forgiving that run we showed
last<00:03:34.699> season<00:03:35.209> that<00:03:35.239> wasn't<00:03:36.109> his<00:03:36.229> form<00:03:36.669> and<00:03:37.669> he

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
last season that wasn't his form and he

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.819 
last season that wasn't his form and he
seems<00:03:38.510> have<00:03:38.659> gotten<00:03:38.930> off<00:03:39.049> quite<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.590> nice

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829
