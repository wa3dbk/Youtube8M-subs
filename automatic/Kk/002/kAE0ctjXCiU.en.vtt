00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
light and obviously you're in space but

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
light and obviously you're in space but
it<00:00:47.399> combines<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.210> elements<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> shooter

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it combines the elements of a shooter

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.860 
it combines the elements of a shooter
and<00:00:49.379> an<00:00:49.770> RTS<00:00:50.309> there's<00:00:51.120> these<00:00:51.329> asteroids

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and an RTS there's these asteroids

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.540 
and an RTS there's these asteroids
floating<00:00:52.199> around<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.890> they're<00:00:53.160> full<00:00:53.399> of

floating around and they're full of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.850 
floating around and they're full of
valuable<00:00:54.210> minerals<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.020> you're<00:00:55.559> trying<00:00:55.739> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
valuable minerals and you're trying to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
valuable minerals and you're trying to
mine<00:00:56.129> these<00:00:56.340> minerals<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> course

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
mine these minerals but then of course

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.959 
mine these minerals but then of course
there's<00:00:58.109> other<00:00:58.350> people<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.100> space<00:00:59.460> who<00:00:59.940> are

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
there's other people in space who are

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.610 
there's other people in space who are
gonna<00:01:00.239> try<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> take<00:01:00.840> these<00:01:01.020> minerals<00:01:01.440> from

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
gonna try to take these minerals from

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.619 
gonna try to take these minerals from
you<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.100> they're<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.120> attack<00:01:03.239> your

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you and they're going to attack your

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.170 
you and they're going to attack your
base<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.739> defend<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.030> it's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
base so you have to defend it so it's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.320 
base so you have to defend it so it's
kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.960> tower<00:01:07.260> defense<00:01:07.520> RTS<00:01:08.520> shooter

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
kind of like a tower defense RTS shooter

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
kind of like a tower defense RTS shooter
outer<00:01:09.689> space<00:01:10.140> kind<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.500> similar<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.950> has<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> lot

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
outer space kind of similar it has a lot

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
outer space kind of similar it has a lot
of<00:01:11.520> physics<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> those<00:01:12.689> games<00:01:12.840> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
of physics is one of those games that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.719 
of physics is one of those games that
could<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.409> amazing<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> could<00:01:14.369> suck

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
could be amazing or it could suck

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
could be amazing or it could suck
depending<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> implementation<00:01:15.930> well

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
depending on the implementation well

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
depending on the implementation well
from<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:17.820> seeing<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.299> think

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
from what I know what I'm seeing I think

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
from what I know what I'm seeing I think
it<00:01:18.600> looks<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.810> cool<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> gave<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it looks really cool so I gave it a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
thumbs up oh I like the you know I like

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.390 
thumbs up oh I like the you know I like
to<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.259> harsh<00:01:22.500> graphics<00:01:22.979> cuz<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to really harsh graphics cuz you know a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.440 
to really harsh graphics cuz you know a
lot<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.610> times<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.180> direct

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
lot of times when you get direct

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.999 
lot of times when you get direct
sunlight<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.080> very<00:01:25.380> much<00:01:25.560> yeah<00:01:25.979> I

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
sunlight like that's very much yeah I

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.880 
sunlight like that's very much yeah I
think<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.520> game<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.729> quite<00:01:26.970> beautiful<00:01:27.890> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
think this game is quite beautiful and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
think this game is quite beautiful and
it's<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.880> physics<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.420> things

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
it's got a lot of physics and the things

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.690 
it's got a lot of physics and the things
the<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.409> rubble<00:01:31.799> falls<00:01:32.100> back<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the the rubble falls back to the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
the the rubble falls back to the
asteroid<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.450> doesn't<00:01:33.720> fly<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.110> space

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
asteroid and doesn't fly up in space

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
asteroid and doesn't fly up in space
because<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.740> asteroids<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.790> dense

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
because these asteroids are very dense

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060 
because these asteroids are very dense
are<00:01:36.540> those<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.930> their<00:01:37.049> murderous<00:01:37.350> yeah

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
are those of their murderous yeah

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
you know I think this is something that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.920

not<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.250> lot<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.459> people<00:02:37.520> have<00:02:37.760> done<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.269> think

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
not a lot of people have done I think

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.810 
not a lot of people have done I think
this<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.070> gonna<00:02:40.190> we're<00:02:40.400> gonna<00:02:40.459> get<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.700> little

this is gonna we're gonna get a little
philosophical<00:02:41.060> here<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:41.600> i<00:02:41.660> think<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
philosophical here but i think the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.930 
philosophical here but i think the
essence<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.410> fear<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.010> something<00:02:43.700> that's

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
essence of fear is something that's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.370 
essence of fear is something that's
mysterious<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.989> know<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:45.230> like
