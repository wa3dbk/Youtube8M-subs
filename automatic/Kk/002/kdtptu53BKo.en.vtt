00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
zombies is a take on the 1940s kind of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.169 
zombies is a take on the 1940s kind of
cliche<00:00:24.800> zombie<00:00:25.800> film<00:00:26.160> genre<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.059> these

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
cliche zombie film genre you have these

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.319 
cliche zombie film genre you have these
different<00:00:27.599> weapons<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.989> shoot<00:00:28.019> them<00:00:28.410> i

different weapons to shoot them i

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.450 
different weapons to shoot them i
created<00:00:30.329> a<00:00:30.660> dismemberment<00:00:31.619> system<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.399> you

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
created a dismemberment system so you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.000 
created a dismemberment system so you
get<00:00:33.089> more<00:00:33.269> kind<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.600> satisfaction<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.769> glory

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
get more kind of satisfaction like glory

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.500 
get more kind of satisfaction like glory
satisfaction<00:00:35.760> over<00:00:35.850> your<00:00:36.149> shooting<00:00:36.420> this

to<00:00:38.550> head<00:00:38.729> fight<00:00:38.760> off

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.650 

so<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.700> hike<00:00:55.910> system<00:00:56.150> operates<00:00:56.510> with<00:00:56.630> a

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
so the hike system operates with a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.000 
so the hike system operates with a

use motion tracking controllers that

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.360 
use motion tracking controllers that

on the holodeck we've created this new
our<00:01:23.330> style<00:01:23.900> that's<00:01:24.440> supposed<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.860> simulate

1940s Chicago and supposed to look like

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.700 
1940s Chicago and supposed to look like
we've<00:01:28.400> shot<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.700> movie<00:01:29.090> on<00:01:29.240> film<00:01:29.720> but<00:01:30.440> when<00:01:30.560> you

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
we've shot a movie on film but when you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.880 
we've shot a movie on film but when you
place<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.610> cheesy<00:01:32.030> monster<00:01:32.690> music<00:01:32.900> in<00:01:33.710> a

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
place this cheesy monster music in a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.370 
place this cheesy monster music in a
virtual<00:01:34.310> reality<00:01:34.850> world<00:01:35.090> where<00:01:35.660> you<00:01:35.960> are<00:01:36.140> not

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
virtual reality world where you are not

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.900 
virtual reality world where you are not
just<00:01:36.650> sitting<00:01:36.830> back<00:01:37.070> watching<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.790> are

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
just sitting back watching that you are

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.730 
just sitting back watching that you are
physically<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:38.510> player<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:39.290> becomes<00:01:39.560> one<00:01:39.710> of

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
physically the player it becomes one of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.230 
physically the player it becomes one of
the<00:01:39.830> most<00:01:40.010> terrifying<00:01:40.250> things<00:01:40.910> you've<00:01:41.150> ever

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
the most terrifying things you've ever

00:01:41.240 --> 00:02:11.550 
the most terrifying things you've ever
seen

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.080 

so<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> oculus<00:02:13.070> is<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> pretty<00:02:13.520> awesome<00:02:13.670> piece

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so the oculus is a pretty awesome piece

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.000 
so the oculus is a pretty awesome piece
of<00:02:14.240> hardware<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.780> think<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:15.380> by<00:02:15.470> itself<00:02:15.740> it's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
of hardware I think just by itself it's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.520 
of hardware I think just by itself it's
already<00:02:16.220> revolutionizing<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.390> gaming<00:02:18.290> scene

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
already revolutionizing the gaming scene

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.260 
already revolutionizing the gaming scene
with<00:02:18.860> holodeck<00:02:19.280> we're<00:02:19.550> adding<00:02:19.790> like<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.000> whole

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
with holodeck we're adding like a whole

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.600 
with holodeck we're adding like a whole
new<00:02:20.450> layer<00:02:20.600> above<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.350> because<00:02:21.800> now<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.070> you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
new layer above that because now you you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.280 
new layer above that because now you you
can<00:02:22.790> stand<00:02:23.030> up<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.600> walk<00:02:23.810> around<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.170> this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
can stand up you can walk around in this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.560 
can stand up you can walk around in this
space<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.860> there's<00:02:25.250> actually<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.640> laptop

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
space and there's actually a laptop

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.390 
space and there's actually a laptop
system<00:02:26.960> positioned<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.740> your<00:02:27.920> back<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:28.280> you're

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
system positioned on your back so you're

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.980 
system positioned on your back so you're
completely<00:02:28.760> untethered<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.720> can<00:02:29.870> move

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
completely untethered you can move

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.600 
completely untethered you can move
around<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.380> play<00:02:30.530> space<00:02:30.710> interacting<00:02:31.460> over

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
around in a play space interacting over

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.120 
around in a play space interacting over
a<00:02:32.060> network<00:02:32.240> with<00:02:32.570> two<00:02:32.810> players<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.980> full

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
a network with two players and it's full

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.740 
a network with two players and it's full
positional<00:02:34.580> tracking<00:02:34.610> full<00:02:35.180> orientational

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
positional tracking full orientational

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.780 
positional tracking full orientational
tracking<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.800> it's<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.980> really<00:02:37.160> truly

consumers and technology is getting more
and<00:03:08.030> more<00:03:08.090> find<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.780> actually<00:03:08.900> get<00:03:09.110> into

and more find we can actually get into

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.520 
and more find we can actually get into
that<00:03:10.100> much<00:03:10.370> closer<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.940> what<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:11.959> holodeck<00:03:12.350> can

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
that much closer to what a holodeck can

that much closer to what a holodeck can
