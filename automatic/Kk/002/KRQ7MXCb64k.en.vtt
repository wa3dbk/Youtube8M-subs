00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
do it'll still freeze and it'll still

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.200

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
even if you can't see the outcome of it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.270 
even if you can't see the outcome of it
it's<00:02:29.070> all<00:02:29.400> blowing<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.830> started<00:02:31.830> off<00:02:31.980> right

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
it's all blowing up I started off right

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.030 
it's all blowing up I started off right
here<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:33.120> piling<00:02:33.420> blocks<00:02:33.900> literally<00:02:34.770> around

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
here just piling blocks literally around

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.400 
here just piling blocks literally around
50<00:02:35.459> layers<00:02:35.670> deep<00:02:35.970> because<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.510> actually<00:02:36.959> made<00:02:37.380> a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
50 layers deep because I actually made a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.530 
50 layers deep because I actually made a
huge<00:02:37.709> crater<00:02:38.100> down<00:02:38.490> below<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.030> thing<00:02:39.300> so

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
huge crater down below this thing so

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.810 
huge crater down below this thing so
it's<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:39.990> down<00:02:40.560> below<00:02:40.890> ground<00:02:41.190> extending

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
it's going down below ground extending

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.500 
it's going down below ground extending
way<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.120> above<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:44.060> after<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.209> through

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
way up above and after going through

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.510 
way up above and after going through
that<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.690> got<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.050> bored<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.310> what<00:02:47.489> I

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
that I got really bored of it so what I

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.810 
that I got really bored of it so what I
decided<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:48.060> do<00:02:48.209> instead<00:02:48.360> was<00:02:48.959> um<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
decided to do instead was um just

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.470 
decided to do instead was um just
instead<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:50.880> piling<00:02:51.330> things<00:02:51.360> super<00:02:52.050> deep<00:02:52.370> I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
instead of piling things super deep I

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.540 
instead of piling things super deep I
can<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.690> totally<00:02:54.870> see<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> sexual<00:02:56.070> innuendo

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
can just totally see the sexual innuendo

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.120 
can just totally see the sexual innuendo
that<00:02:56.670> will<00:02:56.850> arise<00:02:57.090> from<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.780> um<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:59.070> I

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
that will arise from that um but I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.220 
that will arise from that um but I
decided<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.760> instead<00:03:00.150> thin<00:03:00.750> out<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> blocks

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
decided to instead thin out the blocks

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.770 
decided to instead thin out the blocks
by<00:03:01.560> one<00:03:01.950> layer<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:03.180> go<00:03:03.360> over<00:03:03.540> an

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
by one layer and just go over an

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.030 
by one layer and just go over an
immensely<00:03:04.140> vast<00:03:05.100> area<00:03:06.200> in<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.350> hopes<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.680> it

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
immensely vast area in the hopes that it

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.949 
immensely vast area in the hopes that it
would<00:03:08.190> set<00:03:08.489> off<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.850> pretty<00:03:09.390> darn<00:03:09.690> cool

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
would set off a pretty darn cool

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.930 
would set off a pretty darn cool
reaction<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:13.110> anyway<00:03:13.670> unfortunately<00:03:14.670> it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
reaction so anyway unfortunately it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.790 
reaction so anyway unfortunately it
didn't<00:03:15.209> really<00:03:15.300> work<00:03:15.420> how<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.780> planned<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.350> but

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
didn't really work how I planned it but

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.699 
didn't really work how I planned it but
I'm<00:03:16.920> still<00:03:17.190> gonna<00:03:17.340> set<00:03:17.580> it<00:03:17.700> off<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:18.030> guys

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
I'm still gonna set it off you guys

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.960 
I'm still gonna set it off you guys
you'll<00:03:19.709> get<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.920> see<00:03:20.070> me<00:03:20.100> freeze<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.820> we'll

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
you'll get to see me freeze and we'll

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.810 
you'll get to see me freeze and we'll
probably<00:03:21.209> just<00:03:21.330> end<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.840> right<00:03:22.019> there<00:03:22.820> so

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
probably just end it right there so

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.180 
probably just end it right there so
without<00:03:24.090> further<00:03:24.269> ado<00:03:25.019> I'll<00:03:25.769> just<00:03:25.950> go<00:03:26.070> ahead

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
without further ado I'll just go ahead

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.410 
without further ado I'll just go ahead
and<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.549> there's<00:03:26.730> no<00:03:26.850> sense<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.269> making

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
and do it there's no sense in making

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.090 
and do it there's no sense in making
myself<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:28.049> barrier<00:03:28.470> as<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> game's<00:03:28.890> going<00:03:29.040> to

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
myself a barrier as the game's going to

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.190 
myself a barrier as the game's going to
freeze<00:03:29.370> regardless<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.540> infinite<00:03:31.049> health

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
freeze regardless I have infinite health

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.640 
freeze regardless I have infinite health
I<00:03:31.500> set<00:03:32.310> my<00:03:32.459> armor<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.140> invincible<00:03:34.140> basically

I set my armor to invincible basically

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.490
