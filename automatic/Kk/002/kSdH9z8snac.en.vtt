you

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.780 

Haxton<00:04:11.170> performs<00:04:11.620> really<00:04:11.980> well<00:04:12.159> when<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.640> put

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
Haxton performs really well when you put

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.280 
Haxton performs really well when you put
a<00:04:12.819> little<00:04:12.939> bit<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.180> overdrive<00:04:13.599> in<00:04:13.780> front<00:04:14.049> of<00:04:14.140> it

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
a little bit of overdrive in front of it

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:34.540 
a little bit of overdrive in front of it
hence<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.640> rock<00:04:15.849> box<00:04:16.180> here<00:04:16.690> we<00:04:16.780> go

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.119 

I

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.830 

as<00:05:11.320> with<00:05:12.310> any<00:05:12.430> semi-hollow<00:05:12.970> design<00:05:13.420> if<00:05:13.780> you

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
as with any semi-hollow design if you

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.420 
as with any semi-hollow design if you
pump<00:05:14.170> a<00:05:14.290> lot<00:05:14.470> of<00:05:14.530> game<00:05:14.830> through<00:05:15.070> it<00:05:15.160> it's<00:05:15.280> going

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
pump a lot of game through it it's going

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.520

to<00:05:15.490> howl<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:16.090> bit<00:05:16.270> so<00:05:16.600> this<00:05:17.200> one<00:05:17.380> actually

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
to howl a bit so this one actually

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.110 
to howl a bit so this one actually
handles<00:05:18.040> pretty<00:05:18.250> well<00:05:18.430> with<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.640> lot<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:18.880> gain

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
handles pretty well with a lot of gain

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.950 
handles pretty well with a lot of gain
on<00:05:19.150> top<00:05:19.480> of<00:05:19.660> it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960
