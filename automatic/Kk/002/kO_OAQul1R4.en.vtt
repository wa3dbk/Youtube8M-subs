for<00:01:11.560> cleanup<00:01:11.800> now<00:01:12.729> for<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.179> spells<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.750> prefer

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
to take double heal and the reason

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.010 
to take double heal and the reason
behind<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:15.970> is<00:01:16.030> because<00:01:16.479> I've<00:01:16.660> seen<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.840> lot

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
behind this is because I've seen a lot

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.900 
behind this is because I've seen a lot
of<00:01:17.050> bases<00:01:17.470> with<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.649> air<00:01:17.830> defense<00:01:18.190> smack<00:01:18.670> bang

in<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.119> middle<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.570> base<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.080> it's<00:01:20.890> not

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
in the middle of a base and it's not

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.980 
in the middle of a base and it's not
easy<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.580> get<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.789> so<00:01:22.479> you<00:01:22.570> need<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.810> heal

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
balloons long enough to get into the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.800 
balloons long enough to get into the
middle<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.070> deal<00:01:27.220> with<00:01:27.399> it<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.700> like<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.750> said

if<00:01:29.050> you<00:01:29.110> don't<00:01:29.289> have<00:01:29.440> access<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.920> hogs<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
if you don't have access to hogs the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.980 
if you don't have access to hogs the
double<00:01:30.640> heal<00:01:30.819> can<00:01:31.149> help<00:01:31.360> your<00:01:31.509> balloons<00:01:31.780> to

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
get to that air defense without dying if

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.520 
get to that air defense without dying if
you<00:01:34.149> don't<00:01:34.360> want<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.630> take<00:01:34.780> double<00:01:35.080> heal<00:01:35.289> and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
you don't want to take double heal and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.350 
you don't want to take double heal and
you<00:01:35.649> want<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:36.070> heal<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.700> lightning<00:01:37.060> spell

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
you want a heal and the lightning spell

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.850 
you want a heal and the lightning spell
to<00:01:37.509> deal<00:01:37.659> with<00:01:37.750> clan<00:01:37.960> castle<00:01:38.350> troops<00:01:38.380> that's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
to deal with clan castle troops that's

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.160 
to deal with clan castle troops that's
also<00:01:39.310> fine<00:01:39.520> but<00:01:40.270> another<00:01:40.540> reason<00:01:41.020> behind

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
also fine but another reason behind

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.590 
also fine but another reason behind
taking<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.829> double<00:01:42.100> heal<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.549> because<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.329> lot

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
taking the double heal is because a lot

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.539 
taking the double heal is because a lot
of<00:01:43.659> clan<00:01:43.930> castles<00:01:44.439> that<00:01:44.649> I<00:01:44.680> come<00:01:44.979> across<00:01:45.310> in

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
of clan castles that I come across in

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.940 
of clan castles that I come across in
clan<00:01:46.210> wars<00:01:46.450> tend<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.930> have<00:01:47.049> dragons<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.710> and

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
clan wars tend to have dragons in and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.770 
clan wars tend to have dragons in and
that's<00:01:48.070> why<00:01:48.219> I<00:01:48.250> take<00:01:48.549> extra<00:01:48.939> archers<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.540> just

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
that's why I take extra archers and just

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.149 
that's why I take extra archers and just
use<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.960> double<00:01:50.320> heal<00:01:50.439> because<00:01:50.619> like<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.979> spell

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
use a double heal because like the spell

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.580 
use a double heal because like the spell
doesn't<00:01:51.460> affect<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.820> dragon<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.259> let's<00:01:53.439> take

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
doesn't affect the dragon so let's take

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.080 
doesn't affect the dragon so let's take
a<00:01:53.619> look<00:01:53.770> at<00:01:53.920> one<00:01:54.009> of<00:01:54.130> my<00:01:54.250> recent<00:01:54.490> attacks<00:01:54.939> in

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
a look at one of my recent attacks in

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.270 
a look at one of my recent attacks in
clan<00:01:55.360> wars<00:01:55.630> now<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.229> had<00:01:56.469> to<00:01:56.590> hit<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:57.009> lower

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
clan wars now I had to hit to lower

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.950 
clan wars now I had to hit to lower
because<00:01:57.670> someone<00:01:58.030> else<00:01:58.180> took<00:01:58.360> my<00:01:58.540> opposite

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
because someone else took my opposite

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.080 
because someone else took my opposite
before<00:01:59.290> I<00:01:59.320> got<00:01:59.500> home<00:01:59.710> which<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.219> shame<00:02:00.549> but

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
before I got home which is a shame but

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.870 
before I got home which is a shame but
it's<00:02:01.270> at<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.509> level<00:02:01.570> 6<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.320> far<00:02:03.100> from<00:02:03.310> Max<00:02:03.610> but

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
it's at a level 6 it's far from Max but

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.020 
it's at a level 6 it's far from Max but
it's<00:02:04.090> still<00:02:04.299> an<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.600> half-decent<00:02:05.049> townhall<00:02:05.649> 6

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it's still an a half-decent townhall 6

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.520 
it's still an a half-decent townhall 6
so<00:02:07.030> I'm<00:02:07.119> going<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.360> use<00:02:07.539> my<00:02:07.719> barbarians<00:02:08.320> to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
so I'm going to use my barbarians to

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.109 
so I'm going to use my barbarians to
pull<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.860> dragon<00:02:09.220> right<00:02:09.369> into<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> corner

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
pull the dragon right into the corner

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.850 
pull the dragon right into the corner
now<00:02:10.720> once<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.079> got<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.320> dragon<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:11.769> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
now once you got the dragon in the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.170 
now once you got the dragon in the
corner<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.430> want<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.700> space<00:02:12.910> out<00:02:13.150> your

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
corner you want to space out your

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.420 
corner you want to space out your
archers<00:02:13.810> around<00:02:14.230> him<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.680> circle<00:02:14.890> but<00:02:15.220> don't

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
archers around him in a circle but don't

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.190 
archers around him in a circle but don't
put<00:02:15.640> them<00:02:15.790> too<00:02:15.970> close<00:02:16.239> together<00:02:16.450> because<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
put them too close together because the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.770 
put them too close together because the
AoE<00:02:17.470> Splash<00:02:17.890> Damage<00:02:17.920> will<00:02:18.340> kill<00:02:18.519> them<00:02:18.640> all<00:02:18.780> 12

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
AoE Splash Damage will kill them all 12

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.870 
AoE Splash Damage will kill them all 12
to<00:02:20.019> 15<00:02:20.380> arches<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:20.920> more<00:02:21.160> than<00:02:21.310> enough<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:21.730> deal

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
to 15 arches is more than enough to deal

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.690 
to 15 arches is more than enough to deal
with<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:22.120> level<00:02:22.480> 3<00:02:22.780> dragon<00:02:23.010> after<00:02:24.010> scout<00:02:24.519> in<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
with a level 3 dragon after scout in the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.430 
with a level 3 dragon after scout in the
space<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.150> knew<00:02:25.329> which<00:02:25.540> way<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.750> wanted<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.260> hit

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
space I knew which way I wanted to hit

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.990 
space I knew which way I wanted to hit
this<00:02:26.590> base<00:02:26.829> I<00:02:27.070> wanted<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.489> attack<00:02:27.730> from<00:02:27.940> the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
this base I wanted to attack from the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.569 
this base I wanted to attack from the
right<00:02:28.239> side<00:02:28.540> here<00:02:29.109> because<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.220> drop<00:02:30.430> my

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
right side here because if I drop my

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.490 
right side here because if I drop my
hogs<00:02:30.790> here<00:02:31.030> regardless<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.690> big<00:02:31.900> bombs<00:02:32.170> or<00:02:32.470> a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
hogs here regardless of big bombs or a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500 
hogs here regardless of big bombs or a
spring<00:02:32.890> trap<00:02:33.190> he's<00:02:33.640> only<00:02:33.820> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.239> to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
spring trap he's only going to have to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.930 
spring trap he's only going to have to
so<00:02:35.049> I'll<00:02:35.200> still<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.769> hogs<00:02:36.040> left<00:02:36.340> with<00:02:36.910> a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
so I'll still have to hogs left with a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.490 
so I'll still have to hogs left with a
heal<00:02:37.150> spell<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.720> gives<00:02:37.750> them<00:02:38.079> enough<00:02:38.170> time

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
heal spell that gives them enough time

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.050 
heal spell that gives them enough time
to<00:02:38.650> get<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:38.950> air<00:02:39.190> defense<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.700> take<00:02:39.910> that

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
to get to that air defense and take that

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.199

this attack and it would have been a

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.070 
this attack and it would have been a
waste<00:05:15.280> of<00:05:15.490> loot<00:05:15.760> but<00:05:16.330> luckily<00:05:16.540> there<00:05:16.900> wasn't
