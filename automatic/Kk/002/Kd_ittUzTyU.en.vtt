00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 Hello, this is a new part of the tricks and 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 let's type 100 for this series 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.699
 likes in general, that's such a standard 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.250
 so in this series we will have again 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.619
 the trick is that we take 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.859
 Here are these fast and try to fly into 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.750
 distant island with the help of galaida 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.820
 In general, then fly back and try 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.559
 you can now somewhere not herself 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.630
 do nothing at all in general 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.150
 let's try yes drove 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.520
 once we take all the eye and great there 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.730
 so fly on that building let's at least 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.920
 on this building we try to survive and so 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.610
 good sing smooth and everything is simple 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.910
 Excellent I have something brought down, and guys 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.320

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.440
 says to 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 all drove and now something like that why 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.369
 why seriously I have such a question 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.549
 why everything is normal there is no way all 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:29.270
 everybody you would do everything right here 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:32.060
 the fact that for garbage and that's where it goes 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.820
 u high just slate above distance 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:41.200
 so yes and you know what 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.200
 I try to try the night 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.800
 on the roof of this went very well the river 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:57.409
 and who kish even jumped from a chair so 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.040
 straight fast 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.330
 good speed good start now 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.810
 again then no garbage no no no 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.810
 debug inability 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.150
 yes if you would have stayed now you were 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.060
 until such a post luck 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.310
 here you can try an hour or five minutes 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.920
 everything will turn out just randomly again 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.030
 deducted as his unfortunate but try 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.030

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:41.280

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.370

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.220

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.159
 two minutes and and so my so heavy 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.109
 the trick and we performed it in general then I

 from that count the edges flew to here and 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.120
 that they even fell from the moto itâ€™s just 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.639
