00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
designing the next great product let's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.640 
designing the next great product let's
first<00:00:30.420> go<00:00:30.570> over<00:00:30.600> opening<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> software<00:00:31.530> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
first go over opening the software and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.710 
first go over opening the software and
then<00:00:31.950> we'll<00:00:32.070> tour<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.400> interface<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:33.000> your

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
then we'll tour the interface on your

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.180 
then we'll tour the interface on your
desktop<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.080> should<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.500> an<00:00:34.590> icon<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.130> says

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
desktop you should see an icon that says

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.299 
desktop you should see an icon that says
solvers<00:00:35.760> 2014<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.080> can<00:00:37.230> either<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> 64

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
solvers 2014 and can either have the 64

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.640 
solvers 2014 and can either have the 64
bit<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.880> 32<00:00:39.120> bit<00:00:39.470> depending<00:00:40.470> on<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
bit or the 32 bit depending on the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.830 
bit or the 32 bit depending on the
software<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.580> installed<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.660> don't

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.180 
software you have installed if you don't
see<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> desktop<00:00:43.470> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.830> go<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
see it on the desktop you can go to the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
see it on the desktop you can go to the
Start<00:00:44.430> menu<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.080> it<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.410> first<00:00:46.739> icon

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
they should launch the program to get

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.030 
they should launch the program to get
started<00:00:51.420> first<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.290> gonna<00:00:52.410> come<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:52.800> to

sometimes<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.830> into<00:01:04.949> these<00:01:05.130> file<00:01:05.339> meetings

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
sometimes get into these file meetings

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760 
sometimes get into these file meetings
actually<00:01:05.790> open<00:01:06.600> files<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
actually open files from there so it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.650 
actually open files from there so it
makes<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.160> easy<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:09.149> get<00:01:09.270> started<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
makes it really easy to get started the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.090 
makes it really easy to get started the
easiest<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.229> actually<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.710> click<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.009> this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
easiest way is actually to click on this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.249 
easiest way is actually to click on this
blank<00:01:11.460> sheet<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> paper<00:01:11.700> called<00:01:12.270> new<00:01:12.420> when

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
blank sheet of paper called new when

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.930 
blank sheet of paper called new when
this<00:01:13.380> dialog<00:01:13.740> box<00:01:13.979> opens<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.399> notice<00:01:14.790> we've

this dialog box opens up notice we've

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.550 
this dialog box opens up notice we've
got<00:01:14.970> three<00:01:15.330> options<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.840> got<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> part<00:01:16.350> an

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
got three options we got a part an

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080 
got three options we got a part an
assembler<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.100> drawing<00:01:17.399> and<00:01:17.610> those<00:01:17.940> are

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
assembler your drawing and those are

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
assembler your drawing and those are
three<00:01:18.270> different<00:01:18.300> modes<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.200> SolidWorks<00:01:19.619> can

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
three different modes the SolidWorks can

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
three different modes the SolidWorks can
actually<00:01:20.009> operate<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.520> most<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> time<00:01:21.450> you're

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
actually operate in most the time you're

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.149 
actually operate in most the time you're
going<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.720> start<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.020> parts<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.770> take<00:01:23.010> those

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
going to start with parts you take those

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.170 
going to start with parts you take those
parts<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.760> assemble<00:01:23.970> those

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
parts are going to assemble those

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.700 
parts are going to assemble those
together<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.870> then<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.260> make<00:01:25.470> drawings

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
together and then we can make drawings

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.190 
together and then we can make drawings
of<00:01:26.040> either<00:01:26.220> parts<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:26.760> assemblies<00:01:27.360> let's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
of either parts or assemblies let's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.950 
of either parts or assemblies let's
choose<00:01:28.440> part<00:01:28.770> click<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.460> OK<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.030> launch<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
choose part click on OK and launch the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
choose part click on OK and launch the
program<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:32.010> we<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> full<00:01:32.520> interface

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
program now we have the full interface

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.420 
program now we have the full interface
available<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.409> top<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.250> have

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
available on the top you can see we have

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.920 
available on the top you can see we have
what's<00:01:35.610> called<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> ribbon<00:01:36.330> bar<00:01:36.510> and<00:01:36.720> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
quickly switch between the two if you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.490 
quickly switch between the two if you
need<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.490> little<00:03:23.640> more<00:03:23.820> intricate<00:03:24.600> control
