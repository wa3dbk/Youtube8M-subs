00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that the kind of a mid-game kind of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.050 
that the kind of a mid-game kind of
snowballed<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.759> happened<00:01:33.000> was

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
snowballed and but what happened was

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.370 
snowballed and but what happened was
they<00:01:33.270> gave<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.540> drugs<00:01:33.689> when<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.110> shouldn't

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
they gave up drugs when they shouldn't

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.420 
they gave up drugs when they shouldn't
have<00:01:34.500> they<00:01:34.650> should<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.860> contested<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
have they should have contested all of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
have they should have contested all of
them<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:36.150> got<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> drugs<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.439> were

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
them and we got to drugs when they were

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
them and we got to drugs when they were
ahead<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.100> had<00:01:38.250> control<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.970> think

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
ahead and they had control but I think

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870 
ahead and they had control but I think
Wes<00:01:39.869> fries<00:01:40.049> use<00:01:40.229> TP<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.829> bit<00:01:41.220> early<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:41.729> we

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
Wes fries use TP a bit early and then we

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.550 
Wes fries use TP a bit early and then we
had<00:01:42.030> serif<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.479> TP<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.200> allowed<00:01:43.409> us<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
had serif with TP so that allowed us to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.200 
had serif with TP so that allowed us to
secure<00:01:44.009> some<00:01:44.130> dragons<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
secure some dragons and because of that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.120 
secure some dragons and because of that
we<00:01:45.329> were<00:01:45.960> able<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.290> keep<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> game<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> we

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
we were able to keep in the game and we

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.010 
we were able to keep in the game and we
kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.369> knew<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:47.970> scaled<00:01:48.240> because

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
kind of knew that we out scaled because

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.240 
kind of knew that we out scaled because
of<00:01:49.140> their<00:01:49.229> builds<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.680> they're<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:49.979> like

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
of their builds and they're all like

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
of their builds and they're all like
itemizing<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.820> armor<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.140> reality<00:01:52.259> we

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
itemizing for armor but in reality we

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.160 
itemizing for armor but in reality we
have<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> lot<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> hybrid<00:01:53.399> damage<00:01:53.670> so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
have a lot of hybrid damage so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.450 
have a lot of hybrid damage so
absolutely<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.409> mean<00:01:55.710> definitely<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.340> you

absolutely I mean definitely when you
have<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> late-game<00:01:57.420> scaling<00:01:57.899> composition

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
have a late-game scaling composition

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.459 
have a late-game scaling composition
like<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.960> what<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:00.990> what

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the 131 kind of split push that you guys

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.380 
the 131 kind of split push that you guys
did<00:02:07.860> after<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.369> had<00:02:08.489> secured<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.879> Baron<00:02:09.209> and

did after you had secured the Baron and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.119 
did after you had secured the Baron and
you<00:02:09.509> finally<00:02:09.929> got<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> power<00:02:10.619> spike<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you finally got to that power spike that

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.460 
you finally got to that power spike that
you<00:02:11.190> were<00:02:11.280> looking<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:11.849> we<00:02:12.810> knew<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.319> can

Baron<00:02:14.620> both<00:02:14.920> because<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.670> amount<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.690> stat

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
Baron both because of the amount of stat

Baron both because of the amount of stat
study<00:02:17.110> provides<00:02:17.440> japonica<00:02:18.160> pressure<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.520> I

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
study provides japonica pressure and I

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.830 
study provides japonica pressure and I
can<00:02:18.730> really<00:02:18.910> easily<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.180> i<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.690> beat

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
can really easily and i can beat

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.630 
can really easily and i can beat
Kassadin<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.530> because<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.130> we<00:02:21.250> needed

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
Kassadin and because of that we needed

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.220 
Kassadin and because of that we needed
to<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:21.880> every<00:02:22.120> single<00:02:22.210> outer<00:02:22.480> tower<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.960> it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
to get every single outer tower and it

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.720 
to get every single outer tower and it
was<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.530> kind<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.710> a<00:02:23.770> slow<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.220> steady<00:02:24.460> game

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
was just kind of a slow and steady game

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.550 
was just kind of a slow and steady game
and<00:02:25.000> we<00:02:25.210> wanted<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.450> make<00:02:25.600> sure<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.960> we<00:02:26.410> don't

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
and we wanted to make sure that we don't

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.860 
and we wanted to make sure that we don't
get<00:02:26.830> pressured<00:02:27.460> by<00:02:27.580> TP<00:02:27.820> because<00:02:28.210> saying<00:02:28.720> we

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
get pressured by TP because saying we

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.210 
get pressured by TP because saying we
happen<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.170> group<00:02:29.410> five<00:02:29.560> min<00:02:29.710> with<00:02:29.860> Baron<00:02:30.070> buff

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
happen to group five min with Baron buff

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.770 
happen to group five min with Baron buff
then<00:02:30.490> what<00:02:30.760> happen<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.090> kassadin<00:02:31.570> we're<00:02:31.690> not

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
then what happen is kassadin we're not

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.760 
then what happen is kassadin we're not
going<00:02:31.900> we'll<00:02:31.990> just<00:02:32.140> go<00:02:32.200> split<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.470> topics

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
going we'll just go split on topics

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.650 
going we'll just go split on topics
split<00:02:33.160> top<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.550> bottom<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:33.970> we<00:02:34.480> won't

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
split top and bottom and that we won't

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.090 
split top and bottom and that we won't
be<00:02:34.750> able<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.560> know<00:02:35.650> do<00:02:35.740> anything<00:02:36.040> about

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
be able to you know do anything about

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.770 
be able to you know do anything about
the<00:02:36.250> pressure<00:02:36.370> because<00:02:36.760> they<00:02:36.910> have<00:02:37.060> double<00:02:37.510> TP

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
the pressure because they have double TP

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.600 
the pressure because they have double TP
right<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.470> we<00:02:38.890> have<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.160> play<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.310> one

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
right so we have to play this one

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.920 
right so we have to play this one
through<00:02:39.760> one<00:02:39.910> game<00:02:40.090> until<00:02:40.390> we<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.690> slowly

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
through one game until we can slowly

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.960 
through one game until we can slowly
like<00:02:41.350> pressure<00:02:41.920> them<00:02:42.130> into<00:02:42.220> their<00:02:42.520> base<00:02:42.700> and

just good enough then we can group 5 and

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.460 
just good enough then we can group 5 and

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
were a lot stronger and I knew because i

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.129 
were a lot stronger and I knew because i
think<00:04:49.490> i<00:04:49.610> had<00:04:49.729> IE<00:04:49.910> at<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.419> time<00:04:50.630> so<00:04:50.810> i<00:04:50.840> pretty

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
think i had IE at that time so i pretty

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.480 
think i had IE at that time so i pretty
much<00:04:51.289> ninety<00:04:51.620> percent<00:04:51.740> crit<00:04:52.069> chance<00:04:52.099> and

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
much ninety percent crit chance and

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.270 
much ninety percent crit chance and
that's<00:04:53.240> really<00:04:53.780> just<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.620> crazy<00:04:55.009> amount

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
that's really just to the crazy amount

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.680 
that's really just to the crazy amount
of<00:04:55.340> damage<00:04:55.580> yeah<00:04:56.000> we're<00:04:56.210> gonna<00:04:56.300> get<00:04:56.449> a<00:04:56.479> replay
