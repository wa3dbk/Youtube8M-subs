00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
another free one called shadow and it's

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.810 
another free one called shadow and it's
in<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.210> LAN<00:04:48.360> Maya<00:04:48.630> repo<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:50.340> says<00:04:50.580> that

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
in the LAN Maya repo and it says that

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.890 
in the LAN Maya repo and it says that
it's<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.030> dark<00:04:51.390> theme<00:04:51.750> unlike<00:04:52.650> others<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.900> it's

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
it's a dark theme unlike others and it's

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.010 
it's a dark theme unlike others and it's
only<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.740> gradient<00:04:56.490> black<00:04:57.120> color<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.810> white

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
only a gradient black color and white

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.830 
only a gradient black color and white
glyph<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:59.340> let's<00:04:59.880> see<00:05:00.060> what<00:05:00.240> this<00:05:00.420> looks<00:05:00.750> like

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
glyph so let's see what this looks like

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.150 
glyph so let's see what this looks like
on<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:02.030> actual<00:05:03.050> springboard<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.290> as<00:05:04.920> you<00:05:05.040> can

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
on the actual springboard and as you can

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.740 
on the actual springboard and as you can
see<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:05.550> is<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.700> little<00:05:05.910> bit<00:05:06.090> different<00:05:06.570> but<00:05:06.690> it

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
see it is a little bit different but it

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.130 
see it is a little bit different but it
is<00:05:06.900> unique<00:05:07.410> in<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.710> pretty<00:05:07.920> cool<00:05:08.220> way<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:09.300> really

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
is unique in a pretty cool way I really

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.950 
is unique in a pretty cool way I really
like<00:05:10.320> how<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.590> icons<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:12.150> know<00:05:12.270> sort<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.720> look

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
like how the icons you know sort of look

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.550 
like how the icons you know sort of look
different<00:05:13.470> than<00:05:13.650> most<00:05:14.810> themes<00:05:15.810> we've<00:05:16.200> looked

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
different than most themes we've looked

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.220 
different than most themes we've looked
at<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.220> as<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.330> can<00:05:18.480> see<00:05:18.540> there<00:05:18.990> are<00:05:19.080> some

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
at and as you can see there are some

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.410 
at and as you can see there are some
applications<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.190> aren't<00:05:20.490> themed<00:05:20.910> as<00:05:21.120> well

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
applications that aren't themed as well

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.320 
applications that aren't themed as well
but<00:05:22.380> for<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:22.980> most<00:05:23.160> part<00:05:23.310> all<00:05:23.700> of<00:05:23.730> your<00:05:23.970> stock

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
but for the most part all of your stock

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.470 
but for the most part all of your stock
stuff<00:05:24.750> is<00:05:24.990> themed<00:05:25.350> and<00:05:25.680> that's<00:05:26.250> most<00:05:27.090> of<00:05:27.420> the

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
stuff is themed and that's most of the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.450 
stuff is themed and that's most of the
time<00:05:27.630> what<00:05:28.350> you're<00:05:28.530> gonna<00:05:28.710> run<00:05:28.890> into<00:05:28.920> in<00:05:29.310> these

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
time what you're gonna run into in these

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.190 
time what you're gonna run into in these
free<00:05:29.760> themes<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.240> they<00:05:30.330> usually<00:05:30.540> just<00:05:30.870> do<00:05:31.020> the
