00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.550
 today in trends dressed in the other 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.980
 the night I think it's still the subject 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.960
 a bit like prestige and level that 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.449
 continue with the entities the styles 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.390
 stylized and a little ways to 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.000
 market people still capture it like this 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.089
 short dress for day and long dress 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.610
 for our faces when they arrive 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.930
 normally we see them the schemes 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.010
 we can offer for example a 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.379
 long day dress 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.100
 It is spectacular but expensive the same 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.790
 dress 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.020
 if we lose it like that 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.020
 it's an evening dress 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.250
 we follow a little bit all the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.520
 trends but then we adapt them to 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.460
 a way much lighter or light 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.530
 so that it is very coupled to the street 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.240
 you have a little philosophy is the one that 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.150
 woman is always female is 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.560
 we use fabrics like very vaporous 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.600
 as you see infinity of colors so that 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.600
 stop a little each woman 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.420
 women with what the store what is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 what he wants is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 decompensated and wants to be the queen of 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 seville a color that can raise the tone 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.080
 of skin that can lower it this 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.479
 disconnected can be with the same 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.520
 dress and elvis the same way can 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.500
 Be radiant like being super off 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.180
 and spend on productive endesa that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.790
 sometimes he also asks for it I think what 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.649
 principal is how right now it is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.860

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.550
