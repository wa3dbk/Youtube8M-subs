and how long do they have to take the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.850 
and how long do they have to take the
pills<00:02:09.789> for<00:02:10.030> they<00:02:10.509> did<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.840> for<00:02:11.020> 12<00:02:11.320> weeks

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
pills for they did it for 12 weeks

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.310 
pills for they did it for 12 weeks
oh<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:13.330> rewarding<00:02:13.870> yes<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.200> guys

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
oh that's rewarding yes you guys

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.610 
oh that's rewarding yes you guys
interested<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.740> this

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.000 

this<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.580> raw<00:02:19.790> material<00:02:20.420> for<00:02:20.629> coffee<00:02:21.409> that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
this is the raw material for coffee that

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.289 
this is the raw material for coffee that
we<00:02:22.099> drink<00:02:22.340> why<00:02:22.519> would<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:22.940> drinking<00:02:23.269> coffee

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
we drink why would just drinking coffee

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.720 
we drink why would just drinking coffee
do<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:23.930> yeah<00:02:24.319> because<00:02:24.590> when<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.459> coffee

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
do this yeah because when the coffee

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.699 
do this yeah because when the coffee
that<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.180> drank<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.810> roasted<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.470> when<00:02:27.590> they

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
that we drank is roasted and when they

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.119 
that we drank is roasted and when they
roast<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.190> they<00:02:28.340> roasted<00:02:28.790> at<00:02:28.930> 475<00:02:30.129> degrees

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.119 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.930> changes<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.470> color<00:02:33.650> turns

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.250 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns
brown<00:02:34.459> changes<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> aroma<00:02:35.450> changes<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
brown changes the aroma changes the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.170 
brown changes the aroma changes the
taste<00:02:36.530> changes<00:02:36.860> everything<00:02:37.459> but<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> most

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
taste changes everything but the most

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.149 
taste changes everything but the most
important<00:02:38.840> thing<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.079> does<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.409> it<00:02:39.769> removes

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
important thing it does is it removes

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.390 
important thing it does is it removes
the<00:02:40.549> chlorogenic<00:02:41.030> acid<00:02:41.900> that's<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.920> key<00:02:43.159> to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.430 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to
what<00:02:43.610> we're<00:02:43.760> talking<00:02:44.000> about<00:02:44.299> today<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.349> how

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
what we're talking about today so how

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.069 
what we're talking about today so how
does<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.590> work<00:02:45.680> well<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:47.000> amazing<00:02:47.239> it's<00:02:47.900> what

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
does it work well it's amazing it's what

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.899 
does it work well it's amazing it's what
we<00:02:48.170> call<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.379> triple<00:02:48.769> threat<00:02:48.799> okay

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
we call a triple threat okay

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.520 
we call a triple threat okay
and<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.390> chlorogenic<00:02:50.720> acid<00:02:51.410> that

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
and it's the chlorogenic acid that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.170 
and it's the chlorogenic acid that
causes<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:52.069> effect<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.549> it<00:02:52.670> works<00:02:52.849> three

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
causes the effect and it works three

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.930 
causes the effect and it works three
ways<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.420> first<00:02:53.810> way<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:55.129> goes<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.849> it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
ways the first way is it goes in and it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.690 
ways the first way is it goes in and it
causes<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.660> body<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.989> burn<00:02:57.379> glucose<00:02:58.069> or<00:02:58.340> sugar

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
causes the body to burn glucose or sugar

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.539 
causes the body to burn glucose or sugar
and<00:02:58.910> burn<00:02:59.629> fat<00:02:59.959> mainly<00:03:00.470> in<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.680> liver<00:03:00.829> the

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
and burn fat mainly in the liver the

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.369 
and burn fat mainly in the liver the
second<00:03:01.970> way<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.450> most<00:03:02.629> important<00:03:03.079> way<00:03:03.170> is

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
second way and the most important way is

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.699 
second way and the most important way is
it<00:03:03.829> slows<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.700> release<00:03:04.849> of<00:03:05.359> sugar<00:03:05.680> into<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
it slows the release of sugar into the

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.130 
it slows the release of sugar into the
bloodstream<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:08.209> when<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.480> don't<00:03:08.659> have<00:03:08.900> sugar

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
bloodstream so when you don't have sugar

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.050 
bloodstream so when you don't have sugar
building<00:03:09.620> up<00:03:09.709> in<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.890> bloodstream<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.640> don't

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
building up in the bloodstream you don't

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.630 
building up in the bloodstream you don't
have<00:03:11.299> fat<00:03:11.629> building<00:03:12.079> up<00:03:12.230> because<00:03:12.560> sugar<00:03:12.920> turns

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
have fat building up because sugar turns

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.289 
have fat building up because sugar turns
to<00:03:14.030> fat<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.569> everybody<00:03:15.170> must<00:03:15.500> remember<00:03:15.980> that

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
to fat and everybody must remember that

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.449 
to fat and everybody must remember that
when<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.420> two<00:03:17.629> are<00:03:17.780> combined<00:03:18.290> together<00:03:18.560> you

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
when the two are combined together you

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.789 
when the two are combined together you
get<00:03:19.670> this<00:03:19.849> synergistic<00:03:20.540> effect<00:03:21.200> that

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
get this synergistic effect that

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.580 
get this synergistic effect that
basically<00:03:22.280> burns<00:03:22.700> in<00:03:23.000> blocks<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.630> stops<00:03:24.079> fat

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
basically burns in blocks and stops fat

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.809 
basically burns in blocks and stops fat
but<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.579> also<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:26.620> natural<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.829> safe<00:03:28.069> to<00:03:28.609> folks

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
but it also is natural and safe to folks

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.509 
but it also is natural and safe to folks
have<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.090> take<00:03:29.269> in<00:03:29.419> order<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.630> get<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.900> benefit

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
have to take in order to get the benefit

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.370 
have to take in order to get the benefit
800<00:03:31.519> milligrams<00:03:31.970> twice<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.419> day<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.230> want

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
800 milligrams twice a day and you want

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.009 
800 milligrams twice a day and you want
to<00:03:33.440> take<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.799> before<00:03:34.010> meals<00:03:34.940> about<00:03:35.389> 30<00:03:35.660> minutes

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
to take it before meals about 30 minutes

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.470 
to take it before meals about 30 minutes
before<00:03:36.139> with<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.560> large<00:03:36.859> glass<00:03:37.160> of<00:03:37.400> water<00:03:37.730> and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
before with a large glass of water and

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.970 
before with a large glass of water and
I'm<00:03:38.690> just<00:03:38.840> yeah<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.139> looks<00:03:39.349> like<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.709> right

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
I'm just yeah it looks like this right

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.979 
I'm just yeah it looks like this right
so<00:03:40.459> it's<00:03:40.760> counseling<00:03:41.269> capsule<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:41.840> you're<00:03:41.930> not

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
so it's counseling capsule so you're not

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.210 
so it's counseling capsule so you're not
gonna<00:03:42.169> take<00:03:42.379> the<00:03:42.500> actual<00:03:42.739> beam<00:03:42.950> you're<00:03:43.129> not

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
gonna take the actual beam you're not

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.640 
gonna take the actual beam you're not
having<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.609> coffee<00:03:43.849> variant<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:45.349> probably

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
having a coffee variant it probably

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.289 
having a coffee variant it probably
wouldn't<00:03:45.829> taste<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.099> great<00:03:46.280> anyway<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:47.030> the

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
wouldn't taste that great anyway so the

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.909 
wouldn't taste that great anyway so the
capsules<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.750> can<00:03:47.900> buy<00:03:48.049> where<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.709> buy<00:03:48.859> it

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
capsules you can buy where you buy it

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.830 
capsules you can buy where you buy it
online<00:03:49.129> you<00:03:49.910> want<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.150> make<00:03:50.299> sure<00:03:50.329> that<00:03:50.750> this
