00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.860
 and have a pet and travel with them 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.570
 incompatible terms we can travel 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.799
 with our pet but we have to 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.050
 take into account a series of requirements 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.210
 ranging from comfort to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.090
 security of our pet plus 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.739
 there are a series of legal regulations 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.730
 and regulations that we will have to 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:31.189
 meet and the automobile is the most 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.660
 common to travel with pets if 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.250
 we have a dog the first thing we have 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.440
 what to do is make sure that you have 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.170
 enough space to be able to 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.539
 knock down during the journey also in 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.329
 this case we also have to put 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.489
 clamping measures so that the dog does not 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.329
 can access the driver's seat 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.649
 you can use bars can use meshes 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.050
 You can also use adapters 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.879
 for seatbelt then in 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.010
 this case the dog has to go with a 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.859
 harness because thus avoid being injured 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.379
 the neck if there is a sudden braking or 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.510
 an accident another option that we have is 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.400
 the dog carrier can be used 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.000
 if the animal is used to climbing in 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.770
 the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.170
 and the truth is that for cats it's the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.610
 best means of transport if your 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.420
 dog is one of those who passed it in the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.920
 car 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.450
 you have to get used to it with travel 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.660
 very short so you can get used to 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.670
 and see that there is no danger if the 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.220
 thing persists you can talk to the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.320
 veterinarian to give you some 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.180
 medication or to lower anxiety or 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.160
 to avoid dizziness until the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.869
 animal gets used to 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.430
 it is convenient during the trip to do 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.050
 breaks every two or four hours for 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.240
 be able to stretch the legs and to be able to 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.250
 drink water and especially it is very 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.619
 important never to leave an animal 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.080
 inside the car even if you think that 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.180
 is for a short time the temperature of the 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.800
 sub car goes up very quickly and the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.000
 animal can suffer a heat stroke and 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.000
 this is very dangerous for him 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.659
 If we travel by train or plane, we have to 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.549
 talk about everything first like the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.259
 transport company then you have to 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.240
 ask them the requirements of 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.280
 identification that they ask for the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.469
 possibility of renting cages or 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.289
 transportines and documentation 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.420
 necessary if we travel by plane 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.030
 small animals can go in 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.250
 transportation not in a bag in the cabin 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.220
 of the passengers but they are animals already a 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.590
 little big from 67 kilos 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.720
 they must go in the hold of the plane 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.000
 this causes them a lot of stress then it is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.730
 important sometimes to give them some kind of 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.220
 sedative especially if the journey is 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.670
 long in addition in some companies demand 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.319
 that the animal goes with muzzle and subject 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.720
 by its owner especially in the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.790
 common areas waiting rooms 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.160
 boarding areas as it is important 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.629
 use a muzzle in which the animal can 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.030
 stick out your tongue to be able to cool off 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.829
 with panting if we travel by train the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.980
 Most companies allow the 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.629
 animals weighing less than 67 kilos travel with 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.489
 its owners so we have to 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.420
 have the consent of the people 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.120
 of the same 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.680
 compartment according to which routes we 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.580
 They will also ask us to pay for the ticket 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.170
 of the pet plus in many areas what 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.060
 what we have to do is make the animal 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.250
 inside a carrier or a cage 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.349
 and with the muzzle put especially in the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.880
 Common areas is also mandatory 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.220
 above all take the primer 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.230
 vaccination of the animal there is also the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.569
 possibility of contracting some kind of 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.060
 courier service that has a 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.040
 specialized transport service 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.930
 animals because in this case our 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000
 pet will travel in a service that is 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.010
 adapted for it with a temperature 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.640
 controlled and with a supervision 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.640
 veterinary
