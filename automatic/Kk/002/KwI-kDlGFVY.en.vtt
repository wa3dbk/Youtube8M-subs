hi<00:00:01.860> there<00:00:02.040> one<00:00:02.340> more<00:00:02.520> take<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:03.890> the<00:00:04.890> galaxy<00:00:05.310> m82

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
hi there one more take of the galaxy m82

but<00:02:10.470> right<00:02:11.370> now<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.640> pretty<00:02:11.730> obvious<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
but right now it's pretty obvious and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.309 
but right now it's pretty obvious and
we're<00:02:14.550> seeing<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.879> see<00:02:15.300> 10<00:02:15.540> inch<00:02:15.720> telescope

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
we're seeing it see 10 inch telescope

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.940 
we're seeing it see 10 inch telescope
Elon<00:02:16.800> 250<00:02:17.250> scope<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:19.050> there<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.290> em<00:02:19.590> 82

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
Elon 250 scope so there you have em 82

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.160 
Elon 250 scope so there you have em 82
