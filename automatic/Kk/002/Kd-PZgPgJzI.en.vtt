00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.340 
easier to pull just like this you push
up<00:02:33.670> whenever<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.360> want<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.720> collapse<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.230> you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
up whenever you want to collapse it you

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.590 
up whenever you want to collapse it you
push<00:02:35.560> down<00:02:35.590> whenever<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.310> want<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.790> be

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
push down whenever you want it to be

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.170 
push down whenever you want it to be
normal<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.680> look<00:02:39.190> how<00:02:39.370> little<00:02:39.579> it<00:02:39.760> folds

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
normal and it look how little it folds

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:52.550 
normal and it look how little it folds
ah<00:02:41.400> here's<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.670> red<00:02:42.820> one<00:02:48.120> this

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.550 

that's<00:02:53.560> how<00:02:53.800> little<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.280> thing<00:02:54.489> folds<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
that's how little that thing folds so it

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.280 
that's how little that thing folds so it
can<00:02:56.800> fit<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.099> just<00:02:57.130> about<00:02:57.459> anything<00:02:58.290> normally

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
can fit in just about anything normally

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.960 
can fit in just about anything normally
the<00:02:59.440> smaller<00:02:59.530> ones<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.010> fold<00:03:00.310> like<00:03:00.489> this<00:03:00.520> are

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
the smaller ones that fold like this are

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.559 
the smaller ones that fold like this are
not<00:03:01.390> very<00:03:01.690> good<00:03:01.959> but<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.530> surprisingly

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
not very good but this is surprisingly

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.240 
not very good but this is surprisingly
amazingly<00:03:04.569> strong<00:03:05.110> oh<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.250> watch<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.790> skies

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
think it's going to last for quite some

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.880 
think it's going to last for quite some
time<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.610> then<00:03:43.150> also<00:03:43.450> on<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.110> wheels<00:03:44.440> on<00:03:44.769> the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
time and then also on the wheels on the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.800 
time and then also on the wheels on the
front<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.930> can<00:03:48.690> lock<00:03:49.690> them<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.410> go<00:03:50.560> straight

so<00:03:52.810> if<00:03:53.200> you're<00:03:54.150> held<00:03:55.150> my<00:03:55.329> husband<00:03:55.690> do<00:03:55.810> this

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.360 

that<00:04:00.890> has<00:04:01.010> been<00:04:01.159> different<00:04:01.549> like<00:04:01.640> a<00:04:01.790> pulse<00:04:02.599> you

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
that has been different like a pulse you

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.679 
that has been different like a pulse you
can<00:04:04.370> lock<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.879> wheels<00:04:04.909> to<00:04:05.329> where<00:04:05.450> they<00:04:05.659> just

go straight so if you're in a store or
something<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:10.250> don't<00:04:10.400> want<00:04:10.549> to<00:04:10.640> twiddle

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
something and you don't want to twiddle

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.960 
something and you don't want to twiddle
you<00:04:11.870> can<00:04:12.049> straighten<00:04:12.500> out<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.709> wheels<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.370> go

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
you can straighten out the wheels and go

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.960 
you can straighten out the wheels and go
nowhere<00:04:14.150> else<00:04:14.470> or<00:04:15.470> if<00:04:16.340> one<00:04:16.579> of<00:04:16.609> your<00:04:16.789> owner

children<00:04:17.479> are<00:04:17.630> pushing<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.139> stroller<00:04:18.289> and

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
children are pushing the stroller and

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.670 
children are pushing the stroller and
they<00:04:18.769> go<00:04:18.889> everywhere<00:04:19.269> it's<00:04:20.269> really<00:04:21.079> nice<00:04:21.289> and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
they go everywhere it's really nice and

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.730 
they go everywhere it's really nice and
for<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.639> believe<00:04:23.360> our<00:04:23.600> generation<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.530> is

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
for I believe our generation it is

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.700 
for I believe our generation it is
probably<00:04:25.699> the<00:04:26.060> coolest<00:04:26.510> car<00:04:27.020> seat<00:04:27.260> out<00:04:27.440> there

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
probably the coolest car seat out there

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.860 
probably the coolest car seat out there
with<00:04:28.400> all<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.669> different<00:04:28.880> bubble<00:04:29.510> designs

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
and solid colors it looks really really

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.900 
and solid colors it looks really really
nice<00:04:34.900> okay
