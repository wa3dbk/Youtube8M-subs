00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
the last few times just turned out that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.140 
the last few times just turned out that
it<00:02:53.230> was<00:02:53.470> way<00:02:53.680> too<00:02:53.710> much<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.220> handle<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:55.060> be

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
it was way too much to handle to be

it was way too much to handle to be
quite<00:02:55.300> blunt<00:02:55.620> currently<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.680> Korea<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.220> terms

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.450 
of like the furnace of foreign casa I'm
probably<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.740> only<00:02:59.800> person<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.370> really

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
probably the only person that really

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.100 
probably the only person that really

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
I've been for the last few years kynoch

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.510 
I've been for the last few years kynoch
organizing<00:03:04.930> everything<00:03:05.050> with<00:03:05.830> regards<00:03:06.460> to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
organizing everything with regards to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.580 
organizing everything with regards to
coverage<00:03:06.880> for<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.210> qualifier<00:03:07.630> itself<00:03:08.050> but

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
coverage for the qualifier itself but

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.260 
coverage for the qualifier itself but
especially<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.190> last<00:03:09.370> couple<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.790> times<00:03:10.030> it

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
especially the last couple of times it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.180 
especially the last couple of times it
just<00:03:10.300> got<00:03:10.630> way<00:03:10.960> way<00:03:11.260> too<00:03:11.290> complicated<00:03:11.620> to

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
just got way way too complicated to

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.250 
just got way way too complicated to
really<00:03:12.460> do<00:03:12.910> all<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.090> these<00:03:13.330> things<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:14.080> main

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
really do all of these things the main

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.870 
really do all of these things the main
reason<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:15.100> language<00:03:15.370> barrier<00:03:15.520> is

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
reason is that the language barrier is

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.340 
reason is that the language barrier is
quite<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.180> huge<00:03:16.420> problem<00:03:16.780> because<00:03:16.810> when<00:03:17.260> you

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
quite a huge problem because when you

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.500 
quite a huge problem because when you
sit<00:03:17.530> over<00:03:17.770> there<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:18.970> try

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
sit over there and you have to like try

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.910 
sit over there and you have to like try
to<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.780> into<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.140> game<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.650> have<00:03:20.800> to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
to get into the game so you have to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.800 
to get into the game so you have to
entertain<00:03:21.160> your<00:03:21.880> viewers<00:03:22.240> at<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.480> same<00:03:22.630> time
