interesting study firstly start off I'm
using<00:00:56.420> approach<00:00:57.420> notes<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.940> these<00:01:00.210> notes<00:01:00.480> may

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
using approach notes so these notes may

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
approach notes after that he goes to a

approach notes after that he goes to a
major<00:01:17.159> arpeggio<00:01:21.619> now<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.040> far<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.520> two

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
major arpeggio now so far we have two

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.580 
major arpeggio now so far we have two
things<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:27.439> after<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.650> part<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:31.200> goes<00:01:31.409> back

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
things and after that part it goes back

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.160 
things and after that part it goes back
into<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.950> bebop<00:01:32.340> style<00:01:32.790> line<00:01:38.780> starts<00:01:39.780> off<00:01:39.900> under

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
into a bebop style line starts off under

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.420 
into a bebop style line starts off under
9<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.630> flat<00:01:42.899> 9<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.350> actually<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.950> passing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
9 so flat 9 is actually just a passing

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.300

very<00:02:04.920> harris<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.790> material<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.200> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
very harris this material and if you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.529 
very harris this material and if you
start<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> 9<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.509> have

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
start on the 9 you have to do you have

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.660 
start on the 9 you have to do you have
to<00:02:09.780> start<00:02:10.080> lying<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.619> court<00:02:10.979> torn<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.550> have

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
to start lying on court torn so you have

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.390 
to start lying on court torn so you have
the<00:02:11.760> 9<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.510> use<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.750> passing

you<00:02:46.040> can<00:02:46.220> also<00:02:46.340> think<00:02:46.579> of<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.849> as<00:02:46.940> an<00:02:47.209> e<00:02:47.540> 9

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
you can also think of it as an e 9

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.830 
you can also think of it as an e 9
without<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.250> root<00:02:50.680> spelling<00:02:51.680> under<00:02:51.889> 9<00:02:52.840> and

without the root spelling under 9 and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:02.289 
without the root spelling under 9 and
then<00:02:55.810> another<00:02:56.810> arpeggio<00:02:57.230> 7<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.030> what

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
then another arpeggio 7 and this is what

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.149 
then another arpeggio 7 and this is what
makes<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.780> feel<00:03:03.200> like<00:03:03.349> a<00:03:03.409> tell<00:03:03.709> Farlow

our<00:03:16.459> page<00:03:17.090> use<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.629> shift<00:03:18.379> positions<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:20.000> I

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
our page use that shift positions so I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.199 
our page use that shift positions so I
started<00:03:20.419> out<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.660> line<00:03:20.810> here<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.819> now<00:03:25.819> I'm<00:03:26.030> in

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
started out the line here and now I'm in

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.930 
started out the line here and now I'm in
this<00:03:26.840> next<00:03:27.079> position<00:03:27.290> which<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:27.980> closer<00:03:28.790> to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
this next position which is closer to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.159 
this next position which is closer to
this<00:03:29.290> voicing<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.379> v7<00:03:30.889> and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:32.299> I<00:03:32.510> move<00:03:32.780> again

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
this voicing of v7 and then I move again

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.879 
this voicing of v7 and then I move again
to<00:03:34.129> a<00:03:34.159> higher<00:03:34.519> position<00:03:34.760> after<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.829> you

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
to a higher position after that so you

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:44.140 
to a higher position after that so you
have<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:42.019> it's<00:03:42.139> really<00:03:42.349> two<00:03:42.590> positions<00:03:43.120> with<00:03:44.120> a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
have so it's really two positions with a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.680 
have so it's really two positions with a
little<00:03:44.449> shift<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.280> then<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.310> go<00:03:46.699> to<00:03:46.729> this<00:03:47.209> one<00:03:47.269> I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
little shift and then I go to this one I

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.990 
little shift and then I go to this one I
start<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.139> start<00:03:48.169> on<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.590> root<00:03:48.919> and<00:03:49.099> another

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
start I start on the root and another

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.960 
start I start on the root and another

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.330 
right after the phrase again this is uh
this<00:05:16.990> is<00:05:17.050> something<00:05:17.560> I've<00:05:17.800> learned<00:05:18.099> I<00:05:18.310> learned

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
this is something I've learned I learned

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.460 
this is something I've learned I learned
from<00:05:18.729> watching<00:05:18.880> yo<00:05:19.270> pass<00:05:19.510> in<00:05:19.840> his<00:05:19.990> videos<00:05:20.320> he

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
from watching yo pass in his videos he

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.159 
from watching yo pass in his videos he

often will pay for play the court right
after<00:05:26.470> that<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:26.770> you<00:05:26.889> can<00:05:27.010> really<00:05:27.160> hear<00:05:27.460> the

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
after that so you can really hear the

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.640 
after that so you can really hear the
line<00:05:27.820> even<00:05:28.210> if<00:05:28.479> no<00:05:28.660> one's<00:05:28.870> accompanying<00:05:29.470> you

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
line even if no one's accompanying you

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.920 
line even if no one's accompanying you
you<00:05:30.190> can<00:05:30.370> still<00:05:30.580> hear<00:05:30.820> how<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.060> free<00:05:31.360> sounds

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
you can still hear how the free sounds

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.640 
you can still hear how the free sounds
like<00:05:32.139> in<00:05:32.800> relation<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.520> harmony<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:35.440> there

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
like in relation to the harmony so there

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.640 
like in relation to the harmony so there
you<00:05:35.740> have<00:05:35.800> it<00:05:36.330> it's<00:05:37.330> a<00:05:37.479> phrase<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:38.080> combines

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
you have it it's a phrase that combines

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.750 
you have it it's a phrase that combines
arpeggios<00:05:39.720> bebop<00:05:40.720> elements<00:05:41.320> and<00:05:41.610> starts<00:05:42.610> in

arpeggios bebop elements and starts in

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.490 
arpeggios bebop elements and starts in
the<00:05:42.849> fifth<00:05:43.060> position<00:05:43.240> here<00:05:43.780> well<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.289> fourth

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
the fifth position here well the fourth

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.000 
the fifth position here well the fourth
position

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
position

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.730

ends<00:05:45.760> up<00:05:45.910> into<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:48.060> nine<00:05:49.060> position<00:05:49.660> and<00:05:49.840> goes

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
ends up into the nine position and goes

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.310 
ends up into the nine position and goes
