well the main problem that I have with
the<00:04:10.360> Hobbit<00:04:10.570> movies<00:04:10.959> right<00:04:11.110> now<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.650> they

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
the Hobbit movies right now is that they

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.220 
the Hobbit movies right now is that they
try<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.070> tie<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:12.760> much<00:04:13.030> of<00:04:13.330> Lord<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.020> Rings

into<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.830> Hobbit<00:04:15.160> movies<00:04:15.520> and<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:16.239> feel<00:04:16.989> as

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
into the Hobbit movies and I feel as

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.599 
into the Hobbit movies and I feel as
though<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.470> Hobbit<00:04:17.859> could<00:04:18.010> be<00:04:18.160> more

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
though the Hobbit could be more

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.400 
though the Hobbit could be more
successful<00:04:18.820> if<00:04:19.329> it<00:04:19.480> was<00:04:19.600> just<00:04:19.780> its<00:04:19.900> own<00:04:20.049> thing

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
successful if it was just its own thing

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.050 
successful if it was just its own thing
and<00:04:20.650> like<00:04:20.769> they're<00:04:20.890> adding<00:04:21.160> all<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.489> these

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
and like they're adding all the these

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.490 
and like they're adding all the these
different<00:04:22.419> aspects<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:23.020> like<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.290> Lord<00:04:23.470> of

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500
