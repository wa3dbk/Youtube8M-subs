but<00:00:00.179> major<00:00:00.450> rounds<00:00:00.930> through<00:00:01.079> these<00:00:01.199> rifles

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
but major rounds through these rifles

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.840 
but major rounds through these rifles
over<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:01.890> years<00:00:02.070> and<00:00:02.190> can't<00:00:02.490> seem<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.760> get

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
over the years and can't seem to get

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.309 
over the years and can't seem to get
enough<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.240> them<00:00:03.360> today<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.659> set<00:00:03.959> up<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.140> few

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
enough of them today I set up a few

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.140 
enough of them today I set up a few
tests<00:00:04.560> for<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.830> iphone<00:00:05.100> 5s<00:00:05.520> before<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:05.970> lines

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
tests for the iphone 5s before it lines

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:55.870 
tests for the iphone 5s before it lines
up<00:00:06.299> with<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.480> 50<00:00:06.779> Cal

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.240 

so<00:00:56.880> the<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:57.600> tests<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.290> iphone<00:00:58.710> 5s

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
so the first two tests on the iphone 5s

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
so the first two tests on the iphone 5s
here<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.790> first<00:01:00.030> round<00:01:00.240> ended<00:01:00.810> up<00:01:00.960> cracking

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
here the first round ended up cracking

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.720 
here the first round ended up cracking
the<00:01:01.410> screen<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.830> second<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.310> it<00:01:02.460> actually

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the screen the second one it actually

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.890 
the screen the second one it actually
did<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:02.880> well<00:01:03.120> face<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
did really well face down on the

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.020 
did really well face down on the
concrete<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.710> realistically<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.610> drop<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
concrete so realistically you drop the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.280 
concrete so realistically you drop the
phone<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> water<00:01:06.690> or<00:01:06.900> something<00:01:07.110> like

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
phone in the water or something like

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.480 
phone in the water or something like
that<00:01:07.350> you're<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.770> grab<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.250> really

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that you're gonna grab it out really

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
that you're gonna grab it out really
fast<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.120> I<00:01:09.150> try<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.690> powered

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
fast so that's what I try to do powered

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.540 
fast so that's what I try to do powered
it<00:01:10.230> down<00:01:10.440> there's<00:01:10.980> a<00:01:11.070> few<00:01:11.250> different<00:01:11.340> things

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
it down there's a few different things

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.580 
it down there's a few different things
that<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.540> alcohol<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that you can do with alcohol and and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.170 
that you can do with alcohol and and
what<00:01:13.800> not<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> try<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> moisture

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
what not to try to get all the moisture

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
what not to try to get all the moisture
out<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> phone<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.729> set
