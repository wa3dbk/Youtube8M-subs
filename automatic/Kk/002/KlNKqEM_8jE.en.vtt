00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
pretty excited for because of the GPU

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.120 
pretty excited for because of the GPU
acceleration<00:00:07.939> I<00:00:08.300> just<00:00:08.810> wanted<00:00:09.020> to<00:00:09.110> share<00:00:09.320> what

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
acceleration I just wanted to share what

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.680 
acceleration I just wanted to share what
I<00:00:10.160> found<00:00:10.430> with<00:00:10.640> everybody<00:00:11.030> cuz<00:00:11.210> I<00:00:11.300> ran<00:00:11.510> some

I found with everybody cuz I ran some

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.860 
I found with everybody cuz I ran some
tests<00:00:12.140> so<00:00:12.970> I'm<00:00:13.970> just<00:00:14.150> gonna<00:00:14.240> basically<00:00:14.480> go

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
tests so I'm just gonna basically go

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.540 
tests so I'm just gonna basically go
down<00:00:15.050> and<00:00:15.470> show<00:00:15.710> you<00:00:15.740> show<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.070> what<00:00:16.250> I<00:00:16.279> did

anyways Vegas 11 has an option we've got

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.159 
anyways Vegas 11 has an option we've got
preferences<00:00:25.550> here<00:00:25.820> then<00:00:26.329> we<00:00:26.449> go<00:00:26.569> into<00:00:26.779> video

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
preferences here then we go into video

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.040 
preferences here then we go into video

for video processing currently I'm
running<00:00:33.700> one<00:00:34.700> of<00:00:34.730> my<00:00:34.880> GT<00:00:35.210> X's<00:00:35.630> in<00:00:35.810> there<00:00:35.990> I

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
running one of my GT X's in there I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.710 
running one of my GT X's in there I
don't<00:00:37.460> know<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:37.910> it<00:00:38.030> has<00:00:38.060> the<00:00:38.360> option

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
don't know that it has the option

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.360 
don't know that it has the option
because<00:00:38.870> I'm<00:00:39.020> currently<00:00:39.320> running<00:00:39.590> two<00:00:39.860> GTX

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370

560 s in sli I'm not 100% sure if you're

560 s in sli I'm not 100% sure if you're
able<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.540> do<00:00:44.810> that<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.170> SLI<00:00:45.710> or<00:00:45.740> not<00:00:46.010> I<00:00:46.040> think

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
able to do that in SLI or not I think

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.770 
able to do that in SLI or not I think
you<00:00:46.430> only<00:00:46.760> you're<00:00:46.940> only<00:00:47.030> looking<00:00:47.210> at<00:00:47.540> one<00:00:47.750> of

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
you only you're only looking at one of

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.920 
you only you're only looking at one of
them<00:00:48.940> but<00:00:49.940> I<00:00:49.970> haven't<00:00:50.240> I<00:00:50.510> haven't<00:00:50.660> had<00:00:50.810> an

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
them but I haven't I haven't had an

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.190 
them but I haven't I haven't had an
opportunity<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.470> get<00:00:52.310> my<00:00:52.490> hardware<00:00:53.240> monitors

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
opportunity to get my hardware monitors

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.800 
opportunity to get my hardware monitors
out<00:00:54.470> enough<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:54.920> test<00:00:55.880> it<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:56.360> point<00:00:56.630> yet

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
out enough to test it to that point yet

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.910 
out enough to test it to that point yet
but<00:00:57.800> what<00:00:58.520> I<00:00:58.550> did<00:00:58.850> do<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.450> I<00:01:00.230> ran<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.500> simple

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
but what I did do is I ran a simple

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.560 
but what I did do is I ran a simple
rendering<00:01:01.070> test<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:01.820> I<00:01:01.880> had<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:02.090> old<00:01:02.270> video

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
rendering test so I had this old video

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.850 
rendering test so I had this old video
that<00:01:03.200> was<00:01:03.710> run<00:01:04.400> shot<00:01:04.879> originally<00:01:05.630> in<00:01:05.860> Canon

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
that was run shot originally in Canon

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.970 
that was run shot originally in Canon
t2i<00:01:07.060> 1920<00:01:08.060> by<00:01:08.180> 1080<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.170> minute<00:01:09.620> and<00:01:09.710> 42

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
t2i 1920 by 1080 it's a minute and 42

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.360 
t2i 1920 by 1080 it's a minute and 42
seconds<00:01:10.400> long<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:12.710> what<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:12.890> did<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.340> just

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
seconds long and so what I did is I just

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.040 
seconds long and so what I did is I just
rendered<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:13.909> into<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.659> few<00:01:15.020> different

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
rendered this into a few different

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.870 
rendered this into a few different
format<00:01:15.680> or<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.920> couple<00:01:16.220> different<00:01:16.490> formats

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
format or a couple different formats

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.730 
format or a couple different formats
might<00:01:17.330> might<00:01:17.659> test<00:01:17.990> formats<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.440> I'm<00:01:18.560> using

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
might might test formats that I'm using

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.469 
might might test formats that I'm using
are<00:01:18.979> mp4<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:21.490> WMV<00:01:22.490> those<00:01:23.030> are<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.210> ones<00:01:23.390> that

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
are mp4 and WMV those are the ones that

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.690 
are mp4 and WMV those are the ones that
I<00:01:23.540> used<00:01:23.780> most<00:01:23.960> commonly<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.770> thus<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.580> way<00:01:25.670> I

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
I used most commonly and thus the way I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.850 
I used most commonly and thus the way I
did<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.360> have<00:01:26.659> no<00:01:26.840> scientific<00:01:27.470> method<00:01:27.830> for

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
did it I have no scientific method for

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.880 
did it I have no scientific method for
choosing<00:01:28.190> those<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.150> if<00:01:30.049> you're<00:01:30.530> complaining

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
choosing those so if you're complaining

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.520 
choosing those so if you're complaining
about<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.460> file<00:01:31.760> types<00:01:32.060> get<00:01:32.870> over<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.229> that's

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
about the file types get over it that's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.090 
about the file types get over it that's
you<00:01:34.040> know<00:01:34.159> it<00:01:34.420> post<00:01:35.420> your<00:01:35.690> video<00:01:35.990> in<00:01:36.799> the

ones I use most commonly so anyways my
baseline<00:01:48.229> here<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.619> Vegas<00:01:49.250> 9<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.900> start<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.409> did

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
baseline here is Vegas 9 to start I did

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.210 
baseline here is Vegas 9 to start I did
switch<00:01:52.130> from<00:01:52.340> Vegas<00:01:52.610> 9<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:52.940> 11<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.420> did<00:01:53.570> skip<00:01:53.780> 10

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
switch from Vegas 9 to 11 I did skip 10

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.120 
switch from Vegas 9 to 11 I did skip 10
so<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.250> kind<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:56.080> there's<00:01:57.080> not<00:01:57.290> much<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.799> curve

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
so I kind of there's not much of a curve

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.789 
so I kind of there's not much of a curve
I<00:01:58.280> can't<00:01:58.700> see<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:59.119> saw<00:02:00.049> there's<00:02:00.260> a<00:02:00.350> few<00:02:00.560> things

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
I can't see I saw there's a few things

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.530 
I can't see I saw there's a few things
in<00:02:00.950> 10<00:02:01.220> but<00:02:01.400> it<00:02:01.460> just<00:02:01.610> was<00:02:01.790> never<00:02:01.939> enticing

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
in 10 but it just was never enticing

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.620 
in 10 but it just was never enticing
enough<00:02:02.750> for<00:02:02.900> me<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.080> upgrade<00:02:03.820> Vegas<00:02:04.820> 11<00:02:05.420> on<00:02:05.510> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
enough for me to upgrade Vegas 11 on the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.370 
enough for me to upgrade Vegas 11 on the
other<00:02:05.780> hand<00:02:06.049> has<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.650> lot<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.280> lot<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.670> features

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
other hand has a lot a lot of features

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.779 
other hand has a lot a lot of features
and<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.560> came<00:02:09.740> with<00:02:09.800> some<00:02:09.979> really<00:02:10.340> good<00:02:10.550> deals

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
and it came with some really good deals

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.010 
and it came with some really good deals
and<00:02:11.090> some<00:02:11.209> plugins<00:02:11.660> for<00:02:11.900> free<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.800> it

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
and some plugins for free and it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.770 
and some plugins for free and it
just<00:02:13.200> definitely<00:02:13.950> worth<00:02:14.100> my<00:02:14.280> time<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.780> money

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
just definitely worth my time and money

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.890 
just definitely worth my time and money
so<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> picked<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.980> up<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.550> thus<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.360> video<00:02:18.630> so

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
so I picked it up and thus this video so

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.300 
so I picked it up and thus this video so

the result was 8 minutes in 23 seconds

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.090 
the result was 8 minutes in 23 seconds
which<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.490> about<00:02:29.700> what<00:02:29.970> I'd<00:02:30.060> expect<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.800> one

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
which is about what I'd expect this one

result is within seconds of the other

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.420 
result is within seconds of the other
one<00:02:54.720> now<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.290> would<00:02:55.560> also<00:02:55.710> like<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.040> point<00:02:56.250> out

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
one now I would also like to point out

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.860 
one now I would also like to point out
that<00:02:56.490> I<00:02:56.700> did<00:02:56.880> run<00:02:57.030> these<00:02:57.180> tests<00:02:57.600> multiple

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that I did run these tests multiple

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.950 
that I did run these tests multiple
times<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.710> they<00:02:59.280> were<00:02:59.340> within<00:03:00.180> seconds<00:03:00.870> of

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
times and they were within seconds of

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.810 
times and they were within seconds of
each<00:03:01.080> other<00:03:01.290> every<00:03:02.100> single<00:03:02.250> time<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.580> just

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
each other every single time I just

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.290 
each other every single time I just
basically<00:03:03.150> put<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> average<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.960> here<00:03:05.300> so

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
basically put the average in here so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.140 
basically put the average in here so
then<00:03:06.630> next<00:03:07.320> test<00:03:07.680> was<00:03:07.860> an<00:03:08.010> mp4<00:03:08.490> no<00:03:08.700> GPU

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
then next test was an mp4 no GPU

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.290 
then next test was an mp4 no GPU
acceleration<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.920> was<00:03:11.040> 354<00:03:11.820> which<00:03:12.120> is

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
acceleration and it was 354 which is

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.150 
acceleration and it was 354 which is
really<00:03:12.780> close<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.230> 403<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.040> was

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
really close to the 403 that I was

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.210 
really close to the 403 that I was
getting<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.520> Vegas<00:03:14.820> 9<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.840> about<00:03:16.380> again<00:03:16.980> what<00:03:17.190> I

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
getting on Vegas 9 so about again what I

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.890 
getting on Vegas 9 so about again what I
would<00:03:17.310> expect<00:03:17.730> him<00:03:17.850> but<00:03:18.000> at<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.209> point<00:03:18.510> now

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
would expect him but at this point now

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.630 
would expect him but at this point now
is<00:03:18.959> where<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:19.470> start<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.830> curveball<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.520> we're

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
is where we start the curveball so we're

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.350 
is where we start the curveball so we're
checking<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> GPU<00:03:21.480> acceleration<00:03:23.360> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
checking out the GPU acceleration the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.100 
checking out the GPU acceleration the
first<00:03:24.630> test

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
first test

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.320 
first test
WMV<00:03:25.890> with<00:03:26.250> GPU<00:03:26.580> enabled<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:28.820> wow<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.850> got<00:03:30.209> to

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
WMV with GPU enabled and wow I got to

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.810 
WMV with GPU enabled and wow I got to
tell<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.600> uh<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:31.500> was<00:03:31.770> kind<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.250> not

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
tell you uh this was kind of not

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.430 
tell you uh this was kind of not
expected<00:03:33.450> but<00:03:33.630> it's<00:03:34.280> slower<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.870> took<00:03:37.140> 12

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
expected but it's slower it took 12

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.170 
expected but it's slower it took 12
minutes<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.860> 40<00:03:38.130> seconds<00:03:38.490> for<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.730> same<00:03:38.910> file

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
minutes and 40 seconds for the same file

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.260 
minutes and 40 seconds for the same file
that<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.480> took<00:03:39.600> 817<00:03:40.380> on<00:03:40.670> with<00:03:41.670> no<00:03:41.850> GPU

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
that it took 817 on with no GPU

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.449 
that it took 817 on with no GPU
acceleration<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.890> took<00:03:44.040> 823<00:03:45.030> with<00:03:46.459> Vegas

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
acceleration and it took 823 with Vegas

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.500 
acceleration and it took 823 with Vegas
9<00:03:47.959> same<00:03:48.959> same<00:03:49.410> file<00:03:49.680> format<00:03:49.709> everything<00:03:50.580> now
