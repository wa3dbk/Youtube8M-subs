00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.629 

I<00:00:06.140> kinda<00:00:07.140> was<00:00:07.290> head<00:00:07.470> home<00:00:07.680> gardeners<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.370> mind

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
I kinda was head home gardeners in mind

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.669 
I kinda was head home gardeners in mind
when<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.000> set<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.420> up<00:00:11.809> although<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.290> wasn't

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
when I set this up although it I wasn't

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.289 
when I set this up although it I wasn't
trying<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.070> be<00:00:14.219> everything<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.670> everyone<00:00:14.969> but

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
trying to be everything to everyone but

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.310 
trying to be everything to everyone but
it<00:00:15.420> turns<00:00:15.599> out<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.139> good<00:00:16.289> for

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
it turns out that it's good for

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.620 
it turns out that it's good for
professionals<00:00:17.010> too<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.449> did

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
professionals too like I was a I did

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.210 
professionals too like I was a I did
professional<00:00:19.109> landscaping<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.710> ten<00:00:19.920> years

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
professional landscaping for ten years

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.370 
professional landscaping for ten years
before<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.640> knew<00:00:20.880> most<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.449> stuff<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.140> I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
before I knew most of this stuff and I

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.099 
before I knew most of this stuff and I
sure<00:00:22.680> wish<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.369> had<00:00:23.789> known<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.330> earlier<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:25.050> I

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
sure wish I had known it earlier as I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.240 
sure wish I had known it earlier as I
would<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.590> done<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> lot<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.070> things

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
would have done a lot of things

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.519 
would have done a lot of things
differently<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.510> ends<00:00:27.779> up<00:00:27.810> being<00:00:28.050> pretty

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
differently so it ends up being pretty

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.050 
differently so it ends up being pretty
good<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:28.949> professionals<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> kind<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.910> had

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
good for professionals but I kind of had

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.400 
good for professionals but I kind of had
home<00:00:30.240> gardeners<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.779> mind<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.199> certainly

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
home gardeners in mind and I certainly

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.950 
home gardeners in mind and I certainly
do<00:00:31.679> start<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> basics<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> Academy

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
do start with the basics in the Academy

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.870 
do start with the basics in the Academy
I<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.649> little<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:35.010> advanced<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.610> some

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
I get a little bit advanced on some

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
I get a little bit advanced on some
stuff<00:00:36.090> though<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.410> into<00:00:37.590> some

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
stuff though and I do get into some

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.610 
stuff though and I do get into some
science<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.610> all<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.210> know<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.020> want<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
science but all you know all I want to

science but all you know all I want to
do<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> science<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.550> show<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.760> why

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
do the science so I can show you why

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.000 
do the science so I can show you why
we're<00:00:42.360> doing<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.719> we're<00:00:42.870> doing<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
we're doing what we're doing so really I

we're doing what we're doing so really I
try<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.670> practical<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
try to be really practical now here is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.680 
try to be really practical now here is
my<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.100> lime<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.700> talked<00:00:48.480> about

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
my little bit of my lime I talked about

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
my little bit of my lime I talked about
how<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> lime<00:00:49.170> has<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> come<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:50.399> not

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
how the lime has to come in I'm not

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.549 
how the lime has to come in I'm not
going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> use<00:00:50.879> all<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
going to use all this just a just a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.549 
going to use all this just a just a
touch<00:00:53.750> just<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.289> bit<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
touch just to get a little bit of that

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:09.300 
touch just to get a little bit of that
calcium<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.340> there

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.430

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
there's my cousin and a little bit of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:37.870 
there's my cousin and a little bit of
rock<00:01:15.560> dust<00:01:15.590> here<00:01:32.950> that's<00:01:33.950> good<00:01:34.160> for<00:01:34.340> now<00:01:36.880> and

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
rock dust here that's good for now and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.690 
rock dust here that's good for now and
now<00:01:38.300> I'm<00:01:38.450> going<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:41.800> at<00:01:42.800> least<00:01:42.980> single<00:01:43.490> dig

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
now I'm going to at least single dig

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.220 
now I'm going to at least single dig
this<00:01:43.940> in<00:01:45.610> with<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.640> fork<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.300> know<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:47.960> useful

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
this in with a fork you know so useful

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.410 
this in with a fork you know so useful
to<00:01:48.410> have<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.620> fork<00:01:48.980> I<00:01:49.250> have<00:01:49.820> different<00:01:50.120> kinds

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
to have a fork I have different kinds

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.250 
to have a fork I have different kinds
this<00:01:50.780> one<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.110> happened<00:01:51.410> to<00:01:51.470> be<00:01:51.560> close<00:01:51.710> by

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
this one just happened to be close by

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.469 
this one just happened to be close by
and<00:01:54.260> I'm<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:54.860> gonna<00:01:55.000> single<00:01:56.000> dig<00:01:56.150> it<00:01:56.270> in<00:01:56.360> I

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
and I'm just gonna single dig it in I

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.760 
and I'm just gonna single dig it in I
think<00:01:56.510> I'll<00:01:56.780> double<00:01:57.050> dig<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.290> in<00:01:57.380> when<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.590> turn

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
think I'll double dig it in when I turn

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.480 
think I'll double dig it in when I turn
the<00:01:57.890> camera<00:01:58.220> off<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:03.500> I'll<00:02:03.800> do<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.280> all

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
the camera off so I'll do this all

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.710 
the camera off so I'll do this all
off-camera<00:02:05.000> but<00:02:05.120> I<00:02:05.240> really<00:02:05.510> want<00:02:05.660> to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
off-camera but I really want to

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.320 
off-camera but I really want to
incorporate<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.890> compost<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.760> rock<00:02:08.030> dust

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
incorporate that compost that rock dust

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.810 
incorporate that compost that rock dust
that<00:02:08.540> lime<00:02:08.750> right<00:02:09.170> in<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.740> top<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.700> know

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
that lime right in to the top you know

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.729 
that lime right in to the top you know
at<00:02:10.940> least<00:02:11.180> twelve<00:02:11.480> inches<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.810> soil<00:02:12.110> probably

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
at least twelve inches of soil probably

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.430 
at least twelve inches of soil probably
deeper<00:02:13.100> if<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.880> double<00:02:14.180> dig<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.600> then<00:02:15.290> I'm

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
deeper if I double dig and then I'm

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.750 
deeper if I double dig and then I'm
going<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.590> come<00:02:15.800> back<00:02:15.920> around<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.400> put<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.610> good

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
going to come back around and put a good

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.940 
going to come back around and put a good
edge<00:02:17.000> on<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.630> again<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.230> I'll<00:02:18.709> show<00:02:18.920> you

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
edge on this again and I'll show you

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.920 
edge on this again and I'll show you
that<00:02:19.220> when<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:19.700> done<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:20.390> can<00:02:20.540> go<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.690> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
that when it's done so we can go to the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.250 
that when it's done so we can go to the
final<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:22.550> final<00:02:22.880> step<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.690> I'll<00:02:24.020> be<00:02:24.170> right

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
final the final step so I'll be right

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.240 
final the final step so I'll be right
back<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> can<00:02:26.209> see<00:02:26.480> I've<00:02:26.720> incorporated<00:02:27.650> my

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
back so you can see I've incorporated my
