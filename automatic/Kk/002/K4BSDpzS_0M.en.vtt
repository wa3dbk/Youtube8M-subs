00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.380
 is everyone is saying that 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.910
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.070
 new glitch video on our time 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.869
 to somehow to get on the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.219
 interpack roof so first of all you 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.719
 you have to open the door on 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:33.820
 which I'm going to skip that you're going 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.620
 to do a strap job or a normal man 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.760
 so I recommend a strap job but 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.409
 I think the stiffest people who 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.579
 know how to do it so this blick is 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.930
 really very simple to achieve which 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.000
 you started doing the job 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.559
 arrived on the door you jumped on 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.850
 the roof and there it will be more difficult 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.170
 with that does not have to move very slowly and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.609
 how do you place in the video a 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.010
 once you are on the roof you 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.719
 are going to make a century to the right have 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.910
 somewhere a semicircle 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.199
 and you will run to the right and from 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.019
 that you sort of get to the 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.300
 half of the roof you're going to jump for 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.910
 land on the carcass of the car 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.050
 and to finally be quiet against 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.720
 said barria because the only 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.610
 really all around the roof we will 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.530
 do well like in the video if you 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.380
 have seen his guitar badly or put in 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.200
 before and as powers there I 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.490
 jumped on a rock so get on the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.829
 car carcass you just have to 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.390
 jump and you crouch down to get 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.630
 this barrier of invincibility 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.280
 so it will be hired so got here 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.110
 the enemy are attracted to you and you 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.329
 can be non-invasive way is 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.700
 quiet and I want to show others 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.140
 barriers in the video so I want 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.780
 a Republic life patch buyers 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.670
 because somehow we could 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.460
 do with a physio fringe on the house 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.930
 which is open and we were all 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.789
 time of the house and everything but it was 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.560
 not kill by screaming name very quickly 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.590
 paper on ps3 and who walks a body 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.450
 on xbox so this click with radium and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.909
 feasible on both platforms and 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.920
 everything new was found by the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.390
 thighs a very good American friend to me 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.000
 I will definitely describe 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.120
 to congratulate him on this magnificent me 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.940
 really makes a lot of fun because 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.940
 do not hurt we appreciate more than anything 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.380
 and with the glitch it's really superb 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.800
 so for all people 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.140
 only use glitches 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.210
 sagnol the community of people do not think 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.870
 not that treyarch and designers of 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.180
 games do not find the geeks to themselves 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.820
 so it is certain that thanks to us they 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.440
 can or rather thanks to youtube thanks 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.200
 at the beach hours they can patches 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 and for the game to make itself better and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.940
 be cleaner 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.740
 and then 2.9 with monks blick then 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.900
 stop thinking necessarily known to the 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.730
 community makes that we put videos 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.460
 on youtube click what we find this 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.380
 let's raise the rates for maybe 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.910
 improve the game to make it more 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.620
 clean and for that least blick 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.180
 but maybe that's why for 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.320
 that triumph patches even if we 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.990
 it hurts us when writing 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.550
 yesterday klepatch 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.740
 since we're struggling she's found and 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.390
 it may be heartbreaking but 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.590
 in a way because we make 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.330
 glyphs on youtube we're bad 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.040
 maybe we put the videos on 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.810
 youtube for coterie yesterday that patches 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.340
 and for the game to be better so 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.790
 stop it we know that inevitably 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.990
 glitchs and hurt so I had I'm going 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.900
 to do because everyone says 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.820
 that glitch is bad and it hurts 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.230
 the community not at all so we have 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.660
 put on youtube maybe so that 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.460
 sorting the patches and appreciated the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.660
 people use it to make 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.820
 machines finished it's their problems 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.260
 if they want to be banned it's their 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.900
