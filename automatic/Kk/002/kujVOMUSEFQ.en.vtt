00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.290
 White Animal Control Officer 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.720
 Children shout 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.549
 This is what kind of animal control officers should do 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.399
 If you think this is what I should be doing around I mean if you 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.700
 There are like wild animals in front of kids who are crazy 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.240
 Beyond the fact that this is uh ... I think it all to sell to Landon who is 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.950
 Ohio Executive Director and PC News Sun said that 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.670
 Home Request Help Call the police for help because of this uh ... 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.529
 Litter from the cats that showed the exit 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.879
 In front of some children right and cats were clearly dated not going 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.340
 On what they say hey watch animals call let's make perfect sense 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.150
 So but that is all according to the CEO of Ohio PC 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.050
 Showed up and officers 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.360
 Who can beat the person who called the bill assumes that the officer would be like 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.180
 Trapping cats in their relocation to the shelter if they need to be humane 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.820
 They died slowly because they did not adopt 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 It will be done in a proper manner that it will not only be good when you know who 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.510
 Shot in the base 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 Instead of the accused officers about to hit 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.660
 Getting a gun that supposedly the owner of the house was just a calming gun for the nerves 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.210
 Walking to the back of the house and just started to shoot and kill 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.080
 Eight and a week old cat 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.870
 We were kids so the stairs under the window began to scream and cry because 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.790
 They look down at what the police officer is doing 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.650
 Wah ... I did it and that's all that happened now is the police department 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.959
 Do not deny that they say it and that is what happened 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.189
 This was the right thing for Northridge Bill Mike Police Department Commander 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.130
 free 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.720
 Put out the statement of defense of the police officer's agreement officer 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.500
 Who called Ohio as the eight PC to be released and charged with animal abuse 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.659
 A statement from the police is held by them to fall inside the wood pile and 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.740
 The euthanasia cats were removed from the wood pile and taken from 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.360
 He said that accommodation according to procedures was appropriate 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.090
 And not taking any disciplinary measures for the incident are about to be imposed 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.310
 He did not make any mistake 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.110
 The cats were shot with a gun instead of being taken to the shelter and did 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.850
 You have to know that right in front of him and he did that right in 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.300
 In front of the children shot the cats in front of the children and it seemed like it was 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.969
 So no one gave any warning that he was a citizen 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.510
 Money firearm offered him there 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.989
 I mean cats really did not do anything wrong anything right 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.580
 Cats are violent they do not have to be born 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.600
 They were carrying a bowling game they did not have the least was that they were not wearing 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.240
 Hoodies are certainly something that justifies shooting means I do not 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.779
 Even like a captain 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.399
 I would be horrified 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.779
 I mean I can only assume that this is the person who 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:37.560
 Gets off 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.149
 To kill 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.469
 Animals There is someone who looks like this, if you are one of these people 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.379
 This is the work that you are trying to get 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.769
 If average 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.299
 A dozen cat cats in her backyard said he would not be facing a number 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.699
 MTV of the cruelty charges on the animal unless you can really say Hey listen this 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.529
 The cats were all suffering that they were all about to die because the piano fell on 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.809
 Them uh ... there and it would be illegal it would be legal but so far no cop 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.979
 Nothing is wrong about the stories I believe I have not found 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.819
 The reality of this is that the situation is fine nap 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.609
