dr. Mann is Jeff and Wilbur Budd room in
the<00:00:02.340> south<00:00:02.550> now<00:00:02.730> I'm<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.090> show<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.300> how

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
the south now I'm going to show you how

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.280 
the south now I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.659> control<00:00:04.259> nutgrass<00:00:05.150> also<00:00:06.150> known<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.720> not

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
to control nutgrass also known is not

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.030 
to control nutgrass also known is not
such<00:00:07.740> one<00:00:08.580> thing<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.970> were<00:00:09.120> inspired<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.590> do<00:00:10.769> is

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
such one thing I were inspired to do is

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.430 
such one thing I were inspired to do is
not<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.460> lose<00:00:11.639> any<00:00:12.000> sleep<00:00:12.150> over<00:00:12.450> nutgrass<00:00:13.049> if

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
not to lose any sleep over nutgrass if

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.289 
not to lose any sleep over nutgrass if
you<00:00:13.530> find<00:00:13.799> me<00:00:13.980> nut<00:00:14.190> grass<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.730> your<00:00:14.759> garden

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
you find me nut grass in your garden

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.359 
you find me nut grass in your garden
don't<00:00:15.870> even<00:00:16.199> give<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.560> second<00:00:16.920> thought

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
don't even give it a second thought

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.849 
don't even give it a second thought
so<00:00:17.940> more<00:00:18.270> strategy<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:19.050> controlling<00:00:19.470> nut

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
so more strategy for controlling nut

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.230 
so more strategy for controlling nut
grass<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.300> grow<00:00:21.510> potatoes<00:00:22.580> so<00:00:23.580> I'll<00:00:23.789> say<00:00:24.000> it

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
grass is to grow potatoes so I'll say it

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.960 
grass is to grow potatoes so I'll say it
here<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.900> go<00:00:25.109> about<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.619> time<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.130> us<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.760> grow

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
here you go about it time for us to grow

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.109 
here you go about it time for us to grow
potatoes<00:00:27.150> right<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.640> we've<00:00:29.970> had<00:00:30.000> a

and put them in a bucket or something so
where<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.829> we<00:01:28.829> give<00:01:29.579> our<00:01:29.729> trench<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
where it is we give our trench you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.749 
where it is we give our trench you
smooth<00:01:32.340> your<00:01:32.369> soil<00:01:32.729> back<00:01:33.200> both<00:01:34.200> sides<00:01:34.759> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
smooth your soil back both sides and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.010 
smooth your soil back both sides and
then<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.770> plant<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:37.950> potatoes<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
then you plant your potatoes in that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
then you plant your potatoes in that
valley<00:01:41.299> right<00:01:42.829> yet<00:01:43.829> potato<00:01:44.250> comes<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
valley right yet potato comes up to a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.530 
valley right yet potato comes up to a
bear<00:01:45.899> grows<00:01:46.290> about<00:01:46.649> 8<00:01:46.860> inches<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:48.299> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
bear grows about 8 inches and then you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
bear grows about 8 inches and then you
healed<00:01:49.380> up<00:01:49.590> again<00:01:49.920> say<00:01:50.820> yeah<00:01:51.680> leave<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.860> soil

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
healed up again say yeah leave your soil

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.399 
healed up again say yeah leave your soil
across<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.000> you're<00:01:54.119> gonna<00:01:54.270> instead<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
across and you're gonna instead of that

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.170 
across and you're gonna instead of that
being<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.890> valley<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.509> turn<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.689> into<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.930> hill

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
being a valley you turn it into a hill

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
being a valley you turn it into a hill
so<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.360> same<00:02:00.600> thing<00:02:00.869> goes<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.500> every<00:02:01.740> time

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
so the same thing goes there every time

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.459 
so the same thing goes there every time
you<00:02:02.310> move<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.759> soil<00:02:03.000> across<00:02:03.469> you're

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you move your soil across you're

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.650 
you move your soil across you're
exposing<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> grass

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
exposing more on that grass

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.070 
exposing more on that grass
so<00:02:07.660> instead<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:09.190> know<00:02:09.280> every<00:02:09.670> time<00:02:10.080> you're

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
so instead of you know every time you're

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
so instead of you know every time you're
removing<00:02:11.470> nutgrass

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
removing nutgrass

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.850 
removing nutgrass
the<00:02:12.670> exercise<00:02:13.210> isn't<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.080> remove<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.650> nut

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the exercise isn't to remove the nut

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.550 
the exercise isn't to remove the nut
grass<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:16.180> exercise<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:16.990> grow<00:02:17.320> potatoes

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
grass the exercise is to grow potatoes

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.490 
grass the exercise is to grow potatoes
