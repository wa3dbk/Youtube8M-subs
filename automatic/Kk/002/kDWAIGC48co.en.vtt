the<00:01:36.389> reason<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.020> brush<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.409> twofold<00:01:38.009> one

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
the reason for the brush is twofold one

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.090 
the reason for the brush is twofold one
that<00:01:38.819> a<00:01:38.850> backpacker<00:01:39.389> or<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> local<00:01:40.049> junior<00:01:40.409> can

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that a backpacker or a local junior can

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.800 
that a backpacker or a local junior can
do<00:01:41.249> ground<00:01:41.549> work<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.539> see

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
do ground work with it so you can see

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:54.170 
do ground work with it so you can see
here

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180 

and<00:01:55.180> that's<00:01:55.420> that's<00:01:56.020> one<00:01:56.470> window<00:01:56.830> down<00:01:57.010> now<00:01:57.159> I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
and that's that's one window down now I

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.350 
and that's that's one window down now I
know<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.460> can<00:01:57.670> do<00:01:57.760> it<00:01:57.850> faster<00:01:58.180> than<00:01:58.299> the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
know you can do it faster than the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.090 
know you can do it faster than the
squeegee<00:01:58.750> but<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.560> can<00:01:59.710> have<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.890> backpack
