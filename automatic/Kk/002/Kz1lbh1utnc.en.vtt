and I've got a spinner on my team but

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.750 
and I've got a spinner on my team but
his<00:01:03.780> team<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.409> extremely<00:01:04.979> aggressive<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.700> I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
his team is extremely aggressive and I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.190 
his team is extremely aggressive and I
didn't<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.080> an<00:01:07.200> opening<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:09.200> had

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
didn't really have an opening so I had

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.969 
didn't really have an opening so I had
to<00:01:10.229> switch<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.500> meant<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.070> drapion<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.979> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
to switch I meant to my drapion and I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
to switch I meant to my drapion and I
scare<00:01:14.580> him<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.790> probably<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
scare him out probably because I'm a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.399 
scare him out probably because I'm a
defensive<00:01:16.619> war<00:01:17.509> but<00:01:18.509> he<00:01:18.990> goes<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:19.320> his

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
defensive war but he goes into his

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.320 
defensive war but he goes into his
heatran<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.220> raw<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.909> heat<00:01:21.060> trend

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
heatran and I just raw the heat trend

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.039 
heatran and I just raw the heat trend
back<00:01:21.600> into<00:01:22.020> gyarados<00:01:22.710> anyway<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.930> we're<00:01:24.930> back

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
back into gyarados anyway so we're back

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
back into gyarados anyway so we're back
where<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.290> started<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:27.890> after<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.159> didn't

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
where we started and after this I didn't

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.679 
where we started and after this I didn't
really<00:01:30.119> see<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.900> taunt<00:01:31.170> coming<00:01:31.619> because<00:01:32.040> he

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
really see the taunt coming because he

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.149 
really see the taunt coming because he
switched<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.840> first<00:01:34.110> time<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
switched out the first time and I

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.770 
switched out the first time and I
thought<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> might<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.759> been<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.060> all

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
thought it might have just been like all

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.569 
thought it might have just been like all
offensive<00:01:37.320> moves<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.710> DD<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:41.070> after<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.460> I

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
offensive moves in DD but after that I

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.340 
offensive moves in DD but after that I
had<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.060> chat<00:01:42.240> into<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.540> mullet<00:01:42.840> dress<00:01:42.960> because

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
had to chat into my mullet dress because

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.719 
had to chat into my mullet dress because
it's<00:01:43.470> pretty<00:01:43.649> much<00:01:43.770> useless<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.369> point

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it's pretty much useless at this point

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.749 
it's pretty much useless at this point
there's<00:01:45.090> rocks<00:01:45.299> up<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:47.100> can't<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.520> get

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
there's rocks up and I can't really get

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.350 
there's rocks up and I can't really get
in<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> safe<00:01:48.119> spin<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:50.970> gonna<00:01:51.119> let<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
in a safe spin so I'm just gonna let it

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.819 
in a safe spin so I'm just gonna let it
die<00:01:52.850> after<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> guess<00:01:54.360> save<00:01:55.110> switch<00:01:55.409> back

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
die after that I guess save switch back

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
die after that I guess save switch back
into<00:01:56.460> my<00:01:56.700> drop<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.360> who<00:01:59.450> can<00:02:00.450> take<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.899> on

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
into my drop here on who can take it on

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.590 
into my drop here on who can take it on
one<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.820> doesn't<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.149> earthquake

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
one on one if it doesn't have earthquake

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.209 
one on one if it doesn't have earthquake
and<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.990> does<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.500> quick<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:05.009> got

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
and if it does have a quick I have got

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.320 
and if it does have a quick I have got
something<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> after<00:02:06.119> that

so<00:02:59.040> he<00:02:59.160> goes<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.520> substitute<00:02:59.940> maybe<00:03:00.330> he

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
so he goes for substitute maybe he

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.140 
so he goes for substitute maybe he
expected<00:03:00.810> me<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.990> switch<00:03:01.310> like<00:03:02.310> fearing<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
expected me to switch like fearing the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.949 
expected me to switch like fearing the
eq<00:03:03.570> maybe<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:05.180> he<00:03:06.180> goes<00:03:06.330> for<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.540> dark<00:03:06.720> post

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
maybe it's going to be switched with eq

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.280 
maybe it's going to be switched with eq
again<00:03:08.670> either<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.600> oh<00:03:09.720> that's<00:03:09.990> his<00:03:10.110> only

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
technically so I ruined back up into the

up<00:03:17.340> again<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:20.330> I'm<00:03:21.330> thinking<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.410> point

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
up again and I'm thinking this point

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.220 
up again and I'm thinking this point
okay<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.010> low<00:03:23.130> enough<00:03:23.250> health<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:24.230> two

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
countries should be able to take it out

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.470 
countries should be able to take it out
with<00:03:26.970> like<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.570> systems<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.080> sand<00:03:28.320> storm<00:03:29.480> and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
with like the systems of sand storm and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.570 
with like the systems of sand storm and
I<00:03:30.720> expected<00:03:31.230> him<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.500> taunt<00:03:31.769> me<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.160> didn't

unfortunately<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:18.000> Pisces<00:04:18.510> got<00:04:18.750> pursuit<00:04:19.169> so

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
unfortunately this Pisces got pursuit so

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.819 
unfortunately this Pisces got pursuit so
my<00:04:19.590> plan<00:04:19.979> was<00:04:20.220> kind<00:04:20.520> of<00:04:20.640> ruined

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
my plan was kind of ruined

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.350 
my plan was kind of ruined
the<00:04:22.430> whole<00:04:22.610> idea<00:04:22.759> was<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.389> hopefully<00:04:25.360> actually

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
the whole idea was to hopefully actually

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.029 
the whole idea was to hopefully actually
had<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.750> set<00:04:27.050> up<00:04:27.110> in<00:04:27.199> my<00:04:27.289> head<00:04:27.439> it<00:04:27.560> was<00:04:27.590> hopefully

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
had a set up in my head it was hopefully

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.619 
had a set up in my head it was hopefully
going<00:04:28.069> to<00:04:28.250> keep<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.580> tier<00:04:28.879> two<00:04:29.000> more<00:04:29.150> in<00:04:29.389> for

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 
going to keep the tier two more in for

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.170 
going to keep the tier two more in for
one<00:04:29.780> turn<00:04:30.050> which<00:04:30.259> actually<00:04:30.469> did<00:04:30.969> then<00:04:31.969> I<00:04:32.090> was

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
one turn which actually did then I was

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.029 
one turn which actually did then I was
hoping<00:04:32.419> that<00:04:32.479> he'd<00:04:32.659> switch<00:04:32.990> into<00:04:33.229> tita<00:04:33.650> which

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
hoping that he'd switch into tita which

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.390 
hoping that he'd switch into tita which
he<00:04:34.189> didn't<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:35.259> I<00:04:36.259> would<00:04:36.469> sub<00:04:36.680> two<00:04:37.039> layers<00:04:37.250> of

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
he didn't and I would sub two layers of

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.770 
he didn't and I would sub two layers of
spikes<00:04:37.639> and<00:04:38.259> rapid<00:04:39.259> spin<00:04:39.560> but<00:04:40.370> no<00:04:40.729> on<00:04:41.030> the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
spikes and rapid spin but no on the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.189 
spikes and rapid spin but no on the
second<00:04:42.110> turn<00:04:42.259> because<00:04:43.099> he<00:04:43.189> had<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.400> pursuit<00:04:43.849> I

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
second turn because he had the pursuit I

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.439 
second turn because he had the pursuit I
just<00:04:45.199> went<00:04:45.680> for<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.039> knock<00:04:46.759> off<00:04:46.969> because<00:04:47.419> I

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
just went for the knock off because I

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.450 
just went for the knock off because I
see<00:04:48.199> my<00:04:49.099> plan<00:04:49.400> coming<00:04:50.000> through<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:51.250> he<00:04:52.250> sends

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
see my plan coming through and he sends

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.920 
see my plan coming through and he sends
in<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.729> set<00:04:53.060> does<00:04:53.180> which<00:04:53.300> is<00:04:53.330> fortunately

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
in a set does which is fortunately

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.930 
in a set does which is fortunately
slower<00:04:54.259> than<00:04:54.440> me<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:54.770> I<00:04:54.830> set<00:04:54.889> up<00:04:55.099> both<00:04:55.190> sets<00:04:55.789> of

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
slower than me so I set up both sets of

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.770 
slower than me so I set up both sets of
spikes<00:04:56.539> and<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:57.139> get<00:04:57.349> off<00:04:57.469> the<00:04:57.500> knockoffs<00:04:57.979> great

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
spikes and I get off the knockoffs great

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.809 
spikes and I get off the knockoffs great
so<00:04:59.780> now<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.990> spiritual<00:05:00.860> comes<00:05:01.099> in<00:05:01.340> takes<00:05:01.669> a

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
so now the spiritual comes in takes a

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.200 
so now the spiritual comes in takes a
mega<00:05:02.000> horn<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.740> is<00:05:03.740> heavily<00:05:04.129> poisoned<00:05:04.969> or

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
mega horn and is heavily poisoned or

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.959 
mega horn and is heavily poisoned or
however<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.319> call<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.710> so<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:09.699> didn't<00:05:10.699> want<00:05:10.849> him

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
however you call it so I didn't want him

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.879 
however you call it so I didn't want him
to<00:05:11.030> know<00:05:11.300> that<00:05:11.330> I<00:05:11.539> didn't<00:05:11.900> have<00:05:11.960> stone<00:05:12.379> edge<00:05:12.620> I

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
to know that I didn't have stone edge I

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.980 
to know that I didn't have stone edge I
mean<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:13.430> was<00:05:13.520> really<00:05:13.879> important<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.539> me<00:05:14.629> in<00:05:14.870> my

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
mean it was really important to me in my

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.999 
mean it was really important to me in my
head<00:05:15.169> I'm<00:05:15.289> not<00:05:15.500> sure<00:05:15.680> if<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.889> was<00:05:15.949> that

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
head I'm not sure if it was that

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.839 
head I'm not sure if it was that
important<00:05:16.520> really<00:05:17.000> but<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:19.159> I<00:05:19.250> was<00:05:19.400> afraid<00:05:19.699> of

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
important really but and I was afraid of

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.140 
important really but and I was afraid of
like<00:05:20.270> missing<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:21.050> mega-haul<00:05:21.860> even<00:05:22.310> though<00:05:22.759> i

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
like missing the mega-haul even though i

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.959

just used gimmicks like that fricking
roar<00:05:50.449> shuffling<00:05:50.960> drapion<00:05:51.349> and<00:05:52.389> I<00:05:53.389> fortunately

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 
roar shuffling drapion and I fortunately

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:59.040 
roar shuffling drapion and I fortunately
do<00:05:54.650> get<00:05:54.919> off<00:05:55.039> the<00:05:55.430> first<00:05:56.180> turn<00:05:56.949> Dragon<00:05:57.949> Claw

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
do get off the first turn Dragon Claw

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.629 
do get off the first turn Dragon Claw
but<00:06:00.050> unfortunately<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:00.770> second<00:06:01.099> turn<00:06:01.219> I<00:06:01.250> get

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
but unfortunately the second turn I get

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.089 
but unfortunately the second turn I get
a<00:06:01.669> rest<00:06:02.029> which<00:06:02.449> is<00:06:02.629> just<00:06:02.949> dandy<00:06:04.449> so<00:06:05.949> at<00:06:06.949> this

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
a rest which is just dandy so at this

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.070 
a rest which is just dandy so at this
point<00:06:07.430> I'm<00:06:07.580> I'm<00:06:07.909> assuming<00:06:08.659> that<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:08.930> only

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
point I'm I'm assuming that the only

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.730 
point I'm I'm assuming that the only
tech<00:06:09.349> you<00:06:09.500> move<00:06:09.650> it<00:06:09.770> has<00:06:10.039> is<00:06:10.339> dark<00:06:11.150> pulse<00:06:11.740> so

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
tech you move it has is dark pulse so

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.909 
tech you move it has is dark pulse so
seeing<00:06:13.699> how<00:06:13.940> much<00:06:14.060> it<00:06:14.120> didn't<00:06:14.569> do<00:06:14.750> i<00:06:14.960> go<00:06:15.740> for

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
seeing how much it didn't do i go for

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.430 
seeing how much it didn't do i go for
the<00:06:15.979> rest<00:06:16.219> again<00:06:16.550> and<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:19.150> really<00:06:20.199> it's<00:06:21.199> really

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
the rest again and it really it's really

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.369 
the rest again and it really it's really
take<00:06:21.979> killing<00:06:22.279> me<00:06:22.400> slowly<00:06:22.550> so<00:06:23.089> I<00:06:23.330> think<00:06:23.719> okay

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379 
take killing me slowly so I think okay

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.350 
take killing me slowly so I think okay
if<00:06:24.529> I<00:06:24.620> can<00:06:24.800> rest<00:06:25.009> to<00:06:25.219> a<00:06:25.550> dragon<00:06:26.000> claw<00:06:26.180> this

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
if I can rest to a dragon claw this

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.480 
if I can rest to a dragon claw this
would<00:06:26.479> be<00:06:26.539> over<00:06:26.810> I<00:06:27.199> get<00:06:27.949> arrest<00:06:28.250> again

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
would be over I get arrest again

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.330 
would be over I get arrest again
and<00:06:29.580> at<00:06:30.389> this<00:06:30.599> point<00:06:30.840> I'm<00:06:31.080> just<00:06:31.289> I'm<00:06:32.250> just

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
and at this point I'm just I'm just

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.790 
and at this point I'm just I'm just
hoping<00:06:32.729> for<00:06:32.819> a<00:06:33.030> dragon<00:06:33.780> color<00:06:34.169> because<00:06:34.530> if<00:06:34.680> I

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
hoping for a dragon color because if I

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.900 
hoping for a dragon color because if I
wake<00:06:35.039> up<00:06:36.680> no<00:06:37.680> if<00:06:37.860> I<00:06:37.979> get<00:06:38.190> a<00:06:38.220> hill<00:06:38.490> bell<00:06:38.669> and<00:06:38.789> wake

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
wake up no if I get a hill bell and wake

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.969 
wake up no if I get a hill bell and wake
up<00:06:39.120> there<00:06:39.330> not<00:06:39.419> be<00:06:39.690> a<00:06:39.720> wasted<00:06:40.259> turn<00:06:40.500> if<00:06:40.710> I<00:06:40.800> get

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
up there not be a wasted turn if I get

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.129 
up there not be a wasted turn if I get
arrested<00:06:41.099> obviously<00:06:41.970> be<00:06:42.090> a<00:06:42.120> waste<00:06:42.389> to<00:06:42.539> turn<00:06:42.780> so

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
arrested obviously be a waste to turn so

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.320 
arrested obviously be a waste to turn so
the<00:06:43.919> detail<00:06:44.280> goes<00:06:44.460> down<00:06:44.699> and<00:06:44.910> I'm<00:06:45.000> okay<00:06:45.150> with

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
the detail goes down and I'm okay with

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.020 
the detail goes down and I'm okay with
that<00:06:45.680> so<00:06:46.680> in<00:06:46.860> comes<00:06:47.039> the<00:06:47.220> heater<00:06:47.370> on<00:06:47.580> and<00:06:47.729> this

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
that so in comes the heater on and this

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.909 
that so in comes the heater on and this
confirms<00:06:48.539> that<00:06:48.660> it's<00:06:48.930> scarf<00:06:49.289> because<00:06:49.560> it<00:06:49.800> out

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
confirms that it's scarf because it out

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.170 
confirms that it's scarf because it out
speeds<00:06:50.310> my<00:06:50.639> Dragonite<00:06:51.330> and<00:06:52.280> I<00:06:53.280> think<00:06:54.060> my

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
speeds my Dragonite and I think my

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.890 
speeds my Dragonite and I think my
dragonite<00:06:54.509> is<00:06:54.630> max<00:06:54.810> speed<00:06:55.580> not<00:06:56.580> too<00:06:56.759> sure<00:06:56.940> so<00:06:57.870> I

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
dragonite is max speed not too sure so I

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.260 
dragonite is max speed not too sure so I
send<00:06:58.169> back<00:06:58.349> in<00:06:58.530> my<00:06:58.650> flag<00:06:58.949> on<00:06:59.190> which<00:06:59.669> is<00:06:59.819> scarfed

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
send back in my flag on which is scarfed

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.120 
send back in my flag on which is scarfed
and<00:07:00.509> go<00:07:01.050> for<00:07:01.199> the<00:07:01.259> stone<00:07:01.470> age<00:07:01.620> because<00:07:01.919> I<00:07:01.949> know

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
and go for the stone age because I know

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.510 
and go for the stone age because I know
that<00:07:02.340> stone<00:07:02.580> age<00:07:02.759> would<00:07:02.940> 28<00:07:03.270> kale<00:07:03.560> the<00:07:04.560> heatran

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
that stone age would 28 kale the heatran

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.089 
that stone age would 28 kale the heatran
and<00:07:05.789> one<00:07:06.150> hit<00:07:06.330> kill<00:07:06.509> his<00:07:06.659> aptos<00:07:07.020> and<00:07:07.289> because

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
and one hit kill his aptos and because

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:09.589 
and one hit kill his aptos and because
he<00:07:08.130> is<00:07:08.460> shown<00:07:08.699> that<00:07:08.819> he<00:07:08.970> has<00:07:09.060> hidden<00:07:09.270> power

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
he is shown that he has hidden power

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.640 
he is shown that he has hidden power
grass<00:07:09.930> and<00:07:10.199> not<00:07:10.319> ice<00:07:10.849> so<00:07:12.409> afterwards<00:07:13.409> I'd<00:07:13.500> go

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
grass and not ice so afterwards I'd go

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.520 
grass and not ice so afterwards I'd go
for<00:07:13.830> the<00:07:13.889> astonish<00:07:14.280> again<00:07:14.610> because<00:07:15.530> whatever

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
for the astonish again because whatever

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.409 
for the astonish again because whatever
move<00:07:16.830> he<00:07:17.009> chooses<00:07:17.490> I<00:07:17.610> can<00:07:17.849> just<00:07:18.060> switch<00:07:18.210> in

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
move he chooses I can just switch in

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:24.499 
move he chooses I can just switch in
rhyperior<00:07:19.380> or<00:07:20.840> flag<00:07:21.840> on<00:07:22.050> and<00:07:23.509> unfortunately

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509 
rhyperior or flag on and unfortunately

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:26.719 
rhyperior or flag on and unfortunately
the<00:07:25.259> second<00:07:25.620> time<00:07:25.800> I<00:07:25.830> missed<00:07:26.099> a<00:07:26.159> stone<00:07:26.340> edge<00:07:26.550> so

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:26.729 
the second time I missed a stone edge so

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:28.820 
the second time I missed a stone edge so
I<00:07:26.759> switch<00:07:27.000> into<00:07:27.360> rhyperior<00:07:27.780> to<00:07:28.169> take<00:07:28.349> the<00:07:28.470> HP

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
I switch into rhyperior to take the HP

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.749 
I switch into rhyperior to take the HP
grass<00:07:29.099> and<00:07:30.560> finish<00:07:31.560> the<00:07:31.650> sacrifice<00:07:32.130> off<00:07:32.400> but

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 
grass and finish the sacrifice off but

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:36.499 
grass and finish the sacrifice off but
it<00:07:32.970> survives<00:07:33.539> the<00:07:33.780> HP<00:07:34.169> gross<00:07:34.320> I<00:07:35.330> guess<00:07:36.330> because

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:36.509 
it survives the HP gross I guess because

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.270 
it survives the HP gross I guess because
the<00:07:36.750> solid<00:07:37.050> rock<00:07:37.259> and<00:07:37.469> sand<00:07:37.800> storm<00:07:38.130> and<00:07:38.250> all
