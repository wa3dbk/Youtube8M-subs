00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
bitter side we're now going to add a

bitter side we're now going to add a
half<00:01:17.460> ounce<00:01:17.760> of<00:01:18.200> simple<00:01:19.200> syrup<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.159> use

half ounce of simple syrup you could use

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
half ounce of simple syrup you could use
regular<00:01:23.580> granulated<00:01:24.060> sugar<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.690> most<00:01:24.900> recipes

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
regular granulated sugar in most recipes

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
regular granulated sugar in most recipes
might<00:01:25.440> call<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.710> granulated<00:01:26.310> sugar<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.549> prefer

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
might call for granulated sugar I prefer

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.899 
might call for granulated sugar I prefer
using<00:01:27.540> simple<00:01:27.990> syrup<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> gets<00:01:29.670> fully

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
using simple syrup because it gets fully

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550 
using simple syrup because it gets fully
dissolved<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.510> drink<00:01:30.720> plus<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
dissolved in the drink plus I think it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.640 
dissolved in the drink plus I think it
helps<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.390> softly<00:01:33.390> muddle<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.439> mint

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
helps kind of softly muddle the mint

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
helps kind of softly muddle the mint
rather<00:01:35.130> than<00:01:35.400> giving<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> hard<00:01:36.000> abrasive

you're keeping them clean very
religiously<00:01:52.520> we're<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:53.580> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> just

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
religiously we're now going to just

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
religiously we're now going to just
lightly<00:01:54.240> muddle<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.080> mint<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> bottom<00:01:55.770> we

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
lightly muddle the mint in the bottom we

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
lightly muddle the mint in the bottom we
don't<00:01:55.979> want<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> muddle<00:01:56.310> too<00:01:56.580> hard<00:01:56.939> because

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
don't want to muddle too hard because

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.460 
don't want to muddle too hard because
you<00:01:57.479> metal<00:01:57.780> too<00:01:57.900> hard

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
you metal too hard

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.170 
you metal too hard
the<00:01:58.950> mint<00:01:59.189> itself<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> start

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the mint itself is going to start

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.690 
the mint itself is going to start
becoming<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.810> bitter<00:02:01.020> side<00:02:01.579> what<00:02:02.579> you're

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
becoming on the bitter side what you're

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.030 
becoming on the bitter side what you're
trying<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.720> basically<00:02:04.259> create<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
trying to do here is basically create a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.780 
trying to do here is basically create a
mint<00:02:05.909> infused<00:02:06.630> simple<00:02:07.439> syrup

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:20.270 

there<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.569> go<00:02:18.140> now<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> next<00:02:19.500> step<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.159> take

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
there we go now the next step is to take

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.319 
there we go now the next step is to take
and<00:02:20.489> add<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:20.849> Bourbon<00:02:22.189> I'm<00:02:23.189> going<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> add<00:02:23.549> two

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
and a half ounces of bourbon now we have

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.020 
and a half ounces of bourbon now we have
the<00:02:42.090> step<00:02:42.359> that<00:02:42.590> everyone<00:02:43.590> thinks<00:02:44.040> about<00:02:44.189> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the step that everyone thinks about the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.910 
the step that everyone thinks about the
mint<00:02:45.239> julep<00:02:45.659> from<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> standpoint<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.500> it's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
mint julep from the standpoint it's it's

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.890 
mint julep from the standpoint it's it's
not<00:02:47.099> just<00:02:47.159> a<00:02:47.579> drink<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.120> ice<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.689> drink

something<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.129> little<00:03:02.310> bit<00:03:02.400> more<00:03:02.579> on<00:03:02.669> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
something a little bit more on the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.490 
something a little bit more on the
simplistic<00:03:03.329> side<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:03.989> what's<00:03:04.169> called<00:03:04.349> a

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
simplistic side it's what's called a

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.800 
simplistic side it's what's called a
Lewis<00:03:05.280> bag<00:03:05.489> it's<00:03:06.329> simply<00:03:07.169> just<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.650> canvas<00:03:08.250> bag

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
Lewis bag it's simply just a canvas bag

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:25.149 
Lewis bag it's simply just a canvas bag
that<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:09.989> add<00:03:10.260> our<00:03:10.500> ice<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:22.879> should<00:03:23.879> be<00:03:23.909> plenty

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
that we add our ice to should be plenty

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.460 
that we add our ice to should be plenty
now<00:03:26.159> we<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.519> whack<00:03:27.479> this<00:03:27.780> ice<00:03:28.049> in<00:03:28.260> order<00:03:28.349> to

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
now we just whack this ice in order to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.960 
now we just whack this ice in order to
crush<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.769> down<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.220> canvas<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:29.760> going<00:03:29.819> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
crush it down the canvas is going to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.509 
crush it down the canvas is going to
wick<00:03:30.209> away<00:03:30.239> any<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.139> the<00:03:31.709> melting<00:03:32.250> thought

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
wick away any of the the melting thought

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.949 
wick away any of the the melting thought
the<00:03:32.729> waters<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.269> be<00:03:33.299> formed<00:03:33.629> by<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.810> and

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
the waters can be formed by it and

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.469 
the waters can be formed by it and
therefore<00:03:34.079> we<00:03:34.260> end<00:03:34.379> up<00:03:34.440> with<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> nice<00:03:34.739> dry<00:03:35.099> ice

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:35.479 
therefore we end up with a nice dry ice

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.849 
therefore we end up with a nice dry ice
