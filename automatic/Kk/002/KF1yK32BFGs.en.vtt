on this you might be thinking hose

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.950 
on this you might be thinking hose
clamps<00:00:17.340> heck<00:00:17.580> they're<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.119> same<00:00:18.150> well

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
clamps heck they're all the same well

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.980 
clamps heck they're all the same well
guess<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:19.980> they're<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.490> all<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> same<00:00:20.990> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
guess what they're not all the same and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.630 
guess what they're not all the same and
I<00:00:22.380> want<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> show<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.920> some<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
I want to show you some of the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490 
I want to show you some of the
differences<00:00:24.330> between<00:00:24.720> them

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
differences between them

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.380 
differences between them
I<00:00:25.910> started<00:00:26.910> left<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.810> right<00:00:28.279> from<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.210> my

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
I started left to right from what in my

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.229 
I started left to right from what in my
opinion<00:00:30.420> are<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.410> worst<00:00:32.279> ones<00:00:32.550> -<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> best

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
opinion are the worst ones - the best

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.270 
opinion are the worst ones - the best
ones<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.290> let's<00:00:34.530> look<00:00:34.739> at<00:00:34.950> this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
ones all right so let's look at this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.709 
ones all right so let's look at this
this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.770> Chinese<00:00:37.770> or<00:00:38.370> Taiwan<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.420> let<00:00:39.629> me

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
this is Chinese or Taiwan and let me

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.500 
this is Chinese or Taiwan and let me
switch<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.140> close-up<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.149> may<00:00:42.300> come

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
switch to a close-up and this may come

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.830 
switch to a close-up and this may come
out<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.870> bit<00:00:43.079> better<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:46.170> hose<00:00:46.890> clamp

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
out a little bit better this hose clamp

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.709 
out a little bit better this hose clamp
it's<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:51.539> cuts<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.879> it's<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.090> worm<00:00:54.360> drive

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it's the the cuts that it's a worm drive

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
it's the the cuts that it's a worm drive
they<00:00:54.989> call<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.379> worm<00:00:55.590> drive<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.219> turn<00:00:56.489> this

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
they call it a worm drive you turn this

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.889 
they call it a worm drive you turn this
thing<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:58.410> turn<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.949> screw<00:00:59.820> head<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.879> it

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
thing you turn the screw head and it

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.109 
thing you turn the screw head and it
compresses<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.500> shrinks<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.489> narrows<00:01:06.090> down

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
compresses or shrinks or narrows down

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.020 
compresses or shrinks or narrows down
the<00:01:06.450> hose<00:01:06.780> clamp<00:01:07.460> that's<00:01:08.460> called<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> worm

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the hose clamp that's called the worm

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.570 
the hose clamp that's called the worm
drive<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.840> trouble<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> cheap<00:01:10.890> ones<00:01:11.189> is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
drive the trouble with the cheap ones is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.990 
drive the trouble with the cheap ones is
if<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.360> look<00:01:13.040> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.340> bottom<00:01:15.380> where<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.000> weir

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
if you look on the bottom where the weir

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.700 
if you look on the bottom where the weir
this<00:01:18.299> piece<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> screw<00:01:20.310> runs<00:01:21.240> through

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
this piece that the screw runs through

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.640 
this piece that the screw runs through
is<00:01:22.710> attached<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.420> clamped<00:01:25.320> around

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
is attached it's just clamped around

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.580 
is attached it's just clamped around
there<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:27.570> maybe<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.320> see

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
there and I think maybe you can see

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
there and I think maybe you can see
there's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> split<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.030> there's<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> split

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
there's a split in it there's a split

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.030 
there's a split in it there's a split
there<00:01:31.770> where<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.880> formed<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.900> around<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
there where they formed it around the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.429 
there where they formed it around the
screw<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.729> around<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> clamp<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
screw and around the clamp and that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.030 
screw and around the clamp and that
split<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:38.009> open<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.820> put<00:01:39.119> too<00:01:39.479> much

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
split can open up if you put too much

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
split can open up if you put too much
tension<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.520> torque<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.689> try<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> tighten<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
tension or torque you try to tighten it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.149 
tension or torque you try to tighten it
too<00:01:43.890> tight<00:01:44.420> it'll<00:01:45.420> start<00:01:45.810> opening<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.649> here

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
too tight it'll start opening up in here

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.819 
too tight it'll start opening up in here
and<00:01:47.610> you'll<00:01:48.360> lose<00:01:48.600> tension<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.619> could

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and you'll lose tension and you could

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.940 
and you'll lose tension and you could
have<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> leak<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.060> okay<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
have a leak this is okay for some you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.300 
have a leak this is okay for some you
know<00:01:53.100> very<00:01:53.369> basic<00:01:54.000> simple<00:01:55.310> low-end

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
know very basic simple low-end

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.719 
know very basic simple low-end
applications<00:01:57.590> maybe<00:01:58.590> your<00:01:58.920> garden<00:01:59.280> hose<00:01:59.430> I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
applications maybe your garden hose I

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.560 
applications maybe your garden hose I
don't<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.350> wouldn't<00:02:01.950> put<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.670> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
don't know but I wouldn't put this on a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
don't know but I wouldn't put this on a
on<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.750> car<00:02:04.080> would<00:02:04.470> definitely<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.160> put<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.550> on

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
on a car would definitely not put it on

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.930 
on a car would definitely not put it on
a<00:02:05.700> good<00:02:06.000> car<00:02:06.890> because<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.040> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> it's

other<00:02:37.470> one<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.740> was<00:02:37.860> flat<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:39.480> get<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
other one it was flat so this get a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.120 
other one it was flat so this get a
little<00:02:40.200> more<00:02:40.640> screw<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.910> clamp<00:02:44.300> grip<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:46.350> also

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
little more screw to clamp grip and also

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.270 
little more screw to clamp grip and also
the<00:02:47.910> way<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:49.400> P<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.760> part<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.360> formed<00:02:51.959> is

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
the way this P this part is formed is

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.240 
the way this P this part is formed is
the<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.910> goes<00:02:54.300> through<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.290> little<00:02:55.920> slot

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the it goes through a little slot

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.470 
the it goes through a little slot
there's<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.610> slot<00:02:57.330> there<00:02:58.700> where<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.209> piece

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
there's a slot there where the piece

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.600 
there's a slot there where the piece
goes<00:03:00.870> around<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.530> tab<00:03:01.830> there's<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.250> tab<00:03:02.580> that

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
goes around the tab there's a tab that

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.180 
goes around the tab there's a tab that
comes<00:03:03.090> through<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.540> slot<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.170> then<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.890> tab

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
comes through the slot and then the tab

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.190 
comes through the slot and then the tab
is<00:03:05.640> crimped<00:03:06.120> down<00:03:06.800> so<00:03:08.450> this<00:03:09.450> will<00:03:09.660> take<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> lot

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
is crimped down so this will take a lot

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.430 
is crimped down so this will take a lot
more<00:03:10.580> tension<00:03:11.580> as<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:12.290> as<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.650> turn<00:03:15.440> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
more tension as you as you turn the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.100 
more tension as you as you turn the
screw<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.209> just<00:03:18.450> slotted<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:19.080> a

whereas these theoretically you might
have<00:04:32.480> to<00:04:32.660> go<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.230> retighten<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.860> once<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.190> a

have to go and retighten it once in a

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.320 
have to go and retighten it once in a
while<00:04:34.460> maybe<00:04:34.850> every<00:04:35.590> 50<00:04:36.590> 70<00:04:37.550> thousand<00:04:37.910> miles<00:04:38.090> I

while maybe every 50 70 thousand miles I

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.590 
while maybe every 50 70 thousand miles I
don't<00:04:38.510> know<00:04:39.520> but<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.670> problem<00:04:40.880> with<00:04:41.360> these<00:04:41.540> is

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
don't know but the problem with these is

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.570 
don't know but the problem with these is
I<00:04:42.290> just<00:04:43.190> had<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.790> just<00:04:43.970> replaced<00:04:44.420> a<00:04:44.570> hose<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:45.680> my

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
I just had I just replaced a hose on my

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.300 
I just had I just replaced a hose on my
Corvette<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.990> new<00:04:48.380> hose<00:04:48.650> was<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.010> gate

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
Corvette and the new hose was a gate

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.800 
Corvette and the new hose was a gate
tows<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.990> old<00:04:51.440> hose<00:04:51.830> original<00:04:52.520> equipment<00:04:52.810> had

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
tows the old hose original equipment had

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.040 
tows the old hose original equipment had
it<00:04:54.080> was<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.230> little<00:04:54.500> thicker<00:04:55.280> in<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.920> overall

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
it was a little thicker in the overall

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.680 
it was a little thicker in the overall
circumference<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:01.340> was<00:05:01.550> designed<00:05:01.730> for

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
circumference so this was designed for

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.070 
circumference so this was designed for
the<00:05:02.870> thickness<00:05:03.320> of<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:04.430> hose<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:05.690> original

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
the thickness of the hose the original

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.200 
the thickness of the hose the original
equipment<00:05:06.320> hose<00:05:06.680> but<00:05:07.610> when<00:05:07.820> you<00:05:07.940> put<00:05:08.180> a

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
equipment hose but when you put a

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.320 
equipment hose but when you put a
slightly<00:05:08.650> thinner<00:05:09.650> gates<00:05:10.400> hose<00:05:10.700> on<00:05:11.000> there

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
slightly thinner gates hose on there

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.620 
slightly thinner gates hose on there
this<00:05:11.870> didn't<00:05:12.290> have<00:05:12.410> enough<00:05:12.650> tension<00:05:12.920> on<00:05:13.220> it

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
this didn't have enough tension on it

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.390 
this didn't have enough tension on it
because<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:15.110> know<00:05:15.230> once<00:05:15.410> it<00:05:15.590> gets<00:05:15.770> this<00:05:16.100> small

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
because you know once it gets this small

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.330 
because you know once it gets this small
that's<00:05:16.610> it<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:17.060> won't<00:05:17.390> tighten<00:05:17.840> any<00:05:18.110> more<00:05:18.350> so

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
that's it it won't tighten any more so

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.040 
that's it it won't tighten any more so
if<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:21.100> it's<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.220> good<00:05:22.430> design<00:05:22.820> but<00:05:23.360> if<00:05:23.750> you're

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
if it it's a good design but if you're

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.960 
if it it's a good design but if you're
going<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.320> be<00:05:24.470> putting<00:05:25.130> different<00:05:25.400> kinds<00:05:25.880> of

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
going to be putting different kinds of

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.670 
going to be putting different kinds of
hoses<00:05:26.360> on<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:26.780> not<00:05:26.960> original<00:05:27.440> equipment

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
hoses on and not original equipment

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.010 
hoses on and not original equipment
hoses<00:05:28.250> then<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.000> would<00:05:29.240> stay<00:05:29.480> away<00:05:29.510> from<00:05:29.690> this

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
hoses then I would stay away from this

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.330 
hoses then I would stay away from this
one<00:05:30.290> this<00:05:31.160> beauty<00:05:32.090> I<00:05:32.120> found<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:33.169> online<00:05:33.470> this

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
one this beauty I found it online this

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.840 
one this beauty I found it online this
is<00:05:34.520> called<00:05:34.820> ABA<00:05:35.270> daba<00:05:36.430> it's<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.640> Swedish<00:05:38.710> hose

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
is called ABA daba it's a Swedish hose

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.640 
is called ABA daba it's a Swedish hose
clamp<00:05:40.930> there<00:05:41.930> maybe<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.710> can<00:05:42.919> see<00:05:43.130> that<00:05:43.340> ABA

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
clamp there maybe you can see that ABA

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.270 
clamp there maybe you can see that ABA
anyway<00:05:46.570> you<00:05:47.570> just<00:05:47.720> look<00:05:47.990> at<00:05:48.200> it<00:05:48.230> it's<00:05:48.860> it's

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
anyway you just look at it it's it's

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.500 
anyway you just look at it it's it's
like<00:05:49.640> finally<00:05:50.150> machined<00:05:51.070> it's<00:05:52.070> it's<00:05:52.910> just<00:05:53.360> got

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
like finally machined it's it's just got

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.470 
like finally machined it's it's just got
a<00:05:53.540> four<00:05:54.530> flat<00:05:54.800> blade<00:05:55.250> or<00:05:55.580> these<00:05:56.120> of<00:05:56.270> course

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
a four flat blade or these of course

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.620 
a four flat blade or these of course
will<00:05:56.630> also<00:05:56.780> take<00:05:57.230> a<00:05:57.260> little<00:05:57.470> nut<00:05:57.740> driver<00:05:58.630> most

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
will also take a little nut driver most

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.880 
will also take a little nut driver most
most<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.080> time<00:06:00.230> you're<00:06:00.320> going<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.530> use<00:06:00.620> a<00:06:00.650> nut

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
most the time you're going to use a nut

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.650 
most the time you're going to use a nut
driver<00:06:00.919> on<00:06:01.400> this<00:06:01.580> rather<00:06:01.850> than<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.150> screwdriver

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
driver on this rather than a screwdriver

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.320 
driver on this rather than a screwdriver
but<00:06:02.990> you<00:06:03.110> could<00:06:03.290> go<00:06:03.440> either<00:06:03.470> way<00:06:03.770> but<00:06:04.730> look<00:06:05.150> at

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
but you could go either way but look at

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.030 
but you could go either way but look at
this<00:06:05.510> blue<00:06:06.140> part<00:06:06.669> it's<00:06:07.669> all<00:06:07.940> one<00:06:08.210> piece<00:06:08.480> that

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
this blue part it's all one piece that

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.230 
this blue part it's all one piece that
is<00:06:10.040> one<00:06:10.490> piece<00:06:10.850> that's<00:06:12.580> pressed<00:06:13.580> into<00:06:13.970> the

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
is one piece that's pressed into the

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.170 
is one piece that's pressed into the
correct<00:06:14.600> size<00:06:15.370> it's<00:06:16.370> thick<00:06:16.850> it<00:06:17.840> you<00:06:18.500> could<00:06:18.710> put

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
correct size it's thick it you could put

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.440 
correct size it's thick it you could put
probably<00:06:20.180> double<00:06:21.220> or<00:06:22.220> triple<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.850> tour

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
probably double or triple the tour

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.390 
probably double or triple the tour
on<00:06:23.840> this<00:06:24.830> clamp<00:06:26.080> versus<00:06:27.080> any<00:06:27.890> of<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.250> other

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
on this clamp versus any of the other

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.760 
on this clamp versus any of the other
ones<00:06:28.640> and<00:06:29.450> it'll<00:06:29.780> just<00:06:30.020> keep<00:06:30.140> tightening<00:06:30.650> and

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
ones and it'll just keep tightening and

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.530 
ones and it'll just keep tightening and
tightening<00:06:30.980> till<00:06:31.430> it<00:06:31.550> cuts<00:06:31.910> through<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.330> hose

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
tightening till it cuts through the hose

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.780 
tightening till it cuts through the hose
probably<00:06:34.450> it's<00:06:35.450> got<00:06:35.690> a<00:06:35.720> big<00:06:36.290> screw<00:06:36.920> it's<00:06:37.340> it's

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
probably it's got a big screw it's it's

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.370 
probably it's got a big screw it's it's
the<00:06:38.030> biggest<00:06:38.390> screw<00:06:38.660> of<00:06:38.840> all<00:06:39.050> of<00:06:39.200> these<00:06:40.180> and<00:06:41.380> I

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
the biggest screw of all of these and I

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.160 
the biggest screw of all of these and I
just<00:06:43.160> I<00:06:43.430> just<00:06:43.460> like<00:06:43.910> this<00:06:44.120> one<00:06:44.420> piece<00:06:44.720> it's

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
just I just like this one piece it's

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.530 
just I just like this one piece it's
just<00:06:45.680> one<00:06:46.010> piece<00:06:46.400> it's<00:06:47.210> a<00:06:47.330> heavy<00:06:47.570> gauge<00:06:48.220> it's

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
just one piece it's a heavy gauge it's

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.930 
just one piece it's a heavy gauge it's
not<00:06:50.540> ever<00:06:50.810> going<00:06:51.020> to<00:06:51.140> spread<00:06:51.860> you<00:06:52.580> know<00:06:52.610> it<00:06:52.790> can

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
not ever going to spread you know it can

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.340 
not ever going to spread you know it can
be<00:06:52.970> able<00:06:53.180> to<00:06:53.300> strip<00:06:53.660> this<00:06:53.870> through<00:06:54.140> there

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
be able to strip this through there

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.020 
be able to strip this through there
you'll<00:06:54.530> be<00:06:54.590> able<00:06:54.680> to<00:06:54.890> tighten<00:06:55.190> this<00:06:55.280> town<00:06:55.550> and

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
you'll be able to tighten this town and

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.110 
you'll be able to tighten this town and
it's<00:06:56.390> a<00:06:56.690> little<00:06:57.020> bit<00:06:57.170> thicker<00:06:57.640> if<00:06:58.640> you<00:06:58.730> look<00:06:58.910> at

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
it's a little bit thicker if you look at

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.750 
it's a little bit thicker if you look at
it<00:06:59.270> compared<00:06:59.690> to<00:06:59.750> the<00:07:00.050> two<00:07:00.620> BMWs<00:07:01.400> it's<00:07:01.700> a

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
it compared to the two BMWs it's a

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.970 
it compared to the two BMWs it's a
little<00:07:02.000> bit<00:07:02.120> thicker<00:07:04.660> about<00:07:05.660> the<00:07:05.930> same<00:07:06.320> as<00:07:06.650> the

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980 
little bit thicker about the same as the

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.830 
little bit thicker about the same as the
constant<00:07:07.970> hook<00:07:08.780> there<00:07:09.350> get<00:07:09.920> back<00:07:10.190> in<00:07:10.370> frame

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
constant hook there get back in frame

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.420 
constant hook there get back in frame
it's<00:07:11.840> about<00:07:12.020> the<00:07:12.200> same<00:07:12.410> as<00:07:12.620> the<00:07:12.770> constant

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
it's about the same as the constant

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.330 
it's about the same as the constant
tension<00:07:14.270> one<00:07:14.660> except<00:07:15.650> the<00:07:15.770> constant<00:07:16.190> tension

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
tension one except the constant tension

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.410 
tension one except the constant tension
one<00:07:16.640> has<00:07:16.850> a<00:07:16.880> little<00:07:17.180> narrow<00:07:17.480> section<00:07:18.140> here<00:07:18.830> so

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.420 
one has a little narrow section here so

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.300 
one has a little narrow section here so
this<00:07:20.420> one<00:07:20.630> has<00:07:20.810> the<00:07:21.350> same<00:07:21.590> size<00:07:21.950> all<00:07:22.160> the<00:07:22.190> way

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.310 
this one has the same size all the way

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.030 
this one has the same size all the way
around<00:07:22.610> anyway<00:07:23.270> that's<00:07:23.630> enough<00:07:23.900> that's<00:07:24.200> my

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.040 
around anyway that's enough that's my

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.830 
around anyway that's enough that's my
thing<00:07:25.310> on<00:07:25.430> hose<00:07:25.730> clamps<00:07:26.240> they're<00:07:26.480> not<00:07:26.630> all

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 
thing on hose clamps they're not all

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.470 
thing on hose clamps they're not all
created<00:07:27.020> the<00:07:27.350> same<00:07:27.610> so<00:07:28.610> if<00:07:28.850> you<00:07:29.030> want<00:07:29.240> to<00:07:29.360> do<00:07:29.450> a
