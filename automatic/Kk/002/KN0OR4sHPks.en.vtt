00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.550
 hey I am rose and I will be teaching you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.200
 a few tricks how to use the 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.900
 master liquid eyeliner and tube 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.059
 maybelline to create that perfect line 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.349
 and fabulous that we want in our look 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.179
 to start we're going to take a speck and 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.789
 let's put a substantial amount 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.249
 of the minor maurer de maybelline in the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.439
 lower part of the eye this is going to 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.659
 serve as a guide to help us do 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.419
 that perfect line so you're going to take 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.890
 in the motita and will apply in the part 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.579
 lower eye 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.379
 using it as a guide 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.379
 the end of the eye is going to help you 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.460
 make this guide in the best way 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.730
 I already have this side done but when 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.980
 what you do is going to make sure that both 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.980
 sides are as similar as possible 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.180
 after we do this we're going to take a 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.300
 angular brush like this and brown shadow 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.990
 or black to make a guideline of 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.510
 how do we want this line to stay 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.780
 so you're going to take the shade 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.450
 and you will apply it as close to the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.400
 possible tab following that line that 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.400
 you already created with the mineral powder 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.370
 You will reach the highest part of the 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.920
 eye you're not going to go from there 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.920
 and will do as 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.240
 in the external form of the eye 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.749
 just as a guide, you're going to make sure that 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.689
 that line does not happen of the dust that you put 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:59.060
 and not left down after 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.609
 you do that are ready to use your 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.770
 metro and maybelline tube and the good thing about 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.000
 teacher and tube is that you have two ways 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.910
 to use it why 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.310
 if you turn 90 degrees you can have a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.290
 wider brush and one thinner for 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.600
 those areas that need a brush more 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.290
 fine 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.760
 Now I'm going to start drawing my eye 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.940
 from the inside of the eye towards 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.940
 outside 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.360
 and I will be using the more side 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.360
 fine 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.340
 then you have your eye outlined 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.520
 you are going to do that that there is so much we 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.350
 like but it's going to be very easy 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.040
 because he will also use the side 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:56.939
 fine of the duo master and you're just going 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.939
 lengthen it 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.230
 in this simple and fast way 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.819
 you are going to have your line made fabulous 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.519
 always making sure that both sides 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.159
 are as similar as possible when 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.709
 you finish that you're going to take a brush 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.180
 big and they're going to remove all that dust 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.120
 that you applied on the bottom of the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.120
 eye after this apply your mask 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.790
 in both eyes 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.830
 let's apply the blues 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.859
 important part of makeup 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.620
 and apply cycles 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.030
 Easy simple and you already have your look 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.290
