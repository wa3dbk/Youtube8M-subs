00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
one it's it feels quite chunky to hold

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.470 
one it's it feels quite chunky to hold
I'm<00:02:15.040> not<00:02:15.160> sure<00:02:15.280> I'm<00:02:15.370> not<00:02:15.490> quite<00:02:15.670> sure<00:02:15.700> why<00:02:16.090> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
I'm not sure I'm not quite sure why and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.730 
I'm not sure I'm not quite sure why and
one<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.200> first<00:02:17.380> things<00:02:17.590> you'll<00:02:17.710> notice

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
one of the first things you'll notice

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.080 
one of the first things you'll notice
which<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.370> different<00:02:18.520> about<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:18.880> one

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
which is a bit different about this one

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.890 
which is a bit different about this one
is<00:02:19.390> it's<00:02:19.630> got<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> sort<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.170> flat<00:02:21.630> typic<00:02:22.630> sort

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
is it's got a sort of a flat typic sort

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.300 
is it's got a sort of a flat typic sort
of<00:02:22.960> doesn't<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:23.440> not<00:02:23.530> rounded<00:02:23.950> off<00:02:24.070> like

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
of doesn't it's not rounded off like

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.140 
of doesn't it's not rounded off like
most<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.790> ones

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
most of the ones

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.569 
most of the ones
it<00:02:25.780> sort<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.049> just<00:02:26.260> stops<00:02:26.890> as<00:02:27.189> if<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:27.459> been

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
it sort of just stops as if it's been

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.020 
it sort of just stops as if it's been
cut<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:29.319> then<00:02:29.530> you've<00:02:29.680> got<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:30.189> handle<00:02:30.579> which

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
cut and then you've got the handle which

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.729 
cut and then you've got the handle which
I<00:02:31.329> mean<00:02:31.689> is<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:31.930> all<00:02:32.110> sort<00:02:32.379> of<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.530> same

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
I mean is this all sort of the same

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.920 
I mean is this all sort of the same
thickness<00:02:33.159> and<00:02:33.549> you<00:02:34.030> have<00:02:34.180> these<00:02:34.360> sort<00:02:34.659> of<00:02:34.689> two

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
thickness and you have these sort of two

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.630 
thickness and you have these sort of two
little<00:02:35.260> rings<00:02:35.470> here<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.950> indicate<00:02:36.189> where<00:02:36.549> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
little rings here to indicate where the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.479 
little rings here to indicate where the
handle<00:02:36.939> is<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.780> handle<00:02:38.079> is<00:02:38.200> black<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.799> then

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
handle is the handle is black and then

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.259 
handle is the handle is black and then
the<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.989> shaft<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.409> brown<00:02:41.680> basically<00:02:42.340> it's
