it's a character that hasn't been seen

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.590 
it's a character that hasn't been seen
yet<00:02:28.620> yeah<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.940> there's<00:02:30.090> part<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.390> me<00:02:30.450> that

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
yet yeah so there's part of me that

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.050 
yet yeah so there's part of me that
actually<00:02:31.050> thinks<00:02:31.430> because<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.700> how<00:02:32.790> much<00:02:32.940> I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
actually thinks because of how much I

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.670 
actually thinks because of how much I
love<00:02:33.240> him<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.570> think<00:02:34.380> he<00:02:34.500> would<00:02:34.650> be

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
love him I think he would be

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.490 
love him I think he would be
underutilized<00:02:35.670> as<00:02:35.910> Suzanne<00:02:36.240> because<00:02:37.020> you

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
underutilized as Suzanne because you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.530 
underutilized as Suzanne because you
have<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.010> kid<00:02:38.160> version<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> don't<00:02:39.300> know<00:02:39.390> how

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
have the kid version so I don't know how

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.940 
have the kid version so I don't know how
much<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.870> film<00:02:40.050> would<00:02:40.140> actually<00:02:40.470> focus<00:02:40.800> on

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
much of the film would actually focus on

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.730 
much of the film would actually focus on
him<00:02:41.160> yes<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.820> I'm<00:02:42.450> actually<00:02:42.810> leaning<00:02:43.290> towards

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
him yes so I'm actually leaning towards

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.680 
him yes so I'm actually leaning towards
black<00:02:44.010> Adam<00:02:44.460> I<00:02:44.730> think<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.270> would<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.480> awesome

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
black Adam I think that would be awesome

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.240 
black Adam I think that would be awesome
so<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.410> that's<00:02:46.530> too<00:02:46.709> obscure<00:02:47.070> because

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
so you think that's too obscure because

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.820 
so you think that's too obscure because
I<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.490> no<00:02:47.760> idea<00:02:48.060> what<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.300> hell<00:02:48.420> yeah<00:02:48.830> okay

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
I have no idea what the hell yeah okay

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.640 
I have no idea what the hell yeah okay
so<00:02:50.130> show<00:02:50.459> Sam<00:02:50.700> becomes<00:02:51.360> Shazam<00:02:51.840> because<00:02:52.320> black

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
so show Sam becomes Shazam because black

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.860 
so show Sam becomes Shazam because black

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.630 
movies are they old justice well let's
see<00:03:58.080> I'd<00:03:58.290> say<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:58.500> we<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.070> we<00:03:59.130> got<00:03:59.250> Shazam

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
see I'd say so we have so we got Shazam

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.880 
see I'd say so we have so we got Shazam
then<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.030> we<00:04:00.269> would<00:04:00.570> assume<00:04:00.840> then<00:04:01.140> if<00:04:01.500> that's

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
then so we would assume then if that's

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.949 
then so we would assume then if that's
the<00:04:02.070> first<00:04:02.310> one<00:04:02.549> very<00:04:03.360> similar<00:04:03.600> what<00:04:03.840> we<00:04:03.870> were

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
think that now what Marvel does I think

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.050 
think that now what Marvel does I think
well<00:05:54.029> they<00:05:54.120> did<00:05:54.270> two<00:05:54.479> year<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.580> they<00:05:56.580> spaced

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
well they did two year and they spaced

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.629 
well they did two year and they spaced
them<00:05:57.240> out<00:05:57.300> one<00:05:57.539> in<00:05:57.659> July<00:05:57.960> one<00:05:58.409> in<00:05:58.620> in<00:05:59.310> December

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
them out one in July one in in December
