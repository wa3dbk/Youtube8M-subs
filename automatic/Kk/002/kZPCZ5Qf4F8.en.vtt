00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
that's not all you have to do you also

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.800 
that's not all you have to do you also
have<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:58.360> merge<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.530> vertices<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.220> just

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
have to merge the vertices that you just

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.120 
have to merge the vertices that you just
stuck<00:03:01.810> together<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.530> if<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.769> don't<00:03:02.950> have

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
stuck together and so if you don't have

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.330 
stuck together and so if you don't have
tool<00:03:03.489> bar<00:03:04.420> open<00:03:04.870> right<00:03:05.049> now<00:03:05.080> just<00:03:05.470> press<00:03:05.680> T<00:03:06.310> to

open it and go right now in to merge

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.150 
open it and go right now in to merge
it's<00:03:13.090> under<00:03:13.510> mesh<00:03:14.290> tools<00:03:14.650> right<00:03:15.340> here<00:03:15.370> and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
it's under mesh tools right here and

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.250 
it's under mesh tools right here and
press<00:03:18.160> merge<00:03:18.519> on<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.239> vertices<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.959> you

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
press merge on the vertices that you

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.979 
press merge on the vertices that you
modify<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.390> you'll<00:03:22.390> see<00:03:22.570> all<00:03:22.690> these<00:03:22.780> options

here just click at Center and now when
you<00:03:29.769> click<00:03:29.920> back<00:03:30.160> on<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.549> vertices<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.239> we

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
you click back on the vertices that we

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.680 
you click back on the vertices that we
emerged<00:03:33.989> they're<00:03:34.989> not<00:03:35.200> connected<00:03:36.420> now<00:03:37.420> why<00:03:37.630> is

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
emerged they're not connected now why is

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.699 
emerged they're not connected now why is
that<00:03:38.340> well<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.930> lot<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.049> times<00:03:41.260> when<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.530> click

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
that well a lot of times when you click

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.050 
that well a lot of times when you click
these<00:03:41.890> vertices<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.489> just<00:03:42.670> going<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.850> click

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
these vertices is just going to click

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.120 
these vertices is just going to click
the<00:03:43.209> one<00:03:43.390> that's<00:03:43.720> closest<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.470> in<00:03:44.799> this<00:03:44.920> case

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
the one that's closest and in this case

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.930 
the one that's closest and in this case
the<00:03:45.340> two<00:03:45.820> vertices<00:03:46.209> are<00:03:46.329> together<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:47.940> so

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
the two vertices are together and so

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.699 
the two vertices are together and so
when<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.150> click<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.570> you're<00:03:49.989> only<00:03:50.170> clicking

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
when you click that you're only clicking

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.590 
when you click that you're only clicking
one<00:03:50.920> but<00:03:51.640> there's<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:51.940> cool<00:03:52.209> little<00:03:52.269> thing

and blended of slack stuff it's the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.069 
and blended of slack stuff it's the
slack<00:03:55.060> tool<00:03:55.299> it's<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.630> like<00:03:55.780> in<00:03:55.930> Photoshop

same thing and your mesh will be all
stitched<00:04:33.930> up

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
stitched up

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
the slack tool is that when you're doing

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.350 
the slack tool is that when you're doing
when<00:04:41.580> you're<00:04:41.669> taking<00:04:42.030> somebody<00:04:42.210> else's

when you're taking somebody else's

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.570 
when you're taking somebody else's
picture<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:43.229> can<00:04:43.380> cut<00:04:43.650> out<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.310> background

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
picture you can cut out the background

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.550 
picture you can cut out the background
which<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.030> already<00:04:45.240> did<00:04:45.630> with<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:45.990> picture<00:04:46.380> if

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
which I already did with this picture if

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.159 
which I already did with this picture if
you<00:04:47.039> remember<00:04:47.280> from<00:04:47.400> last<00:04:47.460> time<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.750> picture

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
you remember from last time the picture

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.589 
you remember from last time the picture
was<00:04:49.919> from<00:04:50.250> it<00:04:50.940> was<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.240> official

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
was from it was the official

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.050 
was from it was the official
presidential<00:04:52.320> picture<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.860> think<00:04:52.979> and<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:54.030> was

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
presidential picture I think and it was

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.850 
presidential picture I think and it was
from<00:04:54.360> like<00:04:54.509> behind<00:04:54.840> his<00:04:55.020> desk<00:04:55.229> or<00:04:55.470> something

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
from like behind his desk or something

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.890 
from like behind his desk or something
and<00:04:56.070> so<00:04:56.849> there<00:04:57.000> was<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.150> lot<00:04:57.300> of<00:04:57.330> background<00:04:57.810> I

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
and so there was a lot of background I

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.300 
and so there was a lot of background I
didn't<00:04:58.199> want<00:04:58.380> because<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:58.979> wanted<00:04:59.220> the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
didn't want because I just wanted the

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.210 
didn't want because I just wanted the
face<00:04:59.490> for<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.759> mesh<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:01.110> what<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.070> do

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
face for the mesh and so what you do

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.189 
face for the mesh and so what you do
does<00:05:02.370> what<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.210> do<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.479> correct<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.870> is<00:05:04.020> just

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
does what you do to correct that is just

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.439 
does what you do to correct that is just
what<00:05:04.320> we<00:05:04.410> did<00:05:04.560> when<00:05:05.430> we<00:05:05.460> wanted<00:05:05.910> to<00:05:06.030> merge<00:05:06.270> the

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
what we did when we wanted to merge the

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.540 
what we did when we wanted to merge the
thing<00:05:06.770> except<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:07.830> don't<00:05:07.919> press<00:05:08.099> merge<00:05:08.340> that

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
thing except you don't press merge that

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.750 
thing except you don't press merge that
