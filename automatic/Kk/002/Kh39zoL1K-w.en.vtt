00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
and initially you'll see kind of a ittle

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.180 
and initially you'll see kind of a ittle
he'll<00:00:47.720> see<00:00:47.960> my<00:00:48.110> call<00:00:48.290> this<00:00:48.380> is<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:48.680> wrong<00:00:48.860> size

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
he'll see my call this is the wrong size

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.869 
he'll see my call this is the wrong size
or<00:00:49.220> it's<00:00:49.550> not<00:00:49.670> fitting<00:00:49.940> too<00:00:50.210> well<00:00:51.190> but<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.760> way

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
or it's not fitting too well but the way

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.520 
or it's not fitting too well but the way
the<00:00:53.120> size<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:53.870> all<00:00:54.110> designed

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
the size of this is all designed

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.920 
the size of this is all designed
correctly<00:00:55.370> but<00:00:55.940> as<00:00:56.059> we<00:00:56.180> because<00:00:56.420> we<00:00:56.570> work<00:00:56.750> it

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
correctly but as we because we work it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.369 
correctly but as we because we work it
in<00:00:57.079> it'll<00:00:57.820> just<00:00:58.820> kind<00:00:58.970> of<00:00:59.090> almost<00:00:59.720> like<00:00:59.930> a<00:00:59.989> like

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
in it'll just kind of almost like a like

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.869 
in it'll just kind of almost like a like
a<00:01:00.410> pair<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.739> shoes<00:01:01.040> you<00:01:01.220> got<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.460> kind<00:01:01.550> of<00:01:01.670> fit

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
a pair of shoes you got to kind of fit

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:02.350 
a pair of shoes you got to kind of fit
it<00:01:02.000> in

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
it in

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.170 
it in
so<00:01:03.110> as<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.379> manipulate<00:01:03.949> it<00:01:03.980> get<00:01:04.910> it<00:01:05.000> into

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
so as you manipulate it get it into

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.560 
so as you manipulate it get it into
place<00:01:06.430> it'll<00:01:07.430> begin<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:07.880> relax<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.509> is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
place it'll begin to relax this is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.950 
place it'll begin to relax this is
leather<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.040> will<00:01:10.190> relax<00:01:13.509> so<00:01:14.509> now<00:01:14.660> once

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
leather but it will relax so now once

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.920 
leather but it will relax so now once
it's<00:01:15.170> in<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.650> cover<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.280> zipped<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.119> just

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
it's in the cover and zipped in just

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.620 
it's in the cover and zipped in just
kind<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.610> manipulate<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.789> move<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.300> around<00:01:20.390> a

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
kind of manipulate it move it around a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.840 
kind of manipulate it move it around a
little<00:01:20.720> bit<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.350> it'll<00:01:21.680> begin<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.280> fit<00:01:22.700> into

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
little bit and it'll begin to fit into

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.980 
little bit and it'll begin to fit into
place<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.990> once<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.770> once<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.160> do<00:01:25.640> that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
place and once it once you do that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.320 
place and once it once you do that
you'll<00:01:26.990> see<00:01:27.259> that<00:01:27.440> it's<00:01:27.710> not<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:32.000> it'll<00:01:32.210> be

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
you'll see that it's not that it'll be

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.210 
you'll see that it's not that it'll be
all<00:01:32.509> right<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.869> if<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.470> can<00:01:33.649> see<00:01:33.800> now<00:01:33.979> it's

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
all right and if you can see now it's

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.650 
all right and if you can see now it's
fitting<00:01:34.580> in<00:01:34.700> fine<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:36.700> at<00:01:37.700> first<00:01:38.060> like<00:01:38.360> I<00:01:38.450> said

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
fitting in fine so at first like I said

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.139 
fitting in fine so at first like I said
it<00:01:38.810> kind<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:39.950> might<00:01:40.100> crinkle<00:01:40.910> up<00:01:41.000> with

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
it kind of you might crinkle up with

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.120 
it kind of you might crinkle up with
just<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.390> little<00:01:41.660> bit<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.530> as<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:42.860> use<00:01:43.100> it

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
just a little bit but as you use it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.040 
just a little bit but as you use it
it'll<00:01:43.550> begin<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.060> fit<00:01:44.210> into<00:01:44.330> place<00:01:44.539> and<00:01:45.020> just

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
it'll begin to fit into place and just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.950 
it'll begin to fit into place and just
kind<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.860> maneuver<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:46.490> little<00:01:46.700> bit<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.179> it

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
kind of maneuver it a little bit and it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.590 
kind of maneuver it a little bit and it
will<00:01:48.200> be<00:01:48.470> just<00:01:49.220> what<00:01:49.400> you<00:01:49.520> want<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.909> be<00:01:50.090> but

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
will be just what you want it to be but

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.740 
will be just what you want it to be but
if<00:01:50.720> it's<00:01:50.930> if<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.560> goes<00:01:52.009> on<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.700> sloppy<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.570> too

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
if it's if it goes on to sloppy and too

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.950 
if it's if it goes on to sloppy and too
loose<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:55.070> won't<00:01:55.250> like<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:55.460> either<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.600> just

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
loose you won't like that either so just

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.149 
loose you won't like that either so just
keep<00:01:57.200> on<00:01:57.350> working<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.640> book<00:01:58.960> into<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.350> cover

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
keep on working the book into the cover

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.960 
keep on working the book into the cover
and<00:02:01.820> it'll<00:02:02.180> be<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.299> nice<00:02:02.570> tight<00:02:03.320> fit<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.920> as<00:02:04.820> you

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
and it'll be a nice tight fit and as you

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.060 
and it'll be a nice tight fit and as you
can<00:02:05.180> see<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.170> looks<00:02:06.470> just<00:02:06.799> like<00:02:06.950> a

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
can see that it looks just like a

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.650 
can see that it looks just like a
regular<00:02:07.310> Bible<00:02:07.909> almost<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.239> you've<00:02:08.360> got<00:02:08.540> it

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
regular Bible almost like you've got it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.900 
regular Bible almost like you've got it
bound<00:02:09.070> but<00:02:10.070> what's<00:02:10.280> really<00:02:10.459> nice<00:02:10.579> with<00:02:10.790> the

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
bound but what's really nice with the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.509 
bound but what's really nice with the
zipper<00:02:11.269> is<00:02:11.329> it's<00:02:11.510> going<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.690> protect<00:02:12.310> your<00:02:13.310> add

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
zipper is it's going to protect your add

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.479

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.570 
onto here to this turn
and<00:02:57.090> because<00:02:57.960> of<00:02:57.990> our<00:02:58.170> leather<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.710> very<00:02:58.830> as

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580

and because of our leather is very as
thicker<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.330> heavier<00:03:01.040> that's<00:03:02.040> what<00:03:02.160> we<00:03:02.250> saw<00:03:02.400> it
