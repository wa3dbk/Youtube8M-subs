advantage of all of the compute resource
that<00:02:44.299> we've<00:02:44.450> got<00:02:44.629> within<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.959> building<00:02:45.319> one

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
that we've got within the building one

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.949 
that we've got within the building one
of<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.129> things<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.519> platforms<00:02:47.269> LSF<00:02:47.690> will

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
of the things that platforms LSF will

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.380 
of the things that platforms LSF will
allow<00:02:48.170> us<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:48.500> do<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.430> incorporate<00:02:49.760> some<00:02:50.359> of

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
allow us to do is to incorporate some of

allow us to do is to incorporate some of
the<00:02:50.569> desktop<00:02:51.019> machines<00:02:51.440> or<00:02:51.739> still<00:02:52.489> powerful

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
the desktop machines or still powerful

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.789 
the desktop machines or still powerful
machines<00:02:53.329> which<00:02:54.140> are<00:02:54.260> being<00:02:54.500> used<00:02:54.680> for

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
machines which are being used for

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.009 
machines which are being used for
computer-aided<00:02:55.310> design<00:02:55.579> at<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.060> moment<00:02:56.450> but

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
computer-aided design at the moment but

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.270 
computer-aided design at the moment but
to<00:02:57.140> incorporate<00:02:57.680> them<00:02:57.799> into<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.129> virtual

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
to incorporate them into the virtual

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.690 
to incorporate them into the virtual
cluster<00:02:59.409> when<00:03:00.409> they're<00:03:00.590> not<00:03:00.739> being<00:03:00.890> used<00:03:01.250> when

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
cluster when they're not being used when

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.430 
cluster when they're not being used when
our<00:03:01.879> engineers<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.510> disappeared<00:03:03.200> for<00:03:03.379> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
our engineers have disappeared for the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.819 
our engineers have disappeared for the
night<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:04.099> get<00:03:04.700> some<00:03:04.760> well-earned<00:03:05.180> rest<00:03:05.829> the

night to get some well-earned rest the

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.470 
night to get some well-earned rest the
great<00:03:07.069> thing<00:03:07.220> about<00:03:07.310> platform<00:03:07.849> is<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.209> they

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
great thing about platform is that they

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.990 
great thing about platform is that they
came<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.230> as<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.500> true<00:03:09.859> innovation<00:03:10.250> partner<00:03:10.849> not

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000
