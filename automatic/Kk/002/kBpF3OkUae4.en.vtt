00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Congo is no national amusement 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.020
 to crash around with it hello 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.460
 together because the film factory have 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.889
 grandmaster is brought 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 opening film of the berlinale 2013 from 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.089
 housing was even the jury itself 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.789
 president he is the story of two 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.920
 Master once he comes from the south 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.470
 she comes from the north and the roads 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.689
 intersect in the hometown 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.140
 at the same time, it is also of God 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.730
 that's the name of jesus, the chinese name 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.650
 her father is also a big one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.530
 grief is there in these too 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.930
 home of him in the brothel as 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.570
 to be sent to the war 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.550
 this is 1936 one year before the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 Japanese invasion and in this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.719
 Model meets just the whole 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 martial arts world and that's why 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.780
 this film built and how the whole 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.050
 looks like he sees it here in one 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.050
 neckline 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.479
 when the film opens the berlinale 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.399
 one sees in the press demonstration 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.289
 with a little more awe into it 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.360
 thinks okay intended 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.159
 a little masterpiece 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 and there you are still relatively fast 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.939
 disappointed one in any case be the first 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.369
 to stage king in great pictures and 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.009
 martial arts movies say tomorrow last 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.850
 time not as good as here the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.500
 is this a 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.599
 unfortunately, you have to go back 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.890
 quickly realize that the style is so 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.959
 the stylistic somehow im 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.459
 foreground stands and I feel 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.140
 that the director is so very much a 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.909
 a little bit cool what he finds there somehow 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.229
 bring to the screen that he realizes 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.750
 One of the main thing is that it's almost easy 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.220
 every fight scene with slower frames 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.080
 you will be shown the feeling you see 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.209
 already crazy of video game and quite 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.140
 looks funny or just a real one 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.090
 slow motion 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.280
 that is somehow all that the film 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.079
 Land has to offer in degenerate 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.269
 fight scenes you look for again and again 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.010
 You always look for everything in it 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.599
 slow motion one loses though one yes 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.829
 everything slows down completely 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.810
 Overview what's in this fight scenes 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.280
 happens and I find that a bit 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.810
 too bad because the movie looks at some 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.989
 put up well but the thirtieth 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.450
 felt fight scene in slow-moving rain 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.430
 then it really gets on the nerves and the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.900
 film is not exactly that short 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.030
 I'm a bit zwiegespalten there 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.250
 Although great house but there is 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.060
 Also more that the means to the purpose than 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.859
 vice versa 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.440
 and that's a pity about it 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.760
 the movie is not so I have to 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.709
 First of all, I have to clarify one thing 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750
 not mind if film great 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.310
 looks may also celebrate itself 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.170
 when I'm filming martial arts now 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.519
 see how house of flying daggers the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.200
 actually the whole party is celebrating 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.430
 But time itself brings at least 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.170
 creative ideas 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.130
 So if I have a crazy fight 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.200
 again and again from another 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.819
 perspective or crazy 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.989
 Underground or whatever 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.940
 then I'll watch me one too 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.870
 self-glorification of the whole too 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.459
 somehow like to 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.390
 at home here as such because 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.290
 just happens 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.720
 because that's just a lot deeper 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.500
 history and now just the packaging 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.850
 Pretty cool 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.560
 So imagine you would 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.850
 get a free Christmas present 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.800
 packed you have never had one 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.850
 Nice packaging is already seen 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.860
 good times you see under the Christmas tree 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.720
 great if this is unpacked there 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.440
 not much in it then it is one 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.330
 a pity 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.310
 and that's exactly what I think you can do this 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.540
 bring film relatively well on the point 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.160
 he looks fantastic 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.420
 But it always repeats exactly as it does 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.430
 I have already done so now 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.180
 do and that's why I finish the whole 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.550
 now with a little disappointed 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.530
 mediocre film judgment to the grand 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.540
 master who should the gram do you have 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.640
 now in the cinema are on everyone 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.739
 case picture fetishists who tell me 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.390
 shit no matter what it's all about 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.340
 staged great I want every one of me 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.690
 picture at home then hangs on the wall 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.050
 Look at this movie in any case 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.150
 on 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.160
 also martial arts fans so many movies 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.810
 do not even come out so you are 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.350
 her fans of such film then you go 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.239
 to the movies 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.040
 who should not watch the movie? 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.690
 are just those who say it's great that 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.310
 It looks nice but I need one 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.140
 a little more substance has the film 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.790
 do not look at it or not 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.410
 people say okay that looks action 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.130
 moderately from the trailer also sees that 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.600
 fantastic 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.310
 I assume I get 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.510
 Fast-paced movie delivered with great 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.030
 content 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.340
 the tempo is missing completely it is very long 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.590
 Because of this, who is expecting something like that and 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.270
 also what long-winded has no desire 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.950
 should not synonymous this movie 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.090
 watch my personal in the cinema 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.890
 rating also falls a bit 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.240
 zwiegespalten from that location is then 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.020
 the pro and contras a bit 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.850
 compensate 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.610
 that's why I give 5 out of 10 points 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.130
 grandmaster led the berlinale of 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.720
 many also as a master 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.880
 has been designated so you can now 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.860
 make your own picture out of it 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.510
 Film offers eye food is just 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.110
 a bit boring because of 5 of 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.100
 10 points for webmaster liked master 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.020

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.789

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.060
 which films are stylistically so successful 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.860

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.910

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.470
