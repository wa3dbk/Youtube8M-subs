00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
functionally to 1287 but to me they have

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.209 
functionally to 1287 but to me they have
a<00:00:57.230> bigger<00:00:57.410> sound<00:00:57.589> they<00:00:57.859> sounded<00:00:58.100> their

a bigger sound they sounded their

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.009 
a bigger sound they sounded their

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
october preamp tubes and they sound I

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.169 
october preamp tubes and they sound I
think<00:01:00.530> this<00:01:00.589> sound<00:01:00.769> better<00:01:00.940> not<00:01:01.940> that<00:01:02.030> there's

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
think this sound better not that there's

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.479 
think this sound better not that there's
anything<00:01:02.329> wrong<00:01:02.449> with<00:01:02.570> 12ax7<00:01:02.989> s<00:01:03.350> but<00:01:03.530> let<00:01:04.460> me

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
anything wrong with 12ax7 s but let me

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.610 
anything wrong with 12ax7 s but let me
give<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.730> a<00:01:04.790> little<00:01:04.820> bit<00:01:05.059> of<00:01:05.620> demonstration

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
in as much boost or as little as you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.730 
in as much boost or as little as you
want<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:41.720> gives<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.260> little<00:01:42.440> bit<00:01:42.530> more

time for my solo I hit up to minus 8 or
I<00:02:46.040> hit<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.340> foot<00:02:46.459> switch<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.850> goes<00:02:46.970> up<00:02:47.120> to

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
I hit the foot switch and it goes up to

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.660 
I hit the foot switch and it goes up to
minus<00:02:47.360> 8

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.819 

and<00:02:53.670> off<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.120> go<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.599> solo<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> true

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
and off I go on the solo so it's a true

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.110 
and off I go on the solo so it's a true
volume<00:02:56.159> boost<00:02:56.340> which<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.849> something<00:02:57.030> you

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
volume boost which is something you

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.759 
volume boost which is something you
can't<00:02:57.390> do<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.689> you're<00:02:57.810> overdriving<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.349> non

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
can't do if you're overdriving the non

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.199 
can't do if you're overdriving the non
master<00:02:59.129> volume<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.459> you're<00:02:59.640> overdriving<00:02:59.939> it

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
master volume if you're overdriving it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.459 
master volume if you're overdriving it
you<00:03:00.299> can't<00:03:00.510> really<00:03:00.659> get<00:03:00.810> louder<00:03:00.989> with<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.230> pedal

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
you can't really get louder with a pedal

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.679 
you can't really get louder with a pedal
in<00:03:01.560> front<00:03:01.799> so<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.310> takes<00:03:02.640> care<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.939> making<00:03:03.510> it

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
in front so that takes care of making it

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.910 
in front so that takes care of making it
louder<00:03:03.810> at<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.349> back<00:03:04.500> end<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.510> there<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.599> go

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
louder at the back end and there you go

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.250 
louder at the back end and there you go
