00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi guys are fail and this is the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.100
 new installment of the best launchers for 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.379
 Android 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.210
 this night is called sic sky and how 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.070
 always the link can be found in the description 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.710
 this launcher has a graphic 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.680
 quite minimalist and you can't 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.400
 put in the widget and apps on the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.800
 home screen 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.850
 then this is the homescreen then 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 as you see here we have only then with 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.170
 written the method where I live and then 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.490
 you have written the date below Sunday 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 19 January 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.649
 here these sisters to go there 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.230
 applications and here is to go to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.700
 says settings if we make a slide 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.469
 from left to right 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.469
 no sorry from left to right 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.480
 there was a slight snap because I want to 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.210
 remember that it is still in beta though 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 interest a beta is really complete 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.640
 is finished another has not found 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.789
 no problem 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.680
 except this snap that it only does with 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.940
 just doing this slide from the left 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.129
 to the right 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 here the weather will appear as you see 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.969
 we read our city and all 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.369
 characteristics of the medium if we do 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.740
 still the slide to the right will show up 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.049
 the day today from the morning 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.909
 until the evening and all temperatures 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.130
 that there is every hour for which every hour there 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.020
 will say if we are 10 degrees 25 degrees 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.360
 a thousand billion degrees speaks to us 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 notified here and if we still do one 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.630
 slides we will be judged the days 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.340
 example Sunday Monday Tuesday 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.210
 Wednesday and so free we would have all the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 present here from Sunday until Saturday 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.470
 of the next week for which of the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.470
 next week next that is between two 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.420
 weeks in a few words then we press 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.770
 the back button and screen today do not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.619
 I can talk by making the slide from 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.320
 right to left instead they will come 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.299
 all the things that will be presented to us 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.030
 we have in the calendar for which I in 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.710
 this case only birthday events 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.840
 because it is not Mr. anything 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 calendar ok making a slide 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 from top to bottom they would be 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.049
 let's say the settings and the panel of 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.060
 cellphone control with 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.039
 calendar setting ie not 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.289
 just look for the calendar what 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.549
 we have seen before doing 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.319
 to the right to the left then the time there 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.180
 will always be presented as a side 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.530
 from left to right as I have 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.340
 shown first and then the settings of 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.599
 the settings of the whole launcher 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.670
 general if we want to put in full 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.870
 screen, however, inventing it informs that not 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.859
 we would have the bar here 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.510
 then there is the top bar if we use the format 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:39.889
 24 hours for the accommodation the button the bar 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.769
 double tap 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.659
 the panel here are all 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.959
 settings we have as mentioned for 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:50.720
 the swiss life I had done before and 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.720
 then other things I don't know what to do 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.159
 see at the end are crap 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.739
 if instead we try this button we 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.310
 is here we will go into the menu and the menu is 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.799
 done in a pretty nice way to me 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.689
 like as done with always with the time 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.120
 quiet, etc., etc. as you say 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.519
 we would have set it this way 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.930
 application there is a row a row with 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.459
 four application a column of 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.280
 four applications that may 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.419
 put up to six columns up to six 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.000
 But lines will come out like that 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:26.000
 so maybe he likes it too 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.370
 absolutely yes though it's for my taste 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.590
 it's cool to see absolutely in the fridge 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.769
 to see, however, is a bit but its own 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.959
 slightly confused, no I don't 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.479
 I can then captain the lancer as 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.389
 said it is very minimalist so the 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:43.579
 review was very short however it is 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.829
 some nice handsome in his 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.479
 simplicity for which this launcher is 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.180
 advice to those who do not want too many problems 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.739
 to whom as to the people who have 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.229
 chosen iphone the iphone chose it 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.239
 also for not having too many widgets 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.680
 by bike to have a quick thing where 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.409
 click and go 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.470
 let's say you throw it a little too well 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.259
 however it has its charm you see to these 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.659
 has a style quite with black on the col 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.879
 transparent black the white above which has 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.439
 its really cute effect too 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.180
 set this way with all 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.060
 those applications makes its effect on 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.289
 its dirty effect nothing i hope the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.389
 video you enjoyed clicking i like it 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.290
 I remember facebook twitter page 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.090
 instagram 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.920
 go no I do n't have it in definition 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.380
 however the others are in descriptions for 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.380
