are thinner some of them if you plant
the<00:00:25.920> big<00:00:26.099> radishes<00:00:26.910> might<00:00:27.240> get<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> size<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
have spacing like this is a good space

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.799 
have spacing like this is a good space
right<00:00:32.910> there<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:34.200> work<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.410> way<00:00:34.710> down

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
depending on a variety these are globe

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.190 
depending on a variety these are globe
radishes<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.480> they're<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> compete<00:00:40.170> for

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
radishes so they're going to compete for

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350 
radishes so they're going to compete for
space<00:00:40.530> right<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.399> were<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.790> more

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
space right here if they were just more

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180

down making sure there's it you know
maybe<00:01:00.329> an<00:01:00.750> inch<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.949> one's<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.309> bit

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
maybe an inch that one's a little bit

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.380 
maybe an inch that one's a little bit
close<00:01:02.989> that<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.350> thinned<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:05.210> work<00:01:06.210> my

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
close that will get thinned out work my

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
close that will get thinned out work my
way<00:01:06.570> down<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:08.840> they<00:01:09.840> look<00:01:10.020> pretty<00:01:10.500> good<00:01:10.680> go

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
way down and they look pretty good go

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.289 
way down and they look pretty good go
over<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> next<00:01:12.150> row<00:01:13.820> you<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.939> that's<00:01:15.150> not

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
over to the next row you know that's not

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.550 
over to the next row you know that's not
quite<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:15.750> inch<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> leave

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
quite an inch but I'm going to leave

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.649 
quite an inch but I'm going to leave
that<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.119> come<00:01:18.270> out

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that one one of these have to come out

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.550 
that one one of these have to come out
and<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.240> gap<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.229> that's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and you can see a gap like that that's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960 
and you can see a gap like that that's
okay<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.100> most<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> space<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.820> want

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
okay but most of the space you want

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
okay but most of the space you want
about<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.330> wide<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> keep

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
about this wide and then you keep

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.819 
about this wide and then you keep
working<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:27.229> pretty<00:01:28.229> good<00:01:28.320> pretty

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
working your way down pretty good pretty

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.080 
working your way down pretty good pretty
good<00:01:30.170> I'll<00:01:31.170> leave<00:01:31.409> those<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.759> rest<00:01:32.939> of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
good I'll leave those and the rest of

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
good I'll leave those and the rest of
them<00:01:33.590> look<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.619> they're<00:01:34.979> pretty<00:01:35.130> well

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
them look like they're pretty well

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.020 
them look like they're pretty well
spaced<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> will<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.640> perfect<00:01:38.640> spacing

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
spaced so that will be perfect spacing

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.499 
spaced so that will be perfect spacing
for<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.369> round<00:01:41.369> radishes<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.970> come<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
for the round radishes to come in and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
for the round radishes to come in and
then<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.869> third<00:01:43.110> line<00:01:43.320> over<00:01:43.619> are<00:01:43.829> my<00:01:44.130> French

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
then the third line over are my French

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.569 
then the third line over are my French
breakfast<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> tend<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> leave<00:01:45.600> those<00:01:46.579> growing

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
breakfast I tend to leave those growing

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.160 
breakfast I tend to leave those growing
a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.790> bit<00:01:47.939> closer<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.780> other<00:01:48.930> thing<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
a little bit closer the other thing I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.230 
a little bit closer the other thing I
want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> show<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.759> there's<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> couple<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
want to show you there's a couple of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.319 
want to show you there's a couple of
holes<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.430> leaves<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.060> from

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
holes in the leaves and that's from

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.480 
holes in the leaves and that's from
snails<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> best<00:01:55.619> way<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.829> treat

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
snails and the best way to treat

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.510 
snails and the best way to treat
snails<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.689> use<00:01:58.469> iron<00:01:58.770> phosphate<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
snails is to use iron phosphate and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.230 
snails is to use iron phosphate and
that's<00:01:59.640> just<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.409> bait<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.680> put<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that's just a bait that you put on the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.319 
that's just a bait that you put on the
ground<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.200> snail<00:02:04.979> comes<00:02:05.280> over<00:02:05.549> eats<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
ground the snail comes over eats the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.359 
ground the snail comes over eats the
bait<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.780> interrupts<00:02:07.200> its<00:02:07.409> digestive<00:02:08.009> system

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
bait it interrupts its digestive system

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.580 
bait it interrupts its digestive system
and<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> snail<00:02:08.819> dies<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.929> very

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and the snail dies and it's very

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.030 
and the snail dies and it's very
non-toxic<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> recommend

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
non-toxic it's what I recommend

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.410 
non-toxic it's what I recommend
for<00:02:13.189> snail<00:02:13.629> control<00:02:14.629> in<00:02:14.780> your<00:02:14.810> garden<00:02:16.420> final

tip is that you can see these radishes

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.910 
tip is that you can see these radishes
are<00:02:20.299> a<00:02:20.329> couple<00:02:20.629> inches<00:02:21.019> high<00:02:21.170> they<00:02:21.439> have<00:02:21.469> a<00:02:21.650> lot

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
are a couple inches high they have a lot

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.080 
are a couple inches high they have a lot
of<00:02:21.950> leaves<00:02:22.310> now<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.239> would<00:02:23.629> plant<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:25.090> second

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
of leaves now I would plant a second

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.849 
of leaves now I would plant a second
sowing<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.599> radishes<00:02:27.049> you<00:02:27.379> don't<00:02:27.590> want<00:02:27.769> to

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
sowing of radishes you don't want to

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.229 
sowing of radishes you don't want to
plant<00:02:28.069> like<00:02:28.340> for<00:02:28.519> instance<00:02:28.640> there's<00:02:29.030> three

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
plant like for instance there's three

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.059 
plant like for instance there's three
rows<00:02:29.390> here<00:02:29.599> you<00:02:30.019> don't<00:02:30.230> want<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.409> do<00:02:30.500> six<00:02:30.859> rows

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
rows here you don't want to do six rows

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.800 
rows here you don't want to do six rows
all<00:02:31.310> at<00:02:31.459> once<00:02:31.670> because<00:02:32.090> you'll<00:02:32.209> end<00:02:32.510> up<00:02:32.629> with

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
all at once because you'll end up with

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.429 
all at once because you'll end up with
six<00:02:34.030> rows<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.239> radishes<00:02:35.569> all<00:02:35.840> maturing<00:02:36.260> at<00:02:36.349> the

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
six rows of radishes all maturing at the

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.780 
six rows of radishes all maturing at the
same<00:02:36.650> time<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.189> that's<00:02:37.310> going<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.519> be<00:02:37.609> a<00:02:37.640> lot

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
same time and that's going to be a lot

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.940 
same time and that's going to be a lot
of<00:02:37.819> radishes<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.510> eat<00:02:38.659> so<00:02:39.079> you<00:02:39.139> wait<00:02:39.470> about<00:02:39.590> two

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
of radishes to eat so you wait about two

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
of radishes to eat so you wait about two
weeks<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.579> your<00:02:40.730> plants<00:02:41.030> look<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:41.329> this<00:02:41.569> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
weeks to your plants look like this and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.990 
weeks to your plants look like this and
then<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.379> put<00:02:42.590> in<00:02:42.709> another<00:02:43.099> three<00:02:43.459> rows<00:02:43.700> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
then you put in another three rows and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.479 
then you put in another three rows and
that's<00:02:44.420> some<00:02:44.750> succession<00:02:45.409> planting<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
that's some succession planting so you

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.849 
that's some succession planting so you
have<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.639> continuous<00:02:47.389> continuous<00:02:48.079> crop<00:02:48.680> of
