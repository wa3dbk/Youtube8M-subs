00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Hello such good morning to all good 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.210
 today I bring you a video that they are not going to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.639
 can refuse to see that being 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.840
 in our homes or our offices 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.940
 there is no impediment to be able 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.340
 train when we have a free time 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 we must keep an open mind and see 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.580
 that any furniture or place of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.580
 house is a good area to train 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.539
 steering wheel very simple exercise 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.149
 realize I can be very close 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.559
 we can cotton station if you are 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.270
 in a place that does not have any kind of 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.280
 apparatus for exercise 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.040
 and here what we are achieving is a 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.310
 tricel congestion 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.790
 I can gather more tannins 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.790
 Y 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.900
 and we will achieve more as management 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.900
 still 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.950
 pretty good exercises remember that 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.850
 it is always a good time to train and 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.160
 stay in shape 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.920
 so if at the moment they feel like 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.470
 train they have a little free time 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.500
 and get an armchair 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.390
 is super eating 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.330
 and we visit guayas we do not stay 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.240
 only in exercising happy with this 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.860
 we can also do push- ups we put 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.580
 hands in this way 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.730
 Y 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.730
 we do our practices with a 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.810
 small lift 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.810
 of the horizontal plane 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.609
 another very good exercise if they have something 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.469
 it's called no but now we continue with this 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.030
 we can start doing 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.579
 lizards on the ground and when there 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.039
 some more we are going to come here in this 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.549
 table and we're going to do all the 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:55.509
 we can till muscle 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.810
 find completely exhausted and we're going 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.070
 to achieve a very good congestion of the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.260
 pectoral 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.409
 because we already know that the more the 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.679
 easier lifting is doing push-ups 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.050
 so first I sing to school in the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.410
 floor then come in a place like this 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.410
 elevator
