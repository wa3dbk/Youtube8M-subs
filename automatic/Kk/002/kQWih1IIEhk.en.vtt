00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 well now we're all here with 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.240
 another video and today we finally have the moll 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.150
 of 7 x 7 of the ocu but the cubic up 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.889
 now it was only the moyo was domed and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
 finally they have removed the cubic version that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.109
 very many of us were waiting because 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.390
 Well let's take it out and we'll talk about 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.420
 this cube not here have I have 21 in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 black background and other on white background and the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.429
 I really wanted so much 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.790
 and yesterday I could not resist opening the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.829
 I tried and I have to say they are a 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.360
 good wonder let's compare the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.579
 size because it is that the truth is that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 a big cube then let's see the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.129
 size vs. 7 7 mini that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 I have here 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.050
 this is 7% descent the mini a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.410
 super cube and let's compare it with 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.410
 this 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.760
 practically the same is a tad 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.110
 It's a little bit bigger but it's barely 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.629
 denotes the difference the truth is that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.300
 for a 7 by 7 it is very good size as 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.949
 you see the stick is something small then they 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 I will put one text so they are bigger 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.180
 not that it covers a little more or good 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.770
 I'll buy maybe they'll explain the not now 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.210
 that are worth to compete and that is already 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.140
 everything all covered with that in the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.180
 problem you see its spectacular turn 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 yesterday the truth is that I was doing a lot 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.860
 time that did not solve 7 for 7 and yesterday 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:27.970
 when I came it is a sun see in 5 minutes 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.380
 39 and half me half officer had it 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.300
 559 and a lot of time ago I did not 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.370
 solved that is that the cube the truth is 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.900
 that helped me a lot because it's leaving you 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.700
 give him the turns very well in the part of 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.640
 back therefore the inner part as 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.160
 the 3 x 3 part is spectacular and the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.500
 it's true that you notice that it's going again not 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.210
 I played for nothing maybe go a little 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.310
 tight this we're going tight this 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.870
 example the black background is that even 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.870
 in the sound it felt tighter 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.420
 this harder more a little more a little 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.490
 tight even maybe it would be good 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.700
 drop this because I doubt this much 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.289
 I think he has a very good cut see there 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.910
 happening to us even from the line of the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.370
 piece that was usually glued 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.050
 even cut out the truth that we did 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.030
 well let's ride that we leave 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.700
 roll and so we see a bit like tour around 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.620
 all faces the happy cousin when 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.840
 pille had by what you have wrecked 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.459
 is going to mark a mother of mine when she 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.840
 accustom this brand about 7 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.180
 a hundred is that it's scary to see them 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.730
 apart from that nothing already has the record 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.330
 of the world or imagine with a good quota 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.200
 good good because this truth is that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.370
 I save 17 for 7 that goes a little loose 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.840
 it goes a little loose that you do not 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.489
 I have here but it's a bit loose and 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.769
 I have it quite used because I have 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.690
 solved many times then it goes 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.060
 Even better is the turn of the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.280
 fingers a wash I love the bus 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.379
 incredible hand but the good thing is that this one 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.750
 yes you can walk better the turns in 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.940
 the side fu as has the corners very 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.910
 small and above all the fall 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.500
 so the survey costs to give you the 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.359
 movements a little fast he wants to give 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.670
 one turn and you take two layers unintentionally 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.840
 this in this does not happen because of that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.180
 I'm waiting for this cube because this one 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.010
 note that this line of pieces of more 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.140
 small and these larger lines more 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.970
 or less like here 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.459
 here also happens something like that then 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.050
 that 's very good because when you die 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.640
 only the back fortress only 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.209
 you can the back by three in 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.690
 frozen 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.220
 the corner costs sometimes but it is a 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.830
 excellent excellent cube I have competed 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.350
 with adolfo dominated several times but 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.260
 I doubted much between the bomb do and this 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.640
 because I liked the turn of the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.610
 but this one I liked the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.220
 grip now I have a function of the 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.560
 two that is the host wins this I'm going to 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.989
 drop a little and has lubricated and all that 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.840
 well not now but then when 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.640
 I have already left a little more 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.290
 I would like to adjust and I'm sure he stayed 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.420
 in spectacular flight good its appearance 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.100
 disassembled of course would make him fall to 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.140
 remove all these crap stickers 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.850
 because they are very fat I do not like the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.640
 Vinyl thickness is too big in 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.680
 these for example that are the brand of 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.570
 oil stick the thickness of the vinyl is 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.940
 much finer then you do not notice much 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.070
 in this one is pretty fat here it sticks 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.680
 the nail even in this is much more 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.139
 difficult this is much more typical 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.720
 and I do not really like the tones of 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.280
 green change a bit in the yellow ones 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.740
 this also seems a little stronger and 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.419
 those in orange good this would not be 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.460
 another kind of orange but those of 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.660
 Orange is also noticeable then good 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.520
 I'm going to take them off I'm going to 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.419
 put one of the others that I like more 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.240
 get them 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.949
 Well, this is the mobile, this is not what 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.840
 I'm taking a lot and what dismantles 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.370
 because it's just to show us not because 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.380
 be picked up from kubik jet about what 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.410
 bought I already already be for me that this one 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.680
 I already bought the price and this is a 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.180
 cube expensive but expensive clear we do not know 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.949
 I do not know how much we will sell it on how 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.259
 team because we just came to him 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.000
 we have to put a price but 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.830
 directly cost us a dough 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.190
 well I do not know so cheap I do not think that 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.380
 be but good the truth is that a cube 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.259
 this is wonderful the truth is a 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.330
 wonder and this nothing this same all 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.849
 they were softer but you hear a lot more 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.729
 soft but why are we going tight 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.320
 it goes much tighter then good 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.970
 I do not but I prefer it more loose no 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.550
 because at the time of throwing turns but 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.420
 you see and this you can give everything fast 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.450
 that you want me not to occupy 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.560
 they are very good, very good, very good 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.330
 now I will stay here a ratillo 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.350
 solving them by playing with water 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.300
 because it's that since he came 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.660
 I practically did not release it because 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.030
 Cuba already even tell you directly that 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.910
 it's like the other more or less but cubic 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.650
 and the good thing is that's why I grab everything 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.900
 for competition to make it faster 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.760
 the one who wants to solve it calmly 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.040
 that simply takes a 7 for 7 and 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.310
 get to solve it between it and the 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.770
 I recommend the cheapest 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.500
 Maybe because it's that the other tour better 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.150
 even the stick of mine then already when 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.150
 you know that and I let it go and I left it to me 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.860
 surely like turn will rotate is 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.750
 better even like the other but 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.430
 because they are attacked by a tubazo the only thing 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.500
 New chalice and fresh out of the box 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.900
 Well, it's not like the other one that already 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.600
 I have already touched on the initials and all those 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.280
 things as we have seen nothing in Bilbao 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.320
 cubic was developed that what 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.630
 will finally have it and we have already 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.620
 seen so nothing with this I say goodbye and 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.620
 see you in another
