00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.670
 complicate the task and try to find more 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.040
 complex satellite but let's say by example 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.230
 move firmly as the most popular 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.040
 paths naturally need to change the converter 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.040
 on undertale 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.200
 tagscanner is framed and need 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.510
 consider that moment because 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.040
 the satellite is in the west that is a little 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.360
 to the right of these situations in envelopes 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.440
 can also turn clockwise 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.410
 arrow 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.900
 several degrees and respectively 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:19.780
 go back to spectrum mode 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.780
 hot bird from the list 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:32.840
 and we also need to turn the antenna 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.570
 west a few degrees so 36 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.990
 minus 13 is not literal 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.200
 include we have 23 degrees yes it 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.520
 turning the subject by 23 degrees also 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:51.280
 waiting for the poor to burst here burst 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.280
 fixed we fix 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:00.090
 check the garden is one such is a satellite to us 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.810
 managed to catch even the first time 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.840
 there is a transport fixed that it is 13 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.560
 degrees 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 Now we go 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.030
 quality strength mode to more 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.189
 fine tune the antenna pashka 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.189
 poorly so 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.189
 2730 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.660
 3532 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.760
 we will have the maximum value 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.760
 for our antenna 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.310
 can also easily check whether this 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:47.710
 satellite or not and having scanned the channel and 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:51.370
 go to the search channels 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.370
 choose hot bird 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.200
 scanners 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.970
 we scan open channels in principle according to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:11.160
 the list already shows that a lot 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.459
 Arab channels that is already talking 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.560
 about the fact that this is a hot bird all 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.940
 scans we will not interrupt the search 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.940
 check the picture 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.849
 Well, please, we see 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.440
 channel of outcome bert
