seconds<00:02:00.350> needed<00:02:00.649> here<00:02:00.830> otherwise<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.490> Kicks

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
seconds needed here otherwise a Kicks

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.100 
seconds needed here otherwise a Kicks
down<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.330> just<00:02:02.570> there<00:02:02.780> you've<00:02:02.899> got<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:03.020> little

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
down and just there you've got a little

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.420 
down and just there you've got a little
bit<00:02:03.229> wheel<00:02:03.440> spin<00:02:03.649> up<00:02:03.740> with<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.979> cars<00:02:04.190> fully

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
bit wheel spin up with the cars fully

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.469 
bit wheel spin up with the cars fully
loaded<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.820> can<00:02:04.850> feel<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.149> a<00:02:05.210> little<00:02:05.330> bit

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
loaded you can feel this a little bit

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.240 
loaded you can feel this a little bit
twisting<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.899> rear<00:02:06.020> suspension<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.800> you've

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
twisting the rear suspension and you've

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.620 
twisting the rear suspension and you've
got<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.460> manage<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.940> throttle<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:08.479> don't

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
got to manage the throttle so you don't

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.300 
got to manage the throttle so you don't
get<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> unloaded<00:02:09.229> wheel<00:02:09.380> spinning<00:02:10.130> up

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
get the unloaded wheel spinning up

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.500 
get the unloaded wheel spinning up
because<00:02:10.520> also<00:02:10.729> we're<00:02:10.820> doing<00:02:11.000> these<00:02:11.120> laps<00:02:11.360> of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
because also we're doing these laps of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.390 
because also we're doing these laps of
the<00:02:11.630> stability<00:02:12.350> control<00:02:12.650> systems<00:02:13.010> turned<00:02:13.220> off

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
the stability control systems turned off

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.440 
the stability control systems turned off
a<00:02:13.430> little<00:02:13.760> bit<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.910> understeer<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.360> way

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
a little bit of understeer on the way

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.180 
a little bit of understeer on the way
and<00:02:14.750> if<00:02:14.840> it's<00:02:14.930> dance<00:02:15.290> nice<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.709> focused<00:02:15.830> even

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and if it's dance nice and focused even

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.320 
and if it's dance nice and focused even
again<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:16.550> put<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.760> little<00:02:16.910> chair<00:02:17.209> up

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
again you can put that little chair up

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.210 
again you can put that little chair up
as<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:18.110> unloaded<00:02:18.500> rear<00:02:18.650> wheel<00:02:18.800> starts<00:02:19.130> to

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
as the unloaded rear wheel starts to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.280 
as the unloaded rear wheel starts to
light<00:02:19.400> up<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.180> that's<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.390> constant<00:02:20.870> battle

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
light up so that's a constant battle

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.620 
light up so that's a constant battle
just<00:02:21.580> managing<00:02:22.580> traction<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.150> extract<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> lap

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
just managing traction to extract a lap

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.030 
just managing traction to extract a lap
time<00:02:23.810> also<00:02:24.019> you<00:02:24.110> can<00:02:24.320> drive<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.650> car<00:02:24.709> really

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
time also you can drive this car really

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.449 
time also you can drive this car really
sideways<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.790> lovely<00:02:26.120> light<00:02:26.890> feel<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.100> it

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
sideways a lovely light feel to it

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.670 
sideways a lovely light feel to it
such<00:02:28.880> an<00:02:28.970> engaging<00:02:29.239> chassis<00:02:29.630> but<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.019> extract

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
such an engaging chassis but to extract

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.990 
such an engaging chassis but to extract
a<00:02:30.830> lap<00:02:31.010> time<00:02:31.250> you've<00:02:31.459> got<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.790> manage

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
a lap time you've got to just manage

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.240 
a lap time you've got to just manage
that<00:02:32.299> oversteer<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.989> not<00:02:33.830> get<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.070> car

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
that oversteer and not get the car

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.250 
that oversteer and not get the car
moving<00:02:34.519> around<00:02:34.760> too<00:02:34.970> much<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:35.870> quite<00:02:36.049> hard

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
moving around too much it's quite hard

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.259 
moving around too much it's quite hard
work<00:02:36.410> through<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.769> high-speed<00:02:37.269> change

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
work through that high-speed change

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.300 
work through that high-speed change
direction<00:02:38.660> second<00:02:39.230> gear<00:02:39.470> for<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.799> long<00:02:40.130> term

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
direction second gear for the long term

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.270 
direction second gear for the long term
at<00:02:40.430> corner

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
at corner

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.160 
at corner
so<00:02:42.790> third<00:02:43.060> get<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.690> little<00:02:43.840> bit<00:02:43.960> of<00:02:44.020> wheelspin

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
so third get a little bit of wheelspin

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.140 
so third get a little bit of wheelspin

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.940 

but<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.569> first<00:03:08.780> thing<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.319> can<00:03:09.530> feel<00:03:09.800> the

difference<00:03:12.890> but<00:03:13.340> soonish<00:03:13.910> come<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.420> corner

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
difference but soonish come to a corner

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.660 
difference but soonish come to a corner
straightaway<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.739> can<00:03:15.890> feel<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.280> difference

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
straightaway you can feel the difference

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.390 
straightaway you can feel the difference
that<00:03:16.700> was<00:03:17.000> just<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.900> much<00:03:18.170> taller<00:03:18.440> than<00:03:18.920> the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
that was just so much taller than the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
taller than the standard car when it

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.090 
taller than the standard car when it
transitions<00:03:38.180> into<00:03:38.239> oversteer<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.680> diff<00:03:39.890> is

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
transitions into oversteer the diff is

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.559 
transitions into oversteer the diff is
so<00:03:40.280> much<00:03:40.459> better<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.760> just<00:03:40.850> transitions<00:03:41.390> into

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
so much better it just transitions into

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.210 
so much better it just transitions into
smooth<00:03:41.870> oversteer<00:03:42.410> rather<00:03:42.650> than<00:03:42.920> trying<00:03:43.160> to

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
smooth oversteer rather than trying to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.640 
smooth oversteer rather than trying to
spin<00:03:43.519> out<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.730> unloaded<00:03:44.120> wheel<00:03:44.350> it's<00:03:45.350> just

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
spin out the unloaded wheel it's just

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.229 
spin out the unloaded wheel it's just
really<00:03:46.190> feels<00:03:46.519> like<00:03:46.580> a<00:03:46.730> different<00:03:47.000> card<00:03:47.150> it's

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
really feels like a different card it's

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.870 
really feels like a different card it's
more<00:03:47.360> feed<00:03:47.630> in<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.870> steering<00:03:48.440> better<00:03:49.340> hosted

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
more feed in the steering better hosted

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.449 
more feed in the steering better hosted
but<00:03:50.720> again<00:03:50.959> when<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.200> hosts<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.650> it's<00:03:51.890> really

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
but again when it hosts is it's really

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.759 
but again when it hosts is it's really
smooth<00:03:52.849> in<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.120> transition<00:03:53.750> it's<00:03:54.290> just<00:03:54.560> a

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
smooth in the transition it's just a

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.940 
smooth in the transition it's just a
much<00:03:55.069> taller<00:03:55.340> car<00:03:55.880> than<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.209> standard<00:03:56.630> car

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
much taller car than the standard car

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.920 
much taller car than the standard car
just<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.069> easier<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.549> carry<00:03:58.790> speed<00:03:59.180> it's

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
just the easier to carry speed it's

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.509 
just the easier to carry speed it's
still<00:04:00.170> quite<00:04:00.380> an<00:04:00.500> over<00:04:00.739> steering<00:04:00.980> muscle<00:04:01.370> car

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
still quite an over steering muscle car

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.220 
still quite an over steering muscle car
don't<00:04:01.670> get<00:04:01.760> me<00:04:01.819> wrong<00:04:01.970> but<00:04:02.120> it's<00:04:02.180> just<00:04:02.569> does

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
don't get me wrong but it's just does

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.830 
don't get me wrong but it's just does
feel<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.880> very<00:04:04.880> different<00:04:05.120> car<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.630> stay

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
feel like a very different car to stay

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.340 
feel like a very different car to stay
in<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.019> car<00:04:07.120> much<00:04:08.120> much<00:04:08.390> honed<00:04:08.900> everything's

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
in the car much much honed everything's

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
in the car much much honed everything's
honed<00:04:09.560> everything<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:09.980> tie<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.250> down

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
honed everything to tie it down

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.250 
honed everything to tie it down
everything's<00:04:10.910> sharper<00:04:13.660> makes<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.840> standard

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
everything's sharper makes the standard

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.819 
everything's sharper makes the standard
xfr<00:04:15.709> feel<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.010> bit<00:04:16.280> like<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.600> stocky<00:04:17.829> executive

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829

xfr feel a bit like a stocky executive
saloon<00:04:19.269> can<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.299> test<00:04:20.539> them<00:04:20.690> into<00:04:20.900> this<00:04:20.989> car

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
saloon can I test them into this car

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.930 
saloon can I test them into this car
and<00:04:22.300> across<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.870> line<00:04:23.110> in<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:24.550> end<00:04:24.580> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
and across the line in the end the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.540 
and across the line in the end the
Jaguar<00:04:25.330> xfr-s<00:04:25.750> was<00:04:26.140> 1.6<00:04:26.920> seconds<00:04:27.310> quicker

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
Jaguar xfr-s was 1.6 seconds quicker

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.370 
Jaguar xfr-s was 1.6 seconds quicker
than<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.000> standard<00:04:28.360> car<00:04:28.510> but<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.080> it<00:04:29.170> worth

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
than the standard car but is it worth

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.470 
than the standard car but is it worth
the<00:04:29.620> extra<00:04:29.770> money<00:04:30.160> but<00:04:30.670> if<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:30.880> rate<00:04:31.090> driving

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
the extra money but if you rate driving

the extra money but if you rate driving
pleasure<00:04:31.630> above<00:04:32.020> all<00:04:32.170> else<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:32.980> answer

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
pleasure above all else then the answer

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.310 
pleasure above all else then the answer
is<00:04:33.310> guess<00:04:33.700> but<00:04:34.330> it's<00:04:34.450> completely<00:04:34.570> reworked

is guess but it's completely reworked

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.710 
is guess but it's completely reworked
suspension<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:36.160> unique<00:04:36.610> diff<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.270> xfr-s

suspension and unique diff the xfr-s
