that<00:02:43.849> was<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.269> primary<00:02:44.540> version<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.410> know

that was the primary version you know
when<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.769> game<00:02:45.950> releases<00:02:46.459> for<00:02:46.670> both<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.940> 3ds

any Lego in this Lego game but that'd be

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.530 
any Lego in this Lego game but that'd be
okay<00:03:33.380> if<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:33.650> were<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:33.830> good<00:03:34.070> game<00:03:34.280> holy<00:03:35.060> crap

okay if this were a good game holy crap
this<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.810> not<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.440> it's<00:03:37.340> basically<00:03:37.910> a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
this is not that it's basically a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.030 
this is not that it's basically a
simulation<00:03:38.480> game<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:39.110> go<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.350> school<00:03:39.590> you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
simulation game you go to school you

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.400 
simulation game you go to school you
make<00:03:40.400> friends<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.000> do<00:03:41.150> little<00:03:41.360> tasks<00:03:41.990> it's

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
make friends you do little tasks it's

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.290 
make friends you do little tasks it's
like<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.680> wants<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.160> be<00:03:43.250> Lego<00:03:43.580> Animal<00:03:44.150> Crossing

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
like it wants to be Lego Animal Crossing

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.510 
like it wants to be Lego Animal Crossing
only<00:03:44.960> there's<00:03:45.140> very<00:03:45.380> little<00:03:45.620> Lego<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:46.220> hardly

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
only there's very little Lego and hardly

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.270 
only there's very little Lego and hardly
any<00:03:46.670> Animal<00:03:47.120> Crossing<00:03:47.240> which<00:03:48.020> I<00:03:48.380> mean<00:03:48.980> that

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
any Animal Crossing which I mean that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.920 
any Animal Crossing which I mean that
kind<00:03:49.490> of<00:03:49.580> makes<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.790> hard<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.090> be<00:03:50.180> Lego<00:03:50.480> Animal

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
kind of makes it hard to be Lego Animal

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.290 
kind of makes it hard to be Lego Animal
Crossing<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:52.160> there<00:03:52.490> are<00:03:52.580> so<00:03:52.760> many<00:03:53.000> problems

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
Crossing and there are so many problems

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.200 
Crossing and there are so many problems
I<00:03:53.870> don't<00:03:54.590> even<00:03:54.830> know<00:03:55.040> where<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.220> start<00:03:55.310> okay<00:03:56.180> I

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
I don't even know where to start okay I

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.030 
I don't even know where to start okay I
guess<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.570> best<00:03:56.780> places<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:57.650> probably<00:03:57.980> the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
guess the best places it's probably the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.950 
guess the best places it's probably the
production<00:03:58.550> value<00:03:58.910> which<00:03:59.300> is<00:03:59.480> king

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
production value which is king

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.440 
production value which is king
offensively<00:04:00.770> bad<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.760> graphics<00:04:02.300> are

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
offensively bad the graphics are

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.540 
offensively bad the graphics are
terrible<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:03.380> audio<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:03.920> music<00:04:04.310> sounds

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
terrible the audio and the music sounds

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.760 
terrible the audio and the music sounds
like<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.730> was<00:04:04.790> recorded<00:04:05.360> over<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.600> phone<00:04:05.960> the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
like it was recorded over the phone the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.980 
like it was recorded over the phone the
frame<00:04:07.130> rates<00:04:07.400> worse<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:07.880> mean<00:04:07.970> this<00:04:08.690> wouldn't

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
frame rates worse I mean this wouldn't

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.470 
frame rates worse I mean this wouldn't
be<00:04:09.230> good<00:04:09.410> for<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.740> Nintendo<00:04:10.220> 64<00:04:10.910> looks<00:04:11.360> like

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
be good for the Nintendo 64 looks like

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.370 
be good for the Nintendo 64 looks like
claymation

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
claymation

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.470

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.449 
and again claymation looks awesome this
looks<00:04:14.780> hideous<00:04:14.990> fact<00:04:15.920> if<00:04:16.040> you<00:04:16.130> want<00:04:16.280> an<00:04:16.370> idea

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
looks hideous fact if you want an idea

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.160 
looks hideous fact if you want an idea
of<00:04:16.820> how<00:04:16.940> little<00:04:17.180> effort<00:04:17.450> went<00:04:17.840> into<00:04:18.049> this

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
of how little effort went into this

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.440 
of how little effort went into this
thing<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.590> how<00:04:18.680> ugly<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.310> look<00:04:20.060> no<00:04:20.209> further

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
thing and how ugly it is look no further

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.320 
thing and how ugly it is look no further
than<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.260> mean<00:04:21.860> that<00:04:21.980> it's<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:22.730> compressed

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
than this I mean that it's so compressed

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.520 
than this I mean that it's so compressed
it's<00:04:23.720> unwatchable

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
it's unwatchable

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.170 
it's unwatchable
that's<00:04:24.800> your<00:04:24.980> effort<00:04:25.280> this<00:04:25.670> is<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:25.970> level

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
that's your effort this is the level

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:37.510 
that's your effort this is the level
right<00:04:26.600> there

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.040 

like<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.639> said<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:39.270> game<00:04:39.419> is<00:04:39.539> also<00:04:39.689> available

like I said the game is also available

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.379 
like I said the game is also available
on<00:04:40.439> the<00:04:40.559> 3ds<00:04:40.589> and<00:04:41.309> I<00:04:41.429> have<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.789> imagine<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
on the 3ds and I have to imagine the

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.999 
on the 3ds and I have to imagine the
production<00:04:42.809> values<00:04:43.169> are<00:04:43.379> way<00:04:43.649> better<00:04:43.889> for

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
production values are way better for

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.489 
production values are way better for
that<00:04:44.189> one<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.819> this<00:04:45.539> one<00:04:45.749> seems<00:04:45.959> like<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.139> five

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:46.499 
that one this this one seems like a five

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
prettier and even if it ran better game

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.109 
prettier and even if it ran better game
itself<00:04:51.270> still<00:04:51.659> sucks<00:04:52.289> it's<00:04:52.679> like<00:04:52.860> 90%<00:04:53.459> fetch
