00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.580
 Asked to you , we said 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.080
 two more questions to the or two three 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.990

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.730

 always gave short tips to say yes 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.630
 Let's just try my target group 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.820
 Maybe that's not what I can do 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.150
 Go out that they are so fitness so we 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 do not have any body or maybe 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 a few bodybuilders but not so many 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 In between, let's say someone wants to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.590
 just have a good body or 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.469
 just want to be who be slim 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 Being fit and healthy, of course 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.170
 also be 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.969
 what are the most important three tips 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.460
 that you can give someone I say 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.350
 sometimes overweight is simply slim 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.270
 wants to be and wants to be fit so one 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.590
 a very important rule is protein many 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 People who are overweight in eating too 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 The food is usually low in protein 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.079
 either carbs or high in fat 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.449
 mostly the mixture of both 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.329
 I would extremely boot up in the protein 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.559
 So animal herbal whatever 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.300
 There are many sources 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.309
 there can also be a flavio 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.229
 simonetti life in 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.540
 I have high-protein foods 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.150
 also a blog entry with all things 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.549
 where quite a lot 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.330
 food sector are second thing 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.630
 is that a very simple rule I 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.950
 Always say simple rules help in the evening 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.900
 either in the evening or just frustrated 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.580
 to reduce in meal I know 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.049
 people who have, for example, simple 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.240
 Breakfast left it eaten at noon 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.920
 so inter casting is called now 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.579
 a very simple rule again 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.549
 calories calories exactly and also one 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.100
 very cool thing and thirdly to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.250
 lose weight what helps food the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.259
 which have a low calorie density 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.299
 so if you compare noodles or 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.590
 potatoes then I eat the potatoes 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.299
 because they have seawater and less 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.250
 So I'm going to get calories from potatoes 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.740
 Filled faster with less calories 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.450
 next very simple tips you 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.509
 So you can always see what they are doing 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.790
 calorie density and there you can 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.710
 In any case, get some out if you 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 Food is the total 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 Calories need great so thank you very much 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.149
 I think again the 80 20 rule so 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.649
 has brought very compact to the point 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.970
 Of course, a lot more if at all 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.989
 at the end, put in a link 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.129
 meat youtube channel 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.530
 she is probably already the one 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.000
 to be displayed all the time somewhere 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.860
