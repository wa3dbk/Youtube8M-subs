00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
don't think you can go to horribly wrong

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.080 
don't think you can go to horribly wrong
I<00:05:31.800> just<00:05:32.040> found<00:05:32.190> that<00:05:32.370> this<00:05:32.490> is<00:05:32.669> one<00:05:32.850> of<00:05:32.880> the

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
I just found that this is one of the

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.540 
I just found that this is one of the
best<00:05:33.330> ones<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:34.380> know<00:05:34.500> as<00:05:34.620> far<00:05:34.650> as<00:05:34.919> flavor<00:05:35.130> and

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
best ones you know as far as flavor and

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.810 
best ones you know as far as flavor and
the<00:05:36.330> different<00:05:36.750> types<00:05:36.960> of<00:05:37.169> how<00:05:38.040> natural<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.669> is

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
the different types of how natural it is

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.000 
the different types of how natural it is
so<00:05:39.090> i<00:05:39.120> use<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.750> Swanson<00:05:40.260> broth<00:05:40.380> and<00:05:40.680> then<00:05:40.740> I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
so i use the Swanson broth and then I

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.270 
so i use the Swanson broth and then I
just<00:05:41.400> heated<00:05:41.640> up<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.840> add<00:05:43.230> garlic<00:05:43.919> I've

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
just heated up and I add garlic I've

already chopped up my garlic so it's in
this<00:05:46.500> little<00:05:46.770> container<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.580> I'll<00:05:47.760> put<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:47.970> top

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
this little container and I'll put a top

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.880 
this little container and I'll put a top
on<00:05:48.360> it<00:05:48.419> and<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:48.750> way<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:48.930> can<00:05:49.200> use<00:05:49.410> it<00:05:49.440> over<00:05:49.740> and

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
on it and that way I can use it over and

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.800 
on it and that way I can use it over and
over<00:05:50.010> again<00:05:50.220> but<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:50.760> just<00:05:50.940> bagged<00:05:51.180> garlic<00:05:51.720> a

chicken<00:06:06.750> broth<00:06:06.900> also<00:06:07.350> i<00:06:07.380> forgot<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.800> mention

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
chicken broth also i forgot to mention

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.030 
chicken broth also i forgot to mention
chicken<00:06:09.000> broth<00:06:09.180> i<00:06:09.450> also<00:06:09.900> read<00:06:10.290> a<00:06:10.320> study<00:06:10.650> a

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
chicken broth i also read a study a

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.990 
chicken broth i also read a study a
while<00:06:11.460> back<00:06:11.820> where<00:06:12.740> somebody<00:06:13.740> did<00:06:14.610> a<00:06:14.640> study

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
while back where somebody did a study

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.490 
while back where somebody did a study
where<00:06:15.390> they<00:06:15.870> had<00:06:16.590> white<00:06:17.280> blood<00:06:17.580> cells<00:06:17.910> and

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
where they had white blood cells and

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.409 
where they had white blood cells and
they<00:06:19.500> put<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:19.950> chicken<00:06:20.340> broth<00:06:20.520> in<00:06:20.790> and<00:06:21.150> they

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
they put the chicken broth in and they

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.480 
they put the chicken broth in and they
noticed<00:06:21.870> that<00:06:22.110> less<00:06:22.440> white<00:06:22.830> blood<00:06:23.160> cells

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
noticed that less white blood cells

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.150 
noticed that less white blood cells
would<00:06:24.150> travel<00:06:24.570> which<00:06:24.930> is<00:06:25.140> what<00:06:25.380> your<00:06:25.919> body

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
would travel which is what your body

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.810 
would travel which is what your body
releases

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
releases

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.640 
releases
when<00:06:26.910> you<00:06:27.000> have<00:06:27.180> inflammation<00:06:27.630> your<00:06:28.320> it's

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
when you have inflammation your it's

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.960 
when you have inflammation your it's
going<00:06:28.860> to<00:06:28.920> release<00:06:29.160> white<00:06:29.460> blood<00:06:29.670> cells<00:06:29.910> to

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
going to release white blood cells to

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.850 
going to release white blood cells to
fight<00:06:30.090> that<00:06:30.420> off<00:06:30.630> and<00:06:30.870> then<00:06:31.320> the<00:06:31.470> white<00:06:31.620> blood

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
fight that off and then the white blood

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.830 
fight that off and then the white blood
cells<00:06:32.130> produce<00:06:32.400> mucus<00:06:32.790> and<00:06:33.180> you<00:06:33.570> know<00:06:33.690> you're

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
cells produce mucus and you know you're

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.930 
cells produce mucus and you know you're
not<00:06:33.990> going<00:06:34.200> to<00:06:34.260> feel<00:06:34.380> so<00:06:34.620> uh<00:06:34.650> but<00:06:35.280> what<00:06:35.760> they

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
not going to feel so uh but what they

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.580 
not going to feel so uh but what they
did<00:06:36.270> a<00:06:36.300> study<00:06:36.450> that<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:37.080> chicken<00:06:37.410> broth

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
did a study that the chicken broth

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.250 
did a study that the chicken broth
caused<00:06:38.490> the<00:06:38.850> white<00:06:39.030> blood<00:06:39.240> cells<00:06:39.540> to<00:06:39.630> not<00:06:39.900> move

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
caused the white blood cells to not move

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.950 
caused the white blood cells to not move
as<00:06:40.650> much<00:06:40.890> it<00:06:41.160> kind<00:06:41.370> of<00:06:41.430> acted<00:06:41.940> as<00:06:42.060> a<00:06:42.090> barrier<00:06:42.600> so

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
as much it kind of acted as a barrier so

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.340 
as much it kind of acted as a barrier so
it<00:06:43.310> decreases<00:06:44.310> the<00:06:45.180> spread<00:06:45.810> of<00:06:46.050> the<00:06:46.320> infection

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
it decreases the spread of the infection

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.620 
it decreases the spread of the infection
and<00:06:47.160> therefore<00:06:47.970> you're<00:06:48.120> not<00:06:48.270> going<00:06:48.420> to<00:06:48.480> feel

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
and therefore you're not going to feel

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.790 
and therefore you're not going to feel
as<00:06:48.840> bad<00:06:48.870> it's<00:06:49.170> not<00:06:49.260> going<00:06:49.500> to<00:06:49.590> spread

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800
