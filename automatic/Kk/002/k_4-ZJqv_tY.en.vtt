00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
two pins see this pin I just went and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
two pins see this pin I just went and
bought<00:00:41.210> this<00:00:43.250> drilled<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> hole<00:00:44.579> actually

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
bought this drilled the hole actually

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.869 
bought this drilled the hole actually
into<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> wooden<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.100> knock<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
into a wooden for the on it knock the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.229 
into a wooden for the on it knock the
two<00:00:48.059> pins<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:49.399> I'm<00:00:50.399> talking<00:00:50.579> part<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> reason

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
two pins out I'm talking part the reason

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.060 
two pins out I'm talking part the reason
I<00:00:51.390> thought<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> lot<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> rusta

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
I thought because it was a lot of rusta

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
I thought because it was a lot of rusta
they<00:00:53.160> could<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.520> reach<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.390> area<00:00:54.780> inside

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
they could not reach in this area inside

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
they could not reach in this area inside
I<00:00:56.899> cleaned<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> surface<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I cleaned it all up when the surface I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
I cleaned it all up when the surface I
just<00:01:00.030> planed<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.719> regular<00:01:01.410> marble<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
just planed on regular marble with the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.840 
just planed on regular marble with the
sandpaper<00:01:03.949> places<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.159> could<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.549> reach

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
sandpaper places that I could not reach

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:24.359 
sandpaper places that I could not reach
I<00:01:06.119> used<00:01:06.740> dreamy

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369
