19 inches something like that but it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.379

took<00:02:29.769> her<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.219> long<00:02:30.310> time<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.730> start<00:02:31.030> growing

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
took her a long time to start growing

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:32.940 
took her a long time to start growing
because<00:02:31.540> she<00:02:31.780> had<00:02:31.870> an<00:02:31.989> eye<00:02:32.079> infection<00:02:32.260> that
