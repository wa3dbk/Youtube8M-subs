ah hi everyone this is gat sad for the
sad<00:00:03.060> truth<00:00:03.389> I've<00:00:04.110> received<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.710> great<00:00:04.920> number

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
sad truth I've received a great number

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.059 
sad truth I've received a great number
of<00:00:05.339> fantastic<00:00:05.520> questions<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.330> week<00:00:06.509> from

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
of fantastic questions this week from

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.730 
of fantastic questions this week from
viewers<00:00:08.599> many<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> questions<00:00:10.019> dealt<00:00:10.500> with

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
viewers many of the questions dealt with

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.350 
viewers many of the questions dealt with
various<00:00:11.160> aspects<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.790> evolutionary

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
various aspects of evolutionary

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.060 
various aspects of evolutionary
psychology<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.170> thought<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.830> might<00:00:13.860> be

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
psychology so I thought that it might be

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.519 
psychology so I thought that it might be
a<00:00:14.099> good<00:00:14.280> idea<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.910> first<00:00:15.240> episode<00:00:15.529> to

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
a good idea for this first episode to

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.550 
a good idea for this first episode to
offer<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.070> primer<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.940> some<00:00:18.560> foundational

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
offer a primer of some foundational

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.890 
offer a primer of some foundational
tenets<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.010> evolution<00:00:20.460> psychology<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.210> then

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
tenets of evolution psychology and then

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.810 
tenets of evolution psychology and then
in<00:00:22.020> future<00:00:22.230> shows<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.130> address<00:00:23.519> more

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
in future shows we can address more

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.359 
in future shows we can address more
specific<00:00:24.439> questions<00:00:25.439> relating<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> evolution

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
specific questions relating to evolution

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.779 
specific questions relating to evolution
psychology<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.810> fundamentally<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> first

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
psychology so fundamentally the first

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.849 
psychology so fundamentally the first
tenet<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.630> evolution<00:00:31.109> psychology<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
tenet of evolution psychology is the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.790 
tenet of evolution psychology is the
recognition<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> human<00:00:33.600> mind<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
recognition that the human mind is a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.520 
recognition that the human mind is a
product<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.910> dual<00:00:36.090> forces<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.840> natural

product of the dual forces of natural

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.319 
product of the dual forces of natural
and<00:00:37.590> sexual<00:00:37.829> selection<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> same<00:00:39.120> way

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and sexual selection so in the same way

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.900 
and sexual selection so in the same way
that<00:00:39.570> our<00:00:39.870> other<00:00:40.590> organs<00:00:40.890> whether<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.730> our

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
evolved through an evolutionary process

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
evolved through an evolutionary process
precisely<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.590> solve<00:00:50.070> some

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
precisely because they solve some

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.500 
precisely because they solve some

is<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> product<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> evolution<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.070> itself

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
is a product of evolution so that itself

is a product of evolution so that itself
is<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.870> non-controversial<00:01:03.870> statement<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
is a non-controversial statement it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.340 
is a non-controversial statement it
seems<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.189> me<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:07.140> who<00:01:07.290> are

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
seems to me because the those who are

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
seems to me because the those who are
hostile<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.220> premise<00:01:08.430> would<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
hostile with that premise would have to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.340 
hostile with that premise would have to
explain<00:01:09.330> where<00:01:10.290> our<00:01:10.470> human<00:01:10.799> minds<00:01:10.979> come<00:01:11.220> from

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
explain where our human minds come from

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
explain where our human minds come from
secondly<00:01:13.350> evolution<00:01:14.280> psychologists<00:01:14.880> argue

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
secondly evolution psychologists argue

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.899 
secondly evolution psychologists argue
that<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.200> human<00:01:16.350> mind<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.979> an<00:01:17.220> amalgamation

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
that the human mind is an amalgamation

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.350 
that the human mind is an amalgamation
or<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> collection<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:19.100> domain-specific

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
or a collection of domain-specific

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.190 
or a collection of domain-specific
computational<00:01:21.360> systems<00:01:21.810> each<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.070> which

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
computational systems each of which

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.539 
computational systems each of which
evolved<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> solve<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.650> specific<00:01:25.770> adaptive

foods invest in can build coalition and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.069 
foods invest in can build coalition and
friendships<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.950> each<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> these

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.210 
friendships so each of these
evolutionarily<00:01:40.079> important<00:01:40.590> problems<00:01:41.009> would

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
evolutionarily important problems would

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.139 
evolutionarily important problems would
necessitate<00:01:42.350> some<00:01:43.350> adaptive<00:01:43.950> solutions<00:01:44.189> that

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
necessitate some adaptive solutions that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.249 
necessitate some adaptive solutions that
are<00:01:45.270> ultimately<00:01:47.299> encapsulated<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.479> our<00:01:48.659> human

are ultimately encapsulated in our human

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.429 
are ultimately encapsulated in our human
mind<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:50.850> much<00:01:51.439> well

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
mind now this is very much well

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
mind now this is very much well
described<00:01:52.950> by<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> metaphor<00:01:53.909> called<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> Swiss

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
described by a metaphor called the Swiss

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
described by a metaphor called the Swiss
Army<00:01:54.930> knife<00:01:55.590> metaphor<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
Army knife metaphor so if you think of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.310 
Army knife metaphor so if you think of
the<00:01:56.759> Swiss<00:01:56.909> Army<00:01:57.119> knife<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.079> an

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the Swiss Army knife it is an

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.679 
the Swiss Army knife it is an
amalgamation<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:59.009> different<00:01:59.070> knives<00:02:00.000> each<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
amalgamation of different knives each of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.319 
amalgamation of different knives each of
which<00:02:00.899> serves<00:02:01.290> different<00:02:01.590> function<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.729> so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
which serves different function and so

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
which serves different function and so
this<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.659> precisely<00:02:03.960> what<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.469> mean<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:04.890> we

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
this is precisely what we mean when we

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.249 
this is precisely what we mean when we
talk<00:02:05.040> about<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:06.060> domain-specific<00:02:06.420> view<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
talk about the domain-specific view of

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:07.930 
talk about the domain-specific view of
the<00:02:07.380> human<00:02:07.619> mind

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940

secondly<00:02:08.940> evolutionary<00:02:09.569> psychologists

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
secondly evolutionary psychologists

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.339 
secondly evolutionary psychologists
argue<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.340> empty<00:02:11.849> slate<00:02:12.510> premise

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349

organs<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:25.199> fetus<00:04:25.650> are<00:04:25.830> forming<00:04:26.250> during

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
organs of the fetus are forming during

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.400 
organs of the fetus are forming during
that<00:04:26.790> time<00:04:27.030> period<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:27.960> particularly

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
that time period it is particularly

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.380 
that time period it is particularly
important<00:04:29.100> that<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.370> mother<00:04:29.580> not<00:04:29.850> be<00:04:30.000> exposed

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
important that the mother not be exposed

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.750 
important that the mother not be exposed
to<00:04:30.570> food<00:04:30.750> pathogens<00:04:31.020> or<00:04:31.470> teratogen<00:04:32.100> because

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
to food pathogens or teratogen because

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.360 
to food pathogens or teratogen because
that<00:04:32.910> can<00:04:33.060> wreak<00:04:33.270> havoc<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.710> development

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
that can wreak havoc on the development

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.260 
that can wreak havoc on the development
of<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.880> organs<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:37.590> fetus<00:04:37.920> and<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.180> is

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
of the organs of the fetus and so it is

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.720 
of the organs of the fetus and so it is
particularly<00:04:39.630> important<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:41.180> she<00:04:42.440> avoid

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
particularly important that she avoid

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.080 
particularly important that she avoid
pathogens<00:04:45.230> and<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.800> develop<00:04:47.430> some<00:04:47.640> food

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
pathogens and and develop some food

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.300 
pathogens and and develop some food
preferences<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:48.990> could<00:04:49.290> help<00:04:49.740> her<00:04:49.980> in<00:04:50.130> case

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
preferences that could help her in case

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.610 
preferences that could help her in case
she<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.670> exposed<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.240> pathogens<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:51.960> she<00:04:52.410> gets

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
she is exposed to pathogens so she gets

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.370 
she is exposed to pathogens so she gets
nauseous<00:04:52.890> she<00:04:53.400> throws<00:04:53.700> up<00:04:53.940> she<00:04:54.540> avoids<00:04:54.930> foods

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
nauseous she throws up she avoids foods

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.130 
nauseous she throws up she avoids foods
that<00:04:55.560> have<00:04:55.770> high<00:04:55.830> pathogenic<00:04:56.460> load<00:04:57.140> she's

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
that have high pathogenic load she's

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.490 
that have high pathogenic load she's
attracted<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.920> foods<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.610> serve<00:05:00.180> as<00:05:00.510> anti

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
attracted to foods that serve as anti

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.530 
attracted to foods that serve as anti
microbial<00:05:02.130> solutions<00:05:02.700> so<00:05:03.030> for<00:05:03.180> example

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
microbial solutions so for example

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.680 
microbial solutions so for example
pickles<00:05:04.490> serve<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.520> very<00:05:06.210> important

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
pickles serve a very important

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.020 
pickles serve a very important
antimicrobial<00:05:07.440> function<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.070> so<00:05:08.610> once<00:05:08.880> you

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
antimicrobial function and so once you

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.280 
antimicrobial function and so once you
put<00:05:09.180> all<00:05:09.240> these<00:05:09.480> together<00:05:09.660> you<00:05:10.080> start

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
put all these together you start

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.320 
put all these together you start
understanding<00:05:10.410> that<00:05:10.920> these<00:05:11.070> pregnancy<00:05:11.760> the

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
understanding that these pregnancy the

understanding that these pregnancy the
symptoms<00:05:13.080> these<00:05:13.440> pregnancy<00:05:13.920> sickness

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
symptoms these pregnancy sickness

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.430 
symptoms these pregnancy sickness
symptoms<00:05:14.670> are<00:05:14.850> very<00:05:15.630> much<00:05:15.840> an<00:05:15.990> adaptive

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
symptoms are very much an adaptive

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.440 
symptoms are very much an adaptive
solution<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:16.980> a<00:05:17.010> very<00:05:17.280> important<00:05:17.730> problem<00:05:17.970> you

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
solution to a very important problem you

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.550 
solution to a very important problem you
might<00:05:18.630> say<00:05:18.780> okay<00:05:18.990> well<00:05:19.110> that's<00:05:19.260> great

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
might say okay well that's great

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.710 
might say okay well that's great
theoretically<00:05:20.400> but<00:05:20.640> who<00:05:20.880> cares<00:05:21.120> practically

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
theoretically but who cares practically

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.630 
theoretically but who cares practically
well<00:05:22.410> think<00:05:22.680> about<00:05:22.950> what<00:05:23.130> happens<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.550> a

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
well think about what happens to a

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.220 
well think about what happens to a
pregnant<00:05:24.030> woman<00:05:24.060> when<00:05:24.390> she<00:05:24.510> goes<00:05:24.660> to<00:05:24.690> see<00:05:24.990> her

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
pregnant woman when she goes to see her

pregnant woman when she goes to see her
her<00:05:25.920> OBGYN<00:05:26.390> because<00:05:27.390> she's<00:05:27.630> fed<00:05:27.840> up<00:05:27.870> with<00:05:28.110> her

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
her OBGYN because she's fed up with her

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
pregnancy sickness symptoms he or she

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.440 
pregnancy sickness symptoms he or she
will<00:05:31.890> give<00:05:32.040> her<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.220> pill<00:05:32.520> that<00:05:32.550> seeks<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.240> us

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
will give her a pill that seeks to us

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.270 
will give her a pill that seeks to us
wash<00:05:33.780> those<00:05:34.080> symptoms<00:05:34.380> well<00:05:34.980> that's<00:05:35.130> the

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
wash those symptoms well that's the

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.220 
wash those symptoms well that's the
perfectly<00:05:35.790> incorrect<00:05:36.270> thing<00:05:36.450> to<00:05:36.600> do<00:05:36.750> because

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
perfectly incorrect thing to do because

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.530 
perfectly incorrect thing to do because
those<00:05:37.560> symptoms<00:05:38.130> are<00:05:38.280> actually<00:05:38.540> protective

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
those symptoms are actually protective

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.200 
those symptoms are actually protective
right<00:05:40.230> it<00:05:40.470> turns<00:05:40.650> out<00:05:40.860> through<00:05:41.400> other<00:05:41.670> studies

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
right it turns out through other studies

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.990 
right it turns out through other studies
that<00:05:42.810> a<00:05:43.110> woman<00:05:43.530> who<00:05:43.890> experiences<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.580> lot<00:05:44.850> of

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
have healthy outcome of her gestation so

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.130 
have healthy outcome of her gestation so
