00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 and hello to all sasha for blocks of 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.529
 sacha plan as today we are 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.080
 found to do the hard disk test 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.620
 drive my team rocket of ps3 fans of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.090
 playstation 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.000
 it is the mounting bracket of the disc 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.559
 hard for the ps3 ultra slim that allows 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.389
 so to put a hard drive sata 2 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 chicks that is in the new ps3 if 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.730
 you bought the 12 giga version 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.769
 so here are two teeth and therefore provides the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.269
 mounting bracket that is there so face 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.890
 and so it is the support in fact everything 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.990
 just that you're going to put in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.590
 your ps3 the hard drive is not 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 provided of course the up up here and the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.820
 little manual that can do all this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 So that's perfect we go there tac 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.200
 so here you have the hard drive so 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.600
 here I have my hard drive I used a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.030
 small hard drive in time I 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.219
 found in a small laptop 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.239
 an old thing that I had at home I 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.500
 advise you to do the same 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.980
 do not buy a hard drive 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.090
 for ps3 if it's just for storing 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.280
 the few little games that you go 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.730
 buy on the psn so that's 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 party so here we are going to rank in 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.629
 accelerated 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.629
 it's gone 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.090
 tada it's over 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.500
 so the support so the hard drive is 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.850
 mounted on the bracket so hung 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.290
 of course this little part that you 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.350
 see move is to introduce it 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.140
 in the ps3 to which we will put 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.390
 this little screw here just in this little 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.550
 hole there that actually allow who is going 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.020
 block the speech in the ps3 i'm going 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.610
 look for the ps3 and we find ourselves all 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.200
 right away so we're back 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.430
 with the ps3 so I changed a little 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.680
 the location of the camera it was more 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.620
 simple so that's the ps3 slim one 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.180
 I press the reader opens so here 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.100
 you go to the right side of the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 console so the side where there is not the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.010
 playstation logo 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.260
 that's all you're going for 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.910
 slide to the right 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.670
 and there you saw that the hatch was 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.170
 open magic here is so here you 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.170
 have a little hole where you can go 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.490
 put the hard drive so my hard drive 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.260
 that I previously had to ride on the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.740
 support i'm going to push it into the call 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:13.970
 so here it is so here it remains to me 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.920
 more than put 7 6 that's all 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.780
 to remove it, of course, 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.209
 unscrew this trip the little hatch 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.000
 that's why the thing is removable 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.200
 and so from the cost pull they say that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.870
 God could change it if you 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.970
 do you want to be here so I put in traps 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.769
 dac and we will connect it and I will 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.670
 show what that gives so the ps3 but 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.019
 others did it that she found a 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.130
 hard drive and wonder if I want 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.430
 save my data to disk 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.620
 hard 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.150
 so I put yes and then she me 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.560
 ask if I really want to back up 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.600
 all the contents of the flash memory to 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.420
 the hard drive it's going to be copied and so 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.620
 there of course I put at best so at 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.840
 from that moment all the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.330
 data will be copied into the of the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.739
 flash memory to the hard drive it can 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.180
 take some time at home this 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.520
 call about ten minutes 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.040
 Let's go 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.200
 the ps3 will restart now seen 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.460
 that it's over and it will restart in 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.990
 does and will analyze all the data 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.290
 in the hard drive and well organize them 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.290
 here 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.260
 it's over the ps3 restart a 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.460
 last time for to start and so 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.690
 now you can see that I can 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.400
 navigate the menus so everything 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.570
 normally works as if it 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.620
 works wedding trolley except that 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.140
 now it works on the disk 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.250
 hard so everything works we'll go 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.880
 take a quick tour in the 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.830
 settings 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.970
 finally in the system information for 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.670
 to show you that it worked well 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.020
 this is all it was saha for 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.340
