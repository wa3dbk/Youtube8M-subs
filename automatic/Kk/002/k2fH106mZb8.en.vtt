those who take care of them in captivity

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
those who take care of them in captivity
many<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> people<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.520> are<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:05.820> at<00:02:05.909> this

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
many of the people that are here at this

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.449 
many of the people that are here at this
convention<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.780> owners<00:02:07.290> themselves<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
convention are owners themselves the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.430 
convention are owners themselves the
meadows<00:02:08.789> told<00:02:09.090> us<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.539> started<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.289> by

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
meadows told us that they started out by

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.559 
meadows told us that they started out by
owning<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.830> cougar<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.879> think<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.390> lot<00:02:12.540> of

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
owning a cougar and so I think a lot of

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
owning a cougar and so I think a lot of
your<00:02:12.810> emphasises<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
your emphasises to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
your emphasises to
sure<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.250> your<00:02:14.370> rights<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:15.030> owners<00:02:15.780> of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
sure that your rights as owners of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630 
sure that your rights as owners of
exotic<00:02:16.320> animals<00:02:16.410> are<00:02:16.800> upheld<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.490> law

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
exotic animals are upheld with the law

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.520 
exotic animals are upheld with the law
tell<00:02:18.060> me<00:02:18.150> about<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.360> yes<00:02:19.140> that's<00:02:19.440> definitely

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
tell me about that yes that's definitely

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.560 
tell me about that yes that's definitely
an<00:02:20.190> important<00:02:20.730> consideration<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.450> our

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
an important consideration of our

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.080 
an important consideration of our
organization<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.530> believe<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.490> lot

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
organization and we believe that a lot

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.960 
organization and we believe that a lot
of<00:02:24.240> legislations<00:02:25.140> past<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.040> due<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> fear

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
of legislations past is is due to a fear

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970 
of legislations past is is due to a fear
factor<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.680> misunderstanding<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.770> lack<00:02:28.950> of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
factor or a misunderstanding a lack of

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.310 
factor or a misunderstanding a lack of
knowledge<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.150> we<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> strong<00:02:30.720> emphasis

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
knowledge so we have a strong emphasis

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.010

to help everybody do a better job and I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.670 
to help everybody do a better job and I
think<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.610> if<00:02:54.300> we<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.690> safely<00:02:54.959> contain<00:02:55.500> them

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
think that if we can safely contain them

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.160 
think that if we can safely contain them
and<00:02:56.010> address<00:02:56.400> safety<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.330> welfare<00:02:57.570> issues

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and address safety and welfare issues

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.990 
and address safety and welfare issues
for<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.500> animals<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> public<00:02:59.459> then<00:02:59.970> a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
for the animals and the public then a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.090 
for the animals and the public then a
lot<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.510> hysteria<00:03:01.260> will<00:03:01.560> lose<00:03:01.770> its

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
lot of this hysteria will lose its

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.760 
lot of this hysteria will lose its
momentum<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.480> perhaps<00:03:03.930> we<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.410> go<00:03:04.560> back<00:03:04.709> to

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
momentum and perhaps we can go back to

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.670
