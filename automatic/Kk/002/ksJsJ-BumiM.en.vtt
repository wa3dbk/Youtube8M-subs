00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:47.237
Good! Their formation is broken!
Now's the time to show our strength!

00:01:47.337 --> 00:01:51.645
Everyone, follow Rinrin!

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:56.555
After encouraging surrounding soldiers, the two headed to finish off
bandits, whose front now collapsed.

00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:00.579
And, as if in response to that, right-wing also started an assault.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.002
The groundshaking sound of footsteps.
It was so loud that got conveyed through my whole body.

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:07.502
Kazuto: Amazing...

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:12.196
Is what I said... but I was also somehow horrified by it.

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:17.279
Master, are you still afraid?

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.663
Kazuto: Eh?!

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:23.722
Touka grabbed my hand with a worried look on her face.

00:02:23.822 --> 00:02:32.730
I just had a feeling that Master is experiencing something harsh right now...

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.437
Kazuto: ...Was it so clear from my face?

00:02:35.537 --> 00:02:44.802
No. It wasn't but... I just thought how hard it should be for you.

00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:47.206
Kazuto: I see...

00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:51.728
While being marveled by Touka's intuition's sharpness,
I said what I was thinking.

00:02:51.828 --> 00:02:56.705
Kazuto: Battle occured before my eyes and people died...
Seeing that is painful after all...

00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:01.197
You're kind, Master...

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:05.374
Kazuto: That's not so... probably... I'm just not used to it.

00:03:05.474 --> 00:03:09.750
I'm not sympathizing with the losers. And I'm not infinitely kind.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.448
After all, those who we just fought were attacking powerless people.

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:20.992
But... they were still humans. Even if it's payment for what they were doing,
seeing people being cruelly killed I can't remain calm.

00:03:21.092 --> 00:03:26.730
Feeling a strong discomfort around my belly. To avoid puking,
I frowned strongly.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:38.394
You look painful... But, Master, unless you accept it all
you will be unable to save people.

00:03:38.494 --> 00:03:41.028
Kazuto: You're right...

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:47.554
You are unable to save everyone. So, people close to you. To protect those
who surround you, you need to defeat your enemies.

00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:52.950
Enemy, allies. That doesn't mean absolute allies of course,
but people can only live having at least temporary allies.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.596
Kazuto: ...I'm okay.

00:03:55.696 --> 00:04:00.227
I smiled towards Touka, who was still holding my hand
and looked firmly ahead.

00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:04.401
People... no, enemy was escaping and I burned that into my eyes.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:12.261
And... Thanks to Aisha, Rinrin and soldiers' efforts, Kousonsan army
has achieved total triumph.

00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:16.784
Returning with triumphant soldiers we've rejoined with Pairen.

00:04:16.884 --> 00:04:25.384
Absolute victory it was. I'm glad, I'm glad.

00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:30.863
You did it, Pairen-chan. As expected!

00:04:30.963 --> 00:04:38.084
No, no. That's because I had Touka's assistance. Thank you.

00:04:38.184 --> 00:04:43.166
Hehe, I'm kinda happy to hear you say that.

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:46.775
Gazing skeptically on those two's conversation...

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:55.437
But... Hakukei-dono, haven't you felt something strange lately?

00:04:55.537 --> 00:04:58.794
Sei asked while looking at the sky.

00:04:58.894 --> 00:05:07.752
Something strange? I wonder. I probably didn't.

00:05:07.852 --> 00:05:12.726
Pairen-chan, you sure are taking it easy.

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:22.946
Ugh... I'm probably taking it easy, but hearing it from Touka
is double the frustration...

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:31.469
Ah! How mean! I'm not taking it easy like Pairen-chan!

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.219
Onee-chan is the only one who thinks so.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.542
Rinrin said, as she laughed a bit.

00:05:40.642 --> 00:05:48.612
Buu... Rinrin-chan is saying it too? Everyone's cruel!

00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:53.614
Touka puffed her cheeks after hearing Rinrin's words
and voiced her discontent.

00:05:53.714 --> 00:05:57.873
And Aisha was looking at it with a smile.

00:05:57.973 --> 00:06:08.097
But, Sei's right. How nobles act lately seems suspicious.

00:06:08.197 --> 00:06:11.609
She said with a very serious face.

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:15.534
So you think so too...

00:06:15.634 --> 00:06:31.033
Yeah. Lately, nobles were just some kind of marauders.
Attacking villages, killing people, robbing them.
There are signs of famine appearing at the rural areas.

00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:38.597
They got their harvest taken from them.
Of course there'll be a famine.

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:51.450
Yes. And at the borders they noticed Goko's presense.
Something is going to happen, at least I think so.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.696
It might lead to a major uproar...

00:06:56.796 --> 00:07:00.009
Kazuto: Probably... now, that's very likely to happen.

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:04.012
Master also thinks so?

00:07:04.112 --> 00:07:08.600
Kazuto: Yes. But not because of the nobles.
There'll probably be a rebellion against tyranny eventually.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.561
If the world I know and this world are the same,
that's how it'll be.

00:07:12.661 --> 00:07:17.396
Kazuto: How are we going to stand in all this chaos...
That's the main question here.

00:07:17.496 --> 00:07:21.477
You're... right.

00:07:21.577 --> 00:07:27.683
Muttering that quietly, Aisha was looking at the sky,
as if looking into the distant future.

00:07:27.783 --> 00:07:30.670
A blue, blue sky spreading to the farthest of my sight.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.846
But for me... it looked as if the dark clouds, decorating our first battle,
were spreading before us.

00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:38.847
I hope I am wrong.
