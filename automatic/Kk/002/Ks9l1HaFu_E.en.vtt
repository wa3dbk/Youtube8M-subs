barrel<00:00:25.779> this<00:00:25.990> is<00:00:26.260> our<00:00:26.380> learning<00:00:26.560> prompt<00:00:27.279> okay

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
barrel this is our learning prompt okay

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.279 
barrel this is our learning prompt okay
so<00:00:27.910> we're<00:00:28.150> going<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.330> engage<00:00:28.480> in<00:00:28.810> an<00:00:28.900> activity

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
so we're going to engage in an activity

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.500 
so we're going to engage in an activity
that<00:00:29.890> promotes<00:00:30.190> symmetrical<00:00:31.029> muscular

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
that promotes symmetrical muscular

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.840 
that promotes symmetrical muscular
development<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:32.259> it<00:00:32.829> promotes<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.489> little<00:00:33.730> bit

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
development and it promotes a little bit

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.790 
development and it promotes a little bit
of<00:00:33.969> brain<00:00:34.180> growth<00:00:34.480> it<00:00:34.899> gets<00:00:35.170> his<00:00:35.350> nervous

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
of brain growth it gets his nervous

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.189 
of brain growth it gets his nervous
system<00:00:35.829> firing<00:00:36.729> or<00:00:36.879> what<00:00:37.179> we<00:00:37.479> out<00:00:37.749> here<00:00:37.960> like

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
system firing or what we out here like

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.819 
system firing or what we out here like
to<00:00:38.319> call<00:00:38.530> nose<00:00:39.159> to<00:00:39.789> toes<00:00:40.030> or<00:00:40.539> toes<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:41.170> nose<00:00:41.199> we

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
to call nose to toes or toes to nose we

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.680 
to call nose to toes or toes to nose we
want<00:00:42.039> that<00:00:42.219> that<00:00:42.609> that<00:00:42.850> information<00:00:43.479> coming

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
want that that that information coming

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.899 
want that that that information coming
up<00:00:43.870> through<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.229> toes<00:00:44.440> going<00:00:45.370> all<00:00:45.609> the<00:00:45.760> way<00:00:45.789> to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
up through the toes going all the way to

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.939 
up through the toes going all the way to
the<00:00:46.059> brain<00:00:46.269> so<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:46.539> dogs<00:00:46.870> bodies<00:00:47.260> fire<00:00:47.710> and

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
the brain so that dogs bodies fire and

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.020 
the brain so that dogs bodies fire and
he's<00:00:48.039> moving<00:00:48.399> he's<00:00:48.489> learning<00:00:48.789> to<00:00:48.819> balance

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
he's moving he's learning to balance

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.759 
he's moving he's learning to balance
he's<00:00:49.389> learning<00:00:49.659> to<00:00:49.690> be<00:00:49.839> athletic<00:00:50.229> we're

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
he's learning to be athletic we're

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.889 
he's learning to be athletic we're
maximizing<00:00:51.280> his<00:00:51.729> physical<00:00:52.179> potential<00:00:52.539> and

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
maximizing his physical potential and

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.049 
maximizing his physical potential and
his<00:00:53.079> middle<00:00:53.350> potential<00:00:53.829> at<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.010> same<00:00:54.190> time<00:00:54.489> so

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
his middle potential at the same time so

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.090 
his middle potential at the same time so
let's<00:00:55.239> get<00:00:55.359> busy<00:00:55.569> on<00:00:55.749> these<00:00:55.989> laws<00:00:56.229> using<00:00:56.859> these

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
let's get busy on these laws using these

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.919 
let's get busy on these laws using these
law<00:00:57.280> teaches<00:00:57.639> dog<00:00:57.969> to<00:00:58.120> walk<00:00:58.239> on<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:58.510> barrel

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
law teaches dog to walk on a barrel

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.410 
law teaches dog to walk on a barrel
Callie<00:00:59.289> what's<00:00:59.589> first<00:00:59.859> law<00:01:00.069> race<00:01:00.639> criterion

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
Callie what's first law race criterion

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.119 
Callie what's first law race criterion
increments<00:01:02.079> small<00:01:02.289> enough<00:01:02.589> so<00:01:02.829> that<00:01:02.859> the

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
increments small enough so that the

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.799 
increments small enough so that the
subject<00:01:03.549> always<00:01:03.789> has<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.119> realistic<00:01:04.570> chance

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
subject always has a realistic chance

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.530 
subject always has a realistic chance
for<00:01:05.320> reinforcement<00:01:06.040> okay<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:06.909> we<00:01:07.330> got<00:01:07.510> a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
for reinforcement okay so we got a

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.970 
for reinforcement okay so we got a
cecile<00:01:07.900> here<00:01:08.170> we're<00:01:08.260> trying<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.500> teach<00:01:08.560> dog<00:01:08.830> to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
cecile here we're trying to teach dog to

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.800 
cecile here we're trying to teach dog to
walk<00:01:09.100> on<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.370> barrel<00:01:09.760> we<00:01:10.060> want<00:01:10.300> to<00:01:10.390> break<00:01:10.600> that

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
walk on a barrel we want to break that

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.980 
walk on a barrel we want to break that
up<00:01:10.870> into<00:01:11.260> small<00:01:11.830> steps<00:01:12.760> okay<00:01:13.510> so<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.810> first

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990

current level of response into a

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.380 
current level of response into a
variable<00:02:09.640> schedule<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.209> reinforcement

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
variable schedule of reinforcement

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.229

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
there's a certain amount of work that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.070 
there's a certain amount of work that
goes<00:02:27.610> along<00:02:28.090> with<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
goes along with this and the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.590 
goes along with this and the
reinforcement<00:02:29.650> schedule<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.400> not<00:02:30.550> time<00:02:30.910> to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
reinforcement schedule is not time to

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.410 
reinforcement schedule is not time to
time<00:02:32.080> or<00:02:32.440> performance<00:02:33.040> necessarily<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.060> so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
time or performance necessarily but so

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.090 
time or performance necessarily but so
we<00:02:34.570> started<00:02:34.900> off<00:02:34.990> with<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.290> fixed<00:02:35.590> schedule<00:02:35.770> of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
we started off with a fixed schedule of

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.540 
we started off with a fixed schedule of
reinforcement<00:02:36.220> tree<00:02:37.260> tree<00:02:38.260> tree<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.190> then<00:02:39.430> we

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
reinforcement tree tree tree and then we

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.920 
reinforcement tree tree tree and then we
started<00:02:39.820> adding<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> little<00:02:40.360> bit<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.720> time

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
started adding in a little bit of time

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.230 
started adding in a little bit of time
in<00:02:41.230> between<00:02:41.560> those<00:02:41.770> treats<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.790> we<00:02:42.970> added<00:02:43.090> a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
in between those treats so we added a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.240 
in between those treats so we added a
pause<00:02:43.450> come<00:02:44.260> back<00:02:44.470> with<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.770> tree<00:02:45.010> add

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
pause come back with the tree add

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.880 
pause come back with the tree add
another<00:02:45.910> pause<00:02:46.180> come<00:02:47.170> back<00:02:47.380> with<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> tree

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
another pause come back with the tree

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.620 
another pause come back with the tree
little<00:02:48.850> boy<00:02:49.740> now<00:02:50.740> so<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.880> now<00:02:52.030> know<00:02:52.210> I'm<00:02:52.360> ready

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
gonna work on actually manipulating this

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.520 
gonna work on actually manipulating this
barrel<00:03:36.250> with<00:03:36.400> his<00:03:36.550> body<00:03:36.820> okay<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.930> might<00:03:38.500> have

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
barrel with his body okay I might have

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.090 
barrel with his body okay I might have
to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
to

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.220 
to
I<00:03:39.130> might<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.820> accept<00:03:40.570> that<00:03:40.870> being<00:03:41.140> able

I might have to accept that being able

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.770 
I might have to accept that being able
to<00:03:41.350> stay<00:03:41.620> up<00:03:41.830> here<00:03:42.070> on<00:03:42.160> this<00:03:42.280> barrel<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:43.540> and

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
to stay up here on this barrel is it and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.180 
to stay up here on this barrel is it and
maintain<00:03:44.200> balance<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.740> not<00:03:44.890> going<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.100> be

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
maintain balance is not going to be

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.980 
maintain balance is not going to be
perfect<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:45.730> cut<00:03:46.090> them<00:03:46.240> some<00:03:46.390> slack<00:03:46.450> when<00:03:46.870> you

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
perfect so cut them some slack when you

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.270 
perfect so cut them some slack when you
when<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.350> ask<00:03:47.500> them<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.709> do<00:03:47.860> something<00:03:48.130> that

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
when you ask them to do something that

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.150 
when you ask them to do something that
next<00:03:48.700> step<00:03:48.880> it's<00:03:49.090> really<00:03:49.420> hard<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:50.320> know<00:03:50.530> yeah

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
next step it's really hard you know yeah

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.310 
next step it's really hard you know yeah
give<00:03:51.670> them<00:03:51.820> a<00:03:51.910> little<00:03:52.090> bit<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.480> leeway<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
give them a little bit of leeway in the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.570 
give them a little bit of leeway in the
stuff<00:03:53.530> you've<00:03:53.709> been<00:03:53.740> working<00:03:54.220> on

Callie stay ahead of your subject plan
you're<00:03:58.420> shaping<00:03:58.690> program<00:03:59.110> completely<00:03:59.800> so

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
you're shaping program completely so

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.949 
you're shaping program completely so
that<00:04:00.340> if<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.940> subject<00:04:01.150> makes<00:04:01.630> sudden

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
that if the subject makes sudden

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.780 
that if the subject makes sudden
progress<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:02.650> are<00:04:02.680> aware<00:04:03.130> of<00:04:03.190> what<00:04:03.610> to

progress you are aware of what to

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.699 
progress you are aware of what to

reinforce next okay in other words have

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.920 
reinforce next okay in other words have
a<00:04:05.800> game<00:04:05.980> plan<00:04:06.150> everybody<00:04:07.150> needs<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.480> game<00:04:07.630> plan

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
a game plan everybody needs a game plan

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.990 
a game plan everybody needs a game plan
even<00:04:08.440> if<00:04:08.560> it's<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.740> wrong<00:04:08.890> game<00:04:09.220> plan<00:04:09.520> cuz<00:04:09.910> if

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
even if it's a wrong game plan cuz if

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.430 
even if it's a wrong game plan cuz if
it's<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.209> wrong<00:04:10.360> one<00:04:10.630> you<00:04:10.810> can<00:04:11.140> write<00:04:11.290> in<00:04:11.410> your

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
it's the wrong one you can write in your

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.610 
it's the wrong one you can write in your
training<00:04:11.709> Journal<00:04:12.130> what<00:04:12.610> not<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:13.000> do

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
training Journal what not to do

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.949 
training Journal what not to do
okay<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.250> I'm<00:04:14.580> hoping<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.150> today<00:04:15.450> maybe<00:04:15.750> this

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
okay so I'm hoping that today maybe this

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.509 
okay so I'm hoping that today maybe this
dog<00:04:16.139> would<00:04:16.320> make<00:04:16.440> some<00:04:16.560> big<00:04:16.709> progress<00:04:16.949> towards

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
dog would make some big progress towards

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.009 
dog would make some big progress towards
manipulating<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:18.299> barrel<00:04:18.570> being<00:04:18.720> able<00:04:18.870> to

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
manipulating this barrel being able to

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.379 
manipulating this barrel being able to
move<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.470> forward<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.949> backwards<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:20.850> like

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
move it forward and backwards but like

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.000 
move it forward and backwards but like
you<00:04:21.570> got<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.810> be<00:04:21.900> aware<00:04:21.989> of<00:04:22.380> your<00:04:22.500> training

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
you got to be aware of your training

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.700 
you got to be aware of your training
program<00:04:23.520> your<00:04:24.419> environment<00:04:24.930> see<00:04:25.350> yeah<00:04:25.500> he's

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
program your environment see yeah he's

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.230 
program your environment see yeah he's
kind<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:26.040> little<00:04:26.190> bit<00:04:26.220> too<00:04:26.430> far<00:04:26.639> on<00:04:26.699> the<00:04:26.940> end<00:04:27.120> of

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
kind of little bit too far on the end of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.420 
kind of little bit too far on the end of
this<00:04:27.300> barrel<00:04:27.570> I've<00:04:28.260> got<00:04:28.560> him<00:04:28.740> on<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.889> little<00:04:29.190> bit

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
this barrel I've got him on a little bit

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.310 
this barrel I've got him on a little bit
of<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.639> slant<00:04:29.940> because<00:04:30.479> of<00:04:30.630> how<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.780> sun<00:04:31.110> is

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
of a slant because of how the sun is

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.840 
of a slant because of how the sun is
shining<00:04:31.710> right<00:04:31.740> now<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.100> couldn't<00:04:32.430> get<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:32.729> my

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
shining right now I couldn't get to my

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.060 
shining right now I couldn't get to my
optimum<00:04:33.389> place<00:04:33.630> so<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.530> don't<00:04:34.560> want<00:04:34.889> him<00:04:35.010> to

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
optimum place so I don't want him to

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.710 
optimum place so I don't want him to
fail<00:04:35.280> I'm<00:04:35.669> going<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:36.000> get<00:04:36.120> him<00:04:36.240> off<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:36.449> this

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
fail I'm going to get him off of this

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.990 
fail I'm going to get him off of this
barrel<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.410> start<00:04:37.860> him<00:04:38.010> again<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.610> middle

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
barrel and start him again in the middle

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.820 
barrel and start him again in the middle
and<00:04:39.150> then<00:04:39.449> we're<00:04:39.600> gonna<00:04:39.690> see<00:04:39.960> if<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.470> can<00:04:40.680> get

and then we're gonna see if I can get

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.129 
and then we're gonna see if I can get
him<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.280> manipulate<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.540> with<00:04:42.840> his<00:04:43.020> own

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
him to manipulate it with his own

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.870 
him to manipulate it with his own
movement<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.010> I'm<00:04:44.160> gonna<00:04:44.280> get<00:04:44.400> him<00:04:44.520> down<00:04:44.699> oh

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
movement so I'm gonna get him down oh

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.879 
movement so I'm gonna get him down oh

it's a coupie I'm gonna come back to the

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.800 
it's a coupie I'm gonna come back to the
middle<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.490> barrel<00:04:47.850> I<00:04:48.000> know<00:04:48.419> this<00:04:48.690> is
