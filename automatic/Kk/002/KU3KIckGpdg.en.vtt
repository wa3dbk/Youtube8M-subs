00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.610
 Y 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.680
 to accompany 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.390
 there is no motivation 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.860
 it does not work 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:40.590
 we want many people to think 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 that there is also but the parties if 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.829
 people do not vote them they will not change 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:53.089
 new pages to vote because I'm 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.089
 promoting is fundamental 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.740
 imagine 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.530
 make a corpse of an attempt 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.870
 ah 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.460
 we have precedent 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.190
 we did not see the great beating in the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.480
 jail 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.480
 we see so many things 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.260
 why 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.580
 is 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:11.129
 I say I tell you the light is the same 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:14.500
 they both want to change 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.110
 to keep changing the announced lack 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.900
 to maintain power since that is the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.819
 same rule also to maintain but 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.239
 will change what you need to 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.239
 keep
