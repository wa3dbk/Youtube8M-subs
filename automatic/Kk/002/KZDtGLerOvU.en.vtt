high hats now these high hats have a

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.950 
high hats now these high hats have a
great<00:00:53.860> story<00:00:54.219> because<00:00:55.000> there<00:00:55.510> was<00:00:55.629> a<00:00:55.660> lot<00:00:55.930> of

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
great story because there was a lot of

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.500 
great story because there was a lot of
prototyping<00:00:56.770> done<00:00:57.010> with<00:00:57.910> these<00:00:58.059> high<00:00:58.239> hats

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
prototyping done with these high hats

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.110 
prototyping done with these high hats
with<00:00:59.110> a<00:00:59.140> cure<00:00:59.469> Jimbo<00:00:59.920> who<00:01:00.430> helped<00:01:00.640> design<00:01:00.789> them

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
with a cure Jimbo who helped design them

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.560 
with a cure Jimbo who helped design them
with<00:01:01.270> us<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.890> all<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.670> hybrid<00:01:04.180> series

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
with us like all of the hybrid series

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.200 
with us like all of the hybrid series
the<00:01:05.259> outer<00:01:05.500> edge<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.550> cymbal<00:01:06.759> is<00:01:06.970> lathe

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
the outer edge of the cymbal is lathe

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
the outer edge of the cymbal is lathe
and<00:01:07.539> the<00:01:07.840> middle<00:01:08.080> portion<00:01:08.289> is<00:01:08.830> unlived<00:01:09.930> now

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and the middle portion is unlived now

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.249 
and the middle portion is unlived now
why<00:01:12.369> did<00:01:12.880> we<00:01:12.970> come<00:01:13.119> up<00:01:13.180> with<00:01:13.420> 13<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:13.869> a<00:01:14.050> quarter

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
why did we come up with 13 and a quarter

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.150 
why did we come up with 13 and a quarter
well

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
well

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.760 
well
Akira<00:01:15.640> wanted<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.030> try<00:01:16.330> several<00:01:17.259> different

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
Akira wanted to try several different

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.089 
Akira wanted to try several different
sizes<00:01:17.950> we<00:01:18.340> went<00:01:18.550> from<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.849> 13<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.539> half<00:01:20.099> to

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:21.099 
sizes we went from the 13 and a half to

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.820 
sizes we went from the 13 and a half to
13<00:01:21.580> and<00:01:21.729> a<00:01:21.819> third<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.990> all<00:01:23.170> kinds<00:01:23.619> of<00:01:23.679> different

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
13 and a third to all kinds of different

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.309 
13 and a third to all kinds of different
different<00:01:24.580> diameters<00:01:25.149> finally<00:01:25.690> settling<00:01:26.110> on

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
different diameters finally settling on

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.699 
different diameters finally settling on
13<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.490> quarter<00:01:27.700> now<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.750> hybrid<00:01:29.319> hi-hat

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
13 and a quarter now the hybrid hi-hat

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.730 
13 and a quarter now the hybrid hi-hat
has<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> unique<00:01:30.789> design<00:01:31.060> feature<00:01:31.539> where<00:01:31.990> it's

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
has a unique design feature where it's

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.100 
has a unique design feature where it's
sort<00:01:33.099> of<00:01:33.160> like<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.700> master<00:01:34.390> sound<00:01:34.599> bottom

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
sort of like a master sound bottom

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.109 
sort of like a master sound bottom
except<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.009> way<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.399> bottom<00:01:36.759> cymbal

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
except the way that the bottom cymbal

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.719 
except the way that the bottom cymbal
was<00:01:37.270> hammered<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.920> hammer<00:01:39.099> marks<00:01:39.340> go<00:01:39.550> in<00:01:39.640> the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
was hammered the hammer marks go in the

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.219 
was hammered the hammer marks go in the
opposite<00:01:40.119> direction<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.690> actually<00:01:41.020> when<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
opposite direction so actually when the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.639 
opposite direction so actually when the
top<00:01:41.440> hat<00:01:41.890> cymbal<00:01:42.190> comes<00:01:42.399> down<00:01:42.700> on<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:44.140> the

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
top hat cymbal comes down on to the

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.990 
top hat cymbal comes down on to the
bottom<00:01:45.039> it<00:01:45.160> doesn't<00:01:45.369> hit<00:01:45.700> where<00:01:45.880> it's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
bottom it doesn't hit where it's

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.910 
bottom it doesn't hit where it's
hammered<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.509> hits<00:01:46.690> in<00:01:47.140> between<00:01:47.590> where<00:01:47.800> it's

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
hammered it hits in between where it's

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.870 
hammered it hits in between where it's
hammer<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:49.709> what<00:01:50.709> we<00:01:50.830> get<00:01:51.009> is<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.280> softer

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
hammer it and what we get is a softer

hammer it and what we get is a softer
master<00:01:52.360> sound<00:01:52.679> sounding<00:01:53.679> chick<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:56.340> great

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
master sound sounding chick and great

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.699 
master sound sounding chick and great
sticking<00:01:58.060> definition<00:01:58.720> but<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.229> still<00:01:59.500> gets

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
sticking definition but it still gets

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.520 
sticking definition but it still gets
the<00:02:00.429> air<00:02:00.610> out<00:02:01.300> from<00:02:01.360> between<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.110> cymbals

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
the air out from between the cymbals

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.040 
the air out from between the cymbals
