to<00:02:18.840> demo<00:02:19.200> doing<00:02:19.590> things<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.310> but

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
having that that glow that was just

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.949 
having that that glow that was just
mapped<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.820> there<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.330> move<00:02:24.600> it's

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
mapped on there and as I move it's

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.470 
mapped on there and as I move it's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
stayed walked to the image there that's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.850 
stayed walked to the image there that's
the<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.959> thing<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.200> will<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.590> doing

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the kind of thing that will be doing

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.970 
the kind of thing that will be doing
with<00:02:28.980> augmented<00:02:29.190> reality
