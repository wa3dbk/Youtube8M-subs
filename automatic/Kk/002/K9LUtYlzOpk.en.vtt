00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
let's see this is this side of the motor

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.190 
let's see this is this side of the motor

Speedway on here

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.400 
Speedway on here
for<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.510> mounts<00:04:11.810> on<00:04:11.930> here<00:04:12.080> and<00:04:12.170> this<00:04:12.260> is

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
for the the mounts on here and this is

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.230

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.820 
just a front-end kit from Speedway I
think<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.900> was<00:04:14.989> about<00:04:15.080> six<00:04:15.380> seven<00:04:15.620> hundred

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
think that was about six seven hundred

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.259 
think that was about six seven hundred
bucks<00:04:15.950> but<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.549> know<00:04:16.669> some<00:04:16.880> things<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.120> have

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
bucks but you know some things you have

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.569 
bucks but you know some things you have
to<00:04:17.299> pay<00:04:17.540> for<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.680> basically<00:04:18.859> push<00:04:19.400> it

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
to pay for and basically push it

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.610 
to pay for and basically push it
together<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.120> this<00:04:20.419> is<00:04:20.510> all<00:04:20.630> my<00:04:20.780> framework<00:04:21.079> so

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
together and this is all my framework so

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.860 
together and this is all my framework so
I'm<00:04:21.680> kind<00:04:21.889> of<00:04:21.919> proud<00:04:22.130> of<00:04:22.190> that<00:04:22.430> -<00:04:22.610> what<00:04:23.540> else<00:04:23.720> we

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
rod is I'm not gonna argue with it

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.840

my<00:05:17.090> definition<00:05:17.900> of<00:05:18.169> any<00:05:18.320> car<00:05:18.680> is<00:05:18.890> it<00:05:19.490> has<00:05:19.640> to<00:05:19.760> be

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
my definition of any car is it has to be

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.490 
my definition of any car is it has to be
functional<00:05:20.120> driving<00:05:20.720> down<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:20.960> road<00:05:21.169> and

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
functional driving down the road and

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.950 
functional driving down the road and
therefore<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:21.979> have<00:05:22.280> I<00:05:22.700> finished<00:05:23.360> out<00:05:23.479> my<00:05:23.510> trunk

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
welded in floor I got my battery down

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:36.940 
welded in floor I got my battery down
here

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
here

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.250 
here
I<00:05:36.979> got<00:05:37.520> electric<00:05:37.880> cut<00:05:38.090> out<00:05:38.210> some<00:05:38.419> qtb<00:05:38.960> in<00:05:39.110> this

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
I got electric cut out some qtb in this

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.080 
I got electric cut out some qtb in this
thing<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:39.470> I<00:05:39.650> can<00:05:39.830> be<00:05:39.919> annoyingly<00:05:40.340> loud<00:05:40.669> or<00:05:41.000> I

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
thing so I can be annoyingly loud or I

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.520 
thing so I can be annoyingly loud or I
can<00:05:41.330> cruise<00:05:41.720> down<00:05:41.870> a<00:05:41.930> road<00:05:42.140> for<00:05:42.380> long

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
can cruise down a road for long

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.690 
can cruise down a road for long
distances<00:05:44.590> my<00:05:45.590> visor<00:05:45.800> here<00:05:46.190> oh<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.280> extended

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
distances my visor here oh I extended

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.330 
distances my visor here oh I extended
this<00:05:46.850> about<00:05:47.450> an<00:05:47.630> inch<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.200> a<00:05:48.229> half<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:48.919> that

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
this about an inch and a half and that

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.890 
this about an inch and a half and that
basically<00:05:49.729> accommodates<00:05:50.390> the<00:05:50.539> electric

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
basically accommodates the electric

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.879 
basically accommodates the electric
motor<00:05:51.140> which<00:05:51.919> sits<00:05:52.190> up<00:05:52.430> in<00:05:52.810> here

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.700 

and<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.879> think<00:05:57.120> that's<00:05:57.270> about<00:05:57.389> it<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:58.650> only

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
and I think that's about it the only

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.480 
and I think that's about it the only
thing<00:05:58.860> I'll<00:05:59.129> I'll<00:05:59.490> show<00:05:59.789> you<00:05:59.849> out<00:06:00.030> here<00:06:00.300> is<00:06:00.449> a

for some buddies and friends of mine and

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.950 
for some buddies and friends of mine and
so<00:06:26.759> here's<00:06:27.030> what<00:06:27.180> it<00:06:27.210> looks<00:06:27.270> like<00:06:27.509> on<00:06:27.659> the<00:06:27.719> back

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
so here's what it looks like on the back

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.629 
so here's what it looks like on the back
and<00:06:28.229> a<00:06:28.259> soft<00:06:28.469> flat<00:06:28.710> black<00:06:28.919> everything's<00:06:29.460> new

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
and a soft flat black everything's new

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.480 
and a soft flat black everything's new
back<00:06:29.879> here<00:06:30.120> so<00:06:30.300> basically<00:06:30.479> I<00:06:30.840> just<00:06:30.990> have<00:06:31.169> to

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
back here so basically I just have to

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.920 
back here so basically I just have to
wire<00:06:32.490> it<00:06:32.699> up<00:06:32.819> probably<00:06:33.389> shoot<00:06:33.509> it<00:06:33.719> with<00:06:33.840> the

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
wire it up probably shoot it with the

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.980 
wire it up probably shoot it with the
next<00:06:34.139> couple<00:06:34.469> of<00:06:34.500> weeks<00:06:34.560> and<00:06:35.479> I<00:06:36.479> think<00:06:36.840> that's

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
next couple of weeks and I think that's

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.300 
next couple of weeks and I think that's
basically<00:06:37.139> about<00:06:37.680> it<00:06:39.469> here's<00:06:40.469> my<00:06:40.590> 55<00:06:41.009> with<00:06:41.279> a

basically about it here's my 55 with a

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.080 
basically about it here's my 55 with a
big<00:06:41.520> block<00:06:41.759> in<00:06:41.939> it

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
big block in it

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.850 
big block in it
