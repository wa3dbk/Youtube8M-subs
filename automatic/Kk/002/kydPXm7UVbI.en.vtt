00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.679
 Happy Easter to all guys I am a medina 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.330
 and welcome back here on my channel with a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.189
 new episode the sixty-third of the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.989
 top five place of the week today sankoh 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.579
 with an episode really in my opinion 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.720
 very, very interesting 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.099
 we are now in fifth place 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.169
 naive danilo that makes us beautiful 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.540
 trick shot to start the game of 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.980
 team deathmatch really really me 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.719
 he really enjoyed it especially because he 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.250
 came spontaneously precisely because in 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.250
 that commodity is not that part does the triceht 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.660
 made like a 720 with double switch has 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.580
 really made a nice trick shot then 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.450
 congratulations danilo quindo much place 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.700
 deserved 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.190
 we now pass the fourth position where 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 we find we are in the fourth position 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.240
 the mms shocks that is playing with the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.870
 sniper with the mors on rio pecco and ci 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.300
 makes a beautiful beautiful seven 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.550
 anfield and with me it seems six on screen if 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 I'm not wrong or on-screen files anyway 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.060
 a very, very beautiful clip 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.769
 fourth promise because as you know 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.300
 raised two hours for the sniper clips 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.830
 they are not worth who knows how much 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.330
 in the third position there is the b that stands 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.909
 playing a competitive game 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.460
 against the next gaming cea versus colga 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.870
 duke let's say one of the clans is the club 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 stronger than Italy there was no power 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.140
 however it is very much against a clan 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.479
 strong and makes a killing to say the least 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.240
 scary as you can see it is using 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.909
 the dance and it juggles very well and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.830
 concludes with a beautiful double with 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.210
 a cardboard with a fist he pulled at 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.409
 Then really destroy the enemy 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.909
 unfortunately they lost 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.760
 however, he has really done it 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.470
 a beautiful clip 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.869
 so congratulations the b keep it up 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.040
 because really very very difficult 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.930
 do something like that 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.950
 now let's move to the second position where 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.369
 we find a clip really really 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.320
 scary that offers us our not 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.570
 I get the name now I don't know 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.610
 I wrote it by accident anyway veil 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.080
 you won't see it written in the lower right corner 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.140
 because he didn't write it put 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.049
 forgotten I ask for Venice anyway it takes 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.080
 on a sniper xpr from the ground is called 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.290
 eco frame earth takes leaks pr kills 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.200
 an enemy makes a triple collateral and then 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.730
 will make file on really really beautiful 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.450
 especially the triple collateral a 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.370
 random 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410
 even where the enemies were now we pass 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.620
 instead to the first position where there is one 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.360
 monstrous clip made by rex dark that 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.780
 plays with the bartender with dual band fa un 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.650
 headset comes out in the famous spot 2 18 13 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.620
 oct four and 56 ad for the chat queue 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.060
 on screen phenomenal clip I liked it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.150
 a mess when I saw her I fell 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.319
 from the chair and nothing he liked 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.299
 really a lot even if not the state 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.069
 quite common also because some 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.810
 he didn't take them in his head instead he has them 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.099
 given the collateral says or even 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.840
 look at these two at the bottom not there 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.209
 takes the dana collateral shot 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.680
 ok though guys here the top is 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.390
