00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
nicely and i really like it um this is

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.409

in<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.510> color<00:04:49.220> porcelain<00:04:50.220> it's<00:04:50.940> pretty<00:04:51.180> light

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
in the color porcelain it's pretty light

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.290 
in the color porcelain it's pretty light
I'm<00:04:51.690> obviously<00:04:52.020> porcelain<00:04:52.740> dolls<00:04:53.039> are<00:04:53.300> very

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
I'm obviously porcelain dolls are very

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.620 
I'm obviously porcelain dolls are very
pale<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:54.930> that's<00:04:55.289> kind<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.530> sad<00:04:55.710> um<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.479> yeah<00:04:57.600> I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
pale so that's kind of sad um so yeah I

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.810 
pale so that's kind of sad um so yeah I
think<00:04:57.810> those<00:04:58.139> are<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.350> things<00:04:58.560> I'm<00:04:59.340> going

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
think those are the things I'm going

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.190 
think those are the things I'm going
over<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.150> weekend<00:05:00.450> so<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.600> have<00:05:00.750> my<00:05:00.930> stuff

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
over the weekend so I have my stuff

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.110 
over the weekend so I have my stuff
packed<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.010> those<00:05:02.580> are<00:05:02.760> pretty<00:05:02.880> much<00:05:03.060> the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
packed and so those are pretty much the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.390 
packed and so those are pretty much the
basics<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:03.960> have<00:05:04.200> other<00:05:04.560> than<00:05:04.770> just<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.250> few

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
basics that I have other than just a few

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.490 
basics that I have other than just a few
other<00:05:05.550> eye<00:05:05.610> shadow<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.680> options<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:08.070> things

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
other eye shadow of options and things

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.730 
other eye shadow of options and things
but<00:05:10.500> yeah<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.710> think<00:05:10.979> that<00:05:11.280> having<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.910> nice<00:05:12.740> well

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
but yeah I think that having a nice well

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.279 
but yeah I think that having a nice well
covered<00:05:14.550> face<00:05:14.940> kind<00:05:15.389> of<00:05:15.479> makes<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.139> huge

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
covered face kind of makes a huge

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.870 
covered face kind of makes a huge
difference<00:05:16.560> I<00:05:16.860> could<00:05:17.039> honestly<00:05:17.160> do<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:17.669> in

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
difference I could honestly do that in

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.420 
difference I could honestly do that in
mascara<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.510> be<00:05:18.600> totally<00:05:18.750> fine<00:05:19.080> going<00:05:19.590> out

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
mascara and be totally fine going out

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.250 
mascara and be totally fine going out
yeah<00:05:21.420> I<00:05:21.450> just<00:05:21.750> thought<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.930> guys<00:05:22.020> might<00:05:22.080> like
