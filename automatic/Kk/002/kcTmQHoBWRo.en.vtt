the<00:00:32.730> PVC<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> same<00:00:33.600> diameter<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.770> base<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the PVC of the same diameter the base is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.680 
the PVC of the same diameter the base is
two<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.940> half<00:00:36.090> inch<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:38.420> actually<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> take

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
two and a half inch and actually I take

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.119 
two and a half inch and actually I take
that<00:00:39.750> back<00:00:39.989> that's<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> half<00:00:40.739> inch<00:00:40.980> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
that back that's one and a half inch I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.270 
that back that's one and a half inch I
went<00:00:41.370> from<00:00:41.610> two<00:00:41.910> inch<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> half<00:00:43.280> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
went from two inch to one and a half so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.080 
went from two inch to one and a half so
this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.149> half<00:00:45.210> inch<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.870> then

it after thinking about it I kind of did
like<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> pull<00:01:17.759> test<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.570> like

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
like a pull test on it you know like

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.390 
like a pull test on it you know like
just<00:01:18.840> boom<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.439> your<00:01:19.560> fingers<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400

just boom with your fingers and I
couldn't<00:01:20.670> tear<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.119> course<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.509> it's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
couldn't tear it of course because it's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.499 
couldn't tear it of course because it's
fairly<00:01:22.020> thick<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.520> was<00:01:23.670> thinking<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
fairly thick but I was thinking that you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.730 
fairly thick but I was thinking that you
know<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:24.750> no<00:01:24.869> problem<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.350> squirrel

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
know that's no problem for a squirrel
you<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> chew<00:01:26.790> through<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.299> obviously<00:01:27.780> a

you know to chew through so obviously a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.319 
you know to chew through so obviously a
raccoon<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.530> possum<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:29.670> anything<00:01:29.909> else<00:01:30.180> that

plastic<00:01:35.130> wire<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.329> excited<00:01:36.689> in

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
plastic wire I was kind of excited in

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.850 
plastic wire I was kind of excited in
the<00:01:36.810> beginning<00:01:37.110> because<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.439> green<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the beginning because it was green so

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.800 
the beginning because it was green so
it's<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.250> different<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.119> after

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it's a little bit different but after

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.179 
it's a little bit different but after
thinking<00:01:40.020> about<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.740> only<00:01:40.890> just

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
thinking about it and it's only just

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
thinking about it and it's only just
this<00:01:41.280> plastic<00:01:41.960> that's<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
this plastic that's really not going to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.649 
this plastic that's really not going to
work<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.740> our<00:01:43.979> needs<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.509> because<00:01:45.509> we'd

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
work for our needs so because we'd

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.450 
work for our needs so because we'd
already<00:01:45.780> open<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.380> we're<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
already open to this we're just going to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.530 
already open to this we're just going to
put<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.729> inside<00:01:49.520> no<00:01:50.520> real<00:01:50.729> reason<00:01:51.149> just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
put it inside no real reason just

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.179 
put it inside no real reason just
because<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.590> anything<00:01:52.829> else<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
because I don't have anything else to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.920 
because I don't have anything else to
use<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.149> we're<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
use it for right now so we're going to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.709 
use it for right now so we're going to
put<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.140> inside<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.860> coop<00:01:56.070> itself<00:01:56.719> this

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
put it inside of the coop itself this

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.380 
put it inside of the coop itself this
coop<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.640> actually<00:02:00.140> five<00:02:01.140> feet

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
coop here is actually five feet

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.410 
coop here is actually five feet
by<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.440> 11<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.220> 12<00:02:05.520> something<00:02:05.970> kind<00:02:06.120> of<00:02:06.210> weird

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
by like 11 or 12 something kind of weird

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.730 
by like 11 or 12 something kind of weird
you<00:02:06.690> know<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.320> kind<00:02:07.440> of<00:02:07.470> one<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.650> those

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you know it's kind of one of those

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.900 
you know it's kind of one of those
things<00:02:08.009> where<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> bought<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> bunch<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.820> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
things where I bought a bunch of the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.190 
things where I bought a bunch of the
pipes<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> electrical<00:02:09.780> conduit

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
pipes you know the electrical conduit

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.580 
pipes you know the electrical conduit
have<00:02:10.880> these<00:02:11.880> type<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> sleeves<00:02:12.540> over<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.960> so

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
have these type of sleeves over it so

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.300 
have these type of sleeves over it so
you<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:13.800> attach<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.310> bunch<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> them<00:02:14.850> together

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
you can attach a bunch of them together

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.090 
you can attach a bunch of them together
anyways<00:02:17.480> after<00:02:18.480> cutting<00:02:18.870> all<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.050> those<00:02:19.320> that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
anyways after cutting all of those that

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.650 
anyways after cutting all of those that
the<00:02:20.400> 10-foot<00:02:20.760> section<00:02:21.150> came<00:02:21.300> down<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> little

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the 10-foot section came down a little

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.110 
the 10-foot section came down a little
bit<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.920> needed<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.730> couple<00:02:24.000> more

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
bit and then I needed a couple more

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.210 
bit and then I needed a couple more
braces<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> added<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.620> couple<00:02:25.800> extra

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
braces in here so I added a couple extra

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.820 
braces in here so I added a couple extra
there<00:02:26.490> too<00:02:27.350> but<00:02:29.270> anyways<00:02:30.500> that's<00:02:31.500> really

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
there too but anyways that's really

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.680 
there too but anyways that's really
we're<00:02:31.950> at<00:02:32.130> right<00:02:32.340> here<00:02:32.670> we'll<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.240> door<00:02:33.510> up

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
we're at right here we'll have a door up

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.310 
we're at right here we'll have a door up
front<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:35.010> get<00:02:35.190> into<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.550> fairly<00:02:35.820> easy<00:02:36.320> I've

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
front I can get into it fairly easy I've

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.080 
front I can get into it fairly easy I've
got<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> couple<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.890> pretty<00:02:38.100> good<00:02:38.250> ideas<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.610> I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
got a couple of pretty good ideas but I

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.120 
got a couple of pretty good ideas but I
was<00:02:39.630> anticipating<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.500> by<00:02:40.620> watching<00:02:40.860> some

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
was anticipating just by watching some

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.440 
was anticipating just by watching some
of<00:02:41.160> y'all's<00:02:41.400> videos<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:41.940> YouTube<00:02:42.300> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
of y'all's videos on YouTube and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.970 
of y'all's videos on YouTube and
everything<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.900> was<00:02:43.020> anticipating<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.709> only

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
everything I was anticipating it only

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.650 
everything I was anticipating it only
taking<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.340> couple<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.700> hours<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.239> make<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.630> I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
taking a couple of hours to make and I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.850 
taking a couple of hours to make and I
don't<00:02:45.720> know<00:02:45.989> why<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> thought<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.560> would<00:02:46.739> be

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
don't know why I thought it would be

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.699 
don't know why I thought it would be
that<00:02:47.010> quick<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.900> nothing's<00:02:48.900> ever<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.200> easy

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
that quick but nothing's ever that easy

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.180 
that quick but nothing's ever that easy
so<00:02:50.239> it's<00:02:51.239> going<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.810> we'll<00:02:52.440> see<00:02:52.650> what<00:02:52.830> happens

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
so it's going and we'll see what happens

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.490 
so it's going and we'll see what happens
I<00:02:53.400> will<00:02:53.970> keep<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.630> up-to-date<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:55.170> plan<00:02:55.380> on

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
I will keep you up-to-date we plan on

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.680 
I will keep you up-to-date we plan on
making<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.830> for<00:02:56.130> four<00:02:56.370> chickens<00:02:56.820> they<00:02:57.480> will

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
making this for four chickens they will

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.830 
making this for four chickens they will
have<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.050> ability<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.670> go<00:02:59.670> underneath<00:03:00.090> too<00:03:00.510> so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
have the ability to go underneath too so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.810 
have the ability to go underneath too so
they'll<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.100> access<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.220> all<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.550> grass

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.430 
they'll have access to all the grass
underneath<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.630> mean<00:03:03.780> obviously<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.260> sitting

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
underneath I mean obviously it's sitting

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.110 
underneath I mean obviously it's sitting
on<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> deck<00:03:04.739> right<00:03:04.770> now<00:03:04.980> but<00:03:05.850> they'll<00:03:06.000> have

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
on the deck right now but they'll have

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.580 
on the deck right now but they'll have
access<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.690> grass<00:03:06.930> all<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.500> way

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
access to the grass all the way

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.780 
access to the grass all the way
underneath<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.220> then<00:03:08.310> there'll<00:03:08.489> be<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.640> little

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
underneath and then there'll be a little

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.780 
underneath and then there'll be a little
platform<00:03:09.360> here<00:03:09.680> that'll<00:03:10.680> go<00:03:10.799> up<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.580> coop

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
platform here that'll go up to the coop

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.320

get<00:03:25.860> too<00:03:26.040> much<00:03:26.220> into<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.670> kind<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.150> to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
get too much into that I kind of like to

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.160 
get too much into that I kind of like to
do<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.950> little<00:03:28.980> bit<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.370> everything

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
do just a little bit of everything

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.120 
do just a little bit of everything
obviously<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.260> channel<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.560> not<00:03:31.650> about<00:03:31.860> one

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
obviously the channel is not about one

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.530 
obviously the channel is not about one
particular<00:03:32.670> thing<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:32.970> think<00:03:33.150> everyone's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
particular thing I think everyone's

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.380 
particular thing I think everyone's
noticed<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.110> by<00:03:34.290> now<00:03:34.820> here's<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.940> back<00:03:36.120> side

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
noticed that by now here's the back side

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.500 
noticed that by now here's the back side
of<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:37.590> will<00:03:37.860> actually<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.820> axle

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
of it this will actually have the axle

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.900 
of it this will actually have the axle
going<00:03:39.780> through<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.080> here<00:03:40.549> from<00:03:41.549> what<00:03:41.790> I'm

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
going through it here from what I'm

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.240 
going through it here from what I'm
planning<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.600> far<00:03:42.870> I'll<00:03:43.350> put<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.799> tires

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
planning so far I'll put the tires

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.539 
planning so far I'll put the tires
through<00:03:44.580> here<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.090> then<00:03:45.390> on<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.690> side<00:03:46.549> it's

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
through here and then on that side it's

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.130 
through here and then on that side it's
all<00:03:47.730> kind<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.060> work<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.239> progress<00:03:48.540> we'll<00:03:48.930> see

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
all kind of a work in progress we'll see

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.080 
all kind of a work in progress we'll see
what<00:03:49.290> happens<00:03:49.650> but<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.190> far<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:50.910> what

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
what happens but so far this is what

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.140 
what happens but so far this is what
we've<00:03:51.239> got<00:03:51.680> we<00:03:52.680> were<00:03:52.799> able<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.310> keep<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.910> hoops

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
we've got we were able to keep the hoops

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.880 
we've got we were able to keep the hoops
now<00:03:54.630> obviously<00:03:55.110> that's<00:03:55.290> not<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.769> know

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
now obviously that's not you know

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.479 
now obviously that's not you know
straight<00:03:56.190> yet<00:03:56.400> course<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.120> still<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.330> work<00:03:57.600> but

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
straight yet course is still a work but

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.860 
straight yet course is still a work but
what<00:03:59.489> we<00:03:59.610> liked<00:03:59.820> about<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.120> was<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.540> fact<00:04:00.750> that

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
what we liked about it was the fact that

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.710 
what we liked about it was the fact that
we<00:04:01.049> were<00:04:01.170> able<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.590> keep<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.910> hoops<00:04:03.180> all<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
we were able to keep the hoops all the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.009 
we were able to keep the hoops all the
same<00:04:03.930> size<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:06.120> shorter<00:04:06.450> ones<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.930> the

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
same size so the shorter ones in the

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.840 
same size so the shorter ones in the
back<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.680> know<00:04:07.769> making<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.130> house<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.700> it

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
back you know making a house but it

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.280 
back you know making a house but it
would<00:04:08.940> all<00:04:09.060> be<00:04:09.090> one<00:04:09.810> cone<00:04:10.110> so<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:11.340> know<00:04:11.459> or<00:04:11.640> one

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
would all be one cone so you know or one

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.380 
would all be one cone so you know or one
semicircle<00:04:13.290> type<00:04:13.500> shape<00:04:13.830> but<00:04:14.280> anyways<00:04:15.270> I

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
semicircle type shape but anyways I

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.770 
semicircle type shape but anyways I
think<00:04:15.480> it'll<00:04:15.750> turn<00:04:15.870> out<00:04:16.020> pretty<00:04:16.109> cool

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
think it'll turn out pretty cool

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.620 
think it'll turn out pretty cool
and<00:04:17.310> I'll<00:04:18.310> probably<00:04:18.549> show<00:04:18.880> one<00:04:19.150> more<00:04:19.180> in

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
and I'll probably show one more in

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.330 
and I'll probably show one more in
progress<00:04:20.139> video<00:04:20.500> so<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:20.859> will<00:04:21.010> be<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.100> part

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
progress video so this will be a part

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.390 
progress video so this will be a part
one<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.850> then<00:04:22.800> hopefully<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.889> third<00:04:24.100> video

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
one and then hopefully the third video

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.120 
one and then hopefully the third video
will<00:04:24.580> actually<00:04:24.880> have<00:04:25.000> chickens<00:04:25.360> in<00:04:25.450> it<00:04:25.570> so

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
will actually have chickens in it so

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.950 
will actually have chickens in it so
