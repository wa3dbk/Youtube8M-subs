00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.660
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:09.350
 new video on unboxing master 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.449
 today it's about this package that 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.990
 is again a packet of ebay this time 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.460
 from richard or richard and yes that have 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.320
 I'll get it for it now 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.030
 Let's go and we'll take a closer look 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.640
 look at what we have there 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.680
 and if that's what I'm thinking right now 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.140
 Whatever it is, I think 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.630
 yes it's pretty cool it 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.090
 actually and yes I just have to try 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.120
 from war so and that is something 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.390
 green as you can already see 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.649
 and there we have the elder scrolls 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:48.050
 3 moritz for the xbox in the us version 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:50.480
 by the tester software yes morrowind was 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.750
 This is the third part of the call 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.059
 line 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.640
 i have to admit i have the first one and 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.840
 Never really played second and me 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.390
 I do not really know much about it 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.190
 no idea that is actually the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.040
 Title with me this series 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.630
 I got to know me then 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.999
 do not know if it's on pc or too 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.740
 xbox morrowind stop someday 

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:13.850
 had seen and then again briefly 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.389
 played and yes so what should I do about it 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.939
 say 

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:18.740
 It has a pretty big game world and 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.329
 you created that character 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.130
 different choices 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.020
 I think if that was possible then 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.689
 I have created my ex I am something 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.219
 unsafe and then you started there 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.409
 at a time instead of me or something 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.329
 there were still symptoms and then there was 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.109
 since so barrels where to take things out 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.070
 could have closed close and so on 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.450
 Yes 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.860
 which I always keep cool 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.200
 This game I think I 've got there 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.880
 was once looked at a butterfly times 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.260
 that could go out are the things 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.150
 just like that with the dealer now 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.950
 clear and could if he did not stop 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.590
 look or something and such things 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.180
 I can do that pretty cool and yes 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.890
 It's always easy to find there 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.570
 to take everything with me and it was 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.240
 but not so good because mine 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.400
 Luggage were equally full as well and yes 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.200
 and then you let politics 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.450
 explores the area gets quests and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.070
 There are caverns and monsters everywhere 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.679
 can darwin and do this and that 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.670
 and yes, there are too many too many 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.930
 make in this game 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.100
 and then I have again 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.620
 stopped playing because that's me too 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.120
 Much has been and always not as their 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.020
 direct plan had what I do now 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.910
 or where I want to go 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.340
 I think I'm more of a player 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.650
 always prefer to run a predetermined path 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.540
 instead of having too much free space 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.100
 where you can do everything possible then 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.000
 do not know where to start 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.860
 but well that's me and so much 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 I do not know any more about milan 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.310
 then I have not played anymore 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.260
 and does not have it anymore and yes 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.370
 What else can I say that for short 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.140
 Serbia 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.959
 but I have never played or 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.959
 something no idea and elder scrolls 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.580
 5 skyrim I have one too 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.930
 had played a bit and found it 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.360
 actually not that bad 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.070
 It was quite nice but 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.720
 then I stopped so I know 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.280
 not i think this game is not 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.420
 so necessarily for me 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.670
 long-term motivation 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.560
 but maybe I'm starting times but are 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.940
 to have a look there are also people who 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.320
 say this is better or me 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.620
 believe the best of the elder scrolls 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.690
 line 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.739
 but I have no idea we look 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.840
 look at the back 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.989
 Here we have a few 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.100
 screenshots there is already best of e3 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:22.280
 and top 20 games day 3 and better 43 of the 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.769
 apg game revolution and he is cult 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.230
 series games at hall of fame 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.120
 So this is praised very highly 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.530
 play the way it looks and still have 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.320
 I pulled a big picture 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.209
 think dark 11 or so if i am myself 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.120
 not mistaken 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.709
 and yes here is also lena explorer 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.540
 before that I believe then the first 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.070
 both of elder scrolls were from 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.130
 94 and 96 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.450
 and that is then the third part and 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.190
 here 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.280
 already playing as a character each to 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.349
 you can imagine from kia to the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.209
 at ac siena and so much world too much 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.379
 discover is everywhere you want and 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.209
 do what you want 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.599
 that's the thing that always got me that way 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.480
 bit disturbs or and just nice 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.800
 graphics yes we do it all the time 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.450
 us, we look for what those in it 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.340
 and we just have one 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.239
 I have to say quite a lot so what is 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.760
 because everything is so prophecies here 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.100
 the solution book for only 20 dollars yes 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.710
 then we have the software 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.410
 registration card so what is the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.850
 even at this is cool 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.889
 yes, I'll try this one here 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.760
 bit into the camera so there is 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.240
 it is just now 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:42.729
 Here we have the big map of the world 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.410
 by waldenfels is nice that the 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.669
 the card is still there, that's what makes me happy 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.710
 I do not get it together now 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.050

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.539
 instructions yes back with the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.820
 Control is very cool and is not 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.710
 too thin and it too in color and that 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.270
 here in english english german 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.910
 and that's completely by 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.780
 back to front so perfect English 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.910
 it should be 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.370
 and then I still have the cd you 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.340

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.220
 I have to say and she just has none 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.850
 scratch very place and make me completely 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.000

 Scrolls series generally finds or stops 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.120
