00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
employees and neighbors fine Krabs isn't

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.609 
employees and neighbors fine Krabs isn't
known<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.750> most<00:01:24.840> trusting<00:01:25.470> person

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
known to be the most trusting person

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.950 
known to be the most trusting person
especially<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.970> his<00:01:27.119> money<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.450> secret

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
especially with his money and secret

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.679 
especially with his money and secret
recipe<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.460> guess<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> does<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
recipe so I guess it does make a bit of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.140 
recipe so I guess it does make a bit of
sense<00:01:30.979> anyway<00:01:31.979> speaking<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.670> valuables

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
sense anyway speaking of valuables

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.359 
sense anyway speaking of valuables
they're<00:01:33.479> located<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.229> safe<00:01:34.470> behind<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.040> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
they're located in a safe behind you so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
they're located in a safe behind you so

something the most likely cause is the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
something the most likely cause is the
animatronics<00:02:05.219> they've<00:02:06.210> been<00:02:06.360> designed<00:02:06.630> to

animatronics they've been designed to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.300 
animatronics they've been designed to
draw<00:02:06.869> power<00:02:07.110> from<00:02:07.229> an<00:02:07.439> on-site<00:02:07.770> source<00:02:08.099> to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
draw power from an on-site source to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.969 
draw power from an on-site source to
save<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.729> their<00:02:08.849> own<00:02:08.970> energy<00:02:09.390> costs<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.830> you

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
save on their own energy costs so if you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.230 
save on their own energy costs so if you
notice<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.489> office<00:02:11.790> lights<00:02:12.030> flashing<00:02:12.690> then

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
notice the office lights flashing then

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.880 
notice the office lights flashing then
it<00:02:13.420> probably<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.230> means<00:02:14.350> they've<00:02:14.650> wandered

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
it probably just means they've wandered

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.350 
it probably just means they've wandered
up<00:02:15.040> onto<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> landing<00:02:15.670> out<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.910> front<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.180> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
up onto the landing out the front of you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.700 
up onto the landing out the front of you
absolutely<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.080> wouldn't<00:02:17.410> worry<00:02:17.560> too<00:02:17.620> much

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
absolutely I wouldn't worry too much

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.190 
absolutely I wouldn't worry too much

let's<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.960> look<00:02:56.020> where<00:02:56.350> was<00:02:56.500> Patrick

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
let's have a look where was Patrick

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.260 
let's have a look where was Patrick
original<00:02:57.130> he<00:02:57.190> was<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.460> toilet<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:57.880> is<00:02:58.180> he

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.850 
I've got a union and I don't know
because<00:03:49.630> if<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.020> case<00:03:50.200> then<00:03:50.470> mr.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
because if that's the case then mr.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.620 
because if that's the case then mr.
Krabs<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.250> really<00:03:51.640> over<00:03:52.180> can<00:03:52.360> just<00:03:52.510> leave

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630

that light on

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.720 
that light on
so<00:03:55.780> basically<00:03:56.350> should<00:03:57.040> probably<00:03:57.280> be<00:03:57.460> the<00:03:57.550> same

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
so basically should probably be the same

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.030 
so basically should probably be the same
tactic<00:03:58.180> as<00:03:58.390> what<00:03:59.320> we<00:03:59.440> did<00:03:59.560> before<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.950> don't

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
tactic as what we did before I don't
