hey<00:00:01.829> guys<00:00:02.129> Here<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.000> am<00:00:03.140> working<00:00:04.140> on<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
hey guys Here I am working on the

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.210 
hey guys Here I am working on the
regeneration<00:00:06.750> alternator<00:00:07.290> so<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
regeneration alternator so this is the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.259 
regeneration alternator so this is the
one<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.580> rewound<00:00:10.519> you<00:00:11.519> didn't<00:00:11.790> see<00:00:12.000> him<00:00:12.150> in

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
one that I rewound you didn't see him in

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.860 
one that I rewound you didn't see him in
there<00:00:12.450> at<00:00:12.630> all<00:00:13.130> but<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.759> took<00:00:15.360> out<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.839> old

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
there at all but I took out the old

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.840 
there at all but I took out the old
windings<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.390> wound<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.720> new<00:00:18.900> ones<00:00:19.140> with<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
windings and I wound in new ones with a

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.439 
windings and I wound in new ones with a
22-gauge<00:00:20.850> magnet<00:00:21.810> wire<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.320> put<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.240> 10<00:00:24.240> times

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
22-gauge magnet wire I put a 10 times

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
22-gauge magnet wire I put a 10 times
around<00:00:24.920> which<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.670> given<00:00:27.119> me<00:00:27.330> about<00:00:27.740> 45<00:00:28.740> volt

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
around which is given me about 45 volt

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.200 
around which is given me about 45 volt
46<00:00:30.330> volts<00:00:31.640> under<00:00:32.640> load<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> output<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
46 volts under load on the output so I

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.290 
46 volts under load on the output so I
hooked<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.410> rotor<00:00:37.620> is

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
hooked it up so that the the rotor is

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
hooked it up so that the the rotor is
just<00:00:39.320> constant<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.770> hook<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.040> this

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
just constant on it just hook it up this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.930 
just constant on it just hook it up this
little<00:00:41.370> battery<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:43.760> hooking<00:00:44.760> up

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
little battery here just hooking up

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.959 
little battery here just hooking up
there<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.020> he<00:00:46.829> saw<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.250> before<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.820> old

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
there and he saw this before the old

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.229 
there and he saw this before the old
drive<00:00:48.180> setup<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:50.520> here's<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
drive setup so then here's the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.410 
drive setup so then here's the
three-phase<00:00:51.899> output<00:00:52.579> from<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.789> new<00:00:53.940> bindings

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
three-phase output from the new bindings

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.750 
three-phase output from the new bindings
which<00:00:54.629> come<00:00:54.870> down<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.550> three<00:00:56.550> phase

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
which come down to this three phase

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.920 
which come down to this three phase
bridge<00:00:57.180> rectifier<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.399> then<00:00:59.399> for<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> load<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
bridge rectifier and then for a load I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.730 
bridge rectifier and then for a load I
just<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:02.239> these<00:01:03.239> two<00:01:03.719> resistors<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:05.299> their

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
just have these two resistors that their

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.880 
just have these two resistors that their
120<00:01:07.740> watt<00:01:08.689> 25<00:01:09.689> ohm<00:01:09.930> resistors<00:01:10.500> wired<00:01:10.740> in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
120 watt 25 ohm resistors wired in

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399 
120 watt 25 ohm resistors wired in
parallel<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:11.820> about<00:01:12.780> 12<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.350> half

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
parallel so that's about 12 and a half

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
parallel so that's about 12 and a half
homes<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:15.320> 240<00:01:16.320> watts<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> those<00:01:18.030> were

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
homes and 240 watts so those were

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.789 
homes and 240 watts so those were
braking<00:01:18.600> resistors<00:01:19.049> they<00:01:19.200> came<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
braking resistors they came out if I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.960 
braking resistors they came out if I
have<00:01:20.009> an<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> servo<00:01:21.509> pack<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.729> i<00:01:23.759> got<00:01:23.939> my

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
have an all the servo pack so i got my

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.929 
have an all the servo pack so i got my
amp<00:01:24.210> meter<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
amp meter right here on the on the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.770 
amp meter right here on the on the
resistors<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.369> there's<00:01:29.369> my<00:01:29.549> my<00:01:30.299> multimeter

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
resistors and there's my my multimeter

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.210 
resistors and there's my my multimeter
right<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.130> i<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.310> check<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> voltage

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
right there so i can check the voltage

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.020 
right there so i can check the voltage
so<00:01:35.220> when<00:01:36.150> i<00:01:36.180> hook<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.490> road<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.640> current

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so when i hook up the road at current

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.190 
so when i hook up the road at current
this<00:01:39.659> i<00:01:40.100> can<00:01:41.100> i<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.490> check<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.820> out<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
this i can i can check that out and that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.760 
this i can i can check that out and that
it's<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.350> six<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> half<00:01:46.979> amps<00:01:47.579> ish

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
it's about six and a half amps ish

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's about six and a half amps ish
there's<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> 78<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.409> rotor

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
there's up to 78 on the on the rotor

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.230 
there's up to 78 on the on the rotor
field<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:55.460> does<00:01:56.460> change<00:01:56.729> around<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.030> little<00:01:57.119> bit

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
field so does change around a little bit

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.940 
field so does change around a little bit
when<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.509> running<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:59.250> i'll<00:02:00.030> show<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.919 

let's<00:02:04.950> start<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> under<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.730> load<00:02:08.899> with<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
let's start it under the load with the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.710 
let's start it under the load with the
penny

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.220 

and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.710 

3.5

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:53.600 

resistors

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.100 

so<00:02:54.610> that's<00:02:54.850> about<00:02:55.410> 160<00:02:56.410> watts<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.010> far<00:02:58.110> I'm

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
so that's about 160 watts so far I'm

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.780 
so that's about 160 watts so far I'm
having<00:02:59.440> trouble<00:02:59.560> with<00:02:59.830> one<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.190> legs<00:03:00.430> this

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
having trouble with one of the legs this

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.580 
having trouble with one of the legs this
leg<00:03:01.090> right<00:03:01.330> here<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.810> Mike<00:03:02.080> by<00:03:02.260> folding

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
leg right here that I Mike by folding

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.150 
leg right here that I Mike by folding
the<00:03:02.650> wire<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.880> three<00:03:04.090> phase<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:05.160> only

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
the wire of the three phase is only

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.310 
the wire of the three phase is only
about<00:03:06.370> half<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.060> voltage<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.960> other<00:03:08.080> two

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
about half the voltage of the other two

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.010 
about half the voltage of the other two
legs<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.490> go<00:03:09.940> take<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.180> back<00:03:10.390> apart<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.840> see

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
legs so I go take it back apart and see

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.620 
legs so I go take it back apart and see
what's<00:03:11.050> going<00:03:11.320> on<00:03:11.500> with<00:03:11.710> that<00:03:11.830> way<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.630> think

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
what's going on with that way I think

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.990 
what's going on with that way I think
that's<00:03:13.810> what's<00:03:14.160> limiting<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.520> output<00:03:15.850> right

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
that's what's limiting the output right

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.760 
that's what's limiting the output right
now<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.210> 160<00:03:17.050> watts<00:03:17.170> because<00:03:17.500> it's<00:03:17.620> only

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
now to 160 watts because it's only

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.640
