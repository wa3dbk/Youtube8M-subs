to<00:01:39.710> follow<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.890> guide<00:01:41.600> alright<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.810> we're

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to follow this guide alright and we're

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.300 
to follow this guide alright and we're
going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.049> cut<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> whole<00:01:43.470> thing<00:01:43.500> shorter<00:01:44.130> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
going to cut the whole thing shorter to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.770 
going to cut the whole thing shorter to
longer<00:01:45.409> which<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:47.100> allow<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> top<00:01:48.360> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
longer which will allow for the top of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.920 
longer which will allow for the top of
the<00:01:49.740> front<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.670> left<00:01:50.909> longer<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the front here to be left longer and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.230 
the front here to be left longer and
then<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.290> kind<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.500> come<00:01:52.649> back<00:01:52.860> over<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
then this will kind of come back over it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.060 
then this will kind of come back over it
like<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.659> alright<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.649> I've<00:01:55.829> layered

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
like so alright so now that I've layered

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.740 
like so alright so now that I've layered
the<00:01:56.250> top<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.329> do<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.570> actually

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the top what I'm going to do is actually

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.679 
the top what I'm going to do is actually
leave<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.560> longer<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.729> right<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
leave this now longer here right in the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.840 
leave this now longer here right in the
front<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.229> part<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.610> I'm

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
front this part and then all of this I'm

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.480 
front this part and then all of this I'm
actually<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> blend<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.590> do

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
actually going to blend this in and do

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.369 
actually going to blend this in and do
some<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.600> scissor<00:02:06.840> over<00:02:06.960> comb<00:02:07.190> this<00:02:08.190> way

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
some kind of scissor over comb this way

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.550 
some kind of scissor over comb this way
it<00:02:10.379> goes<00:02:10.649> from<00:02:10.860> shorter<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.489> longer

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
it goes from shorter to longer

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.770 
it goes from shorter to longer
and<00:02:12.880> allows<00:02:13.880> us<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:14.300> bit<00:02:14.420> more<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:14.690> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and allows us a little bit more of a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.870 
and allows us a little bit more of a
blend<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.980> way<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.190> can<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.849> a

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
blend this way you can you can have a

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.510 
blend this way you can you can have a
little<00:02:17.060> more<00:02:18.069> flexibility<00:02:19.069> throughout<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
little more flexibility throughout the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.120 
little more flexibility throughout the
top<00:02:19.700> back<00:02:20.030> here<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.599> it's<00:02:21.500> not<00:02:21.590> such<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.860> harsh

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
top back here and it's not such a harsh

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.670 
top back here and it's not such a harsh
line<00:02:22.630> alright<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.230> I'm<00:02:24.410> just<00:02:24.500> going<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
line alright so I'm just going to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.620 
line alright so I'm just going to
continue<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.130> again<00:02:26.060> we're<00:02:26.209> leaving<00:02:26.480> this

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
continue this again we're leaving this

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.890 
continue this again we're leaving this
front<00:02:26.959> bit<00:02:27.110> here<00:02:27.970> longer<00:02:28.970> but<00:02:29.150> I'm<00:02:29.630> just<00:02:29.780> going

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
front bit here longer but I'm just going

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.690 
front bit here longer but I'm just going
to<00:02:29.930> blend<00:02:30.380> this<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.830> little<00:02:31.160> bit<00:02:31.280> from<00:02:31.550> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
to blend this in a little bit from the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.180 
to blend this in a little bit from the
sides<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.330> here<00:02:33.200> into<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> top<00:02:33.739> so<00:02:33.920> it's<00:02:34.069> not

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
sides in here into the top so it's not

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.479 
sides in here into the top so it's not
such<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.489> harsh<00:02:34.849> line<00:02:35.980> even<00:02:36.980> though<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:37.280> still

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
such a harsh line even though we still

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.610 
such a harsh line even though we still
kind<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.760> where's<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.060> spiked<00:02:38.360> up<00:02:38.510> here<00:02:38.870> I'm

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
kind of where's it spiked up here I'm

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.620 
kind of where's it spiked up here I'm
going<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.800> do<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.130> both<00:02:40.160> sides<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.880> then

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
going to do this on both sides and then

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.320 
going to do this on both sides and then
come<00:02:42.200> back<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:42.940> finally<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.030> can<00:02:44.120> work

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
come back and then finally we can work

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.809 
come back and then finally we can work
this<00:02:44.840> front<00:02:45.260> bit<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:45.650> through<00:02:45.830> here<00:02:46.069> all<00:02:46.700> right

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
this front bit in through here all right

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.400 
this front bit in through here all right
so<00:02:46.940> it's<00:02:47.060> looking<00:02:47.299> great<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:47.720> far

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
so it's looking great so far

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.210 
so it's looking great so far
ah<00:02:48.440> now<00:02:49.010> we're<00:02:49.760> getting<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.239> top<00:02:50.480> here<00:02:50.810> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
ah now we're getting to the top here and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.470 
ah now we're getting to the top here and
this<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.430> think<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.819> don't<00:02:53.000> know<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.239> kind<00:02:53.450> of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
this I think I don't know it's kind of

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.750 
this I think I don't know it's kind of
hard<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.720> see<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.110> pitch<00:02:54.290> we<00:02:54.470> had<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.860> think

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
hard to see in the pitch we had I think

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.670 
hard to see in the pitch we had I think
this<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.209> little<00:02:56.450> long<00:02:56.810> into<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.260> into

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
this is a little long into this into

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.339 
this is a little long into this into
this<00:02:57.830> side<00:02:58.069> here<00:02:58.519> alright<00:02:59.450> so<00:02:59.690> what<00:03:00.170> I'm<00:03:00.230> going

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
this side here alright so what I'm going

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.350 
this side here alright so what I'm going
to<00:03:00.410> do<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.830> actually<00:03:01.580> cut<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.120> corner<00:03:03.019> off

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
to do is actually cut this corner off

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.750 
to do is actually cut this corner off
over<00:03:05.360> direct<00:03:05.720> this<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.140> way<00:03:06.549> because<00:03:07.549> it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
over direct this this way because it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.759 
over direct this this way because it
looks<00:03:07.910> like<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.209> coming<00:03:08.390> longer<00:03:09.349> from<00:03:09.590> on

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
looks like it's coming longer from on

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.430 
looks like it's coming longer from on
this<00:03:09.950> side<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.340> sweeps<00:03:10.670> over<00:03:11.090> all<00:03:12.080> right<00:03:12.170> like

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
this side and sweeps over all right like

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.050 
this side and sweeps over all right like
this<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.310> as<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.519> can<00:03:13.610> see<00:03:13.670> it's<00:03:13.940> already

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
this so as you can see it's already

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.740 
this so as you can see it's already
looking<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.480> little<00:03:14.540> bit<00:03:14.720> better<00:03:15.130> okay<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
looking a little bit better okay so and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.990 
looking a little bit better okay so and
then<00:03:17.829> just<00:03:19.510> slightly<00:03:21.160> all<00:03:22.160> right<00:03:22.340> I'm<00:03:22.549> going

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
then just slightly all right I'm going

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.170 
then just slightly all right I'm going
to<00:03:23.120> bring<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.220> just<00:03:25.220> blend<00:03:25.519> this<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.700> little

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
to bring this just blend this a little

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.800 
to bring this just blend this a little
bit<00:03:26.660> more<00:03:27.970> alright<00:03:28.970> because<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.600> see<00:03:29.780> a

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
bit more alright because you can see a

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.750 
bit more alright because you can see a
guide<00:03:30.079> underneath<00:03:30.500> here<00:03:30.769> but<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.519> want<00:03:31.700> to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
guide underneath here but I just want to

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.330 
guide underneath here but I just want to
take<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.060> little<00:03:32.180> bit<00:03:32.690> shorter

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
take this a little bit shorter

throughout the top here just so it has a
little<00:03:36.950> bit<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.310> better<00:03:37.870> blend<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:39.079> it<00:03:39.230> and

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
so I'm just going to over direct this a

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.199 
so I'm just going to over direct this a
little<00:03:45.350> bit<00:03:45.500> back<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.579> still<00:03:46.880> have<00:03:47.060> this

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
little bit back so I still have this

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.500 
little bit back so I still have this
this<00:03:47.870> length<00:03:48.290> throughout<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.739> front<00:03:49.010> here

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
alright right in through here and then

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.009 
alright right in through here and then
it<00:03:52.639> just<00:03:52.910> kind<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.209> works<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.630> in<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.780> little<00:03:53.959> bit

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
it just kind of works it in a little bit

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.410
