card<00:05:31.680> we<00:05:31.830> needed<00:05:32.069> a<00:05:32.159> machine<00:05:32.639> that<00:05:33.419> could

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
card we needed a machine that could

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.409 
card we needed a machine that could
react<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:34.949> his<00:05:35.279> improv<00:05:35.759> and<00:05:36.029> how<00:05:36.150> fast

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
react to the his improv and how fast

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.839 
react to the his improv and how fast
pace<00:05:36.690> was<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.319> the<00:05:38.099> only<00:05:38.310> way<00:05:38.460> that<00:05:38.490> we<00:05:38.729> could

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
pace was but the only way that we could

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.300 
pace was but the only way that we could
get<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.360> results<00:05:39.810> we<00:05:39.930> wanted<00:05:40.440> was<00:05:40.949> to<00:05:41.099> put<00:05:41.279> a

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
get the results we wanted was to put a

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.700 
get the results we wanted was to put a
small<00:05:41.729> animal<00:05:42.210> inside<00:05:42.569> the<00:05:42.750> animatronic<00:05:43.409> so

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
small animal inside the animatronic so

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.120 
small animal inside the animatronic so
it<00:05:43.889> could<00:05:44.099> you<00:05:44.430> know<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:44.819> know<00:05:44.909> react<00:05:45.300> so

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
it could you know you know react so

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.620 
it could you know you know react so
ironically<00:05:47.130> this<00:05:47.279> is<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.520> much<00:05:47.880> like<00:05:48.060> how<00:05:48.240> dr.

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
the animatronic Robotnik it would get

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.749 
the animatronic Robotnik it would get
really<00:06:12.150> really<00:06:12.629> hot<00:06:12.840> and<00:06:13.279> we<00:06:14.279> just<00:06:14.490> needed<00:06:14.639> a

were<00:06:36.500> animatronic<00:06:37.500> and<00:06:37.680> they<00:06:37.770> were<00:06:37.889> usually

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
were animatronic and they were usually

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.680 
were animatronic and they were usually
controlled<00:06:38.430> by<00:06:38.520> an<00:06:38.699> even<00:06:38.880> smaller<00:06:39.149> animal
