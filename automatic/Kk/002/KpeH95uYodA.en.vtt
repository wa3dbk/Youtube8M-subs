giant<00:00:10.190> paper<00:00:10.610> eating<00:00:11.090> monstrosity<00:00:11.720> here<00:00:14.170> the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
giant paper eating monstrosity here the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.550 
giant paper eating monstrosity here the
paper<00:00:15.410> feed<00:00:15.740> is<00:00:16.039> stuck<00:00:16.869> it<00:00:17.869> does<00:00:18.079> not<00:00:18.259> feed

paper feed is stuck it does not feed

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.679 
paper feed is stuck it does not feed
paper<00:00:18.890> I<00:00:19.099> think<00:00:19.369> it's<00:00:19.609> because<00:00:19.939> this<00:00:20.269> paper

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
paper I think it's because this paper

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.380 
paper I think it's because this paper
feeder<00:00:21.079> is<00:00:21.470> jammed<00:00:22.130> so<00:00:22.730> I'm<00:00:22.970> going<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:23.179> have<00:00:23.269> to

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
feeder is jammed so I'm going to have to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.729 
feeder is jammed so I'm going to have to
take<00:00:23.569> it<00:00:23.689> apart<00:00:24.019> to<00:00:24.259> get<00:00:24.380> added<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:25.400> mechanism

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
take it apart to get added the mechanism

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.809 
take it apart to get added the mechanism
any<00:00:27.739> longer<00:00:28.220> screwdriver<00:00:28.759> than<00:00:29.119> this<00:00:29.269> one<00:00:29.569> no

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:30.819 
any longer screwdriver than this one no

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.660 
any longer screwdriver than this one no
to<00:00:31.819> get<00:00:32.419> that<00:00:32.629> screw<00:00:32.989> out<00:00:33.050> it<00:00:33.829> appears<00:00:34.129> my<00:00:34.399> tool

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
to get that screw out it appears my tool

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.389 
to get that screw out it appears my tool
just<00:00:35.149> isn't<00:00:35.570> long<00:00:36.140> enough<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:36.859> I'm<00:00:37.190> going<00:00:37.370> to

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
just isn't long enough so I'm going to

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:53.110 
just isn't long enough so I'm going to
have<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.609> go<00:00:37.699> get<00:00:37.879> a<00:00:37.940> an<00:00:38.350> enlargement<00:00:47.320> I<00:00:52.120> don't

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
have to go get a an enlargement I don't

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.590 
have to go get a an enlargement I don't
like<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:53.420> intersection<00:00:53.989> though<00:00:54.350> because

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
like this intersection though because

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.630 
like this intersection though because
either<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.929> to<00:00:57.109> I<00:00:57.350> either<00:00:58.070> have<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.309> hit<00:00:58.519> the

either have to I either have to hit the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.169 
either have to I either have to hit the
watch<00:00:58.820> signal<00:00:59.300> or<00:01:00.070> wait<00:01:01.070> for<00:01:01.339> a<00:01:01.370> car<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:01.850> pull

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
watch signal or wait for a car to pull

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.660 
watch signal or wait for a car to pull
up<00:01:02.359> to<00:01:03.170> change<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.739> light<00:01:04.070> because<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.520> won't

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
up to change the light because it won't

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:28.750 
up to change the light because it won't
change<00:01:04.940> for<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:05.330> bicycle

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.130 

this<00:01:29.760> looks<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> right<00:01:30.540> tool<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
this looks like the right tool for the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.700 
this looks like the right tool for the
job

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
job

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.790 
job
and<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.550> only<00:01:32.900> 497<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.620> a<00:01:34.650> bad<00:01:34.890> deal<00:01:35.160> later

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
and it only 497 not a bad deal later

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.580 
and it only 497 not a bad deal later
first<00:01:37.800> we<00:01:37.920> take<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> side<00:01:38.640> covers<00:01:39.060> off

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.140 

once<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> side<00:01:46.950> covers<00:01:47.370> are<00:01:47.550> off<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.970> can

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
once the side covers are off you can

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.200 
once the side covers are off you can
remove<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.630> top<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.700> pops<00:01:50.940> right

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
remove the top and that just pops right

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:11.380 
remove the top and that just pops right
off<00:02:06.470> now

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.890 

rest<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:15.230> almost<00:02:16.230> wants<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.800> come<00:02:16.950> apart

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
rest of it almost wants to come apart

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.270 
rest of it almost wants to come apart
there's<00:02:18.900> something<00:02:19.350> holding<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> after

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
there's something holding it so after

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.280 
there's something holding it so after
disconnecting<00:02:23.730> these<00:02:24.150> ribbons<00:02:24.540> here<00:02:25.050> from

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
disconnecting these ribbons here from

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.070 
disconnecting these ribbons here from
their<00:02:25.530> connections<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.430> front<00:02:27.080> this

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
their connections in the front this

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.199 
their connections in the front this
whole<00:02:28.410> top<00:02:28.770> wants<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> come<00:02:29.459> right<00:02:29.670> off<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
whole top wants to come right off and

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.550 
whole top wants to come right off and
that<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.350> slides<00:02:31.650> out<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.100> front<00:02:33.560> there's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that just slides out the front there's

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.750 
that just slides out the front there's
some<00:02:34.709> clips<00:02:35.010> down<00:02:35.250> there<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.600> see<00:02:40.760> how

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
some clips down there you can see how

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.650 
some clips down there you can see how
that<00:02:41.910> would<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.269> slide<00:02:42.540> right<00:02:42.570> out

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that would just slide right out

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.780 
that would just slide right out
I'll<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> top<00:02:46.110> off<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:48.590> opens<00:02:49.590> up

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
I'll get the top off this opens up

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.150 
I'll get the top off this opens up
underneath<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:51.300> right<00:02:51.870> there<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.860> there

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
underneath here right there and there

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.610 
underneath here right there and there
are<00:02:53.520> four<00:02:54.300> more<00:02:54.450> screws<00:02:54.810> got<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> take<00:02:55.440> out

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
are four more screws got to take out

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.050 
are four more screws got to take out
then<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:56.310> whole<00:02:56.490> top<00:02:56.760> might<00:02:57.030> come<00:02:57.240> off<00:02:59.060> this

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
then this whole top might come off this

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.190 
then this whole top might come off this
whole<00:03:00.300> top<00:03:00.600> lifts<00:03:01.170> right<00:03:01.320> off<00:03:04.190> getting<00:03:05.190> closer

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
whole top lifts right off getting closer

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.650 
whole top lifts right off getting closer
and<00:03:07.200> I'm<00:03:07.320> going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.530> see<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:08.660> damaged

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
and I'm going to see the damaged

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.460 
and I'm going to see the damaged
mechanism<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:11.270> need<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.420> gain<00:03:12.630> access<00:03:13.080> to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
mechanism there need to gain access to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.430 
mechanism there need to gain access to
that<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.160> find<00:03:14.400> out<00:03:14.550> what's<00:03:14.790> keeping<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.750> well

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
that and find out what's keeping it well

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.640 
that and find out what's keeping it well
after<00:03:16.740> some<00:03:16.890> fiddling<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.910> looks<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.330> this

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
after some fiddling it looks like this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.810 
after some fiddling it looks like this
there's<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.740> little<00:03:19.920> mechanism<00:03:20.190> right<00:03:20.700> in

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
there's a little mechanism right in

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.410 
there's a little mechanism right in
there<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.860> guides<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.220> plate<00:03:23.880> up<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.180> down

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
there that guides this plate up and down

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.490 
there that guides this plate up and down
and<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:25.680> what<00:03:25.890> came<00:03:26.100> off<00:03:26.160> right<00:03:26.760> there

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
and that's what came off right there

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.400 
and that's what came off right there
it's<00:03:28.500> hard<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.830> see<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.820> uh<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.270> got<00:03:31.050> this<00:03:31.200> out

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
it's hard to see but uh I got this out

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:40.060 
it's hard to see but uh I got this out
of<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> air<00:03:31.680> by<00:03:31.860> prying<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.790> way<00:03:34.820> and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.410 

getting<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.190> out<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.459> there<00:03:42.110> like<00:03:43.110> so<00:03:44.420> this

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
getting that out of there like so this
