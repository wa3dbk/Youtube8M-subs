00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
any of the mobs it doesn't really matter

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
any of the mobs it doesn't really matter
but<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.009> make<00:01:26.159> sure<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.580> kill<00:01:26.880> any

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but just make sure you do not kill any

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.840 
but just make sure you do not kill any
of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> watchers<00:01:27.840> before<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.530> kill<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.520> gate

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of the watchers before you kill the gate

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
of the watchers before you kill the gate
watcher<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.049> he's<00:01:31.290> dead<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.650> out

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
watcher so now that he's dead that out

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.140 
watcher so now that he's dead that out
of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> way<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> first<00:01:32.820> achievement

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
of the way that is the first achievement

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.600 
of the way that is the first achievement
done<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.930> next<00:01:34.200> achievement<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.040> hadron

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
done the next achievement up is hadron

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.270 
done the next achievement up is hadron
ox<00:01:35.930> denied<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> basically<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.100> kill

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
ox denied and this is basically to kill

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
ox denied and this is basically to kill
the<00:01:38.369> big<00:01:38.520> spider<00:01:38.759> boss<00:01:39.000> before<00:01:39.810> he<00:01:39.990> gets<00:01:40.229> up

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the big spider boss before he gets up

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
the big spider boss before he gets up
here<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> closes<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> doors<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.939> his<00:01:42.090> wet

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
here and closes the doors with his wet

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.260 
here and closes the doors with his wet
so<00:01:43.049> we're<00:01:43.770> gonna<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> kind<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so we're gonna do it the the kind of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.490 
so we're gonna do it the the kind of
simpler<00:01:45.659> way<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.020> was<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> bit<00:01:46.320> more<00:01:46.439> difficult

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
simpler way it was a bit more difficult

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
simpler way it was a bit more difficult
back<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> day<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.180> are<00:01:48.210> at

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420

if you're lower level you should still

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.310

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
need to and we're just gonna run through

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.830 
need to and we're just gonna run through
because<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.430> don't<00:02:02.610> need<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.119> he<00:02:03.240> has<00:02:03.329> 400

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
because we don't need to and he has 400

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.530 
because we don't need to and he has 400
HP<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.380> he<00:02:04.439> does<00:02:04.649> heal<00:02:05.159> himself<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.240> that's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
HP now he does heal himself but that's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.760 
HP now he does heal himself but that's
not<00:02:06.689> something<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.170> need<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.350> worry<00:02:07.619> about

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
not something we need to worry about

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
not something we need to worry about
because<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.429> out<00:02:08.610> damage<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> heal<00:02:09.360> so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
because we can out damage the heal so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.300 
because we can out damage the heal so
there<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.080> go<00:02:10.200> he<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.530> dead<00:02:10.739> he<00:02:10.950> hasn't<00:02:11.160> had<00:02:11.250> a

there we go he is dead he hasn't had a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
there we go he is dead he hasn't had a
chance<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.670> close<00:02:11.849> up<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> gate<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.540> we

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
chance to close up the gate and we

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.700 
chance to close up the gate and we
get<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.660> achievement<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.410> we're<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.560> gonna
