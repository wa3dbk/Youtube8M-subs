00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
proclaiming it a failure before they've

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.990 
proclaiming it a failure before they've
even<00:02:46.680> done<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.310> who<00:02:47.430> knows<00:02:47.460> maybe<00:02:47.820> this

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
even done it so who knows maybe this

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.580 
even done it so who knows maybe this
thing<00:02:48.180> does<00:02:48.390> work<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.780> great<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.230> they're

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
thing does work out great and they're

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.110 
thing does work out great and they're
able<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.830> do<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> very<00:02:50.250> smoothly<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.910> all<00:02:51.000> that

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
able to do it very smoothly and all that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.030 
able to do it very smoothly and all that
kind<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.360> stuff<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.140> think<00:02:52.590> they<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.710> set

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
kind of stuff but I think they have set

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.680 
kind of stuff but I think they have set
themselves<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.490> for<00:02:53.550> failure<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.570> within

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
themselves up for failure I think within

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.030 
themselves up for failure I think within
two<00:02:54.990> or<00:02:55.020> three<00:02:55.110> years<00:02:55.440> we're<00:02:55.650> going<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.830> hear

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
two or three years we're going to hear

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.370 
two or three years we're going to hear
them<00:02:56.220> back<00:02:56.460> down<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.910> say<00:02:57.090> okay<00:02:57.810> yeah<00:02:57.990> there

them back down and say okay yeah there

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.620 
them back down and say okay yeah there

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
know and that's what we had before right

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.890 
know and that's what we had before right
we<00:03:02.610> had<00:03:02.700> certain<00:03:03.030> things<00:03:03.180> where<00:03:03.330> canon<00:03:03.780> but

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
we had certain things where canon but

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.410 
we had certain things where canon but
then<00:03:04.050> there<00:03:04.170> was<00:03:04.200> only<00:03:04.410> one<00:03:04.770> g<00:03:05.520> cannon<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.240> g

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
then there was only one g cannon and g

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.090 
then there was only one g cannon and g
cannon<00:03:06.810> meant<00:03:06.990> George<00:03:07.410> which<00:03:07.770> meant<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
cannon meant George which meant the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.380 
cannon meant George which meant the
movies<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.730> know<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.060> think<00:03:09.270> we're

just feel like they set themselves up

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.210 
just feel like they set themselves up

claiming everything to be factual and
true<00:03:26.820> now<00:03:27.090> when<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.570> are<00:03:27.720> seeing<00:03:27.930> comics<00:03:28.470> and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
true now when you are seeing comics and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.980 
true now when you are seeing comics and
books<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.580> know<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.060> much<00:03:30.090> video<00:03:30.630> games

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
books and you know so much video games

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.810 
books and you know so much video games
yeah<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.800> then<00:03:31.980> these<00:03:32.160> are<00:03:32.220> all<00:03:32.490> different

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
yeah and then these are all different

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.340 
yeah and then these are all different
people<00:03:33.060> working<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:33.930> everyone's

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
people working on it so it's everyone's

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.230 
people working on it so it's everyone's
creative<00:03:34.770> input<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.550> then<00:03:35.700> defines

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
creative input that then defines

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.810 
creative input that then defines
particular<00:03:37.020> characters<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.830> personality

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
particular characters and personality

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.600 
particular characters and personality
traits<00:03:39.120> etc<00:03:39.270> etc<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:40.350> think<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.490> they

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
traits etc etc I think that because they

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.820 
traits etc etc I think that because they
are<00:03:41.760> coming<00:03:42.030> out<00:03:42.150> very<00:03:42.630> very<00:03:42.780> fast<00:03:43.200> things

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
are coming out very very fast things

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.650 
are coming out very very fast things
that<00:03:43.980> happen<00:03:44.250> now<00:03:44.430> you're<00:03:44.670> right<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.150> 34<00:03:45.630> years

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
that happen now you're right in 34 years

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.930 
that happen now you're right in 34 years
down<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.140> track<00:03:46.290> they<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.340> adhere<00:03:47.520> to

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
down the track they have to adhere to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.270 
down the track they have to adhere to
these<00:03:48.120> strict<00:03:48.810> guidelines<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.770> this<00:03:50.190> is

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
these strict guidelines and this is

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.190 
these strict guidelines and this is
already<00:03:50.760> becoming<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:51.180> problem<00:03:51.390> from<00:03:52.080> the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
already becoming a problem from the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.630 
already becoming a problem from the
movies<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.800> prequels<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.520> original

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
movies the prequels and the original

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.880 
movies the prequels and the original
trilogy<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.660> see<00:03:54.930> things<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.650> weren't

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
trilogy you see things that weren't

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.470 
trilogy you see things that weren't
consistent<00:03:56.280> from<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.700> original<00:03:57.000> trilogy<00:03:57.180> to

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
consistent from the original trilogy to

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.660 
consistent from the original trilogy to
the<00:03:57.510> prequels<00:03:57.990> and<00:03:58.110> that's<00:03:58.350> jarring<00:03:59.040> now<00:03:59.250> but

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
the prequels and that's jarring now but

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.550 
the prequels and that's jarring now but
they're<00:03:59.850> both<00:04:00.120> canon<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.140> feel<00:04:01.410> like

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
they're both canon so I feel like

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.080 
they're both canon so I feel like
whatever<00:04:01.800> they<00:04:02.010> put<00:04:02.160> out<00:04:02.310> now<00:04:02.520> almost<00:04:02.880> is

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
whatever they put out now almost is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.630 
whatever they put out now almost is
patchwork<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:04.200> try<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.620> either<00:04:05.010> fix<00:04:05.460> these

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
patchwork to try and either fix these

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.880 
patchwork to try and either fix these
particular<00:04:05.940> problems<00:04:06.570> or<00:04:06.840> arm<00:04:07.560> strict

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
particular problems or arm strict

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.440 
particular problems or arm strict
guidelines<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.490> think<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.000> if<00:04:09.210> they<00:04:09.420> keep

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
guidelines I think that if they keep

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.020 
guidelines I think that if they keep
putting<00:04:09.900> out<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.470> book<00:04:10.950> every<00:04:11.130> three<00:04:11.520> months<00:04:11.880> a

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
putting out a book every three months a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.210 
putting out a book every three months a
comic<00:04:12.540> book<00:04:12.660> every<00:04:12.990> week<00:04:13.260> for<00:04:13.740> different<00:04:14.130> or

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
comic book every week for different or

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.390 
comic book every week for different or
three<00:04:14.430> four<00:04:14.730> different<00:04:15.120> co<00:04:16.010> difference<00:04:17.010> yep

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
three four different co difference yep

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.400 
three four different co difference yep
titles<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:17.910> comics<00:04:18.239> now<00:04:18.420> and<00:04:18.660> then<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.200> video

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
titles of comics now and then the video

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.470 
titles of comics now and then the video
games<00:04:19.680> as<00:04:19.890> well<00:04:20.040> you're<00:04:20.580> right<00:04:20.820> there's<00:04:21.299> just

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
games as well you're right there's just

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.600 
games as well you're right there's just
too<00:04:21.840> many<00:04:21.989> variables<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.890> something<00:04:23.340> won't

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
too many variables and something won't

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.370 
too many variables and something won't
add<00:04:23.790> up<00:04:24.030> eventually<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:25.230> I<00:04:25.260> think<00:04:25.410> unless<00:04:26.010> they

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
add up eventually so I think unless they

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.260 
add up eventually so I think unless they
have<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.530> flexibility<00:04:27.220> within<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.760> cannon<00:04:28.120> or

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
have a flexibility within the cannon or

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.240 
have a flexibility within the cannon or
there's<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.720> bit<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:29.080> like<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.350> gray<00:04:29.680> which

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
there's a bit of a like a gray which

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.090 
there's a bit of a like a gray which
ends<00:04:30.550> up<00:04:30.580> becoming<00:04:30.730> layers<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.830> cannon<00:04:32.830> as<00:04:32.950> you

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
ends up becoming layers of cannon as you

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.830 
ends up becoming layers of cannon as you
say<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.550> my<00:04:33.790> favorite<00:04:33.940> thing<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.390> if<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:34.690> are
