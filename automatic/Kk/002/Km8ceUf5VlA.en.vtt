00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 if you ever have a problem with 1 tv 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.009
 There are a few simple tips 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.899
 in many cases to a fast 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.340
 lead solution 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.010
 First, you should use your mediabox 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.120
 restart once 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.210
 Therefore, switch the first time the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.980
 mediabox on standby so about the on 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.689
 off button of your remote as well as here 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.289
 Now take the mediabox short form 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.269
 electricity 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.099
 I'll wait here for a concise 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.000
 With this you can make sure 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.470
 that really all memory is emptied 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 then plug in the plug again 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.730
 and wait until 1 tv restarts 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.020
 is 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.180
 First, see if on the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.059
 front of the mediabox a lamp 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.739
 lit here is no matter where and in which 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.719
 something lights up it is only possible 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.809
 therefore, to determine if their mediabox 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.640
 Ever electricity has lit up here 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.899
 There is nothing there 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.059
 apparently a problem with the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.989
 power supply 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.719
 Check that out for that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.670
 power cable is properly infected he is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.020
 Some media boxes are also available 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.019
 another toggle switch on the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.210
 back or on the power cable also this 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.040
 must be turned on here 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.840
 get stuck and still no 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 lamp on the front of the mediabox 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.360
 lights are best used 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.540
 our a service team at 0 800 6 64 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.220
 100 if your mediabox basically 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.830
 But electricity did not come from the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.979
 standby can intervene out could 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 the problem with the remote control are 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 once try tv on the button 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.670
 on the front of her mediabox 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.009
 to bring the standby or start it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.640
 once tv just as previously described easy 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.200
 after that, 1 tv is still possible 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.880
 not with your remote control 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.880
 the batteries are probably empty 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.950
 You can get new batteries best over 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.020
 a 1 shop or through all post offices 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.659
 buy more at a discounted price 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.600
 or you go to the electronics store 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.939
 There you need button batteries of the type c 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.530
 r 20 25 buy to the next step if 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.380
 you are still not after a reboot 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.879
 we have the tv picture we check the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.920
 cable connections take you to one 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.930
 Installation instructions to hand you 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.719
 when shopping 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.450
 The freedoms you have check the 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:20.299
 cable between modem and mediabox and 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.980
 place between mediabox and television 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.879
 Make sure all cables are correct 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.870
 connected and firmly connected 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.790
 then they should then 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.489
 check if you are watching TV 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.810
 right channel are if you are a hdmi 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.060
 use cable 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.829
 choose on the remote control of 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.329
 tv-device from the appropriate hdmi channel 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:47.120
 Do you own an older tv model? 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:51.889
 and use a scart cable is called the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.389
 channel mostly v1 or input 1 here 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.530
 again the most important steps in the 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:58.849
 overview restart the mediabox 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.019
 check the remote and 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.150
 then check the 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.329
 Cable connections on the back of the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.980
 You should not use mediabox anyway 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.569
 of course we are happy to come 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.120
