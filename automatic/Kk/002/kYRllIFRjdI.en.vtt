00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
get me wrong I like the idea of it but

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.200 
get me wrong I like the idea of it but
it<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.570> sounds<00:01:06.979> crazy<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.640> them<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it just sounds crazy for them to do it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
it just sounds crazy for them to do it
just<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.960> ran<00:01:10.740> 3<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.130> should<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.369> be

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
just because I ran 3 it should just be

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
just because I ran 3 it should just be
left<00:01:11.760> where<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.420> that's<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
left where it's at that's it

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
left where it's at that's it
you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.350> don't<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> part<00:01:14.340> 4<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you know don't do a part 4 because you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
you know don't do a part 4 because you
have<00:01:15.689> other<00:01:15.930> movies<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:17.070> maybe

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
have other movies that you can do maybe

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.429 
have other movies that you can do maybe
a<00:01:17.400> name<00:01:17.909> or<00:01:18.210> movie<00:01:18.570> will<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.810> pretty<00:01:19.110> good<00:01:19.290> but

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
a name or movie will be pretty good but

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
a name or movie will be pretty good but
they're<00:01:19.830> having<00:01:19.950> issues<00:01:20.220> getting<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> rights

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
they're having issues getting the rights

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
they're having issues getting the rights
back<00:01:21.210> because<00:01:21.570> somehow<00:01:22.110> he's<00:01:22.470> connected<00:01:22.890> with

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
back because somehow he's connected with

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
back because somehow he's connected with
another<00:01:23.189> company<00:01:23.759> at<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> end<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.420> it's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
another company at the end I think it's

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.420 
another company at the end I think it's
Fox<00:01:25.350> or<00:01:25.770> something<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.220> because

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
Fox or something like that just because

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
Fox or something like that just because
the<00:01:26.850> whole<00:01:27.000> mutant<00:01:27.780> thing<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.110> something<00:01:28.259> like

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the whole mutant thing or something like

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.620 
the whole mutant thing or something like
that<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.189> correct<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.820> wrong<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> go

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that if I'm correct if I'm wrong and go

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
that if I'm correct if I'm wrong and go
ahead<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> correct<00:01:31.140> me<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> comment
