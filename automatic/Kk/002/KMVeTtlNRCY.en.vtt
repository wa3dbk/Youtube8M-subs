00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
started collecting all holographic art

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.060 
started collecting all holographic art
anything<00:00:49.820> holographic<00:00:50.449> I<00:00:50.510> could<00:00:50.659> get<00:00:50.839> I<00:00:51.080> tried

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
anything holographic I could get I tried

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.950 
anything holographic I could get I tried
to<00:00:52.100> get<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:52.729> I<00:00:52.820> try<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:53.030> get<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:53.390> sets<00:00:53.629> of<00:00:53.720> three

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
to get and I try to get in sets of three

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.630 
to get and I try to get in sets of three
because<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:54.229> could<00:00:54.350> play<00:00:54.500> three<00:00:54.830> of<00:00:54.949> them<00:00:55.100> in

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
because you could play three of them in

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.399 
because you could play three of them in
your<00:00:55.790> deck<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.420> that's<00:00:56.629> what<00:00:56.780> made<00:00:56.960> logical

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
your deck so that's what made logical

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.500 
your deck so that's what made logical
sense<00:00:57.589> to<00:00:57.799> me<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.159> so<00:00:58.790> that's<00:00:58.909> what<00:00:59.119> I<00:00:59.150> started

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
sense to me and so that's what I started

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.899 
sense to me and so that's what I started
doing<00:00:59.629> and<00:00:59.960> when<00:01:00.589> i<00:01:00.619> was<00:01:00.799> doing<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.280> other

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
doing and when i was doing this other

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:03.369 
doing and when i was doing this other
players<00:01:02.360> kind<00:01:02.659> of<00:01:02.720> looked<00:01:02.839> at<00:01:02.930> me<00:01:02.960> like<00:01:03.170> i<00:01:03.350> was

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
players kind of looked at me like i was

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.960 
players kind of looked at me like i was
crazy<00:01:03.530> because<00:01:04.159> i<00:01:04.339> would<00:01:04.460> ask<00:01:04.580> them<00:01:04.760> for<00:01:04.879> the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
crazy because i would ask them for the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.750 
crazy because i would ask them for the
most<00:01:05.119> randomest<00:01:05.630> weirdest<00:01:06.110> cards<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:06.799> I

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
most randomest weirdest cards and I

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.250 
most randomest weirdest cards and I
guess<00:01:07.939> it<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:08.270> kind<00:01:08.510> of<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.630> little<00:01:08.840> crazy<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.170> a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
guess it is kind of a little crazy in a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.560 
guess it is kind of a little crazy in a
sense<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.710> be<00:01:09.860> getting<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:10.880> many<00:01:11.000> cars<00:01:11.270> that

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
sense to be getting so many cars that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.069 
sense to be getting so many cars that
probably<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:12.260> will<00:01:12.380> never<00:01:12.740> use<00:01:13.030> but<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.719> some

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
probably I will never use but in some

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.870 
probably I will never use but in some
sense<00:01:15.109> this<00:01:15.530> kind<00:01:15.770> of<00:01:15.890> works<00:01:16.250> out<00:01:16.429> for<00:01:16.670> me<00:01:16.700> as

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
sense this kind of works out for me as

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.020 
sense this kind of works out for me as
well<00:01:17.170> so<00:01:18.170> there<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.679> times<00:01:18.950> when<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.369> would<00:01:19.850> pick

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
well so there is times when I would pick

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.929 
well so there is times when I would pick
up<00:01:20.090> cards<00:01:20.570> like<00:01:21.380> some<00:01:22.039> judgments<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.820> good

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
up cards like some judgments a good

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.609 
up cards like some judgments a good
example<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.479> picked<00:01:23.689> up<00:01:23.810> three<00:01:24.109> of<00:01:24.200> them<00:01:24.380> people

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
example I picked up three of them people

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.590 
example I picked up three of them people
