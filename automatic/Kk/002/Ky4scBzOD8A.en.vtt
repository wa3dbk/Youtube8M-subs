now this here a newfangled motorcycle
you<00:02:07.060> have<00:02:07.299> two<00:02:07.659> sides<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:09.100> side<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.789> for<00:02:10.149> turn

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
you have two sides this side is for turn

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.809 
you have two sides this side is for turn
and<00:02:10.690> right<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:11.770> if<00:02:12.400> your<00:02:12.640> right<00:02:12.940> side<00:02:13.209> big<00:02:13.569> slow

this<00:02:15.819> side<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.840> want<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.110> replace<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.709> if<00:02:18.430> it's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
this side you want to replace it if it's

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.270 
this side you want to replace it if it's
fast<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.660> means<00:02:20.050> your<00:02:20.230> low<00:02:20.470> means<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
fast that means your low means the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.729 
fast that means your low means the
electrons<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.150> move<00:02:22.420> too<00:02:22.690> fast<00:02:22.989> you

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
electrons in there move too fast you

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.610 
electrons in there move too fast you
need<00:02:23.890> more<00:02:24.010> blinking<00:02:24.489> fluid<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.910> slow<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.390> down

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
need more blinking fluid to slow it down

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.690 
need more blinking fluid to slow it down
so<00:02:26.620> if<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.310> right<00:02:27.550> side<00:02:27.940> on<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:29.170> one<00:02:29.700> if

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
so if it's the right side on this one if

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.830 
so if it's the right side on this one if
it's<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.090> left<00:02:31.360> side<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.569> this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
it's the left side you do it on this

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.949 
it's the left side you do it on this
side<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:35.680> see<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.519> side<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:37.000> smaller<00:02:37.390> that's

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
side now see this side is smaller that's

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.840 
side now see this side is smaller that's
because<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.380> don't<00:02:38.500> turn<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> left<00:02:39.220> as<00:02:39.489> often

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
because you don't turn the left as often

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.850 
because you don't turn the left as often
as<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.090> turn<00:02:40.360> right<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.440> that's<00:02:41.560> why<00:02:41.800> that

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
as you turn right so that's why that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.300 
as you turn right so that's why that
one's<00:02:42.220> smaller

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.809 

now<00:02:50.140> how<00:02:51.140> do<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.440> know<00:02:51.560> how<00:02:52.190> do<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.580> know<00:02:52.700> if

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
now how do you know how do you know if

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.260 
now how do you know how do you know if
your<00:02:52.940> blink<00:02:53.180> fluid<00:02:53.569> is<00:02:53.690> low<00:02:54.520> turn<00:02:55.520> on<00:02:55.760> your

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
your blink fluid is low turn on your

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.820 
your blink fluid is low turn on your
vehicle<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.200> turn<00:02:57.860> on<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.940> turn<00:03:02.209> signal<00:03:02.830> do

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
vehicle and turn on the turn signal do

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.030 
vehicle and turn on the turn signal do
you<00:03:03.920> see<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.330> much<00:03:05.720> much<00:03:06.140> too<00:03:06.380> fast

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
you see that that is much much too fast

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.100 
you see that that is much much too fast
I<00:03:07.160> need<00:03:07.850> probably<00:03:08.510> at<00:03:08.720> least<00:03:10.569> half<00:03:11.569> a<00:03:11.780> bottle

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
I need probably at least half a bottle

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.220 
I need probably at least half a bottle
of<00:03:12.530> liquor<00:03:13.100> fluid<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:14.000> slow<00:03:14.330> that<00:03:14.600> down<00:03:14.900> that's

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
of liquor fluid to slow that down that's

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.260 
of liquor fluid to slow that down that's
way<00:03:15.380> too<00:03:15.410> fast<00:03:15.800> confuse<00:03:16.280> people<00:03:16.459> they'd<00:03:17.120> be

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
way too fast confuse people they'd be

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.150 
way too fast confuse people they'd be
like<00:03:17.450> Oh<00:03:17.660> am<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.140> getting<00:03:18.350> pulled<00:03:18.590> over<00:03:18.739> or<00:03:18.920> was
