going to give you some examples of how

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.910 
going to give you some examples of how
it<00:00:24.090> works<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.720> also<00:00:25.080> run<00:00:25.410> down<00:00:25.590> through<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
it works and also run down through the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.349 
it works and also run down through the
stats<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> different<00:00:26.820> healing<00:00:27.029> waves

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
stats are the different healing waves

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.929 
stats are the different healing waves
that<00:00:27.539> are<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:27.840> there<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
that are out there that you can get and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.330 
that are out there that you can get and
hopefully<00:00:29.939> we'll<00:00:30.300> learn<00:00:30.330> something<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.219> do

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
hopefully we'll learn something so we do

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.740 
hopefully we'll learn something so we do
a<00:00:35.370> quick<00:00:35.610> run-through<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.969> all<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> different

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
a quick run-through of all the different

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420 
a quick run-through of all the different
healing<00:00:37.020> waves<00:00:37.350> currently<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.980> Infinite

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
healing waves currently in Infinite

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.740 
healing waves currently in Infinite
Crisis<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.300> off<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
Crisis now first off we have the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780 
Crisis now first off we have the
standard<00:00:40.140> healing<00:00:40.559> wave<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.520> heals

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
standard healing wave so this heals

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.729 
standard healing wave so this heals
yourself<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.360> nearby<00:00:42.570> allies<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.170> 50<00:00:43.530> health

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
yourself and nearby allies for 50 health

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.250 
yourself and nearby allies for 50 health
further<00:00:44.730> healing<00:00:45.000> waves<00:00:45.239> within<00:00:45.480> 30<00:00:45.780> seconds

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
further healing waves within 30 seconds

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.930 
further healing waves within 30 seconds
will<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.620> their<00:00:46.829> effectiveness<00:00:47.280> reduced<00:00:47.760> by

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
will have their effectiveness reduced by

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
will have their effectiveness reduced by
fifty<00:00:48.420> percent<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.899> means<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.860> know<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
fifty percent that means you know if you

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
fifty percent that means you know if you
had<00:00:50.460> two<00:00:50.730> people<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.239> healing<00:00:51.539> waves<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
had two people with healing waves the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.529 
had two people with healing waves the
first<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.980> will<00:00:53.129> give<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> full<00:00:53.910> health<00:00:54.270> back

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
first one will give you full health back

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.510 
first one will give you full health back
so<00:00:54.780> give<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> 50<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.920> use<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.070> second

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
so give you 50 but if you use a second

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040 
so give you 50 but if you use a second
one<00:00:56.610> within<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> 30<00:00:57.180> seconds<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.660> only<00:00:57.840> get

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
one within the 30 seconds you only get

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.770 
one within the 30 seconds you only get
get<00:00:58.350> 25<00:00:59.039> hate<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.670> back<00:00:59.879> also<00:01:00.510> today<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
get 25 hate to be back also today is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
get 25 hate to be back also today is
that<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> healing<00:01:01.620> wave<00:01:01.829> actually<00:01:02.070> scales<00:01:02.550> up

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that the healing wave actually scales up

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
that the healing wave actually scales up
so<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> longer<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> game<00:01:03.690> goes<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> more

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
so the longer the game goes on the more

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
so the longer the game goes on the more
levels<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.610> actually<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> bigger

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
levels you get you actually do a bigger

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.920 
levels you get you actually do a bigger
hill<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.369> 50<00:01:08.760> half<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.659> level

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
hill so from what was 50 half at level

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
hill so from what was 50 half at level
one<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.380> actually<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.740> 275<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.850> maximum<00:01:12.479> level

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
one you actually do 275 a maximum level

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
one you actually do 275 a maximum level
so<00:01:13.350> poison<00:01:13.770> ivy's<00:01:14.130> healing<00:01:14.400> wave<00:01:14.520> does

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
so poison ivy's healing wave does

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
so poison ivy's healing wave does
exactly<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.360> same<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> standard<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.409> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
exactly the same as the standard one in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.960 
exactly the same as the standard one in
terms<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> healing<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.670> has<00:01:17.820> an

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
terms of the healing but has an

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.820 
terms of the healing but has an
additional<00:01:18.270> bonus<00:01:18.630> which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.200> attack<00:01:19.680> damage

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
additional bonus which is attack damage

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
additional bonus which is attack damage
and<00:01:20.159> power<00:01:20.430> damage<00:01:20.759> buff<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.720> you'll<00:01:21.900> gain

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and power damage buff so you'll gain

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
and power damage buff so you'll gain
tell<00:01:22.439> attack<00:01:22.710> damage<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.130> 10<00:01:23.430> power<00:01:23.729> damage

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
tell attack damage and 10 power damage

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.480 
tell attack damage and 10 power damage
at<00:01:24.720> level<00:01:25.140> 1<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.619> scales<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.220> throughout

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
at level 1 and that scales up throughout

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
at level 1 and that scales up throughout
the<00:01:26.640> game<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.119> think<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.840> sort<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.170> tips<00:01:28.439> off<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the game I think it sort of tips off a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.840 
the game I think it sort of tips off a
little<00:01:28.829> bit<00:01:29.040> towards<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.400> late<00:01:29.579> game<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
little bit towards the late game it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
little bit towards the late game it
doesn't<00:01:30.000> give<00:01:30.329> too<00:01:30.540> much<00:01:30.720> paranoid<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.320> at

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
doesn't give too much paranoid but at

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.620 
doesn't give too much paranoid but at
level<00:01:31.799> 1<00:01:31.979> 10<00:01:32.280> attack<00:01:32.579> damage<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.000> 10<00:01:33.360> pound

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
level 1 10 attack damage and 10 pound

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.749 
level 1 10 attack damage and 10 pound
out<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> lot<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.799> lasts<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.579> five

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
out is a lot and it lasts for five

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.120 
out is a lot and it lasts for five
seconds<00:01:36.299> once<00:01:36.479> you've<00:01:36.689> seen<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.500> green<00:01:37.740> cloud

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
seconds once you've seen the green cloud

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.830 
seconds once you've seen the green cloud
of<00:01:38.159> smoke<00:01:38.460> pop<00:01:38.909> out<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.420> from<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> heel

of smoke pop out from you from the heel

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.319 
of smoke pop out from you from the heel
and<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.710> turn<00:01:40.920> battles<00:01:41.579> very<00:01:42.090> much

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and it can really turn battles very much

for eight power armor an eight attack
armor<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.119> start<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> game<00:01:54.810> which<00:01:54.990> is

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
armor at the start of the game which is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.200 
armor at the start of the game which is
good<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.560> scales<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:56.040> pretty<00:01:56.520> slowly<00:01:56.850> yet

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
good and it scales up pretty slowly yet

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.420 
good and it scales up pretty slowly yet
again<00:01:57.509> there's<00:01:58.380> still<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:58.799> very<00:01:58.890> useful<00:01:59.219> for

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
again there's still very very useful for

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.130 
again there's still very very useful for
turning<00:01:59.880> around<00:01:59.939> those<00:02:00.149> early<00:02:00.509> game<00:02:00.750> fights

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
turning around those early game fights

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.050 
turning around those early game fights
and<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.890> get<00:02:02.040> into<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.219> big<00:02:02.490> team<00:02:02.759> fight

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and if you get into a big team fight

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
and if you get into a big team fight
there's<00:02:03.659> nothing<00:02:04.079> better<00:02:04.229> than<00:02:04.350> giving<00:02:04.710> your

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
there's nothing better than giving your

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.440 
there's nothing better than giving your
whole<00:02:05.100> team<00:02:05.310> some<00:02:05.549> power<00:02:05.790> armor<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> give<00:02:06.329> them

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
whole team some power armor to give them

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.430 
whole team some power armor to give them
a<00:02:06.630> little<00:02:06.869> bit<00:02:07.200> more<00:02:07.409> life-giving<00:02:08.160> energy

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.120

so I'm going to show you some

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.710 
so I'm going to show you some
demonstrations<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.850> using<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.270> healing<00:02:14.570> wave

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
demonstrations of using the healing wave

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.780 
demonstrations of using the healing wave
in<00:02:14.960> action<00:02:15.470> now<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:15.920> often<00:02:16.430> see<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.760> a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
in action now you often see it on a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.120 
in action now you often see it on a
controller<00:02:17.270> support<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.650> bottom<00:02:18.920> lane

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
controller support in the bottom lane

using that healing wave to keep the
marksmen<00:02:21.740> live<00:02:22.040> such<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> cyborg<00:02:22.820> in<00:02:23.030> right<00:02:23.420> now

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
marksmen live such a cyborg in right now

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.230 
marksmen live such a cyborg in right now
his<00:02:23.930> health<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.350> quite<00:02:24.620> low<00:02:24.800> now<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.700> could<00:02:26.000> heal

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
his health is quite low now I could heal

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.270 
his health is quite low now I could heal
him<00:02:26.420> now<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.020> make<00:02:27.470> him<00:02:27.620> look<00:02:27.740> healthier<00:02:28.220> and

him now and make him look healthier and
look<00:02:28.550> less<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.090> target<00:02:29.270> because<00:02:29.540> when<00:02:29.840> once

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
look less of a target because when once

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.160 
look less of a target because when once
you<00:02:30.200> get<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.530> certain<00:02:30.760> low<00:02:31.760> HP<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.840> end<00:02:32.990> up

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
you get to a certain low HP you end up

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.020 
you get to a certain low HP you end up
looking<00:02:33.500> like<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.580> just<00:02:34.610> look<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:34.910> a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
looking like this you just look like a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.550 
looking like this you just look like a
tasty<00:02:35.270> treat<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:35.990> you've<00:02:36.110> always<00:02:36.350> got<00:02:36.470> to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
tasty treat it so you've always got to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.650 
tasty treat it so you've always got to
be<00:02:36.590> prepared<00:02:36.800> for<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.670> worst<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:38.150> happen<00:02:38.270> and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
be prepared for the worst to happen and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.870 
be prepared for the worst to happen and
as<00:02:38.870> i<00:02:39.200> expected<00:02:39.740> i<00:02:39.890> knew<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.130> sideboard<00:02:40.700> was

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
as i expected i knew that sideboard was

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.190 
as i expected i knew that sideboard was
going<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.090> move<00:02:41.270> in<00:02:41.390> here<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.660> do<00:02:41.750> some<00:02:41.990> damage

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
going to move in here and do some damage

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.020 
going to move in here and do some damage
so<00:02:42.560> i<00:02:42.590> was<00:02:42.710> well<00:02:43.010> ready<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.400> pop<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.940> my

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
so i was well ready for a pop to my

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.700 
so i was well ready for a pop to my
healing<00:02:44.270> wave<00:02:44.450> early<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.050> then<00:02:45.380> we're<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.650> the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
healing wave early and then we're on the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.260 
healing wave early and then we're on the
account<00:02:46.070> or<00:02:46.280> attack<00:02:46.490> because<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:46.850> can<00:02:47.000> do<00:02:47.120> some

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
account or attack because we can do some

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.240 
account or attack because we can do some
extra<00:02:47.540> damage<00:02:47.810> here<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.380> luckily<00:02:48.890> i<00:02:49.040> was

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
extra damage here and luckily i was

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.100 
extra damage here and luckily i was
looking<00:02:49.490> at<00:02:49.580> my<00:02:49.700> minimap<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.450> sort<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.720> shazam

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
looking at my minimap and sort of shazam

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.290 
looking at my minimap and sort of shazam
coming<00:02:51.680> down<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.640> picked<00:02:52.880> up<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.060> kill<00:02:53.270> on

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
coming down so we picked up a kill on

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.750 
coming down so we picked up a kill on
top<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.740> can<00:02:54.890> really<00:02:55.130> bait<00:02:55.550> out

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
top of that so you can really bait out

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.360 
top of that so you can really bait out
some<00:02:56.060> situations<00:02:56.840> with<00:02:57.260> with<00:02:57.830> your<00:02:57.950> teammates

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
some situations with with your teammates

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.340 
some situations with with your teammates
health<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:59.480> know<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.630> could<00:02:59.930> heal<00:03:00.140> him<00:03:00.260> up

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
health you know you could heal him up

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.840 
health you know you could heal him up
earlier<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:01.040> make<00:03:01.190> him<00:03:01.310> look<00:03:01.430> less<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.760> a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
earlier to make him look less of a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.280 
earlier to make him look less of a
target<00:03:02.000> but<00:03:02.360> sometimes<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.900> can<00:03:03.080> manipulate

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
target but sometimes you can manipulate

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.160 
target but sometimes you can manipulate
the<00:03:03.950> lane<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.760> your<00:03:04.910> favor<00:03:05.210> by<00:03:05.540> baiting<00:03:06.080> them

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
the lane to your favor by baiting them

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.480 
the lane to your favor by baiting them
in<00:03:06.410> closer<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.950> then<00:03:07.040> healing<00:03:07.370> your

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
in closer and then healing your

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.860 
in closer and then healing your
teammates<00:03:07.850> up<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:11.180> recently<00:03:11.540> I've<00:03:11.720> actually

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
teammates up so recently I've actually

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.630 
teammates up so recently I've actually
been<00:03:12.080> seeing<00:03:12.410> quite<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.680> lot<00:03:12.740> of<00:03:12.860> marksmen<00:03:13.460> pick

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
been seeing quite a lot of marksmen pick

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.910 
been seeing quite a lot of marksmen pick
up<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.060> healing<00:03:14.300> wave<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.020> arcane<00:03:15.650> Green

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
up the healing wave and arcane Green

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.800 
up the healing wave and arcane Green
Lantern's<00:03:16.430> especially<00:03:16.880> for<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:17.510> extra

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
Lantern's especially for that extra

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.050 
Lantern's especially for that extra
armor<00:03:18.290> boost<00:03:18.530> just<00:03:19.160> for<00:03:19.340> more<00:03:19.489> survivability

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
armor boost just for more survivability

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.060 
armor boost just for more survivability
so<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:20.390> mix<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.140> with<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.560> ability

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
so you mix that in with the ability

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.860 
so you mix that in with the ability
shield<00:03:22.489> as<00:03:22.640> well<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:22.850> can<00:03:22.970> be<00:03:23.060> very<00:03:23.360> difficult

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
shield as well you can be very difficult

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.020 
shield as well you can be very difficult
to<00:03:24.140> kill<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.530> also<00:03:24.770> it<00:03:25.250> puts<00:03:25.489> things<00:03:25.670> on<00:03:25.910> your

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
to kill and also it puts things on your

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.910 
to kill and also it puts things on your
terms<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:26.690> instead<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.320> relying<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.830> the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
terms so instead of relying on the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.650 
terms so instead of relying on the
support<00:03:28.280> or<00:03:28.489> controller<00:03:28.910> champion<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.480> heal

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
support or controller champion to heal

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.810 
support or controller champion to heal
you<00:03:29.780> up<00:03:29.900> at<00:03:30.080> those<00:03:30.230> desperate<00:03:30.800> times<00:03:31.100> you

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
you up at those desperate times you

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.699 
you up at those desperate times you
actually<00:03:32.180> can<00:03:32.330> dictate<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.989> battle<00:03:33.320> more<00:03:33.590> in

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
actually can dictate the battle more in

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.840 
actually can dictate the battle more in
your<00:03:33.830> favor<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.250> read<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.670> situation

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
your favor and read the situation

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.610 
your favor and read the situation
because<00:03:35.270> usually<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.690> marksman<00:03:36.050> you're<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
because usually as a marksman you're the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.130 
because usually as a marksman you're the
primary<00:03:36.950> target<00:03:37.520> to<00:03:37.640> go<00:03:37.790> down<00:03:38.060> first<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:39.080> it

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
primary target to go down first so it

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.420 
primary target to go down first so it
kind<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.410> makes<00:03:39.560> sense<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.250> actually

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
kind of makes sense that you actually

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.190 
kind of makes sense that you actually
have<00:03:40.850> this<00:03:41.090> healing<00:03:41.480> wave<00:03:41.630> on<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:41.989> it<00:03:42.140> will

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
have this healing wave on you it will

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.320 
have this healing wave on you it will
give<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:42.470> more<00:03:42.500> survivability<00:03:43.330> especially

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
give you more survivability especially

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.820 
give you more survivability especially
in<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.540> one-to-one<00:03:44.959> fight<00:03:45.290> when<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.470> pair<00:03:45.800> it

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
in a one-to-one fight when you pair it

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.729 
in a one-to-one fight when you pair it
up<00:03:46.010> with<00:03:46.070> Doomsday's<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.150> bandra<00:03:47.420> Billy<00:03:47.739> it's

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
up with Doomsday's in bandra Billy it's

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.160 
up with Doomsday's in bandra Billy it's
an<00:03:48.950> incredibly<00:03:49.670> lethal<00:03:49.940> combo<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.810> like<00:03:51.050> to

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
an incredibly lethal combo and I like to

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.050 
an incredibly lethal combo and I like to
mix<00:03:51.290> up<00:03:51.470> with<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.709> arcane<00:03:52.160> Green<00:03:52.640> Lantern

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
mix up with the arcane Green Lantern

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.960 
mix up with the arcane Green Lantern
here<00:03:53.690> let's<00:03:53.870> give<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:54.560> extra<00:03:54.709> armor<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.850> you

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
here let's give that extra armor to you

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.400 
here let's give that extra armor to you
a<00:03:56.000> little<00:03:56.300> bit<00:03:56.420> more<00:03:56.600> tanky<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:57.230> really

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
a little bit more tanky and it's really

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.560 
a little bit more tanky and it's really
great<00:03:57.650> early<00:03:58.010> on<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.310> also<00:03:59.239> when<00:03:59.480> you

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
great early on and also when you

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.060 
great early on and also when you
initiate<00:03:59.840> into<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.170> fight<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.560> can<00:04:00.680> pop<00:04:00.890> it

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
initiate into a fight you can pop it

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.680 
initiate into a fight you can pop it
early<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:01.820> you're<00:04:02.030> not<00:04:02.150> going<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.390> get<00:04:02.540> any

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
early so you're not going to get any

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.590 
early so you're not going to get any
extra<00:04:02.930> damage<00:04:03.200> coming<00:04:03.620> in<00:04:03.800> on<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.600> you're

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
extra damage coming in on you and you're

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.880 
extra damage coming in on you and you're
just<00:04:05.660> going<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.900> be<00:04:05.959> more<00:04:06.290> better<00:04:06.620> off<00:04:06.739> at

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
just going to be more better off at

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.650 
just going to be more better off at
ective<00:04:07.190> but<00:04:07.370> if<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:07.640> give<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.300> support

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
ective but if you give it to a support

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.300 
ective but if you give it to a support
champion<00:04:09.110> essentially<00:04:09.650> you're<00:04:09.739> taking<00:04:10.190> away

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
champion essentially you're taking away

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.979 
champion essentially you're taking away
one<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.820> stolen<00:04:11.090> powers<00:04:11.570> you<00:04:11.750> know<00:04:11.780> they

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
one of the stolen powers you know they

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.410 
one of the stolen powers you know they
could<00:04:12.200> pick<00:04:12.769> up<00:04:12.890> cameras<00:04:13.459> instead<00:04:14.120> or<00:04:14.360> a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
could pick up cameras instead or a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.300 
could pick up cameras instead or a
teleport<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:15.350> they<00:04:15.470> can<00:04:15.620> actually<00:04:15.739> help<00:04:16.130> out

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
teleport so they can actually help out

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.279 
teleport so they can actually help out
the<00:04:16.459> other<00:04:16.580> lanes<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.180> travel<00:04:17.600> as<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.780> support

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
the other lanes and travel as a support

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.200 
the other lanes and travel as a support
and<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:19.100> know<00:04:19.220> when<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.669> have<00:04:19.789> that<00:04:19.880> healing

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.210 
and you know when you have that healing

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.909 
and you know when you have that healing
wave<00:04:20.359> on<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.570> marksman<00:04:21.080> you<00:04:21.289> actually<00:04:21.739> can

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
wave on the marksman you actually can

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:22.970 
wave on the marksman you actually can
solo<00:04:22.430> Lane

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
solo Lane

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.710 
solo Lane
lot<00:04:23.100> better<00:04:23.400> as<00:04:23.640> well<00:04:23.820> mixed<00:04:24.300> up<00:04:24.420> with<00:04:24.570> being

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
lot better as well mixed up with being

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.270 
lot better as well mixed up with being
vulnerability<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.830> that's<00:04:25.980> what<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.160> want

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
vulnerability and that's what you want

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.440 
vulnerability and that's what you want
to<00:04:26.310> be<00:04:26.430> doing<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.730> want<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:26.910> be<00:04:27.000> gaining<00:04:27.240> as

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
to be doing you want to be gaining as

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.330 
to be doing you want to be gaining as
much<00:04:27.480> farm<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:28.470> staying<00:04:28.740> in<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.950> lane<00:04:29.160> as

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
much farm and staying in the lane as

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.770 
much farm and staying in the lane as
long<00:04:29.520> as<00:04:29.670> possible<00:04:29.730> just<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.300> get<00:04:30.480> your<00:04:30.600> credit

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
long as possible just to get your credit

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.870 
long as possible just to get your credit
so<00:04:31.050> I've<00:04:31.110> been<00:04:31.230> rolling<00:04:31.680> your<00:04:32.160> controller<00:04:32.610> or

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
so I've been rolling your controller or

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.520 
so I've been rolling your controller or
support<00:04:33.300> champion<00:04:33.720> as<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:34.020> might<00:04:34.200> miss

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
support champion as you might miss

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.500 
support champion as you might miss
reader<00:04:34.920> situation<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:35.850> pop<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.150> hill<00:04:36.300> too

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
reader situation and pop the hill too

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.750 
reader situation and pop the hill too
early<00:04:36.840> or<00:04:36.870> too<00:04:36.990> late<00:04:37.190> costing<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.310> your<00:04:38.340> life

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
early or too late costing you your life

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.330 
early or too late costing you your life
so<00:04:39.210> it's<00:04:39.840> actually<00:04:39.990> makes<00:04:40.440> sense<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:41.040> put<00:04:41.190> it

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
so it's actually makes sense to put it

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.330 
so it's actually makes sense to put it
on<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.000> marksman<00:04:45.740> now<00:04:46.740> I've<00:04:46.860> also<00:04:47.040> been

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
on to the marksman now I've also been

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.070 
on to the marksman now I've also been
trying<00:04:47.670> it<00:04:47.820> on<00:04:47.910> junglers<00:04:48.510> like<00:04:48.720> nightmare

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
trying it on junglers like nightmare

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.410 
trying it on junglers like nightmare
Batman<00:04:49.290> because<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:50.130> inves<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:51.000> then<00:04:51.210> get

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
Batman because you inves in and then get

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.170 
Batman because you inves in and then get
a<00:04:51.450> reinitiation<00:04:52.410> in<00:04:52.830> healing<00:04:53.550> of<00:04:53.670> teammates

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180
