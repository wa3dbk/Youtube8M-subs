00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
gonna have to set a waypoint

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.860

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
because you're enough to jump off the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.660 
because you're enough to jump off the
edge<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.439> make<00:02:15.799> it<00:02:15.920> right<00:02:16.040> over<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.519> this

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
edge and make it right over to this

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.740 
edge and make it right over to this
little<00:02:16.819> spot<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.329> you're<00:02:17.450> seeing<00:02:17.659> right

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
little spot that you're seeing right

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.229 
little spot that you're seeing right
here<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:18.230> now<00:02:18.439> so<00:02:18.680> set<00:02:19.670> your<00:02:19.730> waypoint<00:02:20.120> to

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
here right now so set your waypoint to

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.020 
here right now so set your waypoint to
that<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.769> now<00:02:21.769> we're<00:02:21.950> gonna<00:02:22.040> jump<00:02:22.430> off<00:02:22.670> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
that and now we're gonna jump off and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.660 
that and now we're gonna jump off and
use<00:02:23.599> our<00:02:23.810> parachute<00:02:24.620> that's<00:02:25.250> why<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:25.519> need<00:02:25.640> to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
use our parachute that's why we need to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.100 
use our parachute that's why we need to
the<00:02:25.819> parachutes<00:02:26.269> that<00:02:26.329> we<00:02:26.510> didn't<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:26.870> fall

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the parachutes that we didn't just fall

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.420 
the parachutes that we didn't just fall
completely<00:02:27.409> straight<00:02:27.920> under<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:28.250> map

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
completely straight under the map

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.000 
completely straight under the map
because<00:02:29.180> we<00:02:29.450> gotta<00:02:29.599> Trek<00:02:29.930> over<00:02:30.319> towards<00:02:30.860> where

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
because we gotta Trek over towards where

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.399 
because we gotta Trek over towards where
that<00:02:31.099> waypoint<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.790> with<00:02:32.750> our<00:02:32.870> parachutes<00:02:33.290> so

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
that waypoint is with our parachutes so

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.170 
that waypoint is with our parachutes so
just<00:02:33.590> kind<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.769> glide<00:02:34.040> over<00:02:34.280> there<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.670> once

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
just kind of glide over there and once

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.089 
just kind of glide over there and once
you<00:02:35.269> get<00:02:35.390> over<00:02:35.569> there<00:02:35.690> kind<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.019> just<00:02:36.079> go<00:02:36.950> in

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
you get over there kind of just go in

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.830 
you get over there kind of just go in
circles<00:02:37.400> until<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.940> eventually<00:02:38.239> land<00:02:38.720> on

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
circles until you eventually land on

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.750 
circles until you eventually land on
something<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.650> that's<00:02:39.769> something<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.459> going

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
something and that's something is going

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.640 
something and that's something is going
to<00:02:40.940> be<00:02:41.120> your<00:02:41.390> garage<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.439> keep<00:02:42.560> on

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
to be your garage so just keep on

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.110 
to be your garage so just keep on
