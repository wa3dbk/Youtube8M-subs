but
40-ounce<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:48.630> another<00:01:48.869> good<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.200> especially

what's the name proof it's weird because

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.670 
what's the name proof it's weird because
the<00:01:54.090> beef<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> club<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> gotta<00:01:55.259> murder<00:01:55.500> me

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
there that's a weird one about that

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.789 
there that's a weird one about that
because<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.130> actually<00:01:59.399> happened
