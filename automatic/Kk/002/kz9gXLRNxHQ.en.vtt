00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
unrequited love thing going on in the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.060 
unrequited love thing going on in the
movies<00:01:22.360> it's<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.930> little<00:01:23.170> different<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.950> I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
movies it's a little different and I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.500 
movies it's a little different and I
think<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.400> all<00:01:24.520> started<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:24.909> go<00:01:25.090> wrong<00:01:25.120> in

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510

thing and that's what they did it's in

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.580 
thing and that's what they did it's in
the<00:01:48.040> movies<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.760> in<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.180> marketing<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.380> much

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the movies it's in the marketing so much

the movies it's in the marketing so much
so<00:01:50.799> that<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:51.010> think<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.340> only<00:01:51.549> reason<00:01:51.850> they've

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
so that I think the only reason they've

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.060 
so that I think the only reason they've
included<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.750> Ron<00:01:52.930> Hermione<00:01:53.260> relationship

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
included the Ron Hermione relationship

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.670 
included the Ron Hermione relationship
at<00:01:54.250> all<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.909> because<00:01:54.939> JK<00:01:55.750> Rowling's<00:01:56.200> said<00:01:56.500> they

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
at all is because JK Rowling's said they

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.950 
at all is because JK Rowling's said they
had<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.189> if<00:01:57.790> she<00:01:58.000> hadn't<00:01:58.299> been<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.420> factor<00:01:58.689> I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
had to if she hadn't been a factor I

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.270 
had to if she hadn't been a factor I
honestly<00:01:59.320> think<00:01:59.740> they<00:01:59.860> would<00:02:00.010> have<00:02:00.100> killed

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
honestly think they would have killed

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.219 
honestly think they would have killed
