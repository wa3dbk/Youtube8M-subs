electrician or a mechanic for that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.050 
electrician or a mechanic for that
matter<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.530> um<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.610> happening<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.030> that

matter but um what was happening is that

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780 
matter but um what was happening is that
the<00:01:09.990> old<00:01:10.260> inator<00:01:10.560> regulator<00:01:11.100> senses<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the old inator regulator senses that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.719 
the old inator regulator senses that
there's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> battery<00:01:12.510> somewhere<00:01:13.610> namely<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
there's a battery somewhere namely the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
there's a battery somewhere namely the
ones<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> trailer<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.840> opens<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
ones of the trailer so it opens up the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
ones of the trailer so it opens up the
gate<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> gives<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.400> full<00:01:17.640> charge<00:01:17.909> right<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
gate and gives a full charge right the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.969 
gate and gives a full charge right the
way<00:01:18.479> through<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:19.080> course<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> first<00:01:19.590> battery

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
way through of course the first battery

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.130 
way through of course the first battery
it<00:01:20.070> gets<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> full<00:01:20.850> charge<00:01:21.090> goes<00:01:21.810> into<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it gets to the full charge goes into the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.480 
it gets to the full charge goes into the
cranking<00:01:22.500> battery<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.100> boarding<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that but I got under this thing through

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
that but I got under this thing through
a<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.360> charger<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.290> called<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> red

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
a this little charger it's called a red

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.069 
a this little charger it's called a red
arc<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:45.240> guy<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.720> checked<00:01:45.930> my

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
arc and the guy that checked my

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510 
arc and the guy that checked my
batteries<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.770> down<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.159> told<00:01:47.369> me<00:01:47.490> about

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
batteries up and down and told me about

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.539 
batteries up and down and told me about
it<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> cheap<00:01:49.020> thing<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.619> 420<00:01:50.430> odd

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it not a cheap thing is about 420 odd

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.240 
it not a cheap thing is about 420 odd
dollars<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> end<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
dollars I think but in the end I the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.359 
dollars I think but in the end I the
bald<00:01:53.490> battery<00:01:53.909> comes<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.270> 250<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.380> it's

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
bald battery comes with 250 so it's

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.459 
bald battery comes with 250 so it's
probably<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.850> good<00:01:57.030> investment<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
probably a good investment and what it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.530 
probably a good investment and what it
is<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.829> actually<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> small<00:01:59.670> charger<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
is is actually a small charger and it is

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
is is actually a small charger and it is
small<00:02:00.840> tiny<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> size<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.770> two<00:02:01.979> mobile

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
small tiny the size of two mobile

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.120 
small tiny the size of two mobile
telephones<00:02:02.909> probably<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:04.649> still<00:02:04.890> plugs

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
telephones probably and it still plugs

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.609 
telephones probably and it still plugs
into<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.549> innocent<00:02:06.090> bug<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.020> takes<00:02:07.259> 12

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
into that innocent bug but it takes 12

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.979 
into that innocent bug but it takes 12
volt<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:09.060> only<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.300> trickle<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.840> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
volt and it's only a trickle and it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.130 
volt and it's only a trickle and it
charges<00:02:10.319> 20<00:02:10.830> amp<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> other<00:02:11.819> side<00:02:12.140> now

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
charges 20 amp out the other side now

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.059 
charges 20 amp out the other side now
the<00:02:13.319> amazing<00:02:13.590> thing

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
the amazing thing

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.280 
the amazing thing
is<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.519> can<00:02:14.730> now<00:02:14.969> drive<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.870> long<00:02:16.049> as<00:02:16.170> I'm

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
is that I can now drive as long as I'm

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.080 
is that I can now drive as long as I'm
driving<00:02:16.650> every<00:02:16.829> three<00:02:17.040> days<00:02:17.219> or<00:02:17.489> my<00:02:17.640> battery's

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
driving every three days or my battery's

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.599 
driving every three days or my battery's
running<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.260> tell<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.769> I'm<00:02:19.859> running<00:02:19.980> 110

litre<00:02:20.819> lead<00:02:21.719> in<00:02:21.840> Waco<00:02:22.310> fridge/freezer<00:02:23.310> and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
litre lead in Waco fridge/freezer and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.239

another<00:02:24.659> 60<00:02:25.109> litre<00:02:25.409> Waco<00:02:25.799> that<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.159> a

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:26.249 
another 60 litre Waco that it's a

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.819 
another 60 litre Waco that it's a
freezer<00:02:26.519> in<00:02:26.609> its<00:02:26.849> own<00:02:26.969> right<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.590> three<00:02:28.590> days

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
freezer in its own right and three days

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.470 
freezer in its own right and three days
there's<00:02:29.129> no<00:02:29.249> problems<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.909> as<00:02:30.120> long<00:02:30.269> as<00:02:30.299> I'm

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
there's no problems and as long as I'm

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.119 
there's no problems and as long as I'm
driving<00:02:30.659> within<00:02:31.079> three<00:02:31.260> days<00:02:31.290> build<00:02:31.739> charges

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
driving within three days build charges

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.699 
driving within three days build charges
up<00:02:32.250> again<00:02:32.459> okay<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.209> basically<00:02:33.689> instead<00:02:34.650> of

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
up again okay so basically instead of

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.959 
up again okay so basically instead of
charging<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.280> batteries<00:02:35.700> off<00:02:35.819> the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
charging the batteries off the

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.879 
charging the batteries off the
alternator<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.750> alternator<00:02:37.200> voltage<00:02:37.319> goes

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
alternator the alternator voltage goes

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.559 
alternator the alternator voltage goes
to<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.159> input<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.639> thing<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.180> then<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
to the input of this thing and then the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.119 
to the input of this thing and then the
output<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.079> goes<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.409> the<00:02:40.500> battery<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.010> it

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
output of it goes to the battery so it

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.339 
output of it goes to the battery so it
basically<00:02:41.510> isolates<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.750> batteries<00:02:43.139> from

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
basically isolates the batteries from

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.619 
basically isolates the batteries from
the<00:02:43.530> from<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.340> alternator<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.030> still<00:02:45.299> charge

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
the from the alternator but still charge

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.229 
the from the alternator but still charge
of<00:02:45.780> them<00:02:45.870> that's<00:02:46.409> right<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.760> easy<00:02:48.000> it's

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
of them that's right and it's easy it's

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.059 
of them that's right and it's easy it's
just<00:02:48.329> it's<00:02:48.629> not<00:02:48.810> sucking<00:02:49.079> all<00:02:49.379> that<00:02:49.530> power<00:02:49.799> out

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
just it's not sucking all that power out

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.429 
just it's not sucking all that power out
and<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.969> therefore<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.959> all<00:02:52.139> very<00:02:52.349> well

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
and and therefore it's all very well

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.500 
and and therefore it's all very well
controlled<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.699> it's<00:02:53.849> actually<00:02:54.209> called<00:02:54.419> a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
controlled and it's actually called a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.619 
controlled and it's actually called a
red<00:02:54.840> arc<00:02:55.049> Smart<00:02:55.560> Start<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.699> a<00:02:56.879> BCDC

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
red arc Smart Start and it's a BCDC

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.970 
red arc Smart Start and it's a BCDC

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
work for me and they've pretty switched

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.300 
work for me and they've pretty switched
on<00:03:14.790> bloke<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.329> well<00:03:15.629> yeah<00:03:16.319> that's<00:03:16.739> that's

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
on bloke so well yeah that's that's

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.009 
on bloke so well yeah that's that's
definitely<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.909> way<00:03:17.939> to<00:03:18.060> go<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.629> it's<00:03:18.780> sort

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
definitely the way to go and it's sort
