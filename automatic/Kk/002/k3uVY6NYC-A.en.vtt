00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.910
 it's absurd 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.840
 this is it if you have 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160

 on my 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.770
 my 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.810

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.650
 So 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.730

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.049
 of your computer but in the case 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.449

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.659
 this is 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:36.900
 here mud said 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.239
 program and in viola it free for pcs what everything would be 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.539
 union asked a lot about it 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:44.829
 and the following 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.869
 I'm going to open my fifth day. 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.869

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.589
 are involved here in computer censor 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.819
 in his hunter it's 40 degrees 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.579
 if we do not have another he will cut at least to go to block 50 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.709
 40 degrees when making a video lesson 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.329
 is using enough processor 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.329
 So control the timing. See you. 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:24.959
 100% 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.759
 so it's just that 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.759
 quixote chassis on the go table 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:35.049

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:50.279
 tavinho alone vinícius 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:51.650

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.129
 lost christmas space 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.180
