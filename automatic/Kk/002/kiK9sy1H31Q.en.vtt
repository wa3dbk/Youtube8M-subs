00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.860 
but in n you definitely that's pretty
fast<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.940> great<00:02:54.150> thing<00:02:54.180> about<00:02:54.360> nu<00:02:54.750> as

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
fast and the great thing about nu as

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.750 
fast and the great thing about nu as
well<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.230> there's<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:55.769> no<00:02:56.040> spinners<00:02:56.489> no

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
well is that there's like no spinners no

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.520 
well is that there's like no spinners no
good<00:02:57.000> ones<00:02:57.209> anyway<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.810> best<00:02:58.230> ones<00:02:58.470> are

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
good ones anyway like the best ones are

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.070 
good ones anyway like the best ones are
like<00:02:58.590> torical<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.880> believe<00:03:00.540> our<00:03:00.690> moldos

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
like torical and I believe our moldos

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.330 
like torical and I believe our moldos
and<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.380> as<00:03:01.500> well<00:03:01.530> which<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:01.920> both<00:03:02.280> our

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
and you as well which is both our

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.059 
and you as well which is both our
stealth<00:03:02.850> rock<00:03:03.090> week<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:03.450> that's<00:03:03.510> stupid<00:03:04.069> but

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
stealth rock week so that's stupid but

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.800 
stealth rock week so that's stupid but
they're<00:03:05.250> basically<00:03:05.880> no<00:03:06.150> good<00:03:06.360> spinners<00:03:06.660> in

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
they're basically no good spinners in

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.100 
they're basically no good spinners in
that<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.170> nu<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.910> it's<00:03:08.910> very<00:03:09.150> fairly<00:03:09.569> easy<00:03:09.989> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
that in nu and it's very fairly easy to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.680 
that in nu and it's very fairly easy to
pull<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:10.440> up<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.269> scenario<00:03:12.420> though<00:03:12.660> a

pull this up in this scenario though a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.210 
pull this up in this scenario though a
lot<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.989> fish<00:03:13.170> both<00:03:13.380> men<00:03:13.530> are<00:03:13.560> faster<00:03:14.069> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
lot of fish both men are faster the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.530 
lot of fish both men are faster the
point<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.640> said<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.819> stout<00:03:15.060> speed<00:03:15.360> your

point that is said to stout speed your
opponents<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.050> then<00:03:16.290> i<00:03:16.319> go<00:03:16.590> for<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.769> sleep

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010

opponents and then i go for the sleep
talk<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.340> get<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.459> phase<00:03:17.730> move<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.239> not<00:03:18.840> even

out 66.6 percent at a time because you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.910 
out 66.6 percent at a time because you

said right now i'm not even able to add

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.080 
said right now i'm not even able to add

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
speed them at all which is really not

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.190

big deal though because most of his

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.140 
big deal though because most of his

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
now is his his krookodile because that

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.770 
now is his his krookodile because that
thing<00:03:44.370> does<00:03:44.519> have<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> stab<00:03:45.030> earthquake<00:03:45.450> hit<00:03:45.600> me

that sounds to an audix because the the
thing<00:03:53.730> just<00:03:53.820> does<00:03:54.030> not<00:03:54.209> look<00:03:54.269> fast<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.620> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
thing just does not look fast but the

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
gonna go back to wheezing he predicts

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.370 
gonna go back to wheezing he predicts
that<00:04:10.680> though<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.600> at<00:04:12.600> first<00:04:12.840> thought<00:04:13.019> he<00:04:13.200> wasn't

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
that though I at first thought he wasn't

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.539 
that though I at first thought he wasn't
really<00:04:13.590> in<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.799> position<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.190> predict

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
really in the position to predict

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.180 
really in the position to predict
anything<00:04:14.730> because<00:04:15.060> he<00:04:15.090> was<00:04:15.329> definitely<00:04:15.540> down

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
anything because he was definitely down

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.650 
anything because he was definitely down
but<00:04:17.190> then<00:04:17.310> looking<00:04:17.579> at<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.789> IP<00:04:17.970> he<00:04:18.390> looks

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
but then looking at the IP he looks

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.270 
but then looking at the IP he looks
scarfed<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.380> I'm<00:04:19.440> thinking<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.919> know<00:04:19.979> if<00:04:20.100> he

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
scarfed and I'm thinking you know if he

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.830 
scarfed and I'm thinking you know if he
is<00:04:20.310> scarf<00:04:20.700> then<00:04:20.880> why<00:04:21.090> would<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.390> earthquake

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
is scarf then why would the earthquake

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.630 
is scarf then why would the earthquake
knowing<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:22.560> we<00:04:22.770> zijn<00:04:22.979> comes<00:04:23.190> in<00:04:23.310> he<00:04:23.430> cannot

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
knowing if we zijn comes in he cannot

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.420 
knowing if we zijn comes in he cannot
even<00:04:23.820> move

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
even move

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.040 
even move
and<00:04:24.550> if<00:04:25.090> he<00:04:25.180> switches<00:04:25.419> back<00:04:25.630> out<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:25.930> then

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
and if he switches back out and then

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.330 
and if he switches back out and then
back<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.380> he's<00:04:26.500> going<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.680> die<00:04:26.800> from<00:04:26.949> hazards

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
back and he's going to die from hazards

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.100 
back and he's going to die from hazards
anyway<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:27.639> there<00:04:27.910> was<00:04:28.030> no<00:04:28.150> reprint<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.750> not<00:04:28.930> go

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
anyway so there was no reprint to not go

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.210 
anyway so there was no reprint to not go
for<00:04:29.289> crunch<00:04:29.470> there<00:04:29.770> I<00:04:29.949> guess<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.460> made<00:04:30.729> sense

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
for crunch there I guess that made sense

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.320 
for crunch there I guess that made sense
but<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.280> finish<00:04:33.610> him<00:04:33.789> off<00:04:33.850> regardless<00:04:34.030> even

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
but I finish him off regardless even

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.610 
but I finish him off regardless even
after<00:04:34.660> takrut<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.960> get<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.139> take<00:04:35.199> a<00:04:35.259> crunch

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
after takrut I get to take a crunch

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.860 
after takrut I get to take a crunch
