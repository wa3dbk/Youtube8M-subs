00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.300
 information that appeared on the site 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.830

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.060
 so I put you the link in the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.850
 description he had not gone to see 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.739
 so give away the armor that will 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.800
 available to the sellers of the event and 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.050
 of the vanguard for the next dlc and 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.090
 for the titan the hunter and the organist 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.050
 So here we go first 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.940
 with Afghanistan 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.190
 then this armor will be available to 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.739
 sellers of the power test that this 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.539
 armor has some pretty sober colors 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.519
 rather white and a little golden 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.199
 red and blue really I love it 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.640
 I really like the torso that makes 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.350
 reference a little bit with the sharks 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.969
 that we can see through at the time 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.250
 Napoleonic is an era me 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.540
 I appreciate earlier so here I am 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.400
 it's really nice time 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.070
 you can see besides that the that 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.810
 the gloves the helmet and the boots have 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.190
 been worn with the torso of quotas 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.320
 available in the last raid which is 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.810
 so we can see that we 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.549
 may there the armies were mingled here 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.140
 in images that have nothing to say 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.460
 really very sober me I love them 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.020
 sober colors so here I like it 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.939
 I love myself I did that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.890
 especially the organist which I 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.290
 really looking forward to buying the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.520
 torso tested at the seller level 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.930
 of the avant-garde then there we fall 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.360
 still we have a lot more colors 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.479
 sober with really much golden 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.450
 white and blue spikes at the level 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.310
 caste I love following right with the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.110
 blues that goes down on the sides and the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.180
 golden cables on the head that really makes 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.350
 super nice with the glasses and more 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.020
 really believes beautiful 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.390
 at the level of the gloves very sober white 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.619
 blue at the level of torsos same thing we 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.390
 is a little reference to the time 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.100
 Napoleonic and the right one is 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.409
 really julien with a kind of school 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.420
 I like a lot at the level of the boots 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.759
 remains quite sober and at the level of the arms 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.130
 that there is no big big novelty 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.020

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.670

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.810
 equipment I love it but I love 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.210
 really the times what makes me think 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.100
 at Napoleon and I can not wait to 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.260
 is it us to avoid it here we go 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.210
 now go to the hunters so the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.890

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.930
 the latest helmets appeared with a 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.700
 visor blue to golden you will have for 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.560
 the gloves the choice between two ways with 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.360

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.610
 species of small red spots that 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.100
 back on the crazy it was really 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.260
 very pretty at the level of the boots then there 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.250
 I spoke again like the organist that me 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.350

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.420
 approached for my big favorite 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.860
 for the hunter it is at the level of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.910
 caps they really did a big 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.920
 design effort 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.510
 I find them really beautiful 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.880

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.050
 laces in the middle I love it 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.280
 now go to the equipment of 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.500
 the vanguard that will be available 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.970
 for hunters so same thing a 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.100
 always quite sober with the helmets a 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.440
 no big news the arms them 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.209
 will be rather red at the level 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.260
 torsos by cons I love the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.209
 small rooms sciences 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.370
 popping up on all the 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.630
 torso is really pretty at the level 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.160
 boots we can see also you will have 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.840
 blood spots and the right one 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.820
 goes back a little bit higher as 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.739
 the Napoleonic era I have a lot 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.660
 repeat but I love this I conceive 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.940
 super pretty and at the level of the caps on 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.610
 also close to that of the front 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.930
 guard with blood stains on that 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.489
 right that is all white and I the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.769
 really but really beautiful 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.269
 so you hunters what do you think 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.220
 you really that these equipments me 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.900
 I love a lot for the cape that I 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.299
 will buy media ghm directly from 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.560
 that the dlc will go out and that's it 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.470
 of heart also at the level of the times it is 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.239
 I really love this equipment we are going 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.100
 now go to titan so for 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.320
 fly titan is now with 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.450
 rather sober equipment a red blue 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.680
 white a little bit of golden then there 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.180
 really my favorite 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.390
 on the left chest with the species 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.440
 red eagle running through time are 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.299
 really beautiful 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.080
 after for the rest it stays like 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.790
 usually pretty square 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.380
 enough for me I keep a little bit 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.060
 heavy announcements of the titan after his 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.769
 emails or to me and I find that really 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.160
 a bit heavy on the other hand 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.270
 equipment of the avant-garde there he 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.680
 there is something I love it is a species 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.480
 little camouflage that we can see on 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.550
 the little world left and that makes 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.950
 reference to the army I find that the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.540
 Titan saw how square he is 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.530
 small references to art but 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.760
 frankly I find it really that 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.470
 what it is you are not stupid 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.970
 everything and you can you besides you 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.430
 to see that on these screens there is 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.360
 no belts that were put so 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.500
 I think anyway there will be the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.570
 belts there is no doubt 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.770
 Well, here it is, he was not at home 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.820
 tell you too the titans what you 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.320
 think of this equipment 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.030
 and do not hesitate to tell me at 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.320
 overall what equipment do you prefer 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.360
 which equipment you really find the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.130
 prettier me I really stopped 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.420
 on the torsos of the organist and the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.080
 caps of the hunter I find them 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.000
 magnificent 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.770
 this is the end of this video and 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.330
