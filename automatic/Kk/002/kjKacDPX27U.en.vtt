your<00:00:00.690> small<00:00:00.930> intestine<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.500> made<00:00:01.680> up<00:00:01.800> of<00:00:02.510> three

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
your small intestine is made up of three

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.130 
your small intestine is made up of three
sections<00:00:04.080> so<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> first<00:00:04.950> part<00:00:05.130> after<00:00:05.700> the

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
sections so the first part after the

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.390 
sections so the first part after the
stomach<00:00:07.140> after<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.500> caloric<00:00:07.859> sphincter<00:00:08.220> goes

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
stomach after the caloric sphincter goes

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.680 
stomach after the caloric sphincter goes
into<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.730> duodenum<00:00:08.849> which<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.360> saw<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
into the duodenum which we saw in the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.390 
into the duodenum which we saw in the
pancreas<00:00:10.080> right<00:00:10.320> now<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.920> different<00:00:11.219> parts

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
pancreas right now the different parts

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.129 
pancreas right now the different parts
of<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> duodenum<00:00:11.820> I'm<00:00:12.750> not<00:00:12.900> sure<00:00:12.990> if<00:00:13.049> you

it's a very good question so after the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.369 
it's a very good question so after the
ileum<00:00:47.329> goes<00:00:48.329> through<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.780> valve<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.289> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379

we get the other intestines I'll show
you<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.380> pacific<00:01:45.890> parts<00:01:46.159> of<00:01:46.310> Tinian<00:01:46.490> coli

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
you the pacific parts of Tinian coli

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.120 
you the pacific parts of Tinian coli
this<00:01:47.509> only<00:01:47.719> shows<00:01:47.810> behind<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:48.649> just<00:01:48.979> know<00:01:49.100> that

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
this only shows behind so just know that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.510 
this only shows behind so just know that
10<00:01:49.700> da<00:01:49.819> coli<00:01:50.149> way<00:01:50.299> what<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:50.719> it<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.799> just<00:01:52.250> like

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
10 da coli way what is it it's just like

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.620 
10 da coli way what is it it's just like
ligament<00:01:53.479> that<00:01:53.659> holds<00:01:55.000> holds<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.179> pulling

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
ligament that holds holds the pulling

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.479 
ligament that holds holds the pulling
together<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.259> forms<00:01:57.619> these<00:01:57.799> pouches

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
together and it forms these pouches

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.690 
together and it forms these pouches
so<00:01:58.970> these<00:01:59.090> pouches<00:01:59.329> are<00:01:59.599> called<00:01:59.810> hofstra

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
so these pouches are called hofstra

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.350 
so these pouches are called hofstra
Nicastro<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.909> singular<00:02:03.759> okay<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:04.819> it's<00:02:05.209> like

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
Nicastro is singular okay so it's like

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.169 
Nicastro is singular okay so it's like
we<00:02:05.479> said<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.750> stomach<00:02:06.170> will<00:02:06.319> sit<00:02:06.500> here

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
we said the stomach will sit here

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.809 
we said the stomach will sit here
greater<00:02:08.179> omentum<00:02:08.479> comes<00:02:09.099> off<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.459> greater

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
greater omentum comes off of a greater

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.759 
greater omentum comes off of a greater
curvature<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.569> sits<00:02:11.959> on<00:02:12.200> top<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.440> the

curvature and it sits on top of the

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.280 
curvature and it sits on top of the
intestines<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.329> yellow<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:14.900> here<00:02:14.930> is

intestines so this yellow right here is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.500 
intestines so this yellow right here is
greater<00:02:15.590> omentum<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.370> yellow<00:02:16.760> any<00:02:16.970> any

greater omentum this yellow any any

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.050

crevice<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.470> has<00:02:18.769> yellow<00:02:19.129> in<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.760> going

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
crevice that has yellow in it is going

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.709 
crevice that has yellow in it is going
to<00:02:20.299> be<00:02:20.450> greater<00:02:20.959> omentum<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.530> well
