little<00:02:16.849> out<00:02:17.000> free

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.809 

getting<00:02:34.760> quite<00:02:34.909> the<00:02:35.150> hole<00:02:35.360> in

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.710 

all<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.180> dig<00:02:43.390> in

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.030 

and<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.200> gold<00:02:49.560> everywhere

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.000 

lower<00:02:56.550> part

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
lower part

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.869 

then<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.459> last<00:02:59.640> step<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:02.040> actual

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.410 

so<00:03:08.659> first<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.260> whole<00:03:09.560> seems<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.310> be

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
so first the whole seems to be

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.090 
so first the whole seems to be
getting<00:03:11.990> better<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.620> farther<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:12.980> go<00:03:13.220> back<00:03:13.430> in

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
getting better the farther I go back in

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.070 
getting better the farther I go back in
what<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.610> was<00:03:15.880> thinking<00:03:15.910> originally<00:03:16.630> when<00:03:17.050> I

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
what I was thinking originally when I

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.910 
what I was thinking originally when I
first<00:03:17.440> started<00:03:18.310> this<00:03:18.460> whole

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.700 

the<00:03:21.250> light<00:03:21.490> goals<00:03:21.760> were<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.840> outside<00:03:23.290> here

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
the light goals were on the outside here

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.970 
the light goals were on the outside here
where<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.010> first<00:03:24.250> started<00:03:24.700> diggin

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.640 

signs<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.849> heavier<00:03:30.150> Gold's<00:03:30.750> heavier<00:03:31.530> irons

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.580 

hopefully<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.129> farther<00:03:35.400> we<00:03:35.580> go<00:03:35.760> back<00:03:36.590> figure

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
hopefully the farther we go back figure

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.750 
hopefully the farther we go back figure
the<00:03:37.680> goal<00:03:37.890> continued

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the goal continued

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.839 
the goal continued
