00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.340 
elegant and you probably can't see it on
camera<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.790> there's<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> beautiful<00:01:36.659> rosewood

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
camera but there's a beautiful rosewood

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
camera but there's a beautiful rosewood
overlay<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.189> maple<00:01:38.400> underneath<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
overlay here with maple underneath it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.050 
overlay here with maple underneath it
and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.420> another<00:01:39.689> layer<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.610> black<00:01:41.610> veneer

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and then another layer of black veneer

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.050 
and then another layer of black veneer
so<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:42.810> nice<00:01:43.020> depth<00:01:43.590> and

our classic range is the upper end this
is<00:02:32.980> once<00:02:33.190> again<00:02:33.990> solid<00:02:34.990> cedar<00:02:35.200> book-matched

with that with that really delicate new
bracing<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:39.610> lets<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.030> top<00:02:40.240> fly<00:02:40.830> this

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830

particular<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.490> is<00:02:42.640> bound<00:02:42.850> in<00:02:43.150> six<00:02:43.510> ply<00:02:43.750> maple

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
particular one is bound in six ply maple

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.820 
particular one is bound in six ply maple
bindings<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.460> it's<00:02:45.640> got<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> real<00:02:46.330> natural<00:02:46.830> I

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
bindings so it's got a real natural I

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.040 
bindings so it's got a real natural I
can't<00:02:48.640> really<00:02:48.760> say<00:02:49.000> traditional<00:02:49.690> look<00:02:49.840> but

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
can't really say traditional look but

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.840 
can't really say traditional look but
it's<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.440> really<00:02:50.680> warm<00:02:50.980> character<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.820> it

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
it's just a really warm character to it

it's just a really warm character to it
you<00:02:51.970> just<00:02:52.000> see<00:02:52.300> this<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:52.810> want<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.020> pick

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
you just see this you just want to pick

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.770 
you just see this you just want to pick
the<00:02:53.410> guitar<00:02:53.800> up<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.820> particular<00:02:55.120> one<00:02:55.390> as

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
the model number indicates is thin it's

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.450 
the model number indicates is thin it's
a<00:02:58.150> thin<00:02:58.360> classic<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.140> because<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.070> has<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
a thin classic and because it has the

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.390 
a thin classic and because it has the
Fishman<00:03:01.260> classic<00:03:02.260> for<00:03:02.440> EQ<00:03:02.920> into<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.280> and

Fishman classic for EQ into it and

Fishman classic for EQ into it and
you're<00:03:03.490> going<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.700> amplify<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.290> thin

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
you're going to amplify this that thin

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.400 
you're going to amplify this that thin
body<00:03:05.970> gives<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.210> same<00:03:07.390> benefits<00:03:07.930> as<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
body gives you the same benefits as the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.750 
body gives you the same benefits as the
thin<00:03:08.740> medium<00:03:08.890> jumbo<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.460> you're<00:03:09.610> going<00:03:09.730> to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
thin medium jumbo so you're going to

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.960 
thin medium jumbo so you're going to
reduce<00:03:09.940> some<00:03:10.360> of<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.570> low<00:03:11.970> feedback

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
reduce some of that low feedback

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.270 
reduce some of that low feedback
resonance<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.870> caused<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:14.560> much<00:03:14.680> problem<00:03:15.190> on

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
resonance that caused so much problem on

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.770 
resonance that caused so much problem on
stage<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.540> also<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:17.709> thin<00:03:18.010> body

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
stage and it also that thin body

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.840 
stage and it also that thin body
especially<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.110> think<00:03:20.610> electric<00:03:21.610> players

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850
