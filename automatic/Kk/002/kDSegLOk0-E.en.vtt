00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.420
 Last night the false name here Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture, a daytime disaster just happened 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.420
 It looks like a charan 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:21.650
 It's surprisingly difficult to see cherry blossoms with a good sound 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:26.810
 I went to the usual because I did Magna, but this is how I finally got my brother 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:31.820
 There do I'll I do not appear before a child of the camera are hanging here to tell the truth to a microphone using 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.669
 I think I'm hanging of the individual microphone I actually here and here 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.239
 Something really 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.489
 gree feeling full of feeling a little embarrassing, but like this 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:46.739
 You have traffic from the top clipped but is connected the microphone this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:52.660
 So I think this is a condenser mic and maybe it's great to pick up the sound but this is 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:56.800
 This kind of sound for business like this camera and he is a little bit sure with 5 v 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.660
 Is it 10 v Was this 40 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:05.290
 You can't use that much harder without 8 v 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.670
 I do not know at all if I become a little and try to connect well if I think from the use 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.240
 I couldn't use it 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.970
 Oh yeah I know that the voltage is different but I bought it 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.790
 Speaking of the dynamic equipment that can be used in that commercial equipment is the system 5 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.140
 Nebe 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.510
 It is always popular and you can do something about this on youtube though 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.530
 Na to become something you want to do Yappa 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:33.990
 I heard that there was mud and a pant voice came out 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.920
 Mike for the entertainment reporter is sm 63 l 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.850
 It's I wanted for a long Now Now the Uo' show 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.970
 Well root Buddha microphone It is felt Yappa aware of the work for 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.979
 I guy to become a guy that hey vocal stick to the head 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.649
 Since the rest is made as a microphone for reporter's time to work on a case this outside 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.909
 The part of this hey is long 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.940
 This is why it is such a long time when the reporter interviews the other party 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.510
 The field is 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.830
 It's great from Hawaii, I'll take the mark to my mouth 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.600
 Because in quite tough even outdoors because it is such a long time it's the way dynamic microphone 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.150
 We went to such use 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:18.930
 Since the capital ratio is set lower than such a condenser microphone, only the sound of the mouth is picked up 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:24.480
 No I pretty it is or with a variety ne That's sound since the mouth 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.859
 If you talk with me properly, you will hear noise and horror when it comes to the environment. 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.939
 I will cut it 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:33.360
 Let's give it a try Try to pick up this condenser microphone from the sound of this mouth 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:39.810
 I have a high luck rate, but here 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:44.180
 If you remove the microphone a little and feel like it's like this, you 're probably picking up the sound 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.180
 I think I will remove it from the camera once 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.840
 Udon this 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:58.700
 But what I think the main'll try to put a sweet type it looks like sound changes 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.650
 Hey I wonder if you have changed this condenser microphone and sound you are using usually I 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.310
 I do not know if I have not heard a fighter 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.560
 This condenser microphone was just removed from my mouth and I picked up the sound like that. 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.880
 In such a feeling I'll have the same kinda removed but is 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:16.880
 Do you say that I won't pick up some sounds 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.640
 The c-on rate of the sound is lower than that of the previous condenser. 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.210
 Maybe not 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:31.870
 So much better of here I utilization of fine sound sound when you talk a little bit and when you took to the mouth of the 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:34.510
 Sion 's treble should be designed to pick up only this area, so for sound 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.540
 It was different from the Leinster Mike now 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:45.170
 For example, a party venue Toka umbrella various cabinet outdoor 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:48.469
 Saadi when even annoying heights really around when you're working I wanna wide only the sound of the mouth 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.670
 When I say, I think that such a year ago is very useful 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:57.769
 It was through just train I think I'm using the microphone of the entertainment reporter's the past now 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.530
 But probably pretty cat microphone Nde I think that 10 days probably of the train is not picked up at all Well 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.420
 Oh and large 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:08.700
 It's 9th floor I think it's really nice to have 5 points when shooting outdoors 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:12.780
 I think it's considered as a hand mark, and the price is about 10 times the price of the sound microphone here 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.180
 But I bought one because I really wanted one 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.180
 Not that was a report from the local or higher 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.270
 me 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.610
