processes cells and for all those

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.390 
processes cells and for all those
processes<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:19.289> during<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.920> placement<00:00:20.130> role

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
processes but during the placement role

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.950 
processes but during the placement role
as<00:00:20.520> well<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.730> acted<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> bridge<00:00:21.600> between<00:00:21.630> the

as well as acted as a bridge between the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.570 
as well as acted as a bridge between the
primary<00:00:22.410> department<00:00:22.920> into<00:00:23.039> engineering

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
primary department into engineering

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.070 
primary department into engineering
department<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.539> know<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.750> need<00:00:24.869> anything

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
department so we know we need anything

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.570 
department so we know we need anything
to<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.380> fixed<00:00:25.680> anything<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.130> looked<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.460> we

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to be fixed anything as we looked at we

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.550 
to be fixed anything as we looked at we
need<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.880> get<00:00:27.060> from<00:00:27.599> engineering<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> comment

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
need to get from engineering to comment

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.230 
need to get from engineering to comment
so<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:28.980> any<00:00:29.160> issues<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.849> plan<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
so are any issues we have in plan I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.730 
so are any issues we have in plan I
think<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.080> placing<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:31.590> you're

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
think going on placing because you're

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.290 
think going on placing because you're
learning<00:00:31.890> practically<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.090> learn<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
learning practically you get to learn a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.330 
learning practically you get to learn a
lot<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.719> they<00:00:33.870> don't<00:00:34.110> immunity<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> lot<00:00:35.309> of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
lot that they don't immunity so a lot of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.100 
lot that they don't immunity so a lot of
project<00:00:35.730> management<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.180> beam<00:00:36.390> time<00:00:36.630> when

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
project management and beam time when

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.540 
project management and beam time when
she<00:00:37.230> conscious<00:00:37.649> about<00:00:37.860> certain<00:00:38.160> things<00:00:38.309> make

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
she conscious about certain things make

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.979 
she conscious about certain things make
sure<00:00:38.579> they're<00:00:38.820> able<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.149> meet<00:00:39.360> targets<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
sure they're able to meet targets and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
sure they're able to meet targets and
did<00:00:40.410> deadlines<00:00:40.860> effectively<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.940> last

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
did deadlines effectively so last

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.729 
did deadlines effectively so last
stuffer<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.719> embedded<00:00:43.079> into<00:00:43.410> me<00:00:43.530> very

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
stuffer that was embedded into me very

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.260 
stuffer that was embedded into me very
early<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> had<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> make<00:00:45.239> sure

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
early on to because I had to make sure

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
early on to because I had to make sure
that<00:00:45.390> hit<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> lot<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> time<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.890> for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that hit a lot of time is not just for

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
that hit a lot of time is not just for
my<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.820> more<00:00:47.969> work<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.629> personal

ideas coming from young people in
Michigan<00:01:09.330> versus<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> high<00:01:09.780> performance<00:01:10.260> well

Michigan versus a high performance well
when<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> first<00:01:11.580> started<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.090> kind<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
when I first started I was kind of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.670 
when I first started I was kind of
thrown<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.630> deep<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.290> bit<00:01:13.380> because

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
thrown in deep in a little bit because
