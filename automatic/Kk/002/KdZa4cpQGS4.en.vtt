00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
take the front section and put it over

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.119 
take the front section and put it over
the<00:00:38.910> back<00:00:38.940> section<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.440> you're<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> do

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the back section so you're going to do

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
the back section so you're going to do
bulk<00:00:41.670> twists<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> same<00:00:42.719> direction<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
bulk twists in the same direction and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.160 
bulk twists in the same direction and
then<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.370> cross<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.149> over<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> opposite<00:00:45.989> way

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
then you cross it over the opposite way

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
then you cross it over the opposite way
so<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.070> you're<00:00:47.219> doing<00:00:47.430> both<00:00:47.670> twists<00:00:48.149> going

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so if you're doing both twists going

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.080 
so if you're doing both twists going
right<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.680> cross<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.160> over<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.850> left

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
right you would cross it over the left

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.029 
right you would cross it over the left
take<00:00:54.090> some<00:00:54.300> hair<00:00:54.480> add<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.719> into<00:00:55.020> both<00:00:55.379> sections

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
take some hair add it into both sections

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.420 
take some hair add it into both sections
and<00:00:56.600> take<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> front<00:00:57.989> section<00:00:58.199> over<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.250> back

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and take the front section over the back

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.939 
and take the front section over the back
section<00:00:59.750> I'm<00:01:00.750> also<00:01:00.989> wearing<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.350> extensions

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
section I'm also wearing my extensions

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.340 
section I'm also wearing my extensions
because<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.460> needed<00:01:03.030> longer<00:01:03.870> hair<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.260> this

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
because I needed longer hair for this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.609 
because I needed longer hair for this
and<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.330> continue<00:01:06.960> doing<00:01:07.080> those<00:01:07.350> same

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and you just continue doing those same

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:57.390 
and you just continue doing those same

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.360 

and<00:01:58.400> then<00:01:59.360> once<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.690> get<00:01:59.870> to<00:01:59.900> about<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.920> top<00:02:01.190> of

and then once I get to about the top of
my<00:02:01.520> ear<00:02:01.550> I<00:02:02.030> start<00:02:02.630> taking<00:02:02.900> hair<00:02:03.290> in<00:02:03.440> all<00:02:03.680> the
