the<00:01:17.409> V<00:01:17.649> is<00:01:17.679> for<00:01:17.859> transition<00:01:18.789> but<00:01:19.600> what<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.780> want

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
the V is for transition but what I want

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:24.330 
the V is for transition but what I want
to<00:01:20.170> talk<00:01:20.320> about<00:01:21.539> is<00:01:22.539> the<00:01:22.840> rail<00:01:23.049> design<00:01:23.469> right

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
to talk about is the rail design right

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.819 
to talk about is the rail design right
okay<00:01:25.149> before<00:01:25.390> I<00:01:25.600> before<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:26.079> talk<00:01:26.350> about<00:01:26.380> rail

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
okay before I before I talk about rail

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.550 
okay before I before I talk about rail
design<00:01:27.159> this<00:01:27.729> is<00:01:27.969> this<00:01:28.240> from<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.990> from<00:01:29.439> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
design this is this from the from the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.010 
design this is this from the from the
middle<00:01:29.859> to<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.219> front<00:01:30.609> is<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:31.090> skinny<00:01:31.539> fish<00:01:31.780> it

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
middle to the front is a skinny fish it

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.480 
middle to the front is a skinny fish it
reminds<00:01:32.259> me<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.560> old<00:01:32.649> skinny<00:01:32.979> fish<00:01:33.219> that

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
reminds me of the old skinny fish that

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.149 
reminds me of the old skinny fish that
channel<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.299> did<00:01:34.539> but<00:01:35.049> from<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.380> back<00:01:35.560> end<00:01:35.590> it

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
channel is did but from the back end it

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.999 
channel is did but from the back end it
reminds<00:01:36.520> me<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.939> neckbeard<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.990> if<00:01:38.829> you

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
reminds me of the neckbeard so if you

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.590 
reminds me of the neckbeard so if you
remember<00:01:39.369> correctly<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.909> skinny<00:01:40.119> fish<00:01:40.359> was<00:01:40.569> a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
remember correctly the skinny fish was a

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.660 
remember correctly the skinny fish was a
deep<00:01:40.869> Swallowtail<00:01:41.499> so<00:01:42.069> they've<00:01:42.249> changed<00:01:42.280> it

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
deep Swallowtail so they've changed it

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.289 
deep Swallowtail so they've changed it
quite<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:42.999> bit

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
quite a bit

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.700 
quite a bit
it<00:01:43.509> doesn't<00:01:43.840> write<00:01:43.960> anything<00:01:44.229> like<00:01:44.530> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
it doesn't write anything like the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.209 
it doesn't write anything like the
skinny<00:01:45.429> fish<00:01:45.670> but<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.350> reminded<00:01:47.350> me<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.770> but

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
skinny fish but it reminded me of it but

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.830 
skinny fish but it reminded me of it but
I'm<00:01:48.399> going<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.609> talk<00:01:48.759> about<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:49.149> rails<00:01:49.390> for<00:01:49.810> a

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
I'm going to talk about the rails for a

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.270 
I'm going to talk about the rails for a
second<00:01:50.140> here<00:01:50.319> I<00:01:50.469> don't<00:01:50.799> know<00:01:50.950> if<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.249> zoom

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
second here I don't know if you can zoom

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.550 
second here I don't know if you can zoom
in<00:01:51.640> on<00:01:51.729> this<00:01:51.969> you'll<00:01:52.240> see<00:01:52.509> that<00:01:53.049> they<00:01:53.319> come

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
in on this you'll see that they come

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.249 
in on this you'll see that they come
they're<00:01:54.100> they're<00:01:54.729> kind<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.149> sloped<00:01:55.450> down<00:01:55.960> like

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
they're they're kind of sloped down like

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.620 
they're they're kind of sloped down like
this<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.770> then<00:01:57.249> it<00:01:57.429> gets<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.670> real<00:01:57.909> sharp<00:01:58.329> rail

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
this and then it gets a real sharp rail

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.029 
this and then it gets a real sharp rail
here<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.030> being<00:02:01.210> said<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:02.409> the

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
here so with that being said it the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.559 
here so with that being said it the
sharp<00:02:03.340> rail<00:02:03.579> is<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:03.969> grip<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.329> water

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
sharp rail is going to grip the water

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.989 
sharp rail is going to grip the water
and<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.350> going<00:02:05.499> to<00:02:05.560> make<00:02:05.859> it<00:02:06.069> so<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.549> knife

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
and it's going to make it so I can knife

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.449 
and it's going to make it so I can knife
into<00:02:07.299> it<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:08.020> when<00:02:08.229> I'm<00:02:08.319> coming<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.890> I'm<00:02:09.220> doing

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
into it so when I'm coming and I'm doing

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.090 
into it so when I'm coming and I'm doing
like<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.789> speed<00:02:10.569> car<00:02:10.899> or<00:02:11.290> if<00:02:11.560> I'm<00:02:11.680> doing<00:02:12.010> a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
like a speed car or if I'm doing a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.820 
like a speed car or if I'm doing a
roundhouse<00:02:12.670> cut<00:02:13.060> back<00:02:13.270> it's<00:02:13.720> driving<00:02:14.530> through

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
roundhouse cut back it's driving through

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.470 
roundhouse cut back it's driving through
and<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.160> feels<00:02:15.459> like<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.060> not<00:02:16.209> going<00:02:16.420> to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
and it feels like it's not going to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.900 
and it feels like it's not going to
slide

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.390 
slide
my<00:02:17.300> feet<00:02:17.570> what<00:02:18.020> I'm<00:02:18.200> doing<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> quad<00:02:19.010> or<00:02:19.340> a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
my feet what I'm doing a quad or a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.420 
my feet what I'm doing a quad or a
thruster<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.570> for<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.590> really<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.250> but

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
thruster so for that I really like but

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.830 
thruster so for that I really like but
there<00:02:22.580> was<00:02:22.700> something<00:02:23.060> else<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.360> noticed<00:02:23.420> when

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
there was something else I noticed when

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.170 
there was something else I noticed when
I<00:02:23.900> was<00:02:24.080> riding<00:02:24.470> down<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.280> line<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:26.030> was

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
I was riding down the line and was

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.150 
I was riding down the line and was
specially<00:02:26.510> going<00:02:26.660> frontside<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.440> was<00:02:27.890> going

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
specially going frontside I was going

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.040 
specially going frontside I was going
down<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.460> line<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.640> was<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.360> was<00:02:29.540> gaining

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
down the line I was and I was gaining

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.200 
down the line I was and I was gaining
speed<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.710> go<00:02:30.860> into<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:31.460> a<00:02:31.490> like<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.940> big

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
speed to go into it like a like a big

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.480 
speed to go into it like a like a big
roundhouse<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.380> whole<00:02:33.590> board<00:02:33.950> was<00:02:34.220> um

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
roundhouse the whole board was um

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.610 
roundhouse the whole board was um
floating<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.690> see<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.110> in<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.290> video

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
floating you can see it in the video

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.940 
floating you can see it in the video
that<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.400> has<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:38.060> ability<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.770> whole

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
that it has this ability to the whole

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.850 
that it has this ability to the whole
boards<00:02:40.280> planing<00:02:40.850> like<00:02:41.090> super<00:02:41.810> fast<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.380> it's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
boards planing like super fast and it's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.010 
boards planing like super fast and it's
transitioning<00:02:43.430> right<00:02:44.030> into<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> Cuddy<00:02:44.690> and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
transitioning right into the Cuddy and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.980 
transitioning right into the Cuddy and
it<00:02:45.530> felt<00:02:45.770> really<00:02:46.070> good<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.790> for<00:02:47.300> me<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.780> was

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
it felt really good so for me that was

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.380 
it felt really good so for me that was
pretty<00:02:48.230> unusual<00:02:48.700> because<00:02:49.700> I've<00:02:49.910> never<00:02:50.120> seen

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
pretty unusual because I've never seen

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.210 
pretty unusual because I've never seen
that<00:02:50.570> before<00:02:50.630> but<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.010> board

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
that before but I really like the board

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.070 
that before but I really like the board
for<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:53.120> other<00:02:53.300> thing<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.630> want<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.900> talk

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
for that the other thing I want to talk

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.690 
for that the other thing I want to talk
about<00:02:54.230> mention<00:02:54.800> is<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.100> Channel<00:02:55.490> Island

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
about mention is that Channel Island

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.450 
about mention is that Channel Island
recommends<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.270> board<00:02:56.570> as<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.810> quad<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.530> 4<00:02:58.250> fin

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
recommends this board as a quad a 4 fin

recommends this board as a quad a 4 fin
setup<00:02:58.930> I'm<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.990> thruster<00:03:00.590> guy<00:03:00.770> so<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.370> haven't

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
setup I'm a thruster guy so I haven't

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.060 
setup I'm a thruster guy so I haven't
ridden<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:02.060> quad<00:03:02.330> in<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.630> six<00:03:02.960> months<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.920> what

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
ridden a quad in like six months so what

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.220 
ridden a quad in like six months so what
I<00:03:04.130> did<00:03:04.280> was<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.880> started<00:03:05.150> with<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> thruster<00:03:06.020> I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
I did was I started with a thruster I

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.460 
I did was I started with a thruster I
got<00:03:06.860> used<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.400> board<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.880> then<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.900> put<00:03:09.350> in

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
got used to the board and then I put in

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.430 
got used to the board and then I put in
a<00:03:09.560> quad<00:03:09.800> set<00:03:10.160> now<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:10.820> chose<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.390> large<00:03:11.750> spin<00:03:12.170> and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
a quad set now I chose a large spin and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.410 
a quad set now I chose a large spin and
the<00:03:12.980> fins<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.370> chose<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.880> did<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.180> on<00:03:14.360> purpose

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
the fins I chose I did this on purpose

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.740 
the fins I chose I did this on purpose
these<00:03:15.320> are<00:03:15.530> called<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.950> FRP<00:03:16.730> which<00:03:17.480> means

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
these are called the FRP which means

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.980 
these are called the FRP which means
fiberglass<00:03:18.500> reinforced<00:03:19.430> polymers<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.330> looks

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
fiberglass reinforced polymers it looks

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.780 
fiberglass reinforced polymers it looks
like<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.230> standard<00:03:21.650> or<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.040> typical<00:03:22.580> black

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
like a standard or a typical black

like a standard or a typical black
plastic<00:03:23.150> fin<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:24.200> they've<00:03:24.410> Channel<00:03:24.920> Islands

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
plastic fin but they've Channel Islands

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.800 
plastic fin but they've Channel Islands
is<00:03:25.430> doing<00:03:25.670> something<00:03:25.880> great<00:03:26.150> they're<00:03:26.480> putting

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
is doing something great they're putting

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.860 
is doing something great they're putting
fiberglass<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.970> reinforcing<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.000> fibers<00:03:29.660> of

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
fiberglass and reinforcing the fibers of

fiberglass and reinforcing the fibers of
the<00:03:30.350> polymers<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.580> way<00:03:31.760> we<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.300> stiffen

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
the polymers so that way we can stiffen

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.199 
the polymers so that way we can stiffen
up<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.050> Flex<00:03:33.320> pattern<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:34.580> worked<00:03:34.940> great

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
up the Flex pattern it worked great

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.880 
up the Flex pattern it worked great
you<00:03:35.480> can<00:03:35.630> see<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:35.990> video<00:03:36.320> I<00:03:36.350> rode<00:03:36.709> these

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
you can see in the video I rode these

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.550 
you can see in the video I rode these
almost<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.520> whole<00:03:37.700> time<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.270> in<00:03:38.930> all<00:03:39.320> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
almost the whole time and in all the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.590 
almost the whole time and in all the
cutbacks<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.340> everything<00:03:40.790> I'm<00:03:41.209> putting

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
cutbacks and everything I'm putting

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.930 
cutbacks and everything I'm putting
maximum<00:03:42.320> power<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.770> I<00:03:42.890> can<00:03:43.070> put<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.670> I

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
maximum power that I can put in and I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.910 
maximum power that I can put in and I
felt<00:03:44.209> like<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.510> fins<00:03:44.750> were<00:03:44.990> driving<00:03:45.709> through

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
felt like the fins were driving through

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.979 
felt like the fins were driving through
turns<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.730> they<00:03:47.150> were<00:03:47.270> helping<00:03:47.600> me<00:03:47.720> get<00:03:47.959> to

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
turns and they were helping me get to

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.050 
turns and they were helping me get to
sections<00:03:48.770> I<00:03:48.980> felt<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.459> board<00:03:49.640> had<00:03:49.790> lots

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
sections I felt like the board had lots
