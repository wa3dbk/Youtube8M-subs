how<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.380> turns<00:01:22.590> out<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
how that kind of turns out but if you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
how that kind of turns out but if you
travel<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> elevators<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.750> supposed<00:01:25.080> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
travel in the elevators it's supposed to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.990 
travel in the elevators it's supposed to
be<00:01:25.290> pretty<00:01:25.500> dangerous<00:01:25.850> parts<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
be pretty dangerous parts of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.850 
be pretty dangerous parts of the
building<00:01:27.360> break<00:01:27.659> apart<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.380> move<00:01:28.590> through

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
building break apart as we move through

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
building break apart as we move through
it<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.549> parts<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> building<00:01:30.299> are

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it and some parts of the building are

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
it and some parts of the building are
like<00:01:30.659> upside<00:01:31.170> down<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.100> crazy<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.549> know

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
like upside down and and crazy you know

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.670 
like upside down and and crazy you know
it's<00:01:33.150> gonna<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.450> confusing<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.170> first<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.560> have

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it's gonna be confusing at first I have

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.410 
it's gonna be confusing at first I have
a<00:01:34.710> feeling<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.759> sounds<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.299> gonna

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
a feeling what it sounds like it's gonna

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.090 
a feeling what it sounds like it's gonna
get<00:01:36.570> pretty<00:01:36.720> cool<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.650> fun<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.920> play

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
is apparently the only map we can play

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
like it's not gonna be enough but still
the<00:01:58.049> idea<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> game<00:01:58.799> mode<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.490> pretty

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the idea of the game mode is is pretty

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
the idea of the game mode is is pretty
damn<00:01:59.939> awesome<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.020> gonna<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
damn awesome so it's gonna be a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260 
damn awesome so it's gonna be a
four-player<00:02:01.890> game<00:02:02.009> mode<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.640> every<00:02:03.090> single

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
four-player game mode where every single

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.359 
four-player game mode where every single
person<00:02:03.540> starts<00:02:03.990> off<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> zombie<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
person starts off as a zombie and it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.310 
person starts off as a zombie and it
begins<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.939> race<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.600> first<00:02:06.899> zombie<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
begins with a race the first zombie to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.809 
begins with a race the first zombie to
get<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> syringe<00:02:07.979> becomes<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> first

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
get to a syringe becomes the first

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.699 
get to a syringe becomes the first
survivor<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.660> when<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.080> play<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.470> zombie

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
survivor and when you play as a zombie

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.770 
survivor and when you play as a zombie
we're<00:02:11.069> actually<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.550> lot<00:02:11.879> faster<00:02:12.450> than<00:02:12.599> regular

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
we're actually a lot faster than regular

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.940 
we're actually a lot faster than regular
zombies<00:02:13.260> are

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
zombies are

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.979 
zombies are
plus<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.610> kill<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.879> survivor<00:02:15.209> in<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:15.720> hit

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
plus we can kill the survivor in one hit

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.839 
plus we can kill the survivor in one hit
now<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.290> says<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.770> from<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.340> survivors

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
now it says that from the survivors

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.670 
now it says that from the survivors
perspective<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.660> kind<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:19.019> like<00:02:19.170> gun<00:02:19.470> game

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
perspective it's kind of like gun game

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.830 
perspective it's kind of like gun game
you<00:02:19.830> start<00:02:20.129> off<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.400> revolver<00:02:21.030> probably

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
you start off with revolver probably

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.720 
you start off with revolver probably
like<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.170> Python<00:02:22.379> or<00:02:22.739> something<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.280> every

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
like the Python or something and every

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.339 
like the Python or something and every
time<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.120> kill<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.360> zombie<00:02:24.480> your<00:02:24.989> weapon

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
time you kill a zombie your weapon

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.509 
time you kill a zombie your weapon
switches<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:25.920> we're<00:02:26.040> gonna<00:02:26.129> have<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.370> be

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
switches so we're gonna have to be

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.640 
switches so we're gonna have to be
careful<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.030> know<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> survivor<00:02:28.349> when
