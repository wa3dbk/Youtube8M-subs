00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.420 

I<00:00:59.050> automatically<00:01:00.050> out<00:01:00.290> of<00:01:00.440> habit<00:01:00.650> cycle<00:01:01.340> the

I automatically out of habit cycle the
action<00:01:01.460> but<00:01:01.970> without<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.360> magazine<00:01:02.540> let's

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
not go too much to box for box six bucks

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:48.730 
not go too much to box for box six bucks
a<00:01:21.620> box<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:44.590> fun<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.750> bolts<00:01:48.110> definitely

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
a box that's fun the bolts definitely

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.350 
a box that's fun the bolts definitely
more<00:01:48.920> pleasant<00:01:49.400> than<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.610> Mosin<00:01:50.000> that's<00:01:50.210> for

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
more pleasant than the Mosin that's for

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:59.999 
more pleasant than the Mosin that's for
sure

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.100 

well<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.369> looks<00:02:01.550> like<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:01.970> can<00:02:02.360> make<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.840> work

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
well it looks like I can make it work

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.090 
well it looks like I can make it work
with<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.830> lot<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.280> tapping<00:02:04.820> of<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:04.940> magazine

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
with a lot of tapping of the magazine

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.859 
with a lot of tapping of the magazine
guess<00:02:07.100> that'll<00:02:07.399> probably<00:02:07.630> replace<00:02:08.630> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
guess that'll probably replace the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.620 
guess that'll probably replace the
magazine<00:02:09.289> spring<00:02:09.679> or<00:02:10.429> maybe<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.540> entire

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
magazine spring or maybe the entire

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.410 
magazine spring or maybe the entire
magazine<00:02:12.050> we'll<00:02:12.680> see<00:02:12.970> there's<00:02:13.970> something

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
magazine we'll see there's something

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.390 
magazine we'll see there's something
going<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:14.780> with<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:16.000> but<00:02:17.000> let's<00:02:17.510> see<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.220> can

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
going on with it but let's see if I can

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.080 
going on with it but let's see if I can
still<00:02:20.050> make<00:02:21.050> this<00:02:21.260> work<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:25.310> worked

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.100 

and<00:02:29.630> those<00:02:29.810> were<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.050> whole<00:02:30.830> Center<00:02:31.250> swings

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
and those were the whole Center swings

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.210 
and those were the whole Center swings
