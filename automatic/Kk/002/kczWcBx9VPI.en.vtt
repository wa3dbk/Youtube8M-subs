00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.089
 I have chosen to study I think that 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.799
 technique because I 've always been called 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.839
 attention to how the 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.269
 buildings and especially the tools 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.669
 of large dimensions and my family 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.950
 none has followed that path if so 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.630
 like the first one in this and I'm 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.880
 delighted because I told myself architecture 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.680
 technique done because I wanted to know 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.530
 how to build it and that will not collapse 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.480
 I was not focused on the design 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.100
 but how do you build the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.020
 materials the way to build and by 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.770
 that I chose technical architecture and not 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.010
 I chose to study at the university 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.320
 polytechnic of madrid because it has always 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.990
 had a high recognition and a great 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.760
 prestige and since I've always been 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.740
 a little applied by the education that I have 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.960
 had at home especially in my 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.000
 studies because I had a note that I 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.149
 allowed to access perfectly the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.800
 studies of the public university and I 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.820
 I launched at them without a doubt talking and without 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.960
 no type of impediment as always 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.629
 I spent it have been build 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.309
 that I consider the buildings a 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.740
 thing of which we make use all the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.590
 days then I was very clear that I 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.270
 I also wanted to know how it was built and 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.640
 which also had the capacity is for 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.909
 they and then me that I'm from badajoz 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.369
 because he lives in madrid and in the polytechnic 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.399
 a totally new world for me that I 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.229
 It offered a lot of activities 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.509
 sports cultural activities and 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.570
 now that you have to know and you have to have 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.610
 more international world view as 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.090
 I see that I have chosen very well but they have 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.399
 many exchange programs and I have 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.560
 a wide range of possible causes that 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.050
 do in the polytechnic kitchen says 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.520
 well I unlike you the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.100
 it's true that I was not so sure I wanted to 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.530
 dedicate myself to this construction but 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.060
 in high school I really liked it 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.159
 industrial technology and drawing 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.720
 technical then a little those 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.250
 subjects made me look for a 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.909
 career that would fit into what I 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.069
 I was looking for 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.859
 in short the technical architecture the 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:05.460
 construction and that attracted me a lot and 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.229
 I said I decided to try and upm in spite of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.940
 that I live about the one of alcalá de 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.180
 and he could have chosen another 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.430
 university the upm knew he had a lot 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.200
 more prestige as you said and wanted 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.060
 I also be in Madrid because I knew 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.830
 that was going that attracts more people from other 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.660
 provinces and I wanted to know a lot more 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.160
 good people me a little like alicia 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.750
 I studied well I did not choose architecture 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.840
 technique because I knew what it was or 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.819
 I did not even know what I was doing 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.140
 in search of a technical career because 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.420
 I am very good at drawing and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.879
 mathematics and within the options that 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.470
 there was what I think was more 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.269
 interesting when I saw that it was what 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.580
 they did neither I have ever worried nor 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.650
 how buildings were made, I did not 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.970
 posed the certain thing is that then when 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.200
 finished the race and I have exercised 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.890
 professionally it's one thing that 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.760
 love and I chose the upm because when I 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.920
 I studied that a few years ago 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.980
 because it is madrid knew very few 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.959
 universities and well yeah that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.489
 I obviously learned a lot of things 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.900
 and then I have developed my life 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.610
 Professional I have finished the race 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.530
 I am studying the Master of Innovation 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.650
 in building technology with the newspaper 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.629
 researcher and I separate from the activity 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.890
 We have other types of activities 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.900
 as it can be in delegation of students 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.430
 that I am involved and I am involved 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.959
 I think it helps you to train 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.629
 professionally from each working world 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.340
 because you have to relate to yourself in 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.900
 this case with teachers with high 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.720
 university charges to take 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.730
 decisions and I think it's a field that does not 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.019
 it must be forgotten just as we have the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.660
 delegation of students there are many more 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.450
 associations as I could draw 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.310
 the cultural and the to continue then 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.260
 that I have to name because also 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.180
 I'm involved in it is the situation 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.070
 of former students not to lose 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.690
 contact regarding the master I am 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.730
 delighted because we are there we have 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.290
 our materials laboratory that 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.910
 we can do our tests get 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.860
 contact with bazaar companies and 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.130
 helper of green from the river the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.290
 director 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.180
 nothing collaborated like her in all 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.130
 projects that he offers me I have created as 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.210
 you know begonia and strong that there was 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.790
 targeted some language courses 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.690
 which is called vtm languages which is a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.580
 specific department to train us 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.420
 Languages ​​specifically English German 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.570
 French and Portuguese apart also led 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.210
 the mentor and academic that is a program 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.100
 an educational innovation project that 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.440
 is has managed to be recognized by 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.440
 of polytechnic and that which consists of 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.390
 that some students help others and nobody 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.790
 is immersed in any project of the 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.590
 school and I'm very happy because it 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.110
 shows that apart from the degree 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.210
 can do many more things within 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.250
 our university and investigate but the 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.290
 good project because right now I'm 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.240
 with in the thesis I'm doing the 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.140
 doctorate and work on a project 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.310
 research the results that I do in 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.220
 I'm going to use this project 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.770
 for my thesis and basically that's what 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.380
 I'm now working I 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.000
 since the race I did the master and good 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.600
 then I decided to take the course 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.640
 adaptation by 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.470
 I have decided to go out to work 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.440
 have the degree of engineer of 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.190
 building or the name you have in that 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.990
 moment and continue the doctorate then 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.510
 then what I would like would be to work 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.650
 in teaching and in research and goat 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.120
 of the investigation in our 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.330
 university how is it being carried out 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.680
 It has been taking very well what 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.410
 What happens is that the technical careers 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.570
 like ours because they have not had that 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.400
 need to investigate because there was 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.020
 a lot of work then you went out 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.540
 directly from the race and you knew that 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.070
 you were going to be able to work on site or what 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.350
 out then now the investigation yes 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.390
 which it is a little more on the rise and I think 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.050
 that we are taking the good forward I 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:49.980
 I'm doing the master now 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:53.660
 do the doctorate and I went to 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.280
 the school 17 years ago 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.500
 exercised my life 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.849
 and professionals working in a 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.279
 construction company 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.740
 and good while in a work hits you 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:06.509
 all a little 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.399
 and you say I'm really jo I 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.229
 studied me and then you realize 

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:12.929
 that if not there are many things that in 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.399
 beginning scare you but then yes 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:16.979
 he knows if you are even capable of 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:18.509
 explain it to other people then good 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.309
 the truth is that the information that 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.999
 get yes that is good is also true 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:24.869
 that falls short and remains scarce and 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:28.499
 when then you have to exercise the 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:30.659
 profession there are things that you would not like 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:33.809
 know better or what you would like to control 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:35.939
 better not because the more you know, the more 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:37.559
 easy to defend yourself but it is very important 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:40.529
 what are you saying not to learn to 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:42.809
 relate to people and have 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.219
 commented on the relationships that is very very 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:45.430
 important when you have to work in 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.440
 the street 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.740
 possibility of many I have also 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.060
 done coaching and I'm wondering I'm super 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.460
 stuck in mont of intelligence 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.180
 emotional and all that has introduced has 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.800
 been thanks to the school also good 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.800
 we have the practice chairs of my 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.740
 press that is very important offer 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.500
 practice many students me from here 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.420
 well, encourage the people who are 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.000
 interested to at least inform of 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.620
 how schools are faculties and 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.200
 how are the study plans is a 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.690
 public school that is worth a lot and that 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.150
 even though there is so much background as 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.390
 You can see it in the private school but 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.700
 let's do that's why I think you have 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.180
 more initiative to make things do more 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.550
 things and in a better way 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.350
 I would also encourage everyone already 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.440
 I'm delighted with the polytechnic of 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.440
 Madrid
