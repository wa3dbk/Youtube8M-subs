00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.810
 small statino that I leave alone though 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:30.060

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:22.260

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.680
 if they are light this rough way 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.739
 however it is around 4 and a half ounces 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.630
 for a and boots it is a burden rather 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.050
 important 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.050
 A greeting

 sorry I'm panting but it's not just for 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:36.849
