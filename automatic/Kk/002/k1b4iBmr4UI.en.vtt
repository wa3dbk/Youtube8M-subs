00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.119
 in the other countries also the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.070
 let's see now the back saves 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.689
 for the forgotten island dive in 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.340
 a new one piece adventure 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.079
 set in a scenario completely 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.790
 unpublished well fight you explore includes the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.809
 saga of the rose two new characters 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.480

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.940
 so we'll see when we can 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.390
 do one on one 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.640
 Believe in and it's not like not 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.899
 continue to the day one piece they have 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.680
 always done on playstation 3 but 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.690
 I continue the one on the wii saga 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.460
 however quite different 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.820
 we give the game a content with 11 dlc 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:18.830
 key holder another dlc key holder 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.830
 artbook poster and 10 stickers is fine 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:32.220
 ok we open we spend we find ourselves the 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.510
 back game is the same as the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.440
 state 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.790
 the amount is clear that it should be fine 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:49.080
 do just that for one below the other 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:53.610
 He locked the door be true movie I think is 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.760
 the art book shows education 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.979
 ok nothing in my opinion inside the game not 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:06.060
 there are instructions there are dlc parts 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:16.560

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:21.390
