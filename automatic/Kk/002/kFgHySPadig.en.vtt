00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 the first impression I had of this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.359
 samson camera that they sent me for 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.910
 prove it was that it is a very 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.590
 big very bulky and if it's a little 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.210
 bigger than pocket cameras 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 what we are used to today 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.980
 with more or less between 8 and 10 megapixels 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.480
 but what I discovered very soon using it 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.430
 is that it is much more than a camera 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.050
 pocket and that has some functions 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.869
 which are very very interesting and in 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 some unique cases look therefore 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.640
 a 12.2 megapixel camera is very 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.769
 well in a lot of resolution but we know 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.350
 that the resolution is not everything in the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.059
 optics cameras this is the lens of the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.430
 objective as it is said in photography is 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.260
 fundamental to note that from this camera 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 It is noticeably bigger than the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.300
 cameras that look out there and the truth 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.770
 is that it has an optical zoom of 10 x is 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.020
 they can do the approaches 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.030
 fantastic with this camera without it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.870
 go to a professional team a lot much 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.489
 more expensive 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.410
 this is precisely because the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.050
 Optics has some characteristics 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 different from what you normally see 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.500
 that have some optical zoom of up to 3 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.199
 or 4 x 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.210
 besides that this camera has a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.950
 lots of functions for example you can 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.660
 do focus when you're doing a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.060
 approach you can do focus of such 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.979
 so that the foreground is in focus 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.510
 and the second plane out of focus in 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.770
 effect is very nice in photography that 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.990
 usually with automatic cameras 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.369
 can not be done has a lot of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.869
 scene modes including a mode 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.540
 program 'the one way in which everything 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.420
 can handle manually 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.690
 and also sign high definition videos 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.610
 with sound that's great but still 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.509
 better in this case is that the team 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.399
 has on this side a hdmi output 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.800
 what does this mean you can connect it 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.220
 a high resolution television with 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.350
 hdmi input and this is really very 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.700
 good and not very common in the teams of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.140
 this range what if the team is not the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.580
 easiest in the world to handle the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.979
 final hand is taken but the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.920
 buttons on the backrest that have like 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.289
 engraved the silver buttons with the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.630
 icons and engraved words are enough 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.060
 quite difficult to manage at 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.910
 principle after you take your hand 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.459
 And yes, if I decided on a camera 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.370
 like this or some equivalent accord 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.250
 to buy a card the same day 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.260
 memory of at least between 2 and 4 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.390
 gigas because the team comes with very 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.180
 little memory and you took 4 or 5 photos in 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.910
 high resolution and you already stay without 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.610
 ability to store it a very good 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.640
 Robust team walks very well is very 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.319
 quick I think it's a bit more 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.120
 great of what one is used to 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.160
 carry in your pocket so there are 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.630
 to make the decision of whether this is the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.730
 team that wants that out there a team 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.220
 more professional but a camera with 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.130
 many and very good functions and good 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.130
 also image quality I gave him 19
