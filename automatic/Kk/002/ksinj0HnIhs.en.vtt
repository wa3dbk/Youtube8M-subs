this<00:01:05.140> point<00:01:05.410> now<00:01:05.890> um<00:01:06.160> what<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.880> demonstrates

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
this point now um what this demonstrates

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.360 
this point now um what this demonstrates
I<00:01:07.480> think<00:01:07.660> immediately<00:01:07.960> is<00:01:08.470> you<00:01:08.770> know<00:01:08.860> earlier

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
I think immediately is you know earlier

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.070 
I think immediately is you know earlier
in<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.610> show<00:01:09.640> we<00:01:09.820> saw<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.300> helicopter<00:01:10.570> just

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
in the show we saw a helicopter just

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.080 
in the show we saw a helicopter just
blowing<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.500> crap<00:01:11.710> out<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:11.920> everything<00:01:12.310> you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
blowing the crap out of everything you

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.640 
blowing the crap out of everything you
are<00:01:13.180> going<00:01:13.420> for<00:01:13.450> very<00:01:13.750> different<00:01:13.960> tires<00:01:14.409> that

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
are going for very different tires that

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.840 
are going for very different tires that
except<00:01:14.890> from<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.130> level<00:01:15.280> 2<00:01:15.490> level<00:01:15.520> I<00:01:15.820> mean

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
except from the level 2 level I mean

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.060 
except from the level 2 level I mean
watch<00:01:16.630> much<00:01:16.870> of<00:01:17.020> them<00:01:17.110> is<00:01:17.230> why<00:01:17.470> don't<00:01:18.010> we

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
watch much of them is why don't we

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.590 
watch much of them is why don't we
expect<00:01:18.340> some<00:01:18.490> black<00:01:18.640> ops<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.150> is<00:01:19.300> you<00:01:19.570> know

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
expect some black ops that is you know

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.790 
expect some black ops that is you know
that's<00:01:20.200> actually<00:01:20.350> something<00:01:20.560> we've<00:01:20.770> been

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
that's actually something we've been

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.830 
that's actually something we've been
going<00:01:21.070> for<00:01:21.100> level<00:01:21.550> variety<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.180> pacing<00:01:22.750> in

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
going for level variety so pacing in

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.650 
going for level variety so pacing in
this<00:01:22.990> there's<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:23.740> setup<00:01:24.100> here<00:01:24.340> obviously

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
this there's a setup here obviously

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.820 
this there's a setup here obviously
completely<00:01:25.660> different<00:01:26.410> than<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.650> all-out

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
completely different than the all-out

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.800 
completely different than the all-out
action<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:28.060> saw<00:01:28.240> with<00:01:28.450> payback

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
action you just you saw with payback

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.900 
action you just you saw with payback
earlier<00:01:29.170> so<00:01:30.040> we're<00:01:30.160> doing<00:01:30.250> this<00:01:30.400> setup<00:01:30.610> here

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
earlier so we're doing this setup here

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.550 
earlier so we're doing this setup here
and<00:01:31.060> you're<00:01:31.480> controlling<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.020> squad<00:01:32.350> but

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
then in a couple of seconds what we're

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.550 
then in a couple of seconds what we're
going<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.930> do<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.110> going<00:01:35.230> to<00:01:35.290> bring<00:01:35.410> you<00:01:35.530> down
