here with you today
and<00:00:08.080> we're<00:00:08.650> gonna<00:00:08.769> be<00:00:08.920> taking<00:00:09.280> a<00:00:09.340> look<00:00:09.490> at<00:00:09.880> the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
and we're gonna be taking a look at the

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.109 
and we're gonna be taking a look at the
Sony<00:00:11.100> T<00:00:12.100> x10<00:00:13.769> watter<00:00:14.769> proof<00:00:15.099> video<00:00:15.670> camera

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.430 
Sony T x10 watter proof video camera
compared<00:00:16.720> to<00:00:17.109> the<00:00:17.529> sunny<00:00:18.160> TX<00:00:18.640> 20<00:00:19.260> which<00:00:20.260> is

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
compared to the sunny TX 20 which is

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.279 
compared to the sunny TX 20 which is
right<00:00:20.770> here<00:00:21.570> we're<00:00:22.570> gonna<00:00:22.690> be<00:00:22.869> comparing

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
right here we're gonna be comparing

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.930 
right here we're gonna be comparing
things<00:00:23.619> such<00:00:24.039> as<00:00:24.070> battery<00:00:25.060> life<00:00:26.490> which<00:00:27.490> from

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
things such as battery life which from

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.670 
things such as battery life which from
what<00:00:28.119> I've<00:00:28.270> seen<00:00:28.359> the<00:00:28.810> battery<00:00:29.109> life<00:00:29.320> bottom

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
what I've seen the battery life bottom

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.910 
what I've seen the battery life bottom
and<00:00:29.920> warm<00:00:30.310> weather<00:00:30.550> is<00:00:30.760> actually<00:00:30.910> really<00:00:31.330> good

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and warm weather is actually really good

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.400 
and warm weather is actually really good
can<00:00:32.920> be<00:00:33.039> up<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.219> 45<00:00:34.120> minutes<00:00:34.359> long<00:00:34.660> on<00:00:34.989> one

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
can be up to 45 minutes long on one

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.549 
can be up to 45 minutes long on one
battery<00:00:35.860> charge<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:37.570> you're<00:00:37.780> rotting<00:00:38.200> them<00:00:38.320> in

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
battery charge if you're rotting them in

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.880 
battery charge if you're rotting them in
like<00:00:39.399> colder<00:00:39.790> weather<00:00:40.079> say<00:00:41.079> we<00:00:41.350> just<00:00:41.590> went<00:00:41.739> on

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
like colder weather say we just went on

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.650 
like colder weather say we just went on
a<00:00:42.160> snowmobile<00:00:42.489> trip<00:00:42.940> when<00:00:43.120> I<00:00:43.180> was<00:00:43.300> using<00:00:43.480> on

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
a snowmobile trip when I was using on

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.479 
a snowmobile trip when I was using on
like<00:00:43.899> a<00:00:43.930> GoPro<00:00:44.469> mounted<00:00:44.829> on<00:00:44.980> top<00:00:45.219> of<00:00:45.370> my

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
like a GoPro mounted on top of my

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.060 
like a GoPro mounted on top of my
snowmobile<00:00:45.760> helmet<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:47.500> temperature<00:00:47.950> it

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
snowmobile helmet and the temperature it

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.459 
snowmobile helmet and the temperature it
was<00:00:48.129> probably<00:00:48.550> like<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:49.059> don't<00:00:49.840> know<00:00:49.899> 14

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
was probably like I don't know 14

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.100 
was probably like I don't know 14
degrees<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:51.129> we<00:00:51.219> had<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.340> cold<00:00:51.640> wind<00:00:52.110> maybe

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
degrees and we had a cold wind maybe

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.029 
degrees and we had a cold wind maybe
fifteen<00:00:53.680> degrees<00:00:53.980> something<00:00:54.309> like<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:54.730> but

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
fifteen degrees something like that but

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
fifteen degrees something like that but
anyways<00:00:57.039> is<00:00:57.219> it<00:00:57.309> really<00:00:57.520> cold<00:00:57.700> out<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.210> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
anyways is it really cold out and the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.529 
anyways is it really cold out and the
battery<00:00:59.800> life<00:01:00.010> was<00:01:00.250> actually<00:01:00.460> as<00:01:00.820> low<00:01:01.090> as<00:01:01.329> like

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
battery life was actually as low as like

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.850 
battery life was actually as low as like
10<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:01.960> maybe<00:01:02.739> 15<00:01:03.460> minutes<00:01:03.699> per<00:01:04.119> battery<00:01:04.860> if

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
10 the maybe 15 minutes per battery if

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.739 
10 the maybe 15 minutes per battery if
the<00:01:06.039> temps<00:01:06.340> got<00:01:06.490> down<00:01:06.670> colder<00:01:07.149> than<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.420> they

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:07.749 
the temps got down colder than that they

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:10.019 
the temps got down colder than that they
really<00:01:08.139> didn't<00:01:08.439> even<00:01:08.469> want<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.920> work<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:10.029 
really didn't even want to work the

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:11.609 
really didn't even want to work the
actual<00:01:10.389> camera<00:01:10.779> itself<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:11.289> know<00:01:11.350> they're

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
actual camera itself I know they're

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.769 
actual camera itself I know they're
rated<00:01:11.920> for<00:01:12.100> like<00:01:12.219> 14<00:01:12.670> degrees<00:01:12.999> but<00:01:13.359> so

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:13.779 
rated for like 14 degrees but so

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:15.510 
rated for like 14 degrees but so
basically<00:01:14.170> if<00:01:14.319> it<00:01:14.499> starts<00:01:14.829> getting<00:01:14.950> real<00:01:15.219> cold

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
basically if it starts getting real cold

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.410 
basically if it starts getting real cold
like<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:17.609> pretty<00:01:18.609> much<00:01:18.789> don't<00:01:19.119> plan<00:01:19.389> on

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
like that pretty much don't plan on

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.779 
like that pretty much don't plan on
using<00:01:19.599> I<00:01:20.020> let<00:01:20.259> it<00:01:20.349> warm<00:01:20.499> up<00:01:20.679> to<00:01:21.130> from<00:01:21.609> what<00:01:21.759> I

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
using I let it warm up to from what I

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.019 
using I let it warm up to from what I
found<00:01:22.119> at<00:01:22.359> least<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.349> mid-20s<00:01:24.099> and<00:01:24.399> then

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029 
found at least in the mid-20s and then

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:28.469 
found at least in the mid-20s and then
they<00:01:25.149> work<00:01:25.299> pretty<00:01:25.569> good<00:01:25.679> so<00:01:26.679> that's<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:28.240> part

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
they work pretty good so that's as part

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.419 
they work pretty good so that's as part
of<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.630> battery<00:01:28.869> life<00:01:29.109> goes<00:01:29.409> on<00:01:29.679> another<00:01:30.099> big

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
of the battery life goes on another big

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.870 
of the battery life goes on another big
question<00:01:30.579> a<00:01:31.119> lot<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.329> people<00:01:31.479> have<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
question a lot of people have is the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.719 
question a lot of people have is the
start<00:01:34.209> up<00:01:34.329> time<00:01:34.599> on<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.169> TX<00:01:35.799> 10<00:01:36.130> compared<00:01:36.639> to

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
start up time on the TX 10 compared to

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.339 
start up time on the TX 10 compared to
the<00:01:36.819> TX<00:01:37.149> 20<00:01:37.539> which<00:01:37.929> one<00:01:38.229> starts<00:01:39.219> up<00:01:39.520> faster<00:01:40.349> and

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:41.349 
the TX 20 which one starts up faster and

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:42.899 
the TX 20 which one starts up faster and
is<00:01:41.649> there<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.829> big<00:01:42.039> difference<00:01:42.429> between<00:01:42.549> the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
is there a big difference between the

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.129 
is there a big difference between the
two<00:01:43.169> from<00:01:44.169> what<00:01:44.349> I've<00:01:44.499> seen<00:01:44.639> unusable<00:01:45.639> though

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
two from what I've seen unusable though

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.449 
two from what I've seen unusable though
for<00:01:47.139> actual<00:01:47.469> start-up<00:01:47.889> time<00:01:48.130> there<00:01:48.429> really

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
for actual start-up time there really

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.849 
for actual start-up time there really
isn't<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:49.149> big<00:01:49.329> difference<00:01:49.479> for<00:01:50.200> start-up<00:01:50.679> time

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
isn't a big difference for start-up time

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.089 
isn't a big difference for start-up time
which<00:01:51.159> I'll<00:01:51.340> show<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.639> in<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:51.849> video<00:01:52.029> however

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.099 
which I'll show you in the video however

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:57.019 
which I'll show you in the video however
when<00:01:54.099> you<00:01:54.219> stop<00:01:54.579> recording<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.719> TX<00:01:56.109> 20

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
when you stop recording the TX 20

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:01.080 
when you stop recording the TX 20
actually<00:01:58.029> stops<00:01:59.130> faster<00:02:00.130> like<00:02:00.609> you<00:02:00.789> hit<00:02:00.969> the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
actually stops faster like you hit the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.760 
actually stops faster like you hit the
stop<00:02:01.329> button<00:02:01.359> to<00:02:01.779> stop<00:02:01.809> recording<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.679> then

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
stop button to stop recording and then

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.459 
stop button to stop recording and then
it<00:02:02.889> quits<00:02:03.189> a<00:02:03.429> lot<00:02:03.579> quicker<00:02:03.849> the<00:02:04.569> TX<00:02:04.929> 10<00:02:05.229> there

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
it quits a lot quicker the TX 10 there

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.460 
it quits a lot quicker the TX 10 there
the<00:02:05.619> lag<00:02:05.799> in<00:02:06.039> there<00:02:06.249> to<00:02:06.489> stop<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:07.899> know<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.289> lot

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
the lag in there to stop so I know a lot

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.660

20<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.300> supposed<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.780> be<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:10.959> lot<00:02:11.170> faster<00:02:11.200> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
20 is supposed to be a lot faster and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.830 
20 is supposed to be a lot faster and
stuff<00:02:12.099> like<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.459> but<00:02:12.730> from<00:02:13.030> what<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.270> see<00:02:13.599> miss

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
stuff like that but from what I see miss

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.610 
stuff like that but from what I see miss
really<00:02:14.080> not<00:02:14.610> however<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.000> TX<00:02:16.330> money<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.930> my

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
really not however the TX money in my

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.850 
really not however the TX money in my
opinion<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.400> nicer<00:02:18.970> camera<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:20.620> if<00:02:20.739> you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
opinion is a nicer camera but if you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.490 
opinion is a nicer camera but if you
have<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> TX<00:02:21.489> 10<00:02:21.819> is<00:02:22.569> there<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> reason<00:02:23.380> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
have a TX 10 is there a reason to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.070 
have a TX 10 is there a reason to
upgrade<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:24.580> really<00:02:25.030> not<00:02:25.989> from<00:02:26.380> I've<00:02:26.620> seen<00:02:28.080> as

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
upgrade not really not from I've seen as

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.770 
upgrade not really not from I've seen as
far<00:02:29.110> as<00:02:29.500> photos<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:30.160> they<00:02:30.400> both<00:02:30.610> take<00:02:30.910> pretty

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
far as photos go they both take pretty

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.510 
far as photos go they both take pretty
decent<00:02:32.230> photos<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.830> mean<00:02:32.980> they're<00:02:33.160> okay<00:02:33.459> you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
decent photos I mean they're okay you

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.550 
decent photos I mean they're okay you
know<00:02:33.760> you're<00:02:34.000> not<00:02:34.120> gonna<00:02:34.300> beat<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.569> DSLR<00:02:35.319> you're

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
know you're not gonna beat a DSLR you're

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.290 
know you're not gonna beat a DSLR you're
not<00:02:35.709> going<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.950> beat<00:02:36.130> your<00:02:36.700> more<00:02:36.940> advanced

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
not going to beat your more advanced

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.570 
not going to beat your more advanced
point-and-shoot<00:02:37.840> like<00:02:38.620> say<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.010> Canon<00:02:39.430> G

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
point-and-shoot like say the Canon G

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.040 
point-and-shoot like say the Canon G
tabs<00:02:39.910> or<00:02:40.209> stuff<00:02:40.480> like<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:42.600> however<00:02:43.600> one

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
tabs or stuff like that however one

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.220 
tabs or stuff like that however one
thing<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.410> did<00:02:44.650> notice<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.220> it's<00:02:46.030> easier<00:02:46.750> to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
thing I did notice is it's easier to

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.640 
thing I did notice is it's easier to
take<00:02:47.640> panoramic<00:02:48.640> photos<00:02:49.170> with<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.950> TX<00:02:51.400> 20<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
take panoramic photos with the TX 20 the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.120 
take panoramic photos with the TX 20 the
TX<00:02:54.010> 10<00:02:54.430> you're<00:02:55.090> moving<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.780> say<00:02:56.440> move<00:02:56.709> up<00:02:56.890> or

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
TX 10 you're moving and say move up or

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.850 
TX 10 you're moving and say move up or
down<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> little<00:02:57.640> bit<00:02:57.850> or<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:59.290> move<00:02:59.440> as<00:02:59.650> fast

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
down a little bit or don't move as fast

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.520 
down a little bit or don't move as fast
or<00:03:00.190> whatever<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.540> panoramic<00:03:02.110> photo<00:03:02.350> will

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
or whatever the panoramic photo will

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.509 
or whatever the panoramic photo will
actually<00:03:02.950> stop<00:03:03.280> early<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:05.040> whereas<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.160> TX

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
actually stop early and whereas the TX

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.690 
actually stop early and whereas the TX
Pony<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.060> more<00:03:07.330> lenient<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:08.310> allowing<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.459> to

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
Pony is more lenient and allowing you to

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.880 
Pony is more lenient and allowing you to
move<00:03:09.850> up<00:03:10.090> or<00:03:10.269> down<00:03:10.330> or<00:03:10.750> left<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.230> right<00:03:11.290> when

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
move up or down or left to right when

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
move up or down or left to right when
taking<00:03:12.370> panoramic<00:03:12.970> photos<00:03:13.380> +<00:03:14.380> TX<00:03:15.040> plenty<00:03:15.459> also

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
taking panoramic photos + TX plenty also

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.460 
taking panoramic photos + TX plenty also
lets<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.239> do<00:03:16.769> 360-degree<00:03:17.769> panoramic<00:03:18.760> photos

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
lets you do 360-degree panoramic photos

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.560 
lets you do 360-degree panoramic photos
and<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.560> don't<00:03:20.620> believe<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.310> TX<00:03:21.790> 10<00:03:22.060> has<00:03:22.299> that

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
and I don't believe that TX 10 has that

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.160 
and I don't believe that TX 10 has that
option<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:25.000> there<00:03:25.600> are<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.810> few<00:03:25.959> other

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
option so and there are a few other

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.330 
option so and there are a few other
things<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:29.049> I've<00:03:29.200> noticed<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.650> TX<00:03:29.980> 20

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
things like that I've noticed the TX 20

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.210 
things like that I've noticed the TX 20
it<00:03:30.459> does<00:03:30.640> better<00:03:30.880> job<00:03:31.239> on<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:32.680> got<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.920> cool

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
it does better job on it's got a cool

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.069 
it does better job on it's got a cool
little<00:03:33.400> like<00:03:33.670> miniature<00:03:34.150> photo<00:03:34.450> mode<00:03:34.750> where

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
little like miniature photo mode where

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.520 
little like miniature photo mode where
you<00:03:35.170> can<00:03:35.380> make<00:03:35.560> things<00:03:35.890> look<00:03:36.100> miniaturized

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
you can make things look miniaturized

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.810 
you can make things look miniaturized
just<00:03:38.530> stuff<00:03:38.739> like<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.100> like<00:03:39.310> blurring<00:03:39.700> out

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
just stuff like that like blurring out

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.920 
just stuff like that like blurring out
the<00:03:40.030> background<00:03:40.209> for<00:03:40.750> portraits<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.840> it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the background for portraits but it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.699 
the background for portraits but it
doesn't<00:03:44.200> go<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.320> I<00:03:44.440> want<00:03:44.709> all<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:44.950> stuff<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:45.609> I

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
doesn't go to I want all that stuff so I

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.330 
doesn't go to I want all that stuff so I
guess<00:03:48.840> my<00:03:49.840> overall<00:03:50.260> opinion<00:03:50.410> if<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.070> don't

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
guess my overall opinion if you don't

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.830 
guess my overall opinion if you don't
have<00:03:51.579> one<00:03:51.820> yet<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.209> you're<00:03:52.299> looking<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.690> buy

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
have one yet and you're looking to buy

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.590 
have one yet and you're looking to buy
them<00:03:52.989> on<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.440> would<00:03:54.010> recommend<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:55.829> TX<00:03:56.829> 20<00:03:57.600> but

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
them on I would recommend the TX 20 but

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.420 
them on I would recommend the TX 20 but
if<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.810> have<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.019> TX<00:03:59.470> 10<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.040> you're<00:04:00.130> looking
