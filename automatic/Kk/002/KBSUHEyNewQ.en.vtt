00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.380 
solution so you will feel this quite hot
over<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.330> surface<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:54.159> might<00:01:54.520> fear<00:01:55.090> that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
over the surface and you might fear that

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.990 
over the surface and you might fear that
actually<00:01:55.750> feeling<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.530> little<00:01:57.220> bit<00:01:57.310> more<00:01:57.700> but

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
actually feeling a little bit more but

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.969 
actually feeling a little bit more but
it<00:01:58.090> only<00:01:58.299> lasts<00:01:58.899> for<00:01:58.929> about<00:01:59.140> 1<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.710> 2<00:01:59.890> minutes

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
it only lasts for about 1 to 2 minutes

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.240 
it only lasts for about 1 to 2 minutes
just<00:02:00.750> once<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.990> finishes<00:02:02.200> drying<00:02:02.830> I'm<00:02:03.070> just

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
just once that finishes drying I'm just

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.160 
just once that finishes drying I'm just
going<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.520> protect<00:02:04.000> some<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.929> more
