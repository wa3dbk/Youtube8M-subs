00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:18.070
 This is the yellowtail Ono labyrinth game 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:21.220
 If a child goes to the 60th at the start, it will be a goal 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.730
 Right and left knobs 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:30.430
 Slowly while balancing while moving 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.150
 We not proceed with the head 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.500
 This is quite likely to fall in the middle of the hole 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:46.210
 The tsunami on the right is jammed back and forth 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:49.560
 Knob to the left front is is a knob also One move to the left and right 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.650
 I wonder if this time can go up to what number 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.300
 I have finished 4th 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:02.240
 a 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:09.370
 As long as I know, it seems that even 1st grader second grader will have 1 night to 60th 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.370
 But that's a very exceptional case, when i will be in the upper grades of elementary school 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.170
 Finally this 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.670
 It is in the game 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.790
 To the 60th heavy rain 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.970
 It is Tan carrying go 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.400
 The first barrier is usually this labor and so on 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.909
 It means that it will fall in about 10 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.690
 Because it is quite difficult 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.440
 2 sheets 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.480
 And it comes with a spare plate 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.480
 I wonder if you called a b a yo 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.580
 Goal first 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:49.490
 If this is pretty easy 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:53.030
 As you will receive this, you should do this first or do small children do this 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.860
 I think it's good 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.860
 This is pretty kind 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.830
 A little bit 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.060
 To the goal 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.009
 Let's do something a little more difficult 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.009
 A little more use is small and medium 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.850
 It has already fallen in the fourth 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:30.000
 If this is done a little more carefully then somehow 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.650
 Clear the number 21 I think I can go to the goal 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.819
 Like this 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.430
 Also with 2 beader plates 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:43.549
 It is a labyrinth game of brio 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.549
 Please try it by all means
