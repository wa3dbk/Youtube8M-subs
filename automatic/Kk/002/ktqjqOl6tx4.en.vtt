thought it was a great class and then I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
thought it was a great class and then I
was<00:00:30.960> feeling<00:00:31.470> different<00:00:32.070> muscles<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:33.180> know

trouble with the nutrition aspect of the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.000 
trouble with the nutrition aspect of the
program<00:02:21.270> has<00:02:21.660> been<00:02:21.690> huge<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.170> me<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.680> think

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
program has been huge for me I think

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.490 
program has been huge for me I think
that<00:02:23.250> was<00:02:23.430> actually<00:02:23.730> one<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.630> things<00:02:25.320> in

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
that was actually one of the things in

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.900 
that was actually one of the things in
combination<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.220> class<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:26.850> of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
combination with the class that kind of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.690 
combination with the class that kind of
took<00:02:27.090> me<00:02:27.470> over<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.830> top<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.190> where<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.640> was

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
took me over the top of where I was

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.840 
took me over the top of where I was
wanting<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.240> go<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.380> seeing<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.190> changes<00:02:32.640> in

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
wanting to go and seeing the changes in

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.720 
wanting to go and seeing the changes in
my<00:02:33.150> body<00:02:33.180> has<00:02:33.720> been<00:02:33.840> really<00:02:34.170> exciting<00:02:34.770> I'm

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
my body has been really exciting I'm

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.650 
my body has been really exciting I'm
doing<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.330> five<00:02:36.780> meals<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.560> day<00:02:37.610> which<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:39.540> me

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
doing the five meals a day which for me

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.180 
doing the five meals a day which for me
was<00:02:39.840> an<00:02:39.990> adjustment<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.740> think<00:02:41.010> that's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
was an adjustment but I think that's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.710 
was an adjustment but I think that's
really<00:02:41.580> just<00:02:41.760> made<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> huge<00:02:42.270> difference<00:02:42.450> for

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
really just made a huge difference for

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.870 
really just made a huge difference for
me<00:02:42.959> I'm<00:02:43.110> never<00:02:43.380> hungry<00:02:43.739> because<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.280> know<00:02:44.459> that

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
me I'm never hungry because I know that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.729 
me I'm never hungry because I know that
I<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.630> know<00:02:45.660> I'm<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.050> eat<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.500> little

I you know I'm going to eat a little

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.470 
I you know I'm going to eat a little
snack<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.580> know<00:02:47.670> whether<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> protein

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
snack you know whether it be a protein

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.690 
snack you know whether it be a protein
shake<00:02:48.780> or<00:02:49.080> whatever<00:02:49.590> I'm<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.370> couple<00:02:50.610> hours

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
shake or whatever I'm in a couple hours

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.460 
shake or whatever I'm in a couple hours
and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.239> get<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.510> eat<00:02:51.570> again<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.170> know<00:02:52.320> in

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
and then I get to eat again you know in

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.320 
and then I get to eat again you know in
a<00:02:52.560> couple<00:02:52.680> hours<00:02:52.830> after<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.370> which<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:53.970> just

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
a couple hours after that which is just

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.150 
a couple hours after that which is just
huge<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.870> think<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.590> has<00:02:58.620> just

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
huge and so I think that that has just

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.900 
huge and so I think that that has just
you<00:02:59.730> know<00:02:59.850> knowing<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.440> different<00:03:01.890> things<00:03:02.700> to

nutrition in combination with the the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.500 
nutrition in combination with the the
classes<00:03:58.890> has<00:03:59.160> just<00:03:59.400> made<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.150> world<00:04:00.390> of

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
classes has just made a world of

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.570 
classes has just made a world of
difference
