00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.859
 greet warmly our guests from 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.990
 dynamo dresden or year in 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.730
 our trainer frank kramer but me 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.640
 may give you the first word and order 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 her statement to the play beds 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.150
 yes that was certainly for tonight 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.280
 a very bitter pill 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.500
 that has already started with the 0 2 1 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.250
 what we ourselves in principle 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.460
 I believe in ours 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 situation is the team afterwards 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.000
 come back well 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.510
 during the first half has become 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.969
 the pressure of the forter of the represented 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.010
 and tries to move forward again 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.670
 then I'll play shortly before 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.930
 half a very good balancing opportunity 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 after the halftime we are well off the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.720
 I came in from the cabin 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.330
 the first ten minutes and then 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.950
 shoot owner in midfield and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 each way the page completely on 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.600
 of course, then ask and the stieber 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.310
 Lots of space and we have the ball then 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.390
 also shoot yourself for the good end 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.750
 then it gets hard and I still have it there 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.149
 tried with the offensive change yes 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.569
 to give the team new impetus 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.130
 but as the 0 3 1 4 so to speak with one 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.610
 clear hand play was referee 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.160
 two meters next to it is because yes had 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.150
 also the moral of the team somewhere 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.280
 broken and 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.910
 Surely he certainly led 1 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.920
 photo won too high 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.570
 but of course deserves it 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.150
 as I said for us this one quite 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.300
 bitter pill but maybe it will 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.680
 legal questions and then accordingly 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.990
 to get up again 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.190
 that is our task and we have on 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.009
 next Saturday in the home team against a 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.950
 yes, I believe a good opportunity 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:16.930
 thank you very much mister jansen frank yours 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.750
 conclusion as for this would be out 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:25.120
 really good intense game seen 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.520
 We always tried too fast 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.930
 to play the opponent goal won 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.780
 always in the position also possibilities 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.070
 to play out that phase as well 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.480
 where are they playing a bit 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.850
 calms the find that is normal only 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.820
 but always again today 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.280
 could enforce so was required 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.840
 and still we always have that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.430
 have tried too fast too 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.940
 opposing goal and variable to 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.890
 Danish goal to be always order 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.390
 We have always been Indian 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.850
 nail and have the opponent immediately 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.380
 to put pressure and were also in 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.580
 This relationship is very disciplined and 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.790
 The team simply deserves this 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.010
 always as I said in the phase 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.879
 After the halter has to be a bit hard 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.049
 have done 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.439
 We'll have it again 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.870
 worked out of the little one 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.829
 hole and came back immediately and 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.329
 I must say that I find the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.359
 simply an atmospheric game 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.689
 have just seen that too 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.750
 all around drum trees geography form 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.010
 play and the atmosphere just great 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.889
 I am pleased for the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.489
 troupe that he just always directly 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:41.560
 is beside and that I have rewarded for it 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.150
 thank you frank you have her 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:49.269
 ask the two coaches as always 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.280
 Offer young short hand signs that it 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.620
 apparently not experienced with it already 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.810
 A good way home for his guests 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.129
 a lot of experience next game and them 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.129
 even a start to the week yet
