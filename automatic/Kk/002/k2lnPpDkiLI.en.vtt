away from him yeah I think it strange is
probably<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.640> slightly<00:03:41.090> better<00:03:41.390> team<00:03:41.720> but<00:03:41.990> in

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
probably a slightly better team but in

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.750 
probably a slightly better team but in
England<00:03:42.500> they're<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:43.100> don't<00:03:43.370> think<00:03:43.400> anyone
