00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.339
 ah 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.390
 the theme of the harem which consists 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.130
 in one or a protagonist which is 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.620
 unwinds in a tight circle with 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.090
 people of the opposite gender most 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 of the times with implications 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.720
 romantic 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.000
 this formula was popularized so much and it 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.220
 it became so recurrent that it practically 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.700
 it will become a subgenre or stream of 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.280
 the romantic comedy in the anime 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.410
 in many occasions this archetype was 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.780
 used brilliantly to do the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.630
 engine of many plots and stories that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.980
 they would become true classics 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.020
 none like the attempt to incorporate 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.260
 this theme in the genre of science 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.650
 fiction 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.480
 yes veron is jay girl puppet j 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.920
 it was an anime and manga created by saturated 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.140
 kaori and his house preserve book and in 1996 this 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.120
 encourage an attempt to mix the comedy 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.950
 romantic with elements of action and 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.730
 science fiction with pretty results 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.730
 mixed 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.580
 in the 22nd century of the earth for 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.010
 combat overpopulation was devised a 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.250
 project to colonize space 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.520
 Exterior 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.590
 300 years ago one of the ships the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.920
 Mesopotamia came to this planet 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.229
 terrified but there was an accident 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.130
 there were only six survivors and 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.289
 they were all men 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.090
 we landed on this planet and now 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.789
 we are the only six survivors 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.009
 friends but tell me what you can do alone 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.950
 six people plus all of us 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.539
 we are men we can not have children that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.709
 means that ours will be the last 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.110
 generation 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.900
 wait we can reproduce them in number 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.660
 through clones men can not 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.030
 reproduce alone we faced the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.769
 extinction so we had no choice 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.950
 that create descendants through the 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.319
 cloning and genetic manipulation 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.180
 now 300 years later each person of 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.209
 All 6 states are descendants of 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 those first 6 men but as I already 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.890
 you know all the citizens of the 6 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.690
 cities are male states is because 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.319
 even the most skilled genetic manipulation 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.780
 could not produce a woman then 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.019
 We decided to produce androids machines 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.019
 with the appearance of a woman and we call them 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 puppets 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.680
 it is at this point where we know altar 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.530
 a mile an honest and hardworking young man 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.330
 of the nation leaves bread that for apparent 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.400
 chance awakens a stranger 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.470
 puppet called lime to which 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.349
 later they will continue joining other 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.690
 two puppets this trio of puppets 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.660
 have the distinction of having the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.000
 called virgin circuit or maiden the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.269
 which gives them the ability to understand and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.190
 express emotions and feelings though 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.750
 they ignore it they have the secret to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.880
 restore the female gender 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.580
 Lima is the first puppet that 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.890
 woke up they endowed somewhat hyperactive and 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.970
 relevant and cheerful looks more like a girl 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.220
 small represents cherry innocence 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.730
 is the second puppet which is 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.640
 kind calm intellectual and cultured 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.220
 represents motherhood blackberry is the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.980
 third and last puppet is the most 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.890
 strong and rough of the three represents the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.980
 virtue finally we have mitsurugi 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.190
 hanagata him in quotes best friend 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.500
 of otar in it lies in large part of the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.320
 comedy for the bizarre and exaggerated 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.450
 of the character passes most of the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.220
 time trying to get the attention of 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.110
 NATO to save it from the diabolical 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.120
 puppets that want to take it away 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.000
 as the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.009
 story or tarot and his puppets are 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.349
 will be involved in a conflict with 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.050
 other nations also with other 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.990
 puppets paying attention in several 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.669
 moral and existential dilemmas being 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.180
 a pretty dynamic story and 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.400
 entertaining the animation as well as the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.259
 Character design is pretty 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.330
 traditional in the best way 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.150
 Well, although it is not a big deployment 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.400
 technical remains fairly constant to 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.560
 throughout the series likewise the 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.289
 characters are striking and 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.270
 identifiable although there is no denying 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.479
 that we will run into several errors and 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.430
 slumps in the quality of the animation the 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.319
 music that is presented is one of the 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.050
 soundtracks better achieved in the sense 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.909
 of originality and style because the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.980
 songs were made especially 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.860
 for this anime 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.930
 the music of the opening syndics were 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.360
 interpreted by the renowned actress and 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.400
 singer I like to take who 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.490
 he also makes the voice of lime in the 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.200
 original version said songs capture 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.420
 as few the motivations and 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.820
 feelings of the characters what gives 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.860
 great value and identity 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.290
 saver marion the jay consists of 25 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.540
 episodes and given the good reception of 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.090
 this anime proceeded to draw a series 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.160
 of ovas known as gay cyber 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.350
 continuing with the trend of the ovas 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.570
 the plot lends itself to see the 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.910
 characters in varied situations and a 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.370
 so different although it is not 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.350
 precisely a spin-off story not 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.630
 is necessarily relevant to the 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.580
 main line but it complies with being 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.710
 quite entertaining and allow us 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.280
 know the events beyond 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.280
 seibert game 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.810
 a couple of years later I'll go on air 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.569
 second and last season of the saga 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.539
 saver gate under the name of saver gate 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.879
 your ex continuing the story gave 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.560
 tarot and his puppets trying to 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.319
 face the consequences of their 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.780
 actions in the first season and load 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:30.599
 with the responsibility of restoring the 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.669
 humanity in this season appear 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.039
 several family characters and others 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.470
 new those that seemed 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.970
 irrelevant take their place again 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.120
 those that promote the new 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.740
 conflict although this plot is maintained 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.110
 attached to the motivations and 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.030
 background of the characters possesses 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.030
 several gaps and you get to feel something 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.500
 loose but it compensates for it provides a 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.460
 final quite chord and conclusive 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.770
 unfortunately the second season 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.530
 suffers from a terrible slump in the field 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.050
 technical as the animation is very 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.780
 irregular and the character's design is 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.150
 very deteriorated because the faces of the 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.120
 protagonists looks simply ugly 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.980
 throwing him deformed nothing to do with the 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.130
 designs of the first season and the 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.290
 I think that this was due to the use of 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.320
 new techniques with computers for 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:24.030
 which were not yet very prepared 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.010
 silver gay is a saga that still with its 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.290
 ups and downs was quite well achieved 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.020
 taking advantage of the genres in the 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.330
 who dabbled although it is a very anime 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.390
 enjoyable I do not dare to recommend it 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:39.540
 fully because you could say 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.340
 that has not aged quite well given 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.080
 current trends in which the 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.690
 harem has leaned more towards the 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.730
 eroticism and the simple comedy so 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.529
 that maybe he does not find his place in the 

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.899
 contemporary public 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:54.119
 however, I think it's really worth the 

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:57.460
 worth giving her space to those who 

00:07:54.119 --> 00:08:02.220
 they prefer something more classic and conservative 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.220
 of spoken the jerry and I am not kawai
