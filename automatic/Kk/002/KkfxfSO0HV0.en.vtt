 from that stage comes water comes as a 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.530
 three centimeters after that water 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:44.490
 they come under mud come as there is a 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.720
 capital and then oak comes again 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.190

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:10.510
 of success to make them soft change low 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.500
 sink and costly take out change for your
