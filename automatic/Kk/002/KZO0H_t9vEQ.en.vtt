00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
like abstract steel sculpture when I I

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.470 
like abstract steel sculpture when I I
studied<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.250> then<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.430> got<00:00:46.670> more<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:47.360> more

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
studied and then I got more and more

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.820 
studied and then I got more and more
interested<00:00:47.780> in<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:49.600> in<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.780> idea<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.230> not<00:00:51.590> to

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
interested in the in the idea to not to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.690 
interested in the in the idea to not to
to<00:00:52.730> form<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.510> material<00:00:53.990> but<00:00:54.200> to<00:00:54.410> cut<00:00:55.100> single

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
to form the material but to cut single

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.490 
to form the material but to cut single
pieces<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.470> mount<00:00:57.470> them<00:00:58.360> become<00:01:02.110> I<00:01:03.110> come

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
pieces and mount them become I come

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.960 
pieces and mount them become I come
combine<00:01:04.129> them<00:01:04.460> again<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:05.200> two<00:01:06.200> forms<00:01:06.970> so

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
combine them again to two forms so

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
combine them again to two forms so
that's<00:01:08.240> why<00:01:08.570> I<00:01:08.600> think<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.590> got<00:01:09.890> into<00:01:10.990> working

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
that's why I think I got into working

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.690 
that's why I think I got into working
with<00:01:13.749> in<00:01:14.749> the<00:01:14.929> beginning<00:01:15.049> with<00:01:15.469> a<00:01:15.950> lot<00:01:16.579> of

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
with in the beginning with a lot of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.679 
with in the beginning with a lot of
found<00:01:17.030> materials<00:01:17.810> from<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.770> street<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.689> then

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
found materials from the street and then

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.770 
found materials from the street and then
but<00:01:21.469> basically<00:01:22.280> was<00:01:22.490> wooden<00:01:22.969> all<00:01:23.329> kinds<00:01:23.719> of

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
but basically was wooden all kinds of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.380 
but basically was wooden all kinds of
wood<00:01:24.939> flat<00:01:25.939> material<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.829> things<00:01:28.729> then<00:01:29.179> I

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
wood flat material so things then I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.830 
wood flat material so things then I
could<00:01:29.749> paint<00:01:30.499> or<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:30.920> could<00:01:31.429> stick<00:01:32.119> kind<00:01:32.600> of

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
could paint or I could stick kind of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.649 
could paint or I could stick kind of
images<00:01:33.380> on<00:01:33.649> or<00:01:34.069> add<00:01:34.789> some<00:01:35.390> kind<00:01:35.569> of

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
images on or add some kind of

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.660 
images on or add some kind of
information<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.469> one<00:01:37.179> I<00:01:38.380> think<00:01:39.670> one

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
information and one I think one

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.779 
information and one I think one
important<00:01:41.509> idea<00:01:41.600> was<00:01:41.960> at<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.560> beginning<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.660 

let<00:01:46.789> first<00:01:47.030> soil<00:01:47.329> I<00:01:48.069> don't<00:01:49.069> know<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.429> English

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
and then I I started to build somehow

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.770 
and then I I started to build somehow
some<00:02:10.550> some<00:02:10.970> kind<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.380> architectural

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
some some kind of architectural

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.420 
some some kind of architectural
architecture<00:02:14.780> related<00:02:15.880> sculptures

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
architecture related sculptures

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.259 
architecture related sculptures
and<00:02:17.840> containers<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.230> yeah<00:02:21.980> these<00:02:22.980> are<00:02:23.269> the

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
and containers and yeah these are the

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.580 
and containers and yeah these are the
DCA<00:02:24.659> is<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.590> second<00:02:25.980> station<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.590> let's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
DCA is the second station of this let's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.830 
DCA is the second station of this let's
say<00:02:28.769> travelling<00:02:29.250> show<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.819> goes<00:02:29.879> when<00:02:30.569> later

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
say travelling show it goes when later

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.240 
say travelling show it goes when later
to<00:02:31.079> Ghent<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.590> Belgium<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:34.319> we<00:02:34.829> could<00:02:35.040> say

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
to Ghent in Belgium and so we could say

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.369 
to Ghent in Belgium and so we could say
these<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:35.909> wheels<00:02:36.090> because<00:02:36.689> first<00:02:37.139> of<00:02:37.290> all

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
these are wheels because first of all

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.770 
these are wheels because first of all
it's<00:02:37.680> because<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:38.400> people<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.389> seen<00:02:39.629> it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
it's because we people have seen it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.890 
it's because we people have seen it
already<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.230> Oxford<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.480> 2t

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
already in Oxford and in the 2t

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.099 
already in Oxford and in the 2t
structure<00:02:43.469> in<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:44.639> Salzburg<00:02:45.269> where<00:02:45.599> it<00:02:45.900> was

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
structure in in Salzburg where it was

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.580 
structure in in Salzburg where it was
shown<00:02:46.799> for<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:47.159> first<00:02:47.189> time<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
shown for the first time but then it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.879 
shown for the first time but then it
goes<00:02:49.919> further<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.329> think<00:02:51.629> these<00:02:52.349> are<00:02:52.409> GU<00:02:52.709> in

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
goes further I think these are GU in

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.199 
goes further I think these are GU in
terms<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.310> there's<00:02:53.730> nothing<00:02:54.650> really<00:02:55.650> new

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
terms of there's nothing really new

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.710 
terms of there's nothing really new
about<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.689> things<00:02:58.349> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.430> show<00:02:59.639> it<00:03:00.510> is

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
about the things in the show it is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.209 
about the things in the show it is
something<00:03:01.019> everybody<00:03:01.500> knows<00:03:02.419> it<00:03:03.419> looks<00:03:03.719> even
