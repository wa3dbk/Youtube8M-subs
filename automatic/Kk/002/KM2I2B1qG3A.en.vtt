00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
probably on them we just don't think

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.570 
probably on them we just don't think
it's<00:02:48.520> worth<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:49.380> next<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:50.500> got<00:02:50.680> all<00:02:50.980> Jets

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
holmes now these are three good

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.890 
holmes now these are three good
receivers<00:03:00.280> but<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.610> Jets<00:03:00.850> do<00:03:01.090> not<00:03:01.390> throw<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
receivers but the Jets do not throw the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.360 
receivers but the Jets do not throw the
ball<00:03:02.080> enough<00:03:02.410> for<00:03:02.680> all<00:03:02.830> three<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.160> these<00:03:03.310> guys

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
ball enough for all three of these guys

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.610

Tony Gonzalez out there with Atlanta you
know<00:03:53.170> he<00:03:53.320> had<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.500> decent<00:03:53.860> season<00:03:54.370> but<00:03:54.730> his

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
know he had a decent season but his

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.789 
know he had a decent season but his
numbers<00:03:55.269> just<00:03:55.510> continue<00:03:56.049> to<00:03:56.110> go<00:03:56.320> down<00:03:56.350> it

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
numbers just continue to go down it

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.949

seems<00:03:57.040> year<00:03:57.310> after<00:03:57.670> year<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:58.420> with<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.690> tight

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
seems year after year and with the tight

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.080 
seems year after year and with the tight
end<00:03:59.170> position<00:03:59.230> being<00:03:59.769> so<00:04:00.190> deep<00:04:00.459> this<00:04:00.640> year<00:04:00.700> you

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
end position being so deep this year you

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.259 
end position being so deep this year you
don't<00:04:01.420> have<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.840> extragalactic<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:03.400> solace<00:04:03.820> we

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
don't have to extragalactic in solace we

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.970 
don't have to extragalactic in solace we
think<00:04:04.480> his<00:04:04.600> numbers<00:04:04.959> go<00:04:05.110> down<00:04:05.140> again<00:04:05.560> this

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
think his numbers go down again this

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.520 
think his numbers go down again this
year<00:04:06.040> we<00:04:06.400> think<00:04:06.610> he<00:04:06.730> has<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:06.880> decent<00:04:07.299> year<00:04:07.870> but

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
year we think he has a decent year but

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.860 
year we think he has a decent year but
