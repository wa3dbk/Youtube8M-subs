yellow-bellied tote but also it is a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.120

good habitat for other animals like

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.930 
good habitat for other animals like
frogs<00:03:23.550> or<00:03:24.000> dragonflies<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.459> these<00:03:26.459> kind<00:03:26.820> of

frogs or dragonflies and these kind of

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.080 
frogs or dragonflies and these kind of
habitats<00:03:27.510> are<00:03:27.840> getting<00:03:28.680> very<00:03:28.709> rare<00:03:29.310> at<00:03:29.640> other

places<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.720> Germany<00:03:31.140> they<00:03:31.680> need<00:03:32.370> these<00:03:32.640> kind

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
places in Germany they need these kind

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.290 
places in Germany they need these kind
of<00:03:33.239> tracks<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.350> survive<00:03:34.770> because<00:03:35.520> in<00:03:35.910> former

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
of tracks to survive because in former

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.229 
of tracks to survive because in former
times<00:03:36.330> they<00:03:36.870> lived<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.440> areas<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.820> rivers

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
times they lived in areas of the rivers

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.990 
times they lived in areas of the rivers
but<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.230> riverbanks<00:03:41.040> they<00:03:41.790> are<00:03:41.970> very

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
but the riverbanks they are very

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.290 
but the riverbanks they are very
regulated<00:03:42.630> in<00:03:43.110> our<00:03:43.290> time<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.040> there<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.910> toad

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
regulated in our time so there the toad

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.740 
regulated in our time so there the toad
doesn't<00:03:45.720> have<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.200> habitat<00:03:47.040> anymore<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.760> so

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
doesn't have a habitat anymore and so

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.530 
doesn't have a habitat anymore and so

the last place is where they live are

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
do for the yellow-bellied tote maybe we

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.450 
do for the yellow-bellied tote maybe we
can<00:06:25.360> have<00:06:25.630> an<00:06:25.810> ecological<00:06:26.650> tank<00:06:26.920> or<00:06:27.130> something

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
can have an ecological tank or something

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.230 
can have an ecological tank or something
like<00:06:27.610> that<00:06:27.670> creating<00:06:28.420> puddles<00:06:28.810> like<00:06:29.020> this<00:06:29.230> or

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
like that creating puddles like this or

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.990 
like that creating puddles like this or
maybe<00:06:31.240> also<00:06:31.630> we<00:06:32.200> can<00:06:32.280> convince<00:06:33.280> the<00:06:33.580> military

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
maybe also we can convince the military

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.800 
maybe also we can convince the military
trainers<00:06:34.630> to<00:06:35.020> go<00:06:35.830> more<00:06:36.100> into<00:06:36.460> the<00:06:37.000> open<00:06:37.360> areas

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810

again<00:06:37.990> military<00:06:38.980> training<00:06:39.490> areas<00:06:39.880> are

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
again military training areas are

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.200 
again military training areas are
