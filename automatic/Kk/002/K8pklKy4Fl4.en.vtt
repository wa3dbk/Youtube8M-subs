00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.779
 the tablet has a typical samsung 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.830

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.129
 bloated phone for which special thanks 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.629

 weight is also not the biggest all 320 grams 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.310
 for an 8 inch tablet this is very 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.320

 interface and applications 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.489
 but also the legs of the games with the tablet 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.280
 showed quite good results in 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.530
 8-inch screen

 small and resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.959
 which by modern standards is rather small 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.400
 the grain of the picture is clearly visible but in 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.190
 the rest of the screen is a good color rendition 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.290
 in decent viewing angle good stock 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.920

 Within the new version of the touchwiz shell 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:05.079
 for android 5 but it was saved 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.129
 many of its features shooting quality 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.129
 is on average 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.269
 in ours is clearly not the best senses but 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.580

 white and color renditions they turn out 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.480
 very good 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.970
 and the video is filmed in running resolution 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.980
