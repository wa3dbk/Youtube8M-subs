00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620
 go ahead sir in the hand on 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:15.620
 the steering wheel I regret 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.130
 you probably thought that training 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.090
 bikers of the gendarmerie can be summed up 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.420
 to road traffic 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.669
 mistake the national training center to 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.370
 road safety 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.360
 true institution since 1967 form 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 the gendarmes to all environments 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.150
 and all the technicalities besides 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
 Legendary Polygon Trail 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.530
 Today, teaching addresses 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.300
 intervention techniques 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.089
 professional adapted to 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 motorcyclists 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.640
 so I'm lieutenant colonel reno 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.960
 jean pierre I order the center 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.460
 national safety training 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.089
 road which is located in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.769
 fontainebleau 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.290
 so we do not currently find on 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.820
 the polygon site this hold of which 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.470
 who belongs to the gendarmerie 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.800
 contribute to the formation of our 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.540
 motorcyclist in the frame well beyond 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.510
 initial training in technicality 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.159
 so you currently have on the track 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.370
 Funny and the blue trail 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.250
 trainees of training f 145 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.590
 This is the 145th training course 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.159
 since the center is established in 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.860
 fontainebleau 1967 so during their 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.649
 training that lasts eleven weeks at 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 center the trainees evolves so on 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.039
 the training tracks the tracks 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.039
 special polygon training 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.479
 these tracks is actually the 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.180
 representation of a traffic lane 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.460
 of a motorcycle and he finds different 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.250
 obstacles and difficulties that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.469
 allow to apprehend skills 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.740
 which will then be returned to them on the 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.329
 road 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.070
 all in all so to see how that 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.750
 happened today is today 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.740
 the discovery of the blue trail on the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.710
 rain so 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.390
 so choose what we have 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.140
 learned and somehow with the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.170
 track he got away 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.850
 we do not at best win all 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.020
 two years 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.789
 the application of techniques and that it 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.850
 today comes back the conditions 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.450
 and bah is very formative try 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.450
 always happy 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.630
 back to the road tires the mastery of 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.880
 trajectories is also done in condition 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:36.060
 real direction the three workshops 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.840
 practices of the mastery game without weapons of 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.180
 the opponent control the bike a 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.000
 vehicle in yellow or orange code 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:53.040
 according to the dangerousness and finally control 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.140
 of a vehicle in red code so the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.230
 particularity of the red code is the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.120
 motorcycle work since we work in 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.820
 paired and dissociated on patrol 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.620
 motorcyclist so trainees 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.350
 learn as you go 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.800
 account their new tool work that 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.900
 is the motorcycle so 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.760
 motorcycle that is unstable so 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.860
 when we have to call a 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.500
 individual in red co2 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.090
 how to place the bikes according to 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.970
 the particularity of the placement of the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.660
 vehicle so this workshop is very 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.270
 important 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.480
 for this motorcycle training of 11 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.480
 weeks
