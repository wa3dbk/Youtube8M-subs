00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.809 

the<00:00:03.959> previous<00:00:04.200> chapter<00:00:04.319> we<00:00:04.740> took<00:00:05.220> our<00:00:05.430> seven

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
the previous chapter we took our seven

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.880 
the previous chapter we took our seven
different<00:00:05.940> modes<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.629> built<00:00:07.290> our<00:00:07.440> page<00:00:07.649> shows

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
different modes and built our page shows

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.430 
different modes and built our page shows
over<00:00:08.189> them<00:00:08.340> by<00:00:08.610> taking<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.179> root<00:00:09.420> third<00:00:10.410> fifth

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
over them by taking the root third fifth

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.879 
over them by taking the root third fifth
and<00:00:11.370> seventh<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.389> these<00:00:12.780> individual<00:00:13.559> scales

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
and seventh of these individual scales

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.369 
and seventh of these individual scales
to<00:00:14.549> find<00:00:14.759> out<00:00:14.880> what<00:00:15.089> type<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.299> arpeggios<00:00:15.719> or

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
to find out what type of arpeggios or

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.500 
to find out what type of arpeggios or
what<00:00:16.650> type<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.800> chords<00:00:17.369> would<00:00:18.000> work<00:00:18.240> over

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
what type of chords would work over

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.480 
what type of chords would work over
these<00:00:18.660> modes<00:00:18.900> now<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.710> time<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.980> classify

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
these modes now it's time to classify

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.490 
these modes now it's time to classify
these<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.699> little<00:00:20.939> bit<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.960> take<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.170> look<00:00:22.380> at

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
these a little bit if we take a look at

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.650 
these a little bit if we take a look at
the<00:00:22.590> chart<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.220> our<00:00:23.789> seven<00:00:24.150> different<00:00:24.269> modes

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the chart with our seven different modes

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.880 
the chart with our seven different modes
and<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.410> seven<00:00:25.859> different<00:00:26.599> chord<00:00:27.599> types<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and the seven different chord types that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.830 
and the seven different chord types that
will<00:00:29.039> work<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:29.550> them<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.449> find<00:00:30.660> some

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
will work over them we can find some

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.530 
will work over them we can find some
similarities<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:32.219> instance<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> Ionian

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
similarities for instance the Ionian

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.930 
similarities for instance the Ionian
mode<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> work<00:00:35.640> over<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
mode which it's going to work over a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.310 
mode which it's going to work over a
major<00:00:36.180> seven<00:00:36.690> chord<00:00:38.540> shares<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.690> same<00:00:39.899> type

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
major seven chord shares the same type

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
major seven chord shares the same type
of<00:00:40.350> cord<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.460> Lydian<00:00:41.820> mode<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.540> both

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
of cord as for the Lydian mode so both

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
of cord as for the Lydian mode so both
of<00:00:42.780> these<00:00:43.050> modes<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.579> built

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
of these modes are going to be built

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.209 
of these modes are going to be built
around<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.110> major<00:00:46.289> seventh<00:00:46.739> arpeggios

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
around the major seventh arpeggios

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.729 
around the major seventh arpeggios
because<00:00:48.210> bringing<00:00:48.719> them<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.110> same<00:00:49.379> route

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
because bringing them to the same route

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.189 
because bringing them to the same route
we<00:00:50.149> find<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.420> had<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> same<00:00:51.899> type<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
we find that they had the same type of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.350 
we find that they had the same type of
third<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> major<00:00:53.160> third<00:00:53.460> same<00:00:54.180> type

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
third which is a major third same type

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
third which is a major third same type
of<00:00:54.390> fifth<00:00:54.719> which<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> natural<00:00:55.440> fifth<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
of fifth which is a natural fifth and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.340 
of fifth which is a natural fifth and
same<00:00:56.309> type<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.579> seventh<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> major

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
same type of seventh which is a major

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.279 
same type of seventh which is a major
seven<00:00:59.059> that<00:01:00.059> means<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
seven that means that if you have a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.009 
seven that means that if you have a
major<00:01:01.829> seventh<00:01:02.399> chord

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.179 

you're<00:01:05.619> going<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.799> have<00:01:05.859> two<00:01:06.039> different

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
you're going to have two different

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.520 
you're going to have two different
choices<00:01:06.490> you<00:01:06.789> can<00:01:06.880> either<00:01:07.000> play<00:01:07.329> Ionian<00:01:08.320> or

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
choices you can either play Ionian or

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.080 
choices you can either play Ionian or
Lydian<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.189> let's<00:01:09.369> see<00:01:09.490> how<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.640> sounds

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
Lydian so let's see how that sounds

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.270 
Lydian so let's see how that sounds
here's<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.840> major<00:01:11.049> seventh<00:01:11.469> chord<00:01:11.530> with<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
here's the major seventh chord with the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:23.219 
here's the major seventh chord with the
Ionian<00:01:13.000> mode<00:01:20.819> and<00:01:21.819> now<00:01:21.909> if<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.210> vary<00:01:22.899> a<00:01:23.020> little

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
Ionian mode and now if I vary a little

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.289 
Ionian mode and now if I vary a little
bit<00:01:23.409> with<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.219> same<00:01:24.490> type<00:01:24.819> of<00:01:24.850> cord<00:01:25.209> I'm

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
bit with that same type of cord I'm

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:36.600 
bit with that same type of cord I'm
gonna<00:01:25.450> play<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.719> Lydian<00:01:26.049> mode<00:01:35.369> both<00:01:36.369> of<00:01:36.549> these

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
gonna play the Lydian mode both of these

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.550 
gonna play the Lydian mode both of these
modes<00:01:36.909> work<00:01:37.149> really<00:01:37.420> well<00:01:37.569> over<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:38.170> chord

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
modes work really well over that chord

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.949 
modes work really well over that chord
simply<00:01:39.549> because<00:01:40.030> they<00:01:40.329> both<00:01:40.509> share<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.810> same

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
simply because they both share the same

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.770 
simply because they both share the same
type<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.409> our<00:01:41.649> page<00:01:41.829> 0<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.209> difference<00:01:43.390> is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
type of our page 0 so the difference is

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.990 
type of our page 0 so the difference is
not<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.560> arpeggio<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.579> difference

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
not in the arpeggio the difference

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.149 
not in the arpeggio the difference
between<00:01:46.119> these<00:01:46.420> two<00:01:46.479> scales<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.799> going<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.069> be

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
between these two scales is going to be

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.279 
between these two scales is going to be
found<00:01:48.369> in<00:01:48.700> some<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.689> notes<00:01:49.899> that<00:01:50.079> are<00:01:50.110> not

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
found in some of the notes that are not

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.559 
found in some of the notes that are not
included<00:01:50.860> in<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.130> arpeggio<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:51.970> it<00:01:52.090> could<00:01:52.390> be

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
included in that arpeggio so it could be

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.279 
included in that arpeggio so it could be
the<00:01:53.049> second<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.310> fourth<00:01:54.610> or<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:54.939> sixth<00:01:55.450> the

the second the fourth or the sixth the

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.639 
the second the fourth or the sixth the
root<00:01:56.530> third<00:01:57.189> fifth<00:01:57.219> and<00:01:57.969> seventh<00:01:58.360> be<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.049> used

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
root third fifth and seventh be and used

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.850 
root third fifth and seventh be and used
already<00:02:00.209> by<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.270> arpeggio<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:02.590> that's<00:02:02.739> going

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
already by the arpeggio so that's going

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.410 
already by the arpeggio so that's going
to<00:02:02.920> be<00:02:03.009> our<00:02:03.039> first<00:02:03.340> classification<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.239> major

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
to be our first classification the major

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.389 
to be our first classification the major
seventh<00:02:04.959> have<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.349> cord<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.950> going<00:02:06.129> to<00:02:06.189> work

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
seventh have a cord is going to work

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.410 
seventh have a cord is going to work
with<00:02:07.289> Yonan<00:02:08.289> mode<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.769> deleting<00:02:09.250> mode<00:02:09.459> now

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
with Yonan mode and deleting mode now

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.539 
with Yonan mode and deleting mode now
there<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.929> second<00:02:11.620> big<00:02:11.739> category<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:12.489> the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
like for the dominant 7th category it's

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.960 
like for the dominant 7th category it's
for<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.350> Lockean<00:03:44.220> mode<00:03:44.370> which<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.850> only

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
for the Lockean mode which is the only

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.090 
for the Lockean mode which is the only
mode<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:46.140> will<00:03:46.200> be<00:03:46.440> built<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.800> run<00:03:46.950> an

arpeggio with a root minor third
diminished<00:03:50.100> fifth<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.550> mar<00:03:50.910> 7<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.709> type

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
diminished fifth in mar 7 so that type

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.280 
diminished fifth in mar 7 so that type
of<00:03:52.980> chord<00:03:53.430> minor<00:03:53.910> seventh<00:03:54.450> with<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.690> flat<00:03:54.959> fifth

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
of chord minor seventh with a flat fifth

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.220 
of chord minor seventh with a flat fifth
can<00:03:56.160> work<00:03:56.370> only<00:03:56.640> with<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.300> la<00:03:57.510> career<00:03:57.780> mode<00:03:58.020> so

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
can work only with a la career mode so

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.170 
can work only with a la career mode so
if<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.410> hear<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.800> type<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.070> cord

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
if you hear that type of cord

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.259 
if you hear that type of cord
which<00:04:01.989> is<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.400> minor<00:04:03.400> seventh<00:04:03.849> with<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> flat

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
which is a minor seventh with a flat

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.869 
which is a minor seventh with a flat
fifth<00:04:05.099> you're<00:04:06.099> going<00:04:06.219> to<00:04:06.280> have<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.519> play<00:04:06.640> la

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
fifth you're going to have to play la

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:16.680 
fifth you're going to have to play la
creme<00:04:14.879> because<00:04:15.879> that<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.299> only<00:04:16.329> mode

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
creme because that is the only mode

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.939 
creme because that is the only mode
that's<00:04:16.810> going<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.079> work<00:04:17.199> over<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.709> cord<00:04:18.840> so

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
that's going to work over that cord so

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.710 
that's going to work over that cord so
that's<00:04:20.949> our<00:04:21.160> first<00:04:21.400> step<00:04:21.579> really<00:04:21.910> in<00:04:22.360> two

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
that's our first step really in two

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.379 
that's our first step really in two
modes<00:04:22.990> really<00:04:23.889> knowing<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.370> cord<00:04:24.850> that's

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
modes really knowing the cord that's

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.279 
modes really knowing the cord that's
going<00:04:25.539> to<00:04:25.660> work<00:04:25.900> over<00:04:27.030> emotes<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.840> for<00:04:29.139> any

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
going to work over emotes so for any

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.110 
going to work over emotes so for any
given<00:04:29.410> cord<00:04:29.830> sometimes<00:04:30.340> we'll<00:04:30.520> have<00:04:30.699> several

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
given cord sometimes we'll have several

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.430 
given cord sometimes we'll have several
choices<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.919> sometimes<00:04:33.849> that<00:04:34.060> choice<00:04:34.330> is

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
choices and sometimes that choice is

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.719 
choices and sometimes that choice is
really<00:04:35.440> up<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:35.889> you're<00:04:36.310> going<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.580> really

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
really up to you you're going to really

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
just have to choose and set the mood

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.930 
just have to choose and set the mood
because<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.800> all<00:04:39.160> these<00:04:39.310> different<00:04:39.580> modes

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
because of all these different modes

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.240 
because of all these different modes
have<00:04:40.449> a<00:04:40.599> different<00:04:40.990> tone<00:04:41.229> a<00:04:41.590> different<00:04:42.099> kind

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
have a different tone a different kind

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
of quality to them that you're going to

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.469 
of quality to them that you're going to
be<00:04:43.990> able<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.349> experience<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.360> let<00:04:46.360> the

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
be able to experience and let the

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.089 
be able to experience and let the
listener<00:04:46.870> experience<00:04:47.380> as<00:04:47.560> well<00:04:47.590> and

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
listener experience as well and

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.360 
listener experience as well and
sometimes<00:04:49.020> four<00:04:50.020> chords<00:04:50.410> like<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.800> just<00:04:51.130> played

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
sometimes four chords like I just played

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.370 
sometimes four chords like I just played
you<00:04:51.849> will<00:04:52.030> just<00:04:52.180> have<00:04:52.300> choices<00:04:53.050> especially

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
you will just have choices especially

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.920 
you will just have choices especially
the<00:04:53.919> court<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.310> very<00:04:54.520> long<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.270> last<00:04:55.599> for<00:04:55.900> a

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
the court is very long and last for a

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.650 
the court is very long and last for a
long<00:04:56.740> period<00:04:57.009> of<00:04:57.190> time<00:04:57.250> if<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.240> have<00:04:58.389> several

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
long period of time if you have several

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.350 
long period of time if you have several
chords<00:04:59.169> however<00:04:59.590> the<00:05:00.490> choice<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.120> going<00:05:01.300> to

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
chords however the choice is going to

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.480 
chords however the choice is going to
narrow<00:05:01.570> down<00:05:01.720> because<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.560> more<00:05:02.800> chords<00:05:03.340> you

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
narrow down because the more chords you

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.790 
narrow down because the more chords you
get<00:05:03.699> in<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:03.940> chord<00:05:04.180> progression<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.560> less

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
get in a chord progression the less

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.950 
get in a chord progression the less
livet<00:05:06.639> are<00:05:06.729> you<00:05:06.849> going<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.120> have<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.510> add<00:05:07.659> extra

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
livet are you going to have to add extra

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.600 
livet are you going to have to add extra
notes<00:05:08.440> so<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.639> more<00:05:09.820> chords<00:05:10.300> means<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:12.430> less

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
notes so the more chords means the less

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.300 
notes so the more chords means the less
choices<00:05:12.880> once<00:05:13.389> again<00:05:13.539> and<00:05:13.949> that<00:05:14.949> probably

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
choices once again and that probably

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.279 
choices once again and that probably
means<00:05:15.580> that<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.060> key<00:05:16.240> is<00:05:16.270> already<00:05:16.690> set<00:05:16.990> and

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
means that the key is already set and

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.050 
means that the key is already set and
we're<00:05:17.770> going<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:17.949> learn<00:05:18.099> how<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:18.430> do<00:05:18.639> that<00:05:18.849> by

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
we're going to learn how to do that by

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.020 
we're going to learn how to do that by
taking<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.510> look<00:05:19.780> at<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:21.430> notes<00:05:21.699> that<00:05:22.000> are

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
taking a look at the notes that are

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.600 
taking a look at the notes that are
going<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.300> characterize<00:05:23.080> each<00:05:23.380> modes<00:05:23.919> in

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
going to characterize each modes in

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.070 
going to characterize each modes in
other<00:05:24.789> words<00:05:24.970> if<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.240> take<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.630> first<00:05:25.870> category

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
other words if I take the first category

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.830 
other words if I take the first category
which<00:05:27.039> was<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.639> major<00:05:27.820> seventh<00:05:28.270> category<00:05:28.690> we

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
which was the major seventh category we

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.659 
which was the major seventh category we
have<00:05:28.960> two<00:05:29.169> different<00:05:29.260> modes<00:05:29.590> in<00:05:29.800> there<00:05:29.949> ionian

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
have two different modes in there ionian

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.839 
have two different modes in there ionian
and<00:05:30.849> Lydian<00:05:31.840> they<00:05:32.380> both<00:05:32.560> share<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.860> same<00:05:32.979> root

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
and Lydian they both share the same root

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.469 
and Lydian they both share the same root
third<00:05:34.750> fifth<00:05:34.949> and<00:05:35.949> seven<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.970> difference

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
third fifth and seven the difference

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.850 
third fifth and seven the difference
between<00:05:37.810> these<00:05:37.930> two<00:05:37.990> modes<00:05:38.349> is<00:05:38.620> going<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.800> be

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
between these two modes is going to be

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.710 
between these two modes is going to be
somewhere<00:05:39.220> else<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.849> we're<00:05:40.330> going<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:40.539> take<00:05:40.659> a

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
somewhere else and we're going to take a

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.409 
somewhere else and we're going to take a
look<00:05:40.990> at<00:05:41.289> that<00:05:41.789> specifically<00:05:42.789> in<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.150> next

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419
