through<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> night<00:00:27.210> Sunday<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.470> looks

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
through the night Sunday so this looks

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.800 
through the night Sunday so this looks
to<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> very<00:00:29.070> long<00:00:29.519> duration<00:00:29.760> snow<00:00:30.420> event

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
to be a very long duration snow event

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.740 
to be a very long duration snow event

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and blowing and drifting snow looks to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.680 
and blowing and drifting snow looks to
also<00:00:34.110> become<00:00:34.230> an<00:00:34.469> issue<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:35.250> later<00:00:36.120> Sunday

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
also become an issue here later Sunday

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.500 
also become an issue here later Sunday

and during the evening as well Sunday

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
and during the evening as well Sunday
and<00:00:40.230> possibility<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> low<00:00:41.370> visibilities<00:00:42.090> with

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
especially across open areas the latest

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
snow totals which these numbers are

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
snow totals which these numbers are
bound<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> change<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.239> closer<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
system but it looks like the highest

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
system but it looks like the highest
amounts<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:55.920> fall<00:00:56.340> roughly<00:00:56.789> along<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
