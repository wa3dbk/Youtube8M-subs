00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.070
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.539
 crocker here we are in a new video 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.209
 news today accompanies me heimerdinger 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.460
 to talk a little about the same 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.779
 of the visual improvement he has received and 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.400
 We will also talk a little about what 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.350
 is what we are going to expect during this 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.810
 week and what we can possibly see 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.759
 on the server pp and then we will go to 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.990
 talk about the rigor of the skills of 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.880
 dyn house that have also been 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.429
 modified the particles so 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.020
 let's start with heimerdinger on the day of 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.790
 today inside the server pp have 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.829
 updated the animation of heimerdinger 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.690
 when using the enchantment for 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.340
 boots safe you know that 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.350
 enchantment that for eight seconds 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.810
 that grants extra movement speed 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.280
 when leaving base we know almost all 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.870
 the visual and new updates 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.970
 champions and to receive an animation 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.010
 exclusive when your speed is altered 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.750
 of movement therefore here we have 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.760
 the one of jim erdinger fix you there we are 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.380
 seeing since he uses the rocket that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.120
 it comes out of the dinger head I think it 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.500
 called the rocket good are small 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.440
 details that you give them a touch 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.180
 more fun to the game and about the wait 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.189
 of updates within the server 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.229
 pp this week I think they will come 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.970
 enough things like for example the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.380
 history of heimerdinger that has been 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.220
 completely modified and that 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.780
 we will review 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.700
 to see if it has any interaction or 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.170
 appearance of some other champion already 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.720
 you know what he likes river of the subject of 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.030
 the spoilers we can also possibly 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.280
 see a voice modification let see 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.900
 dinger anyway is something that is not 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.790
 official since in English it has already been 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.830
 modified but does not mean that in 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.020
 Spanish we have changes, however 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.570
 we will be attentive another of the things that 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.980
 maybe we will see an update of the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.840
 It is the main square of Heimerdinger 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.940
 considering that a few months ago 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.200
 received changes in skills and a 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.540
 recent visual update 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.280
 currently what better time to 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.960
 add the new one is square because the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.210
 truth is that the one that is currently is 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.979
 pretty horrible like 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.600
 very many to move that out there that I 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.479
 I think they should change them 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.280
 because he has a crime last during 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.250
 this week maybe we see the splash are 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.190
 of varus arctic operation this skin that 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.110
 It will cost about 975 riot point and not yet 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.270
 We have an exit date to 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.070
 then let's see the rewalk of 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.900
 bean house good you know that I never 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.640
 like to talk about changes in champions 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.500
 inside the server because you know what 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.970
 good rivers and often modifies 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.340
 the odd champion and then neither 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.470
 it even comes to light is simply what 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.210
 they put back as 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.860
 so good in this case I'm going to do 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.440
 an exception since it has also received 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.060
 changes within the particles and some 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.380
 important change the skills well 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.420
 that we're going to start with the skills 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.850
 and we will also see a little bit 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.160
 the particles start with the passive 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.110
 house and you do not get a 15% reduction 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.030
 of magical damage and ignores collisions 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.710
 with units on the passive no longer 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.900
 transforms magical damage into speed 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.730
 of attack the q receives a remarkable change 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.860
 now it does not silence but of all 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.630
 forms interrupts the channeling by 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.000
 example would cancel the ultimate ekatarina 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.650
 now by not silencing it gives us a 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.290
 magic reduction shield for two 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.380
 seconds the shield increases up to 6% 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.510
 of the current mana at the highest level the w no 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.550
 Mana cost inflicts mind damage points 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.860
 more a percent of the current sea 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.800
 as magical damage the next attack 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.750
 basic scale with ap and restores 10% 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.360
 of missing mana triples with 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.340
 champions and involves damage and slows down 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.810
 for three seconds to the enemies that 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.630
 they are in a cone in front of home 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.330
 dyn the air and inflicts magic damage plus a 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.670
 6% of total mana at maximum level at 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.959
 enemy units nearby each new 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.610
 use in the next eight seconds 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.640
 increases mana cost 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.860
 cumulative points up to 10 times good 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.570
 up to here the home rewalk dyn la 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.580
 truth is that I think they have to 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.500
 work much more in the seems to be 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.210
 that already have enough changes 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.890
 there are things that convince them there are things 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.880
 that does not convince them so good 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.590
 truth is that they have to do something 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.960
 because he is the most banned champion inside 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.460
 of the start we will be attentive either 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.050
 I want to talk a lot about the time 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.880
 because you already know that even the next 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.650
 week or within a month can be 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.840
 completely different changes that already 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.550
 did not have the shield that now silences 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.709
 all the skills who knows is a 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.240
 example go so well I hope that you 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.280
 have liked the video we will be attentive 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.020
 to all the news for all this already 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.370
 you know what your channel is by the way 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.959
 can you follow me on twitter at 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.850
 kata crocker I hope you liked it 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.850
 and see you in the next goodbye
