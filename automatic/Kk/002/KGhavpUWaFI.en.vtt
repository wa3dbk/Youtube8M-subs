00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.350 

so<00:00:56.450> what<00:00:56.630> I'm<00:00:56.750> using<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:57.200> waste<00:00:57.500> vegetable<00:00:57.739> oil

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
so what I'm using is waste vegetable oil

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.090 
so what I'm using is waste vegetable oil
and<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.690> use<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.079> you<00:01:00.200> have<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.470> use<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.620> diesel

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
and to use that you have to use a diesel

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.780 
and to use that you have to use a diesel
a<00:01:01.250> car<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.270> has<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.420> diesel<00:01:02.660> engine<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:04.640> this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
a car that has a diesel engine so this

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.340 
a car that has a diesel engine so this
is<00:01:04.940> oil<00:01:05.119> if<00:01:05.300> waiting<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:05.659> get<00:01:05.750> filtered<00:01:06.020> and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
is oil if waiting to get filtered and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.539 
is oil if waiting to get filtered and
this<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.590> my<00:01:06.740> filtering<00:01:07.190> setup

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.569 

only<00:01:11.329> electric<00:01:11.840> bills<00:01:12.229> was<00:01:13.159> running<00:01:13.490> about

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
only electric bills was running about

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.880 
only electric bills was running about
anywhere<00:01:14.149> from<00:01:14.420> like<00:01:14.570> six<00:01:14.929> to<00:01:15.109> seven<00:01:15.590> maybe

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
anywhere from like six to seven maybe

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.279 
anywhere from like six to seven maybe
even<00:01:16.189> eight<00:01:16.340> grand<00:01:16.670> on<00:01:16.759> one<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.289> believe

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
even eight grand on one I believe

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.149 
even eight grand on one I believe
there's<00:01:18.649> like<00:01:19.179> 330<00:01:20.179> panels<00:01:20.719> so<00:01:21.560> with<00:01:22.009> the
