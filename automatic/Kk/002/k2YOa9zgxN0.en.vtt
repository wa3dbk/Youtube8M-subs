00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you see here is the scan data it's a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.410 
you see here is the scan data it's a
very<00:02:37.560> rough<00:02:37.860> very<00:02:38.160> crude<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.300> is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
very rough very crude and this is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.330 
very rough very crude and this is
actually<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> software<00:02:40.470> where<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:40.950> go<00:02:41.160> in

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
actually a software where you can go in

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.460 
actually a software where you can go in
and<00:02:41.490> actually<00:02:41.670> sculpt<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.480> clay<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.290> then

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
and actually sculpt the clay and then

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.960 
and actually sculpt the clay and then
take<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:43.830> computer<00:02:44.190> hook<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.580> up<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.760> another

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
take that computer hook it up to another

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.970 
take that computer hook it up to another
machine<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.360> kicks<00:02:45.720> out<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.080> wax<00:02:46.290> head<00:02:46.590> but

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
machine that kicks out a wax head but

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.380 
machine that kicks out a wax head but
there's<00:02:47.610> something<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.300> don't

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
there's something that just don't

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
translate very well like hair and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.280 
translate very well like hair and
wrinkles<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.270> clothes<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.140> don't

where the clay comes in
it's<00:02:54.840> called<00:02:55.020> cast<00:02:55.290> lean<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.160> mix

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
it's called cast lean it's like a mix

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.500

that can heat it with the torch

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.260 
that can heat it with the torch
and<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.570> gets<00:03:03.660> hot<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.110> like<00:03:04.410> melt<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> wax

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
and it gets hot and like melt the wax

and it gets hot and like melt the wax
this<00:03:06.270> wax<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.660> hard<00:03:06.840> enough<00:03:06.990> that<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.260> can

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380
