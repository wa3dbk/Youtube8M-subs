00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.699 
running the course and actually running
against<00:03:09.190> like<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> man<00:03:09.700> on<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:10.000> man<00:03:10.329> but<00:03:10.709> you

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
against like a man on a man but you

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:12.900 
against like a man on a man but you
obviously<00:03:11.799> i<00:03:12.100> think<00:03:12.310> that's<00:03:12.430> an<00:03:12.519> incredible

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
obviously i think that's an incredible

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.280 
obviously i think that's an incredible
time<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.360> would<00:03:13.510> be<00:03:13.540> pretty<00:03:13.750> special<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.260> be

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
time it would be pretty special to be

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.319 
time it would be pretty special to be
dead<00:03:14.590> but<00:03:14.739> i<00:03:14.799> think<00:03:15.010> that's<00:03:15.190> really<00:03:15.670> very<00:03:16.060> far

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
dead but i think that's really very far

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.569 
dead but i think that's really very far
to<00:03:16.510> back<00:03:16.630> my<00:03:16.840> mind<00:03:17.250> you've<00:03:18.250> got<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.459> have<00:03:18.549> a

was able to ease off yeah I was pretty

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.050

lucky<00:03:52.710> that<00:03:52.890> had<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.190> bit<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.490> lead<00:03:53.640> am<00:03:53.850> I

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
lucky that had a bit of a lead am I

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.220 
lucky that had a bit of a lead am I
don't<00:03:54.210> know<00:03:54.270> how<00:03:54.360> much<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.930> could<00:03:55.110> have

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
don't know how much I that could have

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.230 
don't know how much I that could have
questions<00:03:55.710> obviously<00:03:55.890> my<00:03:56.760> first<00:03:56.970> hundred

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
questions obviously my first hundred

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.450 
questions obviously my first hundred
miles<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.840> my<00:03:57.990> quotes<00:03:58.260> were<00:03:58.650> pretty<00:03:58.890> shot<00:03:59.160> and

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
miles so my quotes were pretty shot and

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.280 
miles so my quotes were pretty shot and
I<00:03:59.940> think<00:04:00.390> actually<00:04:00.540> coming<00:04:00.900> some<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
I think actually coming some of the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.780 
I think actually coming some of the
training<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.710> did<00:04:01.860> up<00:04:01.950> here<00:04:01.980> before<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.460> race<00:04:02.610> I

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
training I did up here before the race I

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.970 
training I did up here before the race I
might<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.060> done<00:04:03.180> too<00:04:03.390> many<00:04:03.980> high-intensity

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
might have done too many high-intensity

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.440 
might have done too many high-intensity
sessions<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.820> think<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.060> actually<00:04:06.150> might

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
sessions and I think I actually might

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.590 
sessions and I think I actually might
have<00:04:06.570> battled<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.050> recover<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:07.530> remember<00:04:08.600> but

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
have battled to recover so remember but

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.140 
have battled to recover so remember but
30<00:04:10.470> miles<00:04:11.040> into<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.490> race<00:04:11.580> my<00:04:11.790> legs<00:04:12.000> are

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
30 miles into the race my legs are

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.760 
30 miles into the race my legs are
really<00:04:12.300> quite<00:04:12.570> sore<00:04:12.870> because<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.320> was<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> little

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
really quite sore because I was a little

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.260 
really quite sore because I was a little
bit<00:04:13.890> but<00:04:14.160> words<00:04:14.520> had<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.820> dig<00:04:15.000> pretty<00:04:15.030> deep

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
bit but words had to dig pretty deep

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.509 
bit but words had to dig pretty deep
that<00:04:15.630> day<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.080> y'all<00:04:16.830> definitely<00:04:17.250> kind<00:04:17.459> of

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
that day and y'all definitely kind of

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.610 
that day and y'all definitely kind of
trashed<00:04:18.209> my<00:04:18.390> legs<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.690> bit<00:04:18.810> side<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.170> yes<00:04:19.410> did

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
trashed my legs a bit side if yes did

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.380 
trashed my legs a bit side if yes did
slowed<00:04:19.890> down<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.130> lot<00:04:20.340> towards<00:04:20.790> in<00:04:20.970> with<00:04:21.180> lucky

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
slowed down a lot towards in with lucky

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.940 
slowed down a lot towards in with lucky
a<00:04:21.540> header<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:22.350> leave<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.800> definitely

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
a header and leave but I definitely

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.790 
a header and leave but I definitely
think<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.400> year<00:04:23.610> you're<00:04:24.510> ordered<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.590> bag

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
think this year you're ordered to to bag

think this year you're ordered to to bag
the<00:04:25.950> windy<00:04:26.220> or<00:04:26.280> definitely<00:04:26.820> given<00:04:27.720> said<00:04:27.960> front

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
left to be running a bit quicker than

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.120 
left to be running a bit quicker than
what<00:04:29.940> i<00:04:29.970> did<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.300> 2011<00:04:30.990> yeah<00:04:31.260> whatever<00:04:32.040> you

what i did in 2011 yeah whatever you

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.500 
what i did in 2011 yeah whatever you
change<00:04:32.430> with<00:04:32.700> your<00:04:32.850> training<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.330> said

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
change with your training and you said

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.640 
change with your training and you said
it<00:04:33.600> was<00:04:33.690> your<00:04:33.720> first<00:04:33.900> time<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.200> your<00:04:34.290> quads<00:04:34.500> or

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
it was your first time of your quads or

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.870 
it was your first time of your quads or
shot<00:04:34.830> would<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.070> be<00:04:35.130> done<00:04:35.280> differently<00:04:35.430> for

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
shot would it be done differently for

I<00:04:46.080> haven't<00:04:46.290> done<00:04:46.470> too<00:04:46.590> many<00:04:46.770> high-intensity

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
I haven't done too many high-intensity

a the fairly non-aggressive group the
standard<00:06:01.510> yeah<00:06:01.810> just<00:06:02.050> an<00:06:02.290> it's<00:06:02.440> down<00:06:02.620> at<00:06:02.740> once
