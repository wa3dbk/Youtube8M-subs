00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.970
 to play well on the deo is this 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.019
 dialing and making microseconds will do 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.410
 well at its perfect and me trying 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.810
 make a macro now here we have 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.970
 a time in two hours to three hours I left 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.750
 to type a boring message of the cabal 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:37.020
 and this macro is to move from the channel and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.250
 logan another channel for after two 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.060

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.530
 message and continue the process of 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.810
 always employing myself.
