you<00:02:32.340> know<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.670> isn't<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.150> adult<00:02:33.540> collectors

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
you know this isn't for adult collectors

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.860 
you know this isn't for adult collectors
or<00:02:34.319> serious<00:02:35.269> collectors<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.359> know<00:02:36.420> who<00:02:36.720> want

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
or serious collectors you know who want

the<00:02:36.989> main<00:02:37.140> line<00:02:37.349> toys<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.159> like<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.849> because

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the main line toys but I like it because

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.610 
the main line toys but I like it because
I<00:02:39.269> guess<00:02:39.540> America<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.109> not<00:02:40.260> going<00:02:40.439> to<00:02:40.500> be

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
I guess America is not going to be

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.500 
I guess America is not going to be
getting<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:41.040> deluxe<00:02:41.189> class<00:02:41.609> lockdown<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
getting the deluxe class lockdown so you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.910 
getting the deluxe class lockdown so you
know<00:02:42.720> might<00:02:42.959> as<00:02:42.989> well<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.319> go<00:02:43.470> with<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.769> guy

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
know might as well just go with this guy

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.140 
know might as well just go with this guy
because<00:02:44.099> he<00:02:44.220> still<00:02:44.400> looks<00:02:44.609> pretty<00:02:44.700> cool<00:02:45.030> in

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
because he still looks pretty cool in

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.129 
because he still looks pretty cool in
robot<00:02:45.480> mode<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.690> think<00:02:47.000> anyway<00:02:48.000> so

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
robot mode I think anyway so

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.270 
robot mode I think anyway so
transformation<00:02:49.139> is<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.319> little<00:02:49.680> bit<00:02:49.829> tricky

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
transformation is a little bit tricky

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.170 
transformation is a little bit tricky
depending<00:02:50.879> on<00:02:50.970> how<00:02:51.150> well<00:02:51.329> you're<00:02:51.569> at<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:52.260> this

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
depending on how well you're at at this

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.789 
depending on how well you're at at this
but<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.450> what<00:02:54.599> you<00:02:54.720> want<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.959> do<00:02:55.019> first<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.500> come

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
but so what you want to do first is come

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.129 
but so what you want to do first is come
back<00:02:55.950> here<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.489> untap<00:02:56.909> these<00:02:57.150> point<00:02:57.540> sections

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
back here and untap these point sections

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.849 
back here and untap these point sections
and<00:02:58.739> then<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.370> want<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.579> split<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.680> arms<00:03:01.680> out

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
and then you want to split the arms out

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.339 
and then you want to split the arms out
basically<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:03.420> want<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.689> rotate<00:03:03.870> him

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
basically and you want to rotate him

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.030 
basically and you want to rotate him
forward<00:03:04.829> like<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.810> twice<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.290> mine<00:03:07.829> don't

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
forward like this twice and mine don't

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.309 
forward like this twice and mine don't
always<00:03:09.030> work<00:03:09.239> well<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.569> sometimes<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.139> does

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
always work well but sometimes it does

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.110 
always work well but sometimes it does
so<00:03:10.590> don't<00:03:10.889> expect<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.519> work<00:03:11.549> every<00:03:11.970> single

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
so don't expect it to work every single

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.030 
so don't expect it to work every single
time<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:12.689> do<00:03:12.959> not<00:03:13.109> go<00:03:13.409> more<00:03:13.620> than<00:03:13.650> two<00:03:14.010> times

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
time but do not go more than two times

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.449 
time but do not go more than two times
unless<00:03:14.670> your<00:03:14.879> figure<00:03:15.180> screwed<00:03:15.569> up<00:03:15.889> so<00:03:16.889> here<00:03:17.370> we

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
unless your figure screwed up so here we

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.930 
unless your figure screwed up so here we
go<00:03:17.489> one<00:03:18.949> crap<00:03:20.510> too<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.889> my<00:03:23.280> head<00:03:23.519> doesn't

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
go one crap too and my head doesn't

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.819 
go one crap too and my head doesn't
always<00:03:24.299> flip<00:03:24.599> up<00:03:24.780> for<00:03:25.079> me<00:03:25.199> which<00:03:25.349> is<00:03:25.379> kind<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.769> a

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
always flip up for me which is kind of a

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.330 
always flip up for me which is kind of a
bummer<00:03:26.480> but<00:03:27.480> I'll<00:03:28.379> just<00:03:28.590> I'll<00:03:28.799> flip<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.099> up<00:03:29.220> on

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
bummer but I'll just I'll flip it up on

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.750 
bummer but I'll just I'll flip it up on
my<00:03:29.459> own<00:03:30.139> some<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.530> since<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:32.069> has<00:03:32.310> given<00:03:32.489> me

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
my own some and since this has given me

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.470 
my own some and since this has given me
a<00:03:32.790> couple<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.209> troubles<00:03:34.489> sometimes<00:03:35.489> like<00:03:35.699> I

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
a couple of troubles sometimes like I

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.869 
a couple of troubles sometimes like I
hate<00:03:37.169> it<00:03:37.379> when<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.530> happens<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:38.159> i<00:03:38.459> think<00:03:38.730> my

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
hate it when that happens I i think my

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.909 
hate it when that happens I i think my
figure<00:03:39.239> has<00:03:39.449> to<00:03:39.599> be<00:03:39.690> rotated<00:03:40.199> three<00:03:40.409> times<00:03:40.650> for

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
figure has to be rotated three times for

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.159 
figure has to be rotated three times for
it<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.099> work<00:03:41.220> right<00:03:41.659> otherwise<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.840> head<00:03:43.019> just

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
it to work right otherwise the head just

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.589 
it to work right otherwise the head just
don't<00:03:43.379> want<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.620> come<00:03:43.769> down<00:03:43.949> on<00:03:44.010> them<00:03:44.599> but

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
don't want to come down on them but

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.240 
don't want to come down on them but
anyway<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:45.959> then<00:03:46.229> you<00:03:46.319> flip<00:03:46.530> these<00:03:46.650> panels<00:03:47.069> up

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
anyway so then you flip these panels up

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.069 
anyway so then you flip these panels up
and<00:03:47.489> then<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.729> hands<00:03:48.120> come<00:03:48.359> out<00:03:48.389> and<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:48.900> you

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
and then the hands come out and then you

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.149 
and then the hands come out and then you
can<00:03:49.199> just<00:03:49.319> get<00:03:49.530> his<00:03:49.620> arms<00:03:49.889> in<00:03:49.979> whatever

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
can just get his arms in whatever

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.330 
can just get his arms in whatever
position<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:51.139> there<00:03:52.139> you<00:03:52.530> have<00:03:52.560> a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
position and there you have a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.390 
position and there you have a
transformers<00:03:54.329> age<00:03:54.479> of<00:03:54.659> extinction<00:03:55.250> flip<00:03:56.250> and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
transformers age of extinction flip and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.509 
transformers age of extinction flip and
change<00:03:56.639> lock<00:03:56.970> down<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.389> his<00:03:57.510> robot<00:03:57.840> mode<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.519> I

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
change lock down in his robot mode and I

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.719 
change lock down in his robot mode and I
love<00:04:00.449> this<00:04:00.750> robot<00:04:01.169> mode<00:04:01.379> I<00:04:01.620> don't<00:04:02.040> know<00:04:02.129> why<00:04:02.340> I

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
love this robot mode I don't know why I

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.240 
love this robot mode I don't know why I
ain't<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.359> new<00:04:03.479> a<00:04:03.510> fan<00:04:03.989> at<00:04:04.229> all<00:04:04.349> really<00:04:04.949> of<00:04:05.099> these

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
ain't a new a fan at all really of these

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.830 
ain't a new a fan at all really of these
simplified<00:04:05.760> transformers<00:04:06.419> but<00:04:06.599> there's<00:04:06.780> just

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
simplified transformers but there's just

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.860 
simplified transformers but there's just
something<00:04:07.379> about<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.799> dude<00:04:07.979> that<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.220> like

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
something about this dude that I like

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.780 
something about this dude that I like
well<00:04:09.870> it's<00:04:10.049> mainly<00:04:10.409> probably<00:04:11.069> because<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:11.459> the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
well it's mainly probably because of the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.649 
well it's mainly probably because of the
sheer<00:04:12.239> size<00:04:13.250> well<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:14.400> he's<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.180> size<00:04:15.419> of<00:04:15.599> a

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
sheer size well it's he's the size of a

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.860 
sheer size well it's he's the size of a
leader<00:04:15.870> class<00:04:16.139> toy<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:17.150> for<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> comparison

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
leader class toy and for a comparison

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.760 
leader class toy and for a comparison
actually<00:04:19.470> here's<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.310> lockdown<00:04:20.909> and<00:04:21.590> here<00:04:22.590> is

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
actually here's the lockdown and here is

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.510 
actually here's the lockdown and here is
leader<00:04:23.190> class<00:04:23.460> Optimus<00:04:23.760> Prime<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:26.130> standing

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
leader class Optimus Prime so standing

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.620 
leader class Optimus Prime so standing
side<00:04:26.789> by<00:04:26.820> side<00:04:27.210> there

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
side by side there

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.410 
side by side there
roughly<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.080> exact<00:04:28.440> same<00:04:28.710> size<00:04:29.180> lockdown<00:04:30.180> is

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
roughly the exact same size lockdown is

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.690 
roughly the exact same size lockdown is
just<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.900> tad<00:04:31.200> bit<00:04:31.230> shorter<00:04:32.010> than<00:04:32.040> Optimus

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
just a tad bit shorter than Optimus

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.850 
just a tad bit shorter than Optimus
Prime<00:04:32.940> by<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.330> head<00:04:33.660> but<00:04:34.350> other<00:04:34.560> than<00:04:34.770> that

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
Prime by the head but other than that

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.850 
Prime by the head but other than that
he's<00:04:35.400> basically<00:04:35.910> a<00:04:36.060> leader<00:04:36.510> class<00:04:36.840> toy<00:04:37.170> almost

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
he's basically a leader class toy almost

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.790 
he's basically a leader class toy almost
only<00:04:38.190> super<00:04:38.640> super<00:04:39.060> simple<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:40.470> for<00:04:40.680> me<00:04:40.770> I

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
only super super simple so for me I

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.470 
only super super simple so for me I
really<00:04:41.160> honestly<00:04:41.460> just<00:04:41.820> consider<00:04:42.210> him<00:04:42.450> my

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
really honestly just consider him my

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.950 
really honestly just consider him my
leader<00:04:42.960> class<00:04:43.230> lockdown<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.960> his

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
leader class lockdown and his

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.150 
leader class lockdown and his
articulation<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:47.340> very<00:04:47.910> very<00:04:48.330> very<00:04:48.750> limited

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
articulation is very very very limited

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.680 
articulation is very very very limited
like<00:04:50.160> not<00:04:50.400> because<00:04:50.880> there's<00:04:51.090> nothing<00:04:51.270> going

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
like not because there's nothing going

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.110 
like not because there's nothing going
on<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.500> just<00:04:52.710> because<00:04:53.040> of<00:04:53.220> how<00:04:53.400> stiff

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
on but it's just because of how stiff

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.350 
on but it's just because of how stiff
the<00:04:54.150> figure<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:54.900> for<00:04:55.380> from<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.100> gimmick<00:04:56.430> so

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
the figure is for from the gimmick so

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.720 
the figure is for from the gimmick so
his<00:04:57.630> articulation<00:04:57.990> as<00:04:58.800> these<00:04:59.160> little<00:04:59.430> panels

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
his articulation as these little panels

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.880 
his articulation as these little panels
up<00:04:59.880> here<00:05:00.090> can<00:05:00.270> move<00:05:00.450> due<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.170> transformation

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
up here can move due to transformation

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.560 
up here can move due to transformation
had<00:05:02.670> moves<00:05:02.910> up<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.210> down<00:05:03.270> due<00:05:03.540> to

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
had moves up and down due to

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.620 
had moves up and down due to
transformation<00:05:04.460> arms<00:05:05.460> can<00:05:05.670> bend<00:05:05.940> right<00:05:06.180> here

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
transformation arms can bend right here

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.210 
transformation arms can bend right here
and<00:05:06.810> bend<00:05:07.470> back<00:05:07.820> down<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:09.710> his<00:05:10.710> hands<00:05:10.980> can

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
and bend back down and his hands can

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.220 
and bend back down and his hands can
move<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.580> were<00:05:11.820> due<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.270> transformation<00:05:13.020> and

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
move and were due to transformation and

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.340 
move and were due to transformation and
that<00:05:13.530> is<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:15.450> know<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.870> really<00:05:16.230> don't

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
that is it and you know I really don't

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.870 
that is it and you know I really don't
mind<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.860> fact<00:05:17.040> that<00:05:17.190> he<00:05:17.340> don't<00:05:17.520> have<00:05:17.640> much

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
mind the fact that he don't have much

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.110 
mind the fact that he don't have much
articulation<00:05:18.300> at<00:05:18.810> all<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:19.730> just<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:20.850> don't<00:05:20.910> know

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
articulation at all I just I don't know

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.770 
articulation at all I just I don't know
why<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:21.870> really<00:05:22.080> like<00:05:22.410> this<00:05:22.620> toy<00:05:22.680> and

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
why I just I really like this toy and

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.410 
why I just I really like this toy and
this<00:05:24.780> is<00:05:24.960> more<00:05:25.140> for<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.560> kid<00:05:26.100> like<00:05:26.490> ages<00:05:27.150> 5<00:05:27.390> and

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
this is more for a kid like ages 5 and

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.070 
this is more for a kid like ages 5 and
up<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.780> think<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:28.970> you<00:05:29.970> know<00:05:30.090> even<00:05:30.390> though<00:05:30.750> I'm

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
up I think and you know even though I'm

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.100 
up I think and you know even though I'm
not<00:05:31.110> an<00:05:31.590> adult<00:05:32.100> but<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.090> still<00:05:33.810> like<00:05:33.960> the

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
not an adult but I still like the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.410 
not an adult but I still like the
mainline<00:05:34.440> toys<00:05:34.650> many<00:05:35.070> more<00:05:35.280> but<00:05:35.490> you<00:05:36.330> know

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
mainline toys many more but you know

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.850 
mainline toys many more but you know
this<00:05:36.570> is<00:05:36.630> about<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.050> best<00:05:37.200> toy<00:05:37.470> of<00:05:37.650> lockdown
