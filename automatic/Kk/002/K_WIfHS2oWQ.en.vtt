00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
Sun was setting and I actually matched a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.710 
Sun was setting and I actually matched a
whole<00:04:16.919> series<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.459> different<00:04:17.940> colors<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.449> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
whole series of different colors to the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.930 
whole series of different colors to the
brickwork<00:04:19.079> while<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.009> was<00:04:20.220> doing<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.820> had

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
brickwork while I was doing this I had

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.430 
brickwork while I was doing this I had
quite<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.239> few<00:04:21.299> tourists<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.139> were<00:04:22.229> quite

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
quite a few tourists that were quite

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.779 
quite a few tourists that were quite
interested<00:04:22.979> in<00:04:23.039> what<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.220> was<00:04:23.370> doing<00:04:23.430> because

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
interested in what I was doing because

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.999 
interested in what I was doing because
it<00:04:23.970> was<00:04:24.060> quite<00:04:24.270> unusual<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.500> explained<00:04:25.889> to

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
it was quite unusual and I explained to

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.430 
it was quite unusual and I explained to
them<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.370> was<00:04:26.400> trying<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.940> recreate<00:04:27.440> the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
them that I was trying to recreate the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.800 
them that I was trying to recreate the
Tudor<00:04:28.710> brick<00:04:28.860> walls<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.520> miniature<00:04:29.820> form<00:04:30.180> in

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
Tudor brick walls in a miniature form in

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.839 
Tudor brick walls in a miniature form in
fact<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.199> would<00:04:31.320> be<00:04:31.349> one<00:04:31.620> twenty-fourth<00:04:32.280> scale

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
fact it would be one twenty-fourth scale

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.110 
fact it would be one twenty-fourth scale
and<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.050> what<00:04:34.199> we<00:04:34.320> have<00:04:34.880> here<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.090> a

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
and this is what we have here is a

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.240 
and this is what we have here is a
series<00:04:36.599> of<00:04:36.630> different<00:04:37.139> shaded<00:04:37.949> bricks

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
series of different shaded bricks

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.749 
series of different shaded bricks
running<00:04:38.849> from<00:04:39.349> green<00:04:40.349> at<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.919> base<00:04:41.099> running

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
running from green at the base running

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.850 
running from green at the base running
through<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.389> brickwork<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:43.259> the<00:04:43.530> brickwork

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
through the brickwork so the brickwork

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.219 
through the brickwork so the brickwork
is<00:04:44.070> slightly<00:04:44.370> paler<00:04:45.090> running<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.080> the

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
is slightly paler running to the

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.939 
is slightly paler running to the
original<00:04:47.060> richer<00:04:48.060> Tudor<00:04:48.479> brickwork<00:04:48.949> now

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
original richer Tudor brickwork now

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.279 
original richer Tudor brickwork now
Tudor<00:04:50.610> brick<00:04:50.820> walls<00:04:51.060> never<00:04:51.570> had<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:52.050> damp

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
Tudor brick walls never had a damp

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.370 
Tudor brick walls never had a damp
course<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.580> handmade<00:04:54.030> bricks<00:04:54.389> were<00:04:54.870> very

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
course and the handmade bricks were very

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.499 
course and the handmade bricks were very
porous<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:56.159> that<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.460> why<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:56.759> change<00:04:57.330> of

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
porous and that is why the change of

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.290 
porous and that is why the change of
color<00:04:57.719> has<00:04:58.590> happened<00:04:58.979> over<00:04:59.490> over<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.969> years

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
color has happened over over the years

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.480 
color has happened over over the years
and<00:05:00.510> that's<00:05:00.960> why<00:05:01.289> the<00:05:01.860> texture<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.430> the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
and that's why the texture and the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.800 
and that's why the texture and the
colors<00:05:02.820> work<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.449> well

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
colors work so well

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.650 
colors work so well
with<00:05:03.990> embroidery<00:05:04.500> because<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:04.980> links<00:05:05.460> in<00:05:05.660> with

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
with embroidery because it links in with

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.270 
with embroidery because it links in with
