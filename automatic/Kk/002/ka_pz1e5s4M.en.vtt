now our thousand all makes them out put
it<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.660> this<00:02:07.080> principle<00:02:08.009> there's<00:02:08.700> already

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
it in this principle there's already

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.470 
it in this principle there's already
butter<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.500> flour<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> will

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
butter and flour in it so that I will

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.670 
butter and flour in it so that I will
not<00:02:12.810> stick<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.440> it

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
now it is all in spring to put a string

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:32.740 
now it is all in spring to put a string
for<00:02:23.370> Leo
