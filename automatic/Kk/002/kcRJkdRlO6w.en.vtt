it's<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:36.290> it's<00:00:36.650> a<00:00:37.340> hard<00:00:37.610> thing<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:38.120> kind<00:00:38.270> of

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
it's a it's a hard thing to kind of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.250 
it's a it's a hard thing to kind of
fully<00:00:38.720> understand<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.739> size<00:00:40.040> of<00:00:40.340> it<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.260> the

fully understand the size of it and the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.990 
fully understand the size of it and the
complexity<00:00:42.920> of<00:00:42.949> it<00:00:43.220> because<00:00:43.489> it's<00:00:43.670> it's

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
complexity of it because it's it's

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
of transpired that this was slightly

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.399 
of transpired that this was slightly
more<00:01:08.210> ambitious<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:08.960> was<00:01:09.140> slightly

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
more ambitious and this was slightly

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.550 
more ambitious and this was slightly
more<00:01:09.710> interesting<00:01:10.180> than<00:01:11.180> other<00:01:12.049> things<00:01:12.409> we

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
more interesting than other things we

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.980 
more interesting than other things we
had<00:01:12.680> looked<00:01:12.890> at<00:01:13.010> in<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.310> past<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:14.570> way<00:01:14.840> you

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
had looked at in the past the way you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.899 
had looked at in the past the way you
tackle<00:01:15.320> any<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.890> these<00:01:16.100> things<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.640> really

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
tackle any of these things you really

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.890

try to know the life story of your
character<00:01:21.380> all<00:01:21.920> right<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.310> think<00:01:22.340> that's

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
character all right and I think that's

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.109 
character all right and I think that's
why<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.330> know<00:01:23.780> especially<00:01:23.960> this<00:01:24.710> game<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.340> so

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
why you know especially this game is so

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.149 
why you know especially this game is so
interesting<00:01:26.750> because<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.040> know

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
interesting because it is you know

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.460 
interesting because it is you know
people<00:01:28.430> ask<00:01:28.670> is<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.119> a<00:01:29.299> film<00:01:29.720> or<00:01:29.900> is<00:01:30.049> it<00:01:30.170> again

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
people ask is it a film or is it again

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.190 
people ask is it a film or is it again
and<00:01:30.740> there<00:01:31.159> is<00:01:31.250> no<00:01:31.430> difference<00:01:31.850> not<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.689> me<00:01:32.840> you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
and there is no difference not to me you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.139 
and there is no difference not to me you
could<00:01:33.350> sit<00:01:33.619> there<00:01:33.649> and<00:01:33.950> watch<00:01:34.219> it<00:01:34.249> as<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:34.789> film

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
could sit there and watch it as a film

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.139 
could sit there and watch it as a film
so<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.439> way<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.950> trying<00:01:37.249> to<00:01:37.399> musically<00:01:37.939> tell<00:01:38.119> a

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
so the way of trying to musically tell a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.520 
so the way of trying to musically tell a
story<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.719> same<00:01:38.929> process

the<00:04:57.419> only<00:04:57.780> time<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.350> actually<00:04:59.090> fully

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
the only time you actually fully

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.360 
the only time you actually fully
understand<00:05:00.750> i<00:05:01.050> think<00:05:01.380> with<00:05:01.500> music<00:05:01.919> what<00:05:02.099> we've

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
understand i think with music what we've

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.300 
understand i think with music what we've
managed<00:05:02.729> to<00:05:02.820> actually<00:05:02.970> do<00:05:03.389> is<00:05:03.660> when<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:05.160> have

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
managed to actually do is when you have

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.760 
managed to actually do is when you have
the<00:05:05.550> time<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.970> sit<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.210> play<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.539> game

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
the time to sit and play the game

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.510 
the time to sit and play the game
because<00:05:07.770> we<00:05:07.979> don't<00:05:08.220> fully<00:05:09.380> understand<00:05:10.520> how

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
because we don't fully understand how

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.089 
because we don't fully understand how
much<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.150> know<00:05:12.300> how<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.930> really<00:05:13.680> will<00:05:13.860> work

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099

you're<00:05:15.810> choosing<00:05:16.169> different<00:05:16.260> decisions

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
you're choosing different decisions

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.189 
you're choosing different decisions
constantly<00:05:17.789> unlike<00:05:18.690> some<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.139> other

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
constantly unlike some of the other

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.080 
constantly unlike some of the other
games<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.740> we've<00:05:19.949> worked<00:05:20.190> on<00:05:20.460> you<00:05:20.880> have<00:05:21.060> a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
games that we've worked on you have a

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.420 
games that we've worked on you have a
very<00:05:21.510> clear<00:05:21.780> vision<00:05:21.840> of<00:05:22.410> what<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.830> end<00:05:22.979> story
