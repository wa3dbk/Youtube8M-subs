00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.600
 copei can not do anything about it 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.230
 You can believe what you're seeing 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.280
 are currently talking about one of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.280
 the possible names 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.190
 starts sidereal hits using 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.500
 immediately his blessed take away 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.380
 a boot to which the sidereal exploits I do not know 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.469
 for a book 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.140
 now we also have sidereal while 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.239
 which is in the middle and they are already rotating 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.070
 everyone will want to enter the middle and 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.840
 mean they will want to make all the chaos 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.000
 possible this is what it seems that 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.480
 tried 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 and there's the arrow going fast but 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.620
 does not impact on anyone 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.650
 it's 54 minutes of play up tot and I think 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.760
 that to ensure an upcoming entry 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.760
 they should go for the immortal 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.020
 you think 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.710
 It would be excellent to leave me quickly 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.710
 look for something 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.290
 opens a divine repair who never watÃ¡n 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.290
 conca with k bought gave in reiterated that 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.150
 buy everything nothing goes with everything or 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.940
 nothing holy god is the all or nothing 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.360
 they really feel that way liquid 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.420
 it is the all or nothing a king but it means 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.420
 or you win a big fight and you take out an item 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.580
 more and let your classmates 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.350
 estimates can also get something or 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.350
 you simply say goodbye to the match 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.770
 and his native henri pierre 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.770
 if you lose it 's over and kills all won 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.830
 thank you very much until you count are more 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.790
 of 8 thousand 500 people already at that time 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.740
 tuning the gamer screens 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.600
 I study tv to see the meeting of a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.860
 gene versus liquid 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.520
 oh my god I do not know what to think I do not know what 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.520
 think 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.020
 holy god 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.859
 seriously and it has already reached the point in 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.810
 which we have been so astonished that 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:37.860
 we do not know what to say 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.040
 win bastards win that yes I can 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.040
 tell 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.950
 and it's so serious they have to scream with 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.519
 more impact of the trend with g 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.469
 it was up to top 16 retweets the first 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.700
 mention appears on your TV now it 's 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.769
 Trend in Peru 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.769
 trend but although I do not know what that is 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.550
 we are already tendencies guys this is the 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.620
 power of the boteros this is the power 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.210
 but how beautiful how beautiful everything is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 great but do not take your eyes off 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.470
 the game because there is a diva in king 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.180
 but in game guys the damage of kun that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:23.750
 at the moment it's 610 610 with 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:27.600
 critical the critic is 25% from a 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.120
 240 chance 4 240 damage forgiveness 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.510
 21% off for 600 andrew's skill 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.510
 you're hitting for almost 2000 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.770
 our words to write that one 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.140
 word with care that can be activated 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.350
 could hook and this could be all 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.420
 for the team to commit a crime 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.420
 that still can not be decided without trying 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.489
 this regime only has to start 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.700

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.490
 it will follow because of the punishment of 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.100

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.460
 towers may end up falling 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.130
 force to be will be that you have to 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.070

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.560
