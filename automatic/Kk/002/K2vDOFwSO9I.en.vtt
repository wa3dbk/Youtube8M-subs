simple the only thing is there's going

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.610 
simple the only thing is there's going
to<00:04:20.920> be<00:04:20.950> like<00:04:21.880> one<00:04:22.330> or<00:04:22.690> two<00:04:22.720> cars<00:04:23.170> I<00:04:23.440> think

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
to be like one or two cars I think

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.720 
to be like one or two cars I think
that's<00:04:23.770> gonna<00:04:23.890> chase<00:04:24.070> after<00:04:24.100> you<00:04:24.490> however

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
that's gonna chase after you however

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.160 
that's gonna chase after you however
they<00:04:25.000> won't<00:04:25.180> start<00:04:25.390> chasing<00:04:25.570> after<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.990> until

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
they won't start chasing after you until

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.550 
they won't start chasing after you until
you<00:04:26.260> get<00:04:26.380> really<00:04:26.620> close<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:28.120> your<00:04:28.900> destination

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
you get really close to your destination

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.590 
you get really close to your destination
so<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.550> really<00:04:30.790> doesn't<00:04:31.030> matter<00:04:31.180> at<00:04:31.510> all

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
so it really doesn't matter at all

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.650 
so it really doesn't matter at all
