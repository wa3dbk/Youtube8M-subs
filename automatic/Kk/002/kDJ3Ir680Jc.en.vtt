00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.740
 we are christ 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.920
 I was born here in the city of Quito 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.559
 province of pichincha and I belong to the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.900
 parish of nayón in a neighborhood san 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.050
 francisco of sodas will be my neighborhood 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.630
 my parents were and are people 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.029
 fighters 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.000
 we have come from a super family 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.789
 humble we have been fighting from very low 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.440
 with them with my husband we met in 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.449
 music and music like that because he's 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.180
 composer is a musician 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.370
 when I met him I met him in a 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.070
 producer that was very fashionable in that 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.530
 then he was in charge of carrying out the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.659
 production the one in charge of listening to 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.149
 everyone who came there to try on 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:57.019
 to see if they were given the opportunity to record 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:01.640
 my little cieraito sara and that has three 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:05.509
 añitos and my big babe that is next 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.880
 I would meet the 15 that is called melanie 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:12.530
 Alejandra Narvaez for me, the family is 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.049
 is the fundamental pillar I believe that for 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.990
 all the people when we started 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.080
 to let us know more and we left here 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 and people recognized us 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.880
 it gave us so much satisfaction we said 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.220
 good at the end of the moment 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.590
 it seemed that we were already saying 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.070
 music start to see that people 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.920
 appreciate your work really motivated us 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.670
 much more popular artists are 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.390
 from town 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.480
 well it says popular we the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.580
 popular artists we know what it is 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.640
 fight from very low because we come 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.700
 from the place of humble homes we come from 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.229
 poor families that we have earned such 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 time a place in the hearts of the people 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.070
 with work with perseverance with patience 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.550
 also because it has not been easy 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.770
 but for me it is so beautiful also that 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.899
 in the street I go to the market I go to the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.150
 store I go to the pharmacy I go out to pay 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.740
 water light in the bank 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.110
 there is Maria de los Angeles and 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.870
 close in your hand for me that's the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.590
 biggest recognition that can me 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.590
 give the audience
