00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 freedom of the press and freedom of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.220
 expression is something that you have all the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.139
 days so that we have 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.719
 procured to the extent of our 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.240
 possibilities to guarantee access to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.220
 the information and we are precisely in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
 that moment concentrated on the reaction 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.779
 of some additional guidelines that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.820
 can allow that access to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.250
 information about everything in the sector 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.500
 public 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.000
 president if freedom of information 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.310
 and freedom of expression is 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.440
 guaranteed in these moments in coast 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.570
 rich as this feeling explains 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.130
 otherwise there are different 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.160
 personalities of the world of journalism 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.980
 in the social networks that signal it 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.949
 as a person or as a mandatory 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.970
 that is taking opposite steps in this 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.970
 freedom of information 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.710
 in favor of precisely many things to 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.710
 break free 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.430
 but I do not think it's a feeling of 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.470
 part of the chinchilla president up 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.690
 the case of the lawsuit filed against 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.869
 a specific businessman a few days 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.580
 back this case has left the 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.170
 borders of san jose has left the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.880
 borders of costa rica and has been 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 commented on different spaces 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.759
 especially within the networks 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.190
 social 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.890
 what is your argument to reject 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.810
 precisely those accusations 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.150
 is being persecuted censor in 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.930
 internet the opinions of his performance 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:44.930
 in his government simply from the attitude 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.270
 irresponsible and irresponsible 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.270
 people of individuals who like 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.750
 in the past they could with total contempt 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.460
 to sell and defame or harm 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.619
 third persons president chinchilla 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.600
 you want to say then this is not a 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.940
 contradictory message from your point of 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.500
 seen as president of costa rica at 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.899
 present a claim in fact the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.399
 first demand that presents a 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.340
 Mandatory President in History 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.300
 modern of costa rica for defamation not 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.310
 it is a contradictory message 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.800
 precisely for a person who is 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.360
 defending freedom of expression in 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.130
 Internet 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.040
 of an individual that effectively with your 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:27.109
 expression sale 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:31.879
 speaks of a very concrete fact that 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:34.849
 attributes and that of not reacting 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.310
 as energetically as he has done then 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.980
 anyone could believe what the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.379
 truth and if something I can not afford 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.500
 is that the citizens of costa rica 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.230
 last of my integrity in the plane and 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.180
 kind can have many discussions in 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.340
 Regarding public policy issues 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.069
 that I have taken but in the plane 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.709
 ethical what I have been doing 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.599
 it's just what always starts 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.939
 here public career that is to live of my 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.709
 salary and he is credited with investments that 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.689
 are false, remember that all the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.319
 freedoms and freedom of expression do not 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.870
 it is not an exception that has two 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.989
 parts that has the part of the exercise 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.599
 obviously expand our freedom hopefully 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.599
 without constraints and excuses but also 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.609
 they have the part of responsibility 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.280
 the other thing that now that you ask me 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.519
 I also take this opportunity to point out that 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.840
 in this world of a lot information 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.840
 plus 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.720
 and it expands much more abundantly than we 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.030
 allows to get from social networks is 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.500
 very important that not only the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.220
 journalists but also citizens 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.520
 develop a little more also below 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.200
 him of malice to wonder why to 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.240
 Sometimes a certain type of information is given 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.370
 where they come from what the 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.990
 sources that is something that never uses 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.510
 can leave because such and I 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.459
 I want to say one thing to the leaders 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.980
 to the rulers whom they take 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.230
 decisions in the public service many 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.090
 Sometimes they are encouraged to encourage 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.670
 the social ones that are taking and the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.270
 first way to scare on the part 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.000
 of those who sometimes want to wake up 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.620
 some rules is precisely pointing 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.900
 against the smell of people so 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.660
 which shows that you raised because 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.270
 I also feel that it is essential that 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.290
 ask who are the ones who are 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.690
 putting some information and the 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.450
 President is giving him his government 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.630
 some kind of message tracking 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.620
 on social networks critical messages 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.280
 of favorable to its management if we do 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.280
 basically on the map 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.320
 let's say taking note of two things 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.720
 first where do the concerns go? 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.460
 starting from the citizens and 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.220
 demands that sometimes accumulate and that 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.170
 in that networks can give the guidelines 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.330
 important that we can treat it to 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.820
 times of the relationship with people by 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.740
 the means and the second term sometimes 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.070
 comes from very specific bands of 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:11.120
 concrete citizens basically that 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.800
 there is an interest and you think 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.810
 do you perceive to create some kind of 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.240
 ungoverned skill or problem 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.310
 governance from these 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:25.360
 messages that are occurring in the 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.360
 social networks in social networks 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.060
 is to understand the power to feed 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.800
 With respect 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.749
 and those social networks from the point of 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.729
 view of what is done of the surrender 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:48.369
 of accounts the power to hide the 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.999
 concerns sometimes power to face 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:53.499
 very fast phenomena that maybe 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:56.830
 position a subject against which the 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:58.509
 government was not prepared and facing 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.539
 which one has to make many clarifications 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.399
 the speed that is answered are 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.719
 very many the challenges that arise from 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:06.909
 the point of view certainly the 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:10.300
 democratic governance but bad 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.699
 we would conclude that the rest subject 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.029
 which is over restricting those 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.029
 spaces
