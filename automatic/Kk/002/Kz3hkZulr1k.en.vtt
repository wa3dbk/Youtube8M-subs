00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
what I found and I've talked to a lot of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480 
what I found and I've talked to a lot of
people<00:01:13.470> around<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> country<00:01:13.799> especially

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
people around the country especially

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.410 
people around the country especially
places<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.799> really<00:01:16.799> low<00:01:16.979> humidity<00:01:17.580> places

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
places in really low humidity places

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
places in really low humidity places
like<00:01:18.689> Arizona<00:01:19.040> every<00:01:20.040> time<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> open<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.549> bag

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
like Arizona every time you open the bag

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780 
like Arizona every time you open the bag
you<00:01:21.060> lose<00:01:21.409> product<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.560> disappears<00:01:23.130> because

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you lose product it disappears because

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.570 
you lose product it disappears because
when<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.299> close<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.810> back<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.280> that's<00:01:26.280> right

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
when you close it back up that's right

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.120 
when you close it back up that's right
humidity<00:01:27.299> takes<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> humidity<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
humidity takes the humidity out of the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
humidity takes the humidity out of the
bag<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:30.090> we're<00:01:30.240> trying<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.689> here<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
bag so what we're trying to do here is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.999 
bag so what we're trying to do here is
to<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.820> product<00:01:33.119> stay<00:01:33.990> stable<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.740> long

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to have the product stay stable as long

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.859 
to have the product stay stable as long
as<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:36.150> these<00:01:36.270> bags<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.750> can

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
do that and one of the ways by doing it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.639

or do whatever you want to do with it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.330 
or do whatever you want to do with it
the<00:01:47.700> air<00:01:47.790> goes<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.270> inside<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:50.159> other

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the air goes back inside so in other

I find that if I do that I can do just

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.240 
I find that if I do that I can do just
about<00:02:11.739> as<00:02:12.069> good<00:02:12.310> as<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:13.180> machine<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:14.110> as<00:02:14.800> far<00:02:15.099> as

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
about as good as a machine can as far as

food saver seal seal a mill machine so
the<00:03:41.410> challenge<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.610> this<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.970> longer

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
the challenge is is that this is longer

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.080 
the challenge is is that this is longer
than<00:03:43.960> the<00:03:44.110> actual<00:03:44.260> machine<00:03:44.710> is<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.700> 14

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
than the actual machine is this is 14

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.600 
than the actual machine is this is 14
and<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.210> half<00:03:46.240> inches<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:47.080> is<00:03:47.140> 12<00:03:47.530> inches<00:03:47.770> all

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
and a half inches this is 12 inches all

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.560 
and a half inches this is 12 inches all
you<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.970> do<00:03:49.210> is<00:03:49.980> put<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.100> on<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.400> on<00:03:51.610> the

you have to do is put it on the on the
little<00:03:52.810> heat<00:03:53.020> bar<00:03:53.610> close<00:03:54.610> it

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.270 

and<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.450> can<00:04:05.569> see<00:04:05.870> it's<00:04:06.530> sealed<00:04:06.890> all<00:04:07.129> the<00:04:07.159> way

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
and you can see it's sealed all the way

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.780 
and you can see it's sealed all the way
to<00:04:07.430> there<00:04:08.859> so<00:04:09.859> you<00:04:10.010> got<00:04:10.129> to<00:04:10.219> do<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.459> move<00:04:10.640> it

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
to there so you got to do is move it

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:23.710 
to there so you got to do is move it
over<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.060> few<00:04:11.299> inches<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:13.280> reseal<00:04:13.819> it<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:23.630> you

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
over a few inches and reseal it so you

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
can see a seal all the way across so

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.129 
can see a seal all the way across so
long<00:04:28.340> as<00:04:28.460> these<00:04:28.550> two<00:04:28.789> lines<00:04:29.060> meet<00:04:29.539> it's

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
long as these two lines meet it's

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.210 
long as these two lines meet it's
completely<00:04:30.770> sealed<00:04:31.039> so<00:04:31.539> I<00:04:32.979> want<00:04:33.979> to<00:04:34.039> show<00:04:34.160> you
