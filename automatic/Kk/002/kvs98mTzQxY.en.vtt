00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
why I'd never really picked this up it

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.530 
why I'd never really picked this up it
just<00:03:09.129> never<00:03:09.220> really<00:03:09.340> interested<00:03:09.819> me<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.329> I'm

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.699 
just never really interested me and I'm
a<00:03:10.599> bit<00:03:10.750> disappointed<00:03:10.810> they<00:03:11.290> didn't<00:03:11.590> have

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
a bit disappointed they didn't have

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.670 
a bit disappointed they didn't have
black<00:03:11.919> bruising<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:13.720> until<00:03:14.260> being<00:03:14.470> told

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
black bruising because until being told

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.809 
black bruising because until being told
I<00:03:14.889> kind<00:03:15.099> of<00:03:15.159> smelled<00:03:15.430> black<00:03:15.609> price<00:03:15.909> and<00:03:17.819> it

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
I kind of smelled black price and it

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.309 
I kind of smelled black price and it
does<00:03:18.970> have<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> kind<00:03:19.449> of<00:03:19.599> berry<00:03:19.780> scent<00:03:20.109> but<00:03:20.229> I

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
does have a kind of berry scent but I

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.449 
does have a kind of berry scent but I
think<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.650> more<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.919> citrus<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
think it's more the citrus and the

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.460 
think it's more the citrus and the
frankincense<00:03:21.879> mix<00:03:22.150> together<00:03:22.329> makes<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.169> seem

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
frankincense mix together makes it seem

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.500 
frankincense mix together makes it seem
a<00:03:23.500> little<00:03:23.709> bit<00:03:24.010> more<00:03:24.190> fruity<00:03:24.639> I'm<00:03:25.120> not<00:03:25.299> sure<00:03:25.419> if

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
a little bit more fruity I'm not sure if

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.119 
a little bit more fruity I'm not sure if
this<00:03:25.629> does<00:03:25.840> anything<00:03:26.049> special<00:03:26.379> either<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.010> it

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
this does anything special either so it

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.619 
this does anything special either so it
might<00:03:27.310> be<00:03:27.340> one<00:03:27.549> of<00:03:27.579> those<00:03:27.699> bath<00:03:27.940> bombs<00:03:28.209> I<00:03:28.359> split

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
might be one of those bath bombs I split

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.899 
might be one of those bath bombs I split
in<00:03:28.780> half<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.109> half<00:03:29.199> over<00:03:29.229> two<00:03:29.590> baths<00:03:29.859> now<00:03:30.579> this

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
in half and half over two baths now this

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.520 
in half and half over two baths now this
is<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.120> bath<00:03:31.359> bomb<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:31.750> was<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.109> reason<00:03:32.260> why

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530

made my breath so shimmery so purple it

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.010 
made my breath so shimmery so purple it
was<00:05:29.470> really<00:05:29.650> funky<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.460> it<00:05:31.210> also<00:05:31.390> sunk<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:31.990> the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
was really funky and it also sunk to the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.630 
was really funky and it also sunk to the
bottom<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.590> bath<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.040> then<00:05:33.190> kept<00:05:33.430> rising

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
bottom of the bath and then kept rising

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.070 
bottom of the bath and then kept rising
to<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.090> top<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:34.570> I<00:05:34.600> guess<00:05:34.810> that<00:05:34.960> was<00:05:35.020> the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
to the top so I guess that was the

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.860 
to the top so I guess that was the
phoenix<00:05:35.470> rising<00:05:35.980> its<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:36.580> mix<00:05:36.820> of<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.270> bath<00:05:37.630> melt

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
phoenix rising its a mix of a bath melt

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.900 
phoenix rising its a mix of a bath melt
and<00:05:38.140> I<00:05:38.230> bath<00:05:38.500> ballistic<00:05:39.160> I<00:05:39.370> think<00:05:39.580> I<00:05:39.640> got<00:05:39.790> that

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
and I bath ballistic I think I got that

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.370 
and I bath ballistic I think I got that
right<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.660> it's<00:05:40.780> quite<00:05:40.900> good<00:05:41.050> for<00:05:41.200> your<00:05:41.290> skin
