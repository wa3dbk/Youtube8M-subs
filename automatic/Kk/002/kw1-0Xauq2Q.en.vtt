00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:07.750
 one that we have prepared here 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:10.690
 and we put the piano chest 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.520
 if it passes to the other side so that 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.340
 is well open part of the 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.230
 ribs and make that brief on the palette 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.450
 I believe that in Buenos Aires you should 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.400
 be thinking every little john with this 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.680
 small to the spectacular book which is 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.090
 the importance as you said that of putting 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.810
 these clubs say because there some 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.400
 some at home 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 but it can be but with an iron and 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.100
 yerko society that something that does not have it 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.739
 if we put them on this side as well the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.989
 Participation so that it looks good 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.790
 open to all that obviously give and 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.489
 production of the area we are in the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.290
 count and each producer brings what 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.539
 has been developing throughout the year 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.300
 with the accompaniment of the inta is a 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.829
 very nice project is accessed from all the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.660
 truth out of Switzerland touring yesterday 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.410
 I was touring long producers of 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.210
 exotic there are oils there are candles 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.850
 jams obviously with the fruit 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.820
 typical here of the south of red fruits that 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.909
 more a lot the truth 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.229
 but lots of very nice people the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.050
 people that we were watching yesterday 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:24.650
 you can not miss the northeast of the country 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.650
 but we are going to lift 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.870
 we put some water for what 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.620
 so that the salt sticks and a 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.620
 grade aspect 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.850
 although in the end already so that the part 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.260
 that intrigues us here is on which side what 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.530
 you're going to hang up like you talk about the rooms 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.530
 it's going very well 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.330
 like the other 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.230
 Argüello claro 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.990
 more winds I do not know how many centimeters 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.340
 in everything it calculates and depends on the fire 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.410
 as I said today now for example 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.180
 we have enough temperature called here 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.510
 up to give him life 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.510
 quarter 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.070
 because when turning when turning it does not grip the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.320
 holy lambs to the dog like the roast 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.730
 I used to be always spinning and 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.740
 stature let's say minor to be 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.630
 directly on one side blau on 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.250
 fire that have liked the rotisserie let's say 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.530
 plastically a salty shot are 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.940
 lovers take the finite and every so often 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.940
 has to come to that steels 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.890
 at some point you will turn it around or 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.890
 the place of the city 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.440
 people resist roasters 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.430
 Argentina resists spices 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:22.299
 a visit to you too 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.299
 nobody wants with 500 dead 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.230
 we told him that the test invited him and 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.930
 spectacular is going to be accompanied with a 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.989
 pumpkin with a pumpkin puree with 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.319
 honey with thyme but another very different 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.319
 because within it 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.480
 a puree rich and sweet too 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.190
 revive honey with thyme and then 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.290
 that's what we are in Patagonia and not 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.360
 we had to miss the presence of 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.460
 sea ​​in the food and we will have a 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.460
 disk full of mussel
