00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
create that by doing what we do then

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870 
create that by doing what we do then
that's<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.439> good<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.100> well

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that's like really good I think well

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.120 
that's like really good I think well
it's<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.119> varied<00:01:54.600> record<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.649> think

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it's a varied record in that I think

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
it's a varied record in that I think
that<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> first<00:01:57.560> probably<00:01:58.560> three<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:58.799> four

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that the first probably three or four

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.880 
that the first probably three or four
tracks<00:01:59.280> are<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.930> won't<00:02:01.110> use<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> word<00:02:01.469> then

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
tracks are and I won't use the word then

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.789 
tracks are and I won't use the word then
but<00:02:02.100> I'll<00:02:02.189> say<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:03.180> calm

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
but I'll say that they are more calm

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.029 
but I'll say that they are more calm
right<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.670> more<00:02:05.030> sort<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:05.740> kind<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.799> hook

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
right and more sort of kind of hook

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.869 
right and more sort of kind of hook
driven<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.509> then<00:02:08.959> there's<00:02:09.319> this<00:02:09.610> mid<00:02:10.610> section

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
driven and then there's this mid section

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.390 
driven and then there's this mid section
to<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.450> latter<00:02:11.629> part<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.110> record<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:13.129> is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
to the latter part of the record that is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.380 
to the latter part of the record that is
more<00:02:13.730> jammy<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.360> more<00:02:14.599> kind<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.900> open<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:16.390> you

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
more jammy and more kind of open and you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.660 
more jammy and more kind of open and you
know<00:02:17.450> what<00:02:17.690> I'm<00:02:17.959> hesitating<00:02:18.860> any<00:02:19.370> kind<00:02:19.610> of

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
know what I'm hesitating any kind of

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.979 
know what I'm hesitating any kind of
characterization<00:02:20.330> because<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.599> don't<00:02:20.750> need<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
characterization because I don't need it

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.250 
characterization because I don't need it
because<00:02:21.560> I'm<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:22.220> know<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.790> can<00:02:22.940> say<00:02:23.180> yeah<00:02:26.260> I

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
because I'm you know you can say yeah I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.229 
because I'm you know you can say yeah I
think<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.370> think<00:02:28.580> it's<00:02:28.700> interesting<00:02:28.910> I

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
think it's I think it's interesting I

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.080 
think it's I think it's interesting I
think<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.690> it's<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.620> first<00:02:30.980> third<00:02:31.849> of<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
think that it's the first third of the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.460 
think that it's the first third of the
record<00:02:32.390> doesn't<00:02:32.540> necessarily<00:02:32.900> prepare<00:02:33.260> you

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
record doesn't necessarily prepare you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.170 
record doesn't necessarily prepare you
for<00:02:33.760> what's<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.849> come

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
for what's to come

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.430 
for what's to come
you<00:02:35.660> know<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.090> bait<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.870> know<00:02:38.900> yeah

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
you know that's like bait you know yeah

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.830 
you know that's like bait you know yeah
it's<00:02:39.769> like<00:02:39.980> real<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.940> it's<00:02:41.180> like<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.420> Beatles

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
compare to the Beatles but it's like a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.530 
compare to the Beatles but it's like a
good<00:02:53.900> example<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.560> pop<00:02:55.250> culture<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:55.849> rock<00:02:56.299> and

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the thing that might they might not be

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.949 
the thing that might they might not be
ready<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:05.829> before<00:03:06.829> they<00:03:07.239> are<00:03:08.239> introduced<00:03:08.840> to

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
ready for before they are introduced to

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.660 
ready for before they are introduced to
it<00:03:09.230> was<00:03:09.530> something<00:03:09.889> that<00:03:09.920> they<00:03:10.160> can<00:03:10.340> kind<00:03:10.519> of

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
it was something that they can kind of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.440 
it was something that they can kind of
get<00:03:11.299> one<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:13.190> know<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:14.000> not<00:03:14.120> very

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
get one so I you know it's not very

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.849 
get one so I you know it's not very
deliberate<00:03:15.019> or<00:03:15.139> thought-out<00:03:15.410> in<00:03:15.769> the

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
deliberate or thought-out in the

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.620 
deliberate or thought-out in the
sequencing<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.519> record<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.209> do<00:03:17.329> think

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
sequencing of the record but I do think

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.160 
sequencing of the record but I do think
like<00:03:18.639> you<00:03:19.639> know<00:03:19.760> there's<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.060> lot<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.750> what<00:03:20.959> we

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.550 
know you can draw them in with something
that<00:03:38.180> they're<00:03:38.329> not<00:03:38.389> going<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.870> get<00:03:38.989> bored<00:03:39.349> with

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
that they're not going to get bored with

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.979 
that they're not going to get bored with
and<00:03:39.889> then<00:03:40.010> they're<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.639> the<00:03:41.030> world<00:03:41.269> that<00:03:41.630> we

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
and then they're in the world that we

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.720 
and then they're in the world that we
created<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.680> then<00:03:42.829> they<00:03:42.980> can<00:03:43.160> see<00:03:43.430> all<00:03:43.579> these

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
created and then they can see all these

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.680 
created and then they can see all these
other<00:03:43.790> sides<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.599> that<00:03:44.780> that's<00:03:45.019> like<00:03:45.260> a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
other sides of it that that's like a

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.420 
other sides of it that that's like a
still<00:03:47.690> not<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:47.989> strategy<00:03:48.680> or<00:03:48.709> anything<00:03:49.069> but<00:03:49.310> it

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
still not a strategy or anything but it

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.409 
still not a strategy or anything but it
is<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.790> makes<00:03:50.060> sense<00:03:50.299> to<00:03:50.630> me<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.889> know

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
is it makes sense to me that you know

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.699 
is it makes sense to me that you know
that<00:03:53.419> you<00:03:53.510> want<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.810> build<00:03:54.019> if<00:03:54.440> you're

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
that you want to build if you're

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.379 
that you want to build if you're
introducing<00:03:55.040> something<00:03:55.639> to<00:03:55.940> people<00:03:56.090> that

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
introducing something to people that

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.819 
introducing something to people that
don't<00:03:56.569> know<00:03:56.690> anything<00:03:57.109> about<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.739> you

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
don't know anything about it that you

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.400 
don't know anything about it that you
want<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.239> initiate<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.720> into<00:04:00.079> it<00:04:00.200> rather

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
want to initiate that into it rather

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.170 
want to initiate that into it rather
than<00:04:00.620> wait<00:04:00.889> into<00:04:01.280> it

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
than wait into it

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.390 
than wait into it
right<00:04:02.810> like<00:04:03.049> taking<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.590> most<00:04:03.829> you<00:04:04.280> know

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
right like taking the most you know

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.990 
right like taking the most you know
taking<00:04:04.849> the<00:04:04.970> most<00:04:06.159> you<00:04:07.159> know<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.519> nother<00:04:07.760> word

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
taking the most you know the nother word

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.970 
taking the most you know the nother word
another<00:04:08.599> loaded<00:04:09.200> word<00:04:09.379> like<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.769> most

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
another loaded word like the most

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.550 
another loaded word like the most
psychedelic<00:04:10.819> or<00:04:11.060> like<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.360> most<00:04:11.599> like<00:04:11.840> cosmic

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
psychedelic or like the most like cosmic

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.830 
psychedelic or like the most like cosmic
or<00:04:12.829> whatever<00:04:13.099> like<00:04:13.640> song<00:04:14.030> that's<00:04:14.450> like<00:04:14.599> ten

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
or whatever like song that's like ten

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.629 
or whatever like song that's like ten
minutes<00:04:15.019> long<00:04:15.349> they're<00:04:15.739> putting<00:04:16.009> that<00:04:16.039> first

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
minutes long they're putting that first

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.310 
minutes long they're putting that first
on<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.970> record<00:04:17.299> wouldn't<00:04:17.570> really<00:04:17.780> make<00:04:18.019> sense

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
on the record wouldn't really make sense

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.069 
on the record wouldn't really make sense
but<00:04:18.820> it's<00:04:19.820> still<00:04:20.000> not<00:04:20.209> really<00:04:20.419> too<00:04:21.049> much

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
but it's still not really too much

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.499 
but it's still not really too much
thought<00:04:21.769> out<00:04:22.039> but<00:04:22.340> right<00:04:22.520> I<00:04:22.789> think<00:04:23.180> in<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.330> lot

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
thought out but right I think in a lot

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.620 
thought out but right I think in a lot
of<00:04:23.539> ways<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:25.090> it's<00:04:26.090> just<00:04:26.419> really

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
of ways like it's just really

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.770 
of ways like it's just really
interesting<00:04:27.199> to<00:04:27.320> be<00:04:27.350> involved<00:04:28.160> in<00:04:28.340> in<00:04:28.789> you

you guys have any thoughts on sort of
where<00:05:21.169> that<00:05:21.409> comes<00:05:21.830> from<00:05:22.099> that<00:05:22.460> it's<00:05:22.580> not

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
where that comes from that it's not

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.250 
where that comes from that it's not
simply<00:05:23.900> you<00:05:24.800> know<00:05:25.630> recreating<00:05:26.630> something

simply you know recreating something

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.779 
simply you know recreating something
from<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.770> course<00:05:27.800> we<00:05:28.220> wouldn't<00:05:28.400> we<00:05:28.760> wouldn't

totally or I wouldn't I wouldn't if
there<00:06:39.020> is<00:06:39.140> something<00:06:39.680> that<00:06:40.010> we're<00:06:40.610> jamming<00:06:41.300> on

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
there is something that we're jamming on

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.730 
there is something that we're jamming on
that<00:06:42.530> needs<00:06:42.800> to<00:06:43.070> be<00:06:44.110> structured<00:06:45.110> a<00:06:45.320> little<00:06:45.350> bit

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
that needs to be structured a little bit

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.230 
that needs to be structured a little bit
more<00:06:45.950> because<00:06:46.070> it<00:06:46.310> makes<00:06:46.520> sense<00:06:46.790> for<00:06:47.120> the

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
more because it makes sense for the

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.420 
more because it makes sense for the
better<00:06:47.450> of<00:06:47.660> the<00:06:47.810> song<00:06:48.020> we'll<00:06:48.380> do<00:06:48.530> that<00:06:48.740> but

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
better of the song we'll do that but

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.730 
better of the song we'll do that but
then<00:06:49.610> there's<00:06:49.850> other<00:06:50.030> songs<00:06:50.330> that<00:06:50.600> if<00:06:51.290> you<00:06:51.500> do

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
then there's other songs that if you do

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.200 
then there's other songs that if you do
that<00:06:51.980> you're<00:06:52.280> it's<00:06:52.460> almost<00:06:52.760> like<00:06:52.910> you<00:06:53.000> cut

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
that you're it's almost like you cut

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.480 
that you're it's almost like you cut
your<00:06:53.300> fingernails<00:06:53.690> too<00:06:54.140> short<00:06:54.440> you<00:06:55.040> know<00:06:55.160> and

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
your fingernails too short you know and

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.670 
your fingernails too short you know and
then<00:06:55.760> you're<00:06:56.510> kind<00:06:56.690> of<00:06:56.750> like<00:06:56.960> what's<00:06:57.200> going<00:06:57.500> on

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
then you're kind of like what's going on

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.470 
then you're kind of like what's going on

you know and so you kind of have to let
it<00:06:59.630> grow<00:06:59.780> out<00:06:59.810> a<00:07:00.020> little<00:07:00.260> bit<00:07:00.530> just<00:07:00.800> let<00:07:01.010> it

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
it grow out a little bit just let it

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.630 
it grow out a little bit just let it
have<00:07:01.280> some<00:07:01.460> space<00:07:01.760> and<00:07:02.060> we're<00:07:02.210> in<00:07:02.450> and<00:07:03.020> so<00:07:03.860> and

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
and that's for the better of that song

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.640 
and that's for the better of that song
you<00:07:07.400> know<00:07:07.550> so<00:07:08.300> it's<00:07:08.540> really<00:07:08.720> like<00:07:09.020> whatever
