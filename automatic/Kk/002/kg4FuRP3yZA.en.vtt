00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.330
You have to first understand what the one
means.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.609
It's just meaning the first count or the first
beat in a bar, right.

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:22.970
So this is the top of the recording, this
is where I would like to start from, right.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.810
So, okay.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:39.059
So what may aim is is to make a smooth transition
on to incorporate a universal cut that most

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.370
hip hop or R&amp;amp;B DJ's use as a transitional
cut.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.050
This is called chirping, right.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.940
I'm going to chirp the next song, then I'm
going to drop on the one, right.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.699
So the top of the recording or whatever you
choose for the one-two beat, right.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:08.740
So you can listen to the recording, you can
drop it from there if that's your one.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.310
The one can't just be from anywhere, it's
what you start counting from, right.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.800
You're going to drop on the one, right.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.010
But I'm going to actually go to the top of
the recording, all right.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.010
One.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.490
So that beat, that's the one.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:38.490
This track 
counting bars, three, four, five, two, three,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.460
four, six, two, three, four, seven, two, three,
four, eight, twookay?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.300
I just dropped on the one.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.130
Focus when you're dropping on the one or you're
transitioning with scratching or you're releasing

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.570
on the one count, on that beat, that first
beat is for it to be on time, that is the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.840
golden rule is make sure your release is on
time.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.050
Make sure the transition is clean, and make
sure that the transition makes sense because

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.629
you don't want to just throw on anything.
