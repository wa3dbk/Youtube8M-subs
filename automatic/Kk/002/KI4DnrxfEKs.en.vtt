00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
smaller than a 188 this is a Mac 188 as

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.210 
smaller than a 188 this is a Mac 188 as
you<00:00:24.260> can<00:00:24.439> see<00:00:24.710> is<00:00:25.699> much<00:00:25.939> taller<00:00:26.269> and<00:00:26.630> much

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
you can see is much taller and much

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.310 
you can see is much taller and much
looser<00:00:28.220> pack<00:00:28.490> this<00:00:28.820> is<00:00:28.970> much<00:00:29.150> denser<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:30.170> the

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
looser pack this is much denser and the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.189 
looser pack this is much denser and the
other<00:00:30.470> one<00:00:30.740> is<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.130> Sigma<00:00:31.490> s<00:00:31.900> s197<00:00:32.900> which<00:00:33.050> is

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
other one is the Sigma s s197 which is

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.009 
other one is the Sigma s s197 which is
actually<00:00:33.680> now<00:00:33.860> also<00:00:34.129> called<00:00:34.580> the<00:00:34.760> F<00:00:35.000> 80<00:00:35.660> I

gonna mention is also the that there's a
matte<00:00:43.699> version<00:00:43.970> and<00:00:44.269> this<00:00:44.330> is<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.600> Sigma

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
matte version and this is the Sigma

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.979 
matte version and this is the Sigma
version<00:00:45.260> it's<00:00:45.409> the<00:00:45.470> SS<00:00:45.920> 131<00:00:46.790> which<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.629> a<00:00:47.659> much

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
version it's the SS 131 which is a much

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.460 
version it's the SS 131 which is a much
fuller<00:00:48.320> more<00:00:48.710> like<00:00:48.949> blush<00:00:49.519> brush<00:00:49.850> type<00:00:50.150> look

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.890 
fuller more like blush brush type look
dual<00:00:51.470> fibre<00:00:51.739> brush<00:00:52.040> now<00:00:52.879> these<00:00:53.210> three<00:00:53.659> are

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
dual fibre brush now these three are

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.990 
dual fibre brush now these three are
dual<00:00:54.260> fiber<00:00:54.650> brushes<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.430> what<00:00:55.580> that<00:00:55.729> means

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
dual fiber brushes and what that means

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.030 
dual fiber brushes and what that means
is<00:00:56.390> there's<00:00:56.930> actually<00:00:57.049> two<00:00:57.470> different<00:00:57.500> types

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
is there's actually two different types

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.880 
is there's actually two different types
of<00:00:58.250> fibers<00:00:58.790> or<00:00:59.119> hairs<00:00:59.720> inside<00:01:00.409> of<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.680> brush

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
of fibers or hairs inside of the brush

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.960 
of fibers or hairs inside of the brush
to<00:01:01.430> give<00:01:01.610> you<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:02.059> more<00:01:03.100> diffused<00:01:04.100> look<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.729> the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
to give you a more diffused look of the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.480 
to give you a more diffused look of the
product<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:05.570> not<00:01:05.750> as<00:01:05.930> dense<00:01:06.229> or<00:01:06.740> as<00:01:07.010> thick<00:01:07.280> as

product it's not as dense or as thick as

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.910 
product it's not as dense or as thick as
a<00:01:07.520> normal<00:01:08.180> regular<00:01:08.630> brush<00:01:09.109> now<00:01:09.859> the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
a normal regular brush now the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.560 
a normal regular brush now the
difference<00:01:10.579> between<00:01:10.700> all<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.030> these<00:01:11.210> is<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
difference between all of these is the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.230 
difference between all of these is the
one<00:01:11.750> ninety<00:01:12.229> seven<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:13.070> very<00:01:13.310> dense<00:01:13.700> thickly

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
one ninety seven is a very dense thickly

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.230 
one ninety seven is a very dense thickly
packed<00:01:14.899> brush<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.130> extremely<00:01:17.090> soft

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
packed brush and it is extremely soft

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.910 
packed brush and it is extremely soft
like<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.659> one<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.929> these<00:01:18.109> softest<00:01:18.590> brushes

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
like it is one of these softest brushes

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.830 
like it is one of these softest brushes
I've<00:01:19.070> ever<00:01:19.219> felt<00:01:19.549> but<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.329> not<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.509> jewel

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.639 
fiber brush so I'm gonna tell you a
little<00:01:23.450> bit<00:01:23.659> about<00:01:23.899> what<00:01:24.079> I<00:01:24.109> think<00:01:24.200> these<00:01:24.590> are

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
little bit about what I think these are

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.649 
little bit about what I think these are
the<00:01:24.890> main<00:01:25.100> two<00:01:25.369> that<00:01:25.759> have<00:01:26.060> been<00:01:26.090> asked<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.539> be

the main two that have been asked to be

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.940 
the main two that have been asked to be
compared<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:29.030> Sigma<00:01:29.390> one<00:01:29.539> by<00:01:29.899> far<00:01:30.259> is<00:01:30.590> my

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
compared the Sigma one by far is my

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.429 
compared the Sigma one by far is my
ultimate<00:01:31.159> favorite<00:01:31.899> foundation<00:01:32.899> brush<00:01:33.109> I

because in order to make a water
resistant<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:42.710> have<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.189> put<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.460> or<00:01:43.700> you

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
resistant you have to put it or you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.219 
resistant you have to put it or you
should<00:01:44.030> put<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.329> on<00:01:44.390> with<00:01:44.569> a<00:01:44.600> sponge<00:01:44.929> it<00:01:45.049> gives

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
should put it on with a sponge it gives

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.870 
should put it on with a sponge it gives
you<00:01:45.319> the<00:01:45.439> best<00:01:45.619> results<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.189> make<00:01:46.579> it<00:01:46.729> water

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
you the best results to make it water

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.999 
you the best results to make it water
resistant<00:01:47.359> so<00:01:47.539> I<00:01:47.569> do<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:47.869> don't<00:01:48.530> use<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.979> for

now the Mac 130 is the one that everyone
was<00:02:37.020> asking<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.710> similar<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:39.060> first

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
was asking is it similar the first

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the difference in size of this and this

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.910 
the difference in size of this and this
one's<00:02:42.270> dirty<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.080> used<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.470> but

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
one's dirty I know I just used it but

these<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.870> super<00:02:46.200> tiny<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.980> is

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
these this is super tiny and this is

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.960 
these this is super tiny and this is
really<00:02:47.520> big<00:02:48.140> similar<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.350> height<00:02:49.970> through

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
really big similar and height through

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.550 
really big similar and height through
here<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:51.540> look<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.110> difference<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.530> size

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
here but look at the difference in size

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.810 
here but look at the difference in size
this<00:02:53.010> way<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:53.310> well<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.480> Mac<00:02:54.660> 130<00:02:55.290> mm<00:02:56.190> this

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
this way as well so the Mac 130 mm this

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.090 
this way as well so the Mac 130 mm this
is<00:02:57.060> one<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.540> went<00:02:57.780> back<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.230> forth<00:02:58.530> about<00:02:58.740> and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
is one I went back and forth about and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.050 
is one I went back and forth about and
my<00:02:59.250> friend<00:02:59.610> Karen<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.090> nice<00:03:00.300> enough<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:02.060> walk

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
my friend Karen was nice enough to walk

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.180 
my friend Karen was nice enough to walk
with<00:03:03.330> me<00:03:03.540> kind<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:04.050> for<00:03:04.320> this<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:04.980> could

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
with me kind of for this so that I could

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.710 
with me kind of for this so that I could
give<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.460> try<00:03:05.670> because<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.970> wasn't<00:03:06.270> sure<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.630> I

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
give it a try because I wasn't sure if I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.970 
give it a try because I wasn't sure if I
was<00:03:06.810> gonna<00:03:06.930> purchase<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.770> many<00:03:07.860> people

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
was gonna purchase it but so many people

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.030 
was gonna purchase it but so many people
wanted<00:03:08.460> information<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.470> now<00:03:10.470> do<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:10.980> think

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
wanted information on it now do I think

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.180 
wanted information on it now do I think
it<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.430> comparable<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.420> brush<00:03:12.660> no<00:03:13.350> not<00:03:14.040> at

it is comparable to this brush no not at

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.250 
it is comparable to this brush no not at
all<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:15.210> I<00:03:15.270> think<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.600> even<00:03:15.690> comparable<00:03:16.170> to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
all do I think it's even comparable to

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.700 
all do I think it's even comparable to
the<00:03:16.470> Mac<00:03:16.650> 188<00:03:17.370> no<00:03:18.030> not<00:03:18.600> at<00:03:18.750> all

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
that however the Sigma one is a little

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.499 
that however the Sigma one is a little
bit<00:05:16.710> more<00:05:16.949> dense<00:05:17.280> for<00:05:17.849> me<00:05:17.969> so<00:05:18.180> it's<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.360> little

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
bit more dense for me so it's a little

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:19.820 
bit more dense for me so it's a little
bit<00:05:18.690> better<00:05:18.840> for<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.139> blush<00:05:19.319> because<00:05:19.500> I<00:05:19.680> also

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
bit better for a blush because I also

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.619 
bit better for a blush because I also
tend<00:05:20.099> to<00:05:20.190> tap<00:05:20.430> blush<00:05:20.699> on<00:05:20.879> and<00:05:21.060> then<00:05:21.180> swirl<00:05:21.509> it

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:21.629 
tend to tap blush on and then swirl it

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:23.360 
tend to tap blush on and then swirl it
in<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:21.960> this<00:05:22.440> seems<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.770> work<00:05:22.860> really<00:05:23.219> well

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
in and this seems to work really well

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.610 
in and this seems to work really well
for<00:05:23.520> that<00:05:23.849> so<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.030> do<00:05:24.120> like<00:05:24.449> that<00:05:24.509> however<00:05:25.139> I

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
for that so I do like that however I

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.320 
for that so I do like that however I
just<00:05:25.889> wanted<00:05:26.099> to<00:05:26.190> make<00:05:26.310> sure<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.520> made<00:05:26.819> note

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
just wanted to make sure I made note

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.559 
just wanted to make sure I made note
that<00:05:27.659> the<00:05:27.870> 131<00:05:28.710> is<00:05:28.949> nothing<00:05:29.669> like<00:05:29.969> the<00:05:30.360> one

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
that the 131 is nothing like the one

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.339 
that the 131 is nothing like the one
thirty<00:05:31.050> two<00:05:31.669> totally<00:05:32.669> different<00:05:32.729> brushes<00:05:33.360> so

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
thirty two totally different brushes so

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.279 
thirty two totally different brushes so
that<00:05:34.770> was<00:05:34.949> my<00:05:35.099> review<00:05:35.279> on<00:05:35.639> the<00:05:35.759> Sigma<00:05:36.060> s<00:05:36.289> s197

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
that was my review on the Sigma s s197

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.629 
that was my review on the Sigma s s197
now<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.740> F<00:05:38.009> 80<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:39.509> Mac<00:05:39.779> 130<00:05:40.590> brush<00:05:41.250> which

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
now the F 80 and the Mac 130 brush which

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.459 
now the F 80 and the Mac 130 brush which
is<00:05:41.789> the<00:05:41.909> dual<00:05:42.090> fibre<00:05:42.419> short<00:05:42.960> one<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.319> then<00:05:43.440> a

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:43.469 
is the dual fibre short one and then a

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:44.959 
is the dual fibre short one and then a
little<00:05:43.560> bit<00:05:43.770> extra<00:05:44.069> information<00:05:44.370> on<00:05:44.729> these

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
little bit extra information on these

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.999 
little bit extra information on these
two<00:05:45.180> but<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.199> just<00:05:46.409> wanted<00:05:46.590> to<00:05:46.680> give<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:46.860> some

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
two but I just wanted to give you some

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.279 
two but I just wanted to give you some
comparison<00:05:47.849> so<00:05:48.000> if<00:05:48.090> you<00:05:48.180> own<00:05:48.360> these<00:05:48.599> you<00:05:49.080> knew

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
comparison so if you own these you knew

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.499 
comparison so if you own these you knew
how<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:50.430> differences<00:05:50.880> were<00:05:51.029> between<00:05:51.060> them

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
how the differences were between them

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:52.700 
how the differences were between them
and<00:05:51.659> whether<00:05:51.750> or<00:05:51.960> not<00:05:52.050> it<00:05:52.259> might<00:05:52.409> help<00:05:52.529> you

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
and whether or not it might help you

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.649 
and whether or not it might help you
decide<00:05:53.430> whether<00:05:53.729> or<00:05:53.819> not<00:05:53.940> you<00:05:54.090> need<00:05:54.240> either<00:05:54.479> of

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
decide whether or not you need either of

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.149 
decide whether or not you need either of
these<00:05:54.810> so<00:05:55.259> I<00:05:55.529> hope<00:05:55.650> you<00:05:55.770> found<00:05:55.919> this<00:05:56.069> review
