fuck<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.140> last<00:04:35.560> hole<00:04:35.800> okay<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:37.060> one<00:04:37.270> just

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
fuck that last hole okay this one just

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.970 
fuck that last hole okay this one just
takes<00:04:37.600> me<00:04:37.690> back<00:04:37.780> here<00:04:38.200> so<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:38.380> think<00:04:38.500> most<00:04:38.890> of

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
takes me back here so I think most of

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.710 
takes me back here so I think most of
the<00:04:39.070> holes<00:04:39.250> are<00:04:39.490> maybe<00:04:40.180> they<00:04:40.330> don't<00:04:40.450> lead<00:04:40.690> to

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
the holes are maybe they don't lead to

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.550 
the holes are maybe they don't lead to
different<00:04:41.050> areas<00:04:41.110> maybe<00:04:41.500> they're<00:04:41.740> just<00:04:41.860> wrong

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
different areas maybe they're just wrong

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.170 
different areas maybe they're just wrong
you<00:04:44.560> know<00:04:44.710> don't<00:04:45.310> stick<00:04:45.580> your<00:04:45.610> bomb<00:04:45.880> in<00:04:46.090> the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
you know don't stick your bomb in the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.930 
you know don't stick your bomb in the
wrong<00:04:46.360> hole<00:04:46.770> could<00:04:47.770> lead<00:04:48.040> to<00:04:48.340> dire<00:04:48.730> dire

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
wrong hole could lead to dire dire

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.420 
wrong hole could lead to dire dire
consequences<00:04:49.680> okay<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:50.890> think<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.250> one<00:04:51.400> I

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
consequences okay so I think the one I

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.610 
consequences okay so I think the one I
went<00:04:51.640> into<00:04:51.850> is<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.270> only<00:04:52.420> write<00:04:52.720> one<00:04:52.990> that

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
went into is the only write one that

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.470 
went into is the only write one that
actually<00:04:53.770> progresses<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.850> level<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:55.330> we'll

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480
