00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.430
 hello all return three new ones 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.990
 photos I was right on Friday 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.330
 at nine and twelve there is in new york ' 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.040
 here at 15 and 12 have come back out 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.940
 three new photos but attentive because 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.460
 it's still 15 and 10 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.170
 I really can not see them for now 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.420
 in the rockstar newsweb nor in 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 twitter but they have uploaded the photos 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.580
 because with the same link of each photo 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.500
 that put v8 v I do not know that I've tried uve 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.000
 9 v 10 and uve 11 and three new ones have come out 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.320
 photos that had not been seen so 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
 I suppose these are the ones that will go up 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.160
 in a few minutes so we go with 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.010
 the first of them 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.080
 you can see the bridge at night 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.230
 there is the port of angels in the background 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.720
 in the distance many buildings of the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.150
 saints to the police helicopter 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.309
 with the focus pointing to one that does not 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.750
 I recognize a lot because he's bald and he seems 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.369
 which has knob the best is 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.140
 just a shadow but it has 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.910
 also an ak-47 like it looked in the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.310
 trailer only this time without 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.680
 silencer so maybe it's true what 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 to customize the weapons down here we see 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.229
 what 's 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.020
 jetsun which is the same as it came out in a 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.790
 in some containers in the trailer and 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.729
 little more I take out of this image so 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.670
 let's go for the next the next 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.770
 image looks a hell is going to be 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.630
 sure hell this time the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 protagonist inside there is again 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.430
 the same as the red trailer car 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.110
 same thing that comes out in the parachute I say that 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 he is the sick because he is also nailed 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.710
 I did not like the 4's 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.000
 I would like more if a 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.950
 veyron or something if it is just like the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.380
 of 4 have changed the shots a little 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.750
 air from here from the side and you're 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.360
 I hope this is just a beta because 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.490
 I honestly expected something else 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.220
 well we see in the background another helicopter 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.280
 police chasing this character 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.470
 there are people out there running and good 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.050
 police cars in the distance and a car 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.750
 blue behind that looks very little but the 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.020
 area that is the roof area I 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.460
 remember a little bit the super diamond is one 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.320
 I was alone in the ballad of gay 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.230
 tony but let's go that just a guess 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.420
 very bad little more can I say 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.060
 so let's move on to the last of the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.060
 photographs in this one also sees a 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.360
 very large river chub is high I know 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.769
 because there in the background suddenly seems 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.390
 that there is a kind of fall because the 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.060
 rest of rocks and mountain looks very 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.489
 down so maybe that's so 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.090
 the best thing right there is a waterfall like 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.160
 is the river has waves so perfect like 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.099
 if there were rapids or something like that in the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.620
 down the river very well finished everything 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.459
 here a big red helicopter in the middle 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.709
 of these to go around flying from the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.709
 small planes from many years ago 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.670
 and it looks very little I sincerely 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.550
 I expected the three photographs today 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.380
 will teach a little more about the city or 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.410
 about maybe some desert but not 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.360
 they have taught almost nothing 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.220
 and it's good because this means 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.130
 that the new photos have already come out and 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.050
 until next time 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.700
 they just came out more pictures I do not know 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.470
 why has he given me to look for v12 and has 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.050
 come out another photo I will look now 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.000
 same v 13 also like that something else comes out 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.720
 but first we go with cloud 12 that I'm going to 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.640
 save the image 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.650
 I'm talking just live while 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.150
 I'm downloading the images for now 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.920
 I'm seeing a ford gt inside the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.390
 truck 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.750
 I'm going to look for v13 to see if I get another one 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.020
 photo no 913 I already get grand theft auto ' 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.770
 five error 404 there is nothing so 4 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.560
 photos I have to put today we go 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.810
 with the last one you see a car 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.690
 a police car around here in the background 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.670
 very rare lights seems to be a 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.640
 stadium what is in the background a stadium 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.850
 like basketball or whatever it looks 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.240
 also a character put in the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.650
 side of a truck these wearing 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.210
 Transforming cars that transport 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.430
 cars and as you said before the car 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.760
 what's in here through the grid 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.260
 back it looks a lot like ford gt the same 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.230
 that we saw in the big picture of value of 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.590
 game of gay tony looks a lot like 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.630
 the ballad of gay tony 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.850
 and then here we see some wheels of the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.380
 change in a little twisted and those of 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.540
 in front of me too so I do not know what game 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.060
 it will be doing the truck that goes 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.960
 lurching is doing eses or something 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.930
 well because the police are pursuing him 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.479
 And now that if you have run out 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.180
 photos because good to give back a 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.360
 last attempt to ub 13 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.669
 we get good that they go to a 14 either 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.590
 come out and if I can put 12 because the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.900
 Rare people who have put 4 photos instead of 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.160
 3 or maybe they have put 4 just for 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.850
 fill in exactly 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.050
 the strip of photographs from the website 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.600
 and exactly that is what they have done 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.400
 I'm looking now and you see in the 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.040
 grid now already if they look exactly 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.680
 three times four I do not think there's going to be 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.390
 more new pictures, well, well, 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.860
 is that this is all I hope you have 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.860
 liked and until next time
