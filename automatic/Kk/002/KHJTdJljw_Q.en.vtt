00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:11.430
 Hi everyone, I have long wanted to share my 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:17.220
 options for your countrymen for your 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:22.869
 Odessa knives and all sorts of personal belongings 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.869
 This is my modest collection. I think that 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.169
 soon it will be replenished 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.619
 but now, as they say, this is not the essence 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:35.040
 everyone knows I think that in our country 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.700
 in Russia it is very difficult to find 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.710
 paracord from which weave 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.210
 various braids for braids 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.390
 to handle knives and the like to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.840
 it can be ordered on ebay 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.360
 before it can wait there for two months but I 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.170
 I think it's time to have a cord 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.240
 alternative is it 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.730
 consists here in such laces which 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.570
 sold in principle in every garment 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.030
 workshop or fabric department cost 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.810
 such marmots is 5 rubles for 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:20.050
 the running meter today is not 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:26.460
 I have such knives here 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.460
 weaving options can consider 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.450
 I do not know maybe someone this 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:38.830
 seem ugly too vulgar 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.410
 but I am personally back in the opinion and lanyard on 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.170
 knife especially on the foldable pocket on the same 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.930
 I consider to be present simply obliged 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:55.000
 Weaving options, too, a bunch of youtube them 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:58.600
 can be found without problems for this you 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.340
 need here let's say this lanyard 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:07.120
 for pockets sharpeners lansky we are here 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.780
 about one and a half meters of grass lace 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.710
 that color well, that is, in the amount of one and a half 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.870
 meter you get one and a half 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.870
 meters of this lace 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.550
 10 minutes of free time scissors and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.360
 lighter i think anyone will be interested in this 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.130
 question youtube instructions have it all 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.140
 beautifully described is told 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.940
 step by step 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.890
 all this can be seen to study 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:43.180
 learn besides 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.570
 design of the knives themselves is also 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.680
 great 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.440
 you can say a means to calm 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:58.020
 nerves i mean anyone loosened 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.020
 the nervous system is simply better not to find 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.170
 Here are the options, that is, you can already there 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.160
 further to modernize 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.910
 Here is my wife offered to buy 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.640
 says these are the type of beads that 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.260
 whether they don't know are called but and here he is 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.530
 lanyard which is under Chris Riva in style 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.360
 chris rea sebenza here i am already here 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.550
 thus decorated as u became 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.550
 a little more fun and interesting 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:41.230
 You can also weave in such bracelets from 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.370
 paracord that also weave from 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.620
 paracord why i think that such 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.470
 lace 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.360
 excellent alternative to paracord 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.860
 yes because it can be very simple 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.930
 find the second he is basically the same 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.960
 durable may not be as durable as 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.790
 paracord but some of its functions it 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.440
 will perform that is and hands on 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.520
 at least you won't break it i don't know 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.380
 how much is a kilogram load 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.569
 endure and most importantly he is a little 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.410
 thinner than paracord ie its diameter 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.060
 over it is thinner and here in this 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.110
 bracelet which is gray now 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:27.580
 removed from the hand can look here about 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.800
 four meters here is this cord to but not 4 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.300
 meters but more than three and a half is me 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.300
 I can say for sure so that with you always 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.020
 there will be the necessary twine in one way or another 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.950
 situations decorating your loved one go 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.150
 haylage and a great hobby 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.460
 if anyone has any other 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.910
 options or someone else somehow in their own way 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.300
 decorates i will be very happy if here 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.760
 there will be video answers and we 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:05.760
 all together we will discuss discuss 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.760
 well that's all thanks so far
