00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this tutorial so let's start well this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.490 
this tutorial so let's start well this
is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.590> final<00:00:37.950> minutes<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:39.300> us<00:00:40.550> usually<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
is the final minutes but us usually the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
is the final minutes but us usually the
illustration<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.510> its<00:00:45.510> own

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
illustration start with its own

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
illustration start with its own
justification<00:00:46.010> index<00:00:47.010> down<00:00:47.280> then<00:00:47.550> some

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
justification index down then some

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.310 
justification index down then some
context<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.950> tittle<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> no<00:00:51.180> s<00:00:51.329> leader<00:00:51.690> in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
context so the tittle is no s leader in

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380

after<00:01:03.329> making<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.960> pile<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:07.500> case<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.979> use

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
after making a pile so I this case I use

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.200 
after making a pile so I this case I use
the<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.810> contact<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.549> continue<00:01:12.000> with

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the first contact to to continue with

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.609 
the first contact to to continue with
with<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> works<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.670> next<00:01:14.810> works<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
with the works so the next works that a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.120 
with the works so the next works that a
has<00:01:17.009> failed<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.290> three

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
has failed it's this one I use three

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.870 
has failed it's this one I use three
base<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.880> visualization<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.500> because<00:01:23.310> i

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
base for visualization and because i

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.569 
base for visualization and because i
think<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:26.700> camera<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.659> perspective

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
think that the camera on the perspective

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.810 
think that the camera on the perspective
it's<00:01:29.579> very<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> start<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.259> point2<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.640> our

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it's very good to start in point2 to our

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.980 
it's very good to start in point2 to our
travel<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.210> valid<00:01:36.630> bump

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
travel like this so this is a valid bump

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.060 
travel like this so this is a valid bump
so<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.240> finally<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:40.860> start<00:01:41.840> another<00:01:42.840> one

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
so and finally I I start another one

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.780 
so and finally I I start another one
this<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.960> more<00:01:45.960> realistic<00:01:46.290> scene<00:01:47.100> satellites

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this is more realistic scene satellites

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.200 
this is more realistic scene satellites
come<00:01:48.240> from<00:01:48.600> some<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> columns<00:01:50.210> another

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
come from some of the columns another

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.639 
come from some of the columns another

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
light the foreground along this is some

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.469 
light the foreground along this is some
of<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:57.210> profits<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:59.369> start<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
of the profits but let's start with the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
see when you do that the idiot finally

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:49.490 
see when you do that the idiot finally
some<00:04:42.230> 34<00:04:43.230> aground<00:04:43.670> to<00:04:44.670> that<00:04:45.420> is<00:04:48.170> the<00:04:49.170> more

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
some 34 aground to that is the more

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.500 
some 34 aground to that is the more
nearest<00:04:50.250> point<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.080> deep<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:54.000> B<00:04:54.180> port

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.480 
of the minutes from the be able point
finally<00:05:00.180> some<00:05:00.960> adjustment<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:01.890> colors

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
finally some adjustment of colors

finally some adjustment of colors
constant<00:05:03.350> contrast<00:05:04.430> consider<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:06.510> finally

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
constant contrast consider so finally

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.550 
constant contrast consider so finally
you<00:05:07.560> have<00:05:07.890> some<00:05:09.200> limits<00:05:10.200> this<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:11.870> this<00:05:12.870> three

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
you have some limits this is this three

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:23.350 
you have some limits this is this three
feet<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:18.260> initial<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:22.080> initial

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
feet to the initial to initial

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.030 
feet to the initial to initial
definition<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.430> other<00:05:26.430> innings<00:05:27.500> but<00:05:28.500> I

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
definition of the other innings but I

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.970 
definition of the other innings but I
think<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.640> in<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.090> front<00:05:30.360> leg<00:05:30.570> was<00:05:30.780> so<00:05:31.080> it

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
think that in the front leg was so it

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.170 
think that in the front leg was so it
will<00:05:32.220> be<00:05:32.250> empty<00:05:32.930> so<00:05:33.930> I<00:05:34.230> decided<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:35.070> add<00:05:35.610> some

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
will be empty so I decided to add some

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.390 
will be empty so I decided to add some
more<00:05:37.580> modification<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:41.250> the

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
more modification to this to the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.040 
more modification to this to the
specification<00:05:42.300> so<00:05:42.810> I<00:05:43.050> add<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:44.540> the<00:05:45.540> monster

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
specification so I add a the monster

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.690 
specification so I add a the monster
that<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:48.330> was<00:05:48.660> almost<00:05:49.110> next<00:05:50.479> phases<00:05:51.479> that<00:05:52.410> are
