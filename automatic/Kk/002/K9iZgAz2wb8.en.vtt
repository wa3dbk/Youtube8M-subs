00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
existed until I played AVP 2010 so yeah

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.649 
existed until I played AVP 2010 so yeah
I<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.709> like<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.189> because<00:02:40.579> I<00:02:40.849> worked<00:02:41.329> so

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
I really like this because I worked so

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.069 
I really like this because I worked so
hard<00:02:41.689> on<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:42.170> detail<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:44.379> hot<00:02:45.379> glue<00:02:45.709> gunned

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
hard on this detail I hot glue gunned

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.020 
hard on this detail I hot glue gunned
there<00:02:48.079> was<00:02:48.230> holes<00:02:48.500> all<00:02:49.340> along<00:02:50.090> here<00:02:52.030> because

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
there was holes all along here because

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.599 
there was holes all along here because
it<00:02:53.299> wasn't<00:02:53.629> completed<00:02:54.109> I<00:02:54.440> kind<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.459> had<00:02:55.579> to

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
it wasn't completed I kind of had to

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.550 
it wasn't completed I kind of had to
fill<00:02:55.879> in<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.090> space<00:02:56.329> but<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:56.959> think<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.379> worked

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
fill in the space but I think it worked

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.960 
fill in the space but I think it worked
out<00:02:57.709> really<00:02:57.889> good<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.189> looks<00:02:58.340> smooth<00:02:58.700> and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
out really good it looks smooth and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.780 
out really good it looks smooth and
everything<00:02:59.120> but<00:03:00.109> then<00:03:00.349> I<00:03:00.379> made<00:03:00.680> these<00:03:00.889> custom

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
everything but then I made these custom

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.979 
everything but then I made these custom
ridges<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:03.739> little<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.599> want<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.659> say<00:03:05.780> air

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
bit if you put it like in the middle

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.990 
bit if you put it like in the middle
like<00:04:19.639> this<00:04:20.199> but<00:04:21.199> yeah<00:04:21.950> other<00:04:22.219> than<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:22.490> she's

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
like this but yeah other than that she's

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.040

perfect

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.510 

she's<00:04:27.050> got<00:04:27.200> good<00:04:27.380> articulation<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:31.250> because

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
she's got good articulation and because

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.330 
she's got good articulation and because
it's<00:04:31.700> following<00:04:31.910> me<00:04:32.150> kinda<00:04:32.630> helps<00:04:33.500> was<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:34.190> not

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
it's following me kinda helps was it not

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.400 
it's following me kinda helps was it not
hindering<00:04:34.850> anything<00:04:35.300> because<00:04:35.600> everything

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
hindering anything because everything

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.850

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.060 
and yesterday else does open she doesn't
she<00:04:40.040> can't<00:04:41.230> stick<00:04:42.230> out<00:04:42.380> on<00:04:42.590> her<00:04:42.680> tongue<00:04:42.860> but<00:04:43.040> I

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
she can't stick out on her tongue but I

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.950
