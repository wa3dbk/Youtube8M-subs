image all the way on the right side is

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:49.619 
image all the way on the right side is
the<00:00:48.550> right<00:00:48.760> side<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.149> image<00:00:49.239> so<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.600> image

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
the right side of the image so the image

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.900 
the right side of the image so the image
is<00:00:49.960> actually<00:00:50.559> preserved<00:00:50.739> left<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.460> right<00:00:51.609> in<00:00:51.820> a

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
is actually preserved left to right in a

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.360 
is actually preserved left to right in a
waveform<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.870> up<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.289> down<00:00:53.469> is<00:00:53.829> simply<00:00:54.340> a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
waveform the up and down is simply a

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.009 
waveform the up and down is simply a
measurement<00:00:54.699> of<00:00:54.879> how<00:00:55.000> bright<00:00:55.420> that<00:00:55.449> part<00:00:55.960> of

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
measurement of how bright that part of

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.740 
measurement of how bright that part of
the<00:00:56.109> image<00:00:56.320> is<00:00:56.530> at<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.730> bottom<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:58.300> have<00:00:58.329> 0

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
the image is at the bottom you have 0

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.349 
the image is at the bottom you have 0
which<00:00:58.929> is<00:00:59.050> pure<00:00:59.289> black<00:00:59.649> at<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.250> top<00:01:00.460> 100<00:01:01.179> which

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
which is pure black at the top 100 which

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.479 
which is pure black at the top 100 which
is<00:01:01.390> pure<00:01:01.750> white<00:01:02.019> so<00:01:02.679> when<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:02.920> look<00:01:03.190> at<00:01:03.309> an

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
is pure white so when you look at an

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.270 
is pure white so when you look at an
image<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.940> can<00:01:04.120> get<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.449> pretty<00:01:05.019> instant<00:01:05.950> guess

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
image you can get a pretty instant guess

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.310 
image you can get a pretty instant guess
as<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.730> how<00:01:06.880> your<00:01:07.090> exposure<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.660> doing<00:01:08.080> and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
as to how your exposure is doing and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.110 
as to how your exposure is doing and
where<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:08.680> might<00:01:08.830> have<00:01:09.040> trouble<00:01:09.280> in<00:01:09.580> terms<00:01:09.820> of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
where you might have trouble in terms of

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.450 
where you might have trouble in terms of
to<00:01:10.570> dark<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.170> shadows<00:01:11.200> or<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.980> bright<00:01:12.250> and

to dark and the shadows or to bright and
the<00:01:12.520> highlights<00:01:12.880> now<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:14.020> image<00:01:14.290> we<00:01:14.470> have

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
the highlights now the image we have

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.679 
the highlights now the image we have
here<00:01:15.040> we've<00:01:15.340> made<00:01:15.369> a<00:01:15.670> little<00:01:16.000> bit<00:01:16.180> contrast

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
here we've made a little bit contrast

here we've made a little bit contrast
see<00:01:16.869> just<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.290> show<00:01:17.500> how<00:01:17.860> much<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.340> waveform

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
see just to show how much the waveform

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.090 
see just to show how much the waveform
can<00:01:18.909> change<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.960> see<00:01:20.170> on<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.500> left<00:01:20.740> side<00:01:20.950> of

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
screen it's very dark and you can see

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.149 
screen it's very dark and you can see
that<00:01:25.270> reflected<00:01:25.960> in<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.290> waveform<00:01:26.740> monitor

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
that reflected in the waveform monitor

similarly in the center there's some
overexposed<00:01:33.130> highlight<00:01:33.640> areas<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.360> see

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
overexposed highlight areas and you see

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.380 
overexposed highlight areas and you see
that<00:01:34.780> represented<00:01:35.500> up<00:01:35.649> here<00:01:35.979> at<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.490> top<00:01:36.729> now

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
that represented up here at the top now

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.030 
that represented up here at the top now
there's<00:01:37.600> also<00:01:37.780> areas<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.439> are<00:01:38.590> sort<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:38.890> in

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
there's also areas that are sort of in

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.889 
there's also areas that are sort of in
the<00:01:39.130> middle<00:01:39.399> like<00:01:39.579> these<00:01:39.729> bushes<00:01:40.210> here<00:01:40.479> where

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
the middle like these bushes here where

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.230 
the middle like these bushes here where
the<00:01:41.140> brighter<00:01:41.380> areas<00:01:41.920> on<00:01:42.189> this<00:01:42.369> side<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.880> you

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
the brighter areas on this side and you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.240 
the brighter areas on this side and you
can<00:01:43.420> see<00:01:43.630> those<00:01:43.810> represented<00:01:44.530> more<00:01:45.009> in<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
can see those represented more in the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.359 
can see those represented more in the
middle<00:01:45.579> of<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.820> waveform<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.649> great<00:01:47.979> way

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
middle of the waveform it's a great way

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.209 
middle of the waveform it's a great way
to<00:01:48.850> tell<00:01:49.180> if<00:01:49.509> your<00:01:49.570> image<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.380> still<00:01:50.619> safe<00:01:50.950> and

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
to tell if your image is still safe and
