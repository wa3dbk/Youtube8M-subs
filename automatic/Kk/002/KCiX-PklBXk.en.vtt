00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 and light blue 2 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.210
 This is a multicolor LED lamp 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.910
 medium power 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.710
 e27 base and control options 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.529
 via wireless bluetooth 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.420
 low energy 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.130
 this standard is incompatible with the classic 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.840
 bluetooth and different from it before 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.050
 more simple controllers 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.849
 have less consumption 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 the lamp has a massive base of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.650
 painted with gray metal paint she 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.710
 acts as a radiator and body 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.809
 e- filling above it is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.390
 matt white cap cylindrical 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.050
 forms under the hood are placed 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.489
 LEDs lamp is quite compact and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.000
 suitable for installation 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.660
 traditional incandescent bulbs 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.940
 possibility of adjustment is provided 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 color shade and temperature in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.879
 limits from 1 thousand 700 to 6500 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.370
 Kelvin real consumption in idle 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.230
 is about one watt a while 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 work at maximum brightness almost 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.159
 reaches 8 watts maximum brightness 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.650
 lamp is 500 lumen work time 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.750
 20,000 hours and and light blue 2 capable 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.070
 work with voltages from 100 to 240 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.670
 Volt and frequency of 50-60 hertz 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.159
 the device is focused on 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.409
 indoor use after 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.479
 lamp installation need to download a special 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.040
 smartphone or tablet application 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.100
 enable on mobile device 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.150
 bluetooth and run the program 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.479
 significant differences in the program 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.820
 ios and android are not able to lamp 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.890
 after disconnecting from the power supply 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.689
 not remembered every time she 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.210
 turns on white to full 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.729
 brightness to control the lamp is necessary 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.189
 be close to her range 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.049
 Depends on smartphone model features 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.180
 interference and other layouts 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.390
 external factors remote control 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.799
 via the Internet is impossible when working with 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.100
 a dozen lamps is not excluded the appearance 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.939
 delays during operation 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.710
 direct lamp control 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.450
 realized only from a smartphone or 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.700
 tablet 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.979
 means of controlling and limiting access to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.959
 the lamp has no settings in 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.150
 the program has a little opportunity 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.069
 lamp name changes and update 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.950
 firmware can be controlled immediately 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.410
 several selected sand lamps 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.620
 three modes are provided first mode 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.540
 colors is designed to work with color. 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.970
 You can adjust the brightness and choose a color with 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.069
 using the dial it is simple and 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.890
 convenient but does not provide the required 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.410
 accuracy is possible to establish 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.290
 lamp on or off time but 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.819
 it does not always work correctly mode 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400
 sunshine is used to control 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.709
 white light brightness and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.510
 color temperature third mode 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.940
 lamp operation provides change 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.769
 flowers according to the program can be set 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.360
 color change rate and choose from 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.209
 palette set of four colors 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.069
 brightness in this mode is not adjustable beyond 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.769
 This program continues to work and 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.150
 after turning off the application 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.829
 provides for the use of scenes that 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.599
 are a set of predefined 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.459
 installations without reference to the schedule or 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.760
 timer, if desired, you can add 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.769
 own scenes drive mode use 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.810
 signal coming from the microphone of the smartphone 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.910
 to dynamically change the brightness and 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.850
 colors of lamp settings and complex algorithms 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.889
 sound analysis it does not have a set of functions 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.630
 the proposed program is quite expected 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.609
 but in terms of potential disclosure 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.359
 such decisions are made all the same 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.430
 the lamp turns on too little with tangible 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.590
 but not too annoying with the delay 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.989
 lamp efficiency as a light source 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.410
 significantly lower than the best representatives among 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.819
 sire diode lamps two years ago 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.310
 good color characteristics 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.970
 the light is moderately warm and fairly white 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.889
 the spectrum is filled evenly by the lamp and and 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.930
 light blue 2 may be useful in 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.790
 certain usage scenarios like 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.590
 at home and in commercial 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.150
 sector however to manage 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.920
 the device needs a smartphone or 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.170
 bluetooth enabled tablet low 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.359
 energy control is only possible on 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.609
 short distance there is no function 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.099
 access restrictions and integration into 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.840
 automation systems and job functions in 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.840
 offline mode significantly limited 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.400
 proprietary utility for android and ios 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.020
 copes well with its 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.150
 duties 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.360
 has but does not differ wide 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.360
 opportunities
