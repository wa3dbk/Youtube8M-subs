00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
times which was a pain because I'm a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.819 
times which was a pain because I'm a
horrible<00:01:35.250> memory<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.530> basically<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.680> have

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
horrible memory and basically you have

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.200 
horrible memory and basically you have
to<00:01:37.860> follow<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.579> path<00:01:38.790> it's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
to follow this little path it's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
to follow this little path it's
different<00:01:39.810> each<00:01:39.869> time<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> had<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.070> no

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
different each time so I had to no

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
different each time so I had to no
record<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.659> fraps<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:43.439> watch<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
record it with fraps and then watch it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670 
record it with fraps and then watch it
over<00:01:44.369> again<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.479> path<00:01:45.750> some

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
over again to get the right path some

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.550 
over again to get the right path some
yeah<00:01:47.390> pretty<00:01:48.390> good<00:01:48.479> tactic<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
yeah pretty good tactic and that
