just going to use that around the
peripherals<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.400> our<00:02:41.520> face<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.050> to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
peripherals of our face so you want to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.080 
peripherals of our face so you want to
take<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.260> over<00:02:43.410> your<00:02:43.620> hairline<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.070> down<00:02:44.730> your

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
take it over your hairline and down your

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.290 
take it over your hairline and down your
cheekbones<00:02:45.690> if<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.700> don't<00:02:47.880> want<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> bronze

cheekbones if you don't want a bronze

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.430 
cheekbones if you don't want a bronze
you<00:02:48.480> don't<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.959> but<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.140> think<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.410> just

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
you don't have to but I think it just

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.990 
you don't have to but I think it just
gives<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.860> more<00:02:50.070> dimension<00:02:50.580> especially

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
gives you more dimension especially

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:04.990 
gives you more dimension especially
after<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.360> put<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.630> foundational<00:02:52.260> over

I've<00:03:24.780> noticed<00:03:25.410> with<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.860> particular

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
I've noticed with this particular

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.010 
I've noticed with this particular
formula<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.790> can't<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.240> do<00:03:27.390> one<00:03:27.660> sweet

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
formula you can't just do one sweet

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.750 
formula you can't just do one sweet
because<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.440> kind<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.710> blends<00:03:29.160> into<00:03:29.370> your<00:03:29.580> skin

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
because it kind of blends into your skin

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.220 
because it kind of blends into your skin
color<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.120> doesn't<00:03:30.480> stay<00:03:30.630> as<00:03:30.750> vibrant<00:03:36.230> then

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
color and doesn't stay as vibrant then

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.510 
color and doesn't stay as vibrant then
we're<00:03:37.440> going<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.590> use<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:37.740> highlighter<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.400> is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
called light sweep by Mac it's a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.230 
called light sweep by Mac it's a
sculpting<00:03:40.740> powder<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.280> what<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.820> really<00:03:42.060> like

concealer so we're gonna go ahead and do
that<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.420> also<00:03:48.540> use<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.110> as<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.410> highlighter<00:03:49.770> in

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
would be like the 328 from Inglot or any

would be like the 328 from Inglot or any
other<00:04:11.459> color<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:11.970> guys<00:04:12.180> like<00:04:12.480> but<00:04:13.350> this

other color that you guys like but this

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.290 
other color that you guys like but this
one<00:04:13.709> gives<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.070> a<00:04:14.130> little<00:04:14.250> bit<00:04:14.459> more<00:04:15.000> shimmer

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.790 
I find that this really helps to
brighten<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.240> entire<00:04:33.750> under<00:04:34.169> eye<00:04:34.199> area<00:04:34.620> as
