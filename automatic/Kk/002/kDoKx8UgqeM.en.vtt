00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
I don't know I just wanted to grow sugar

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.170 
I don't know I just wanted to grow sugar
cane<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.659> top<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.020> world<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:25.610> I'm<00:01:25.850> not

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
cane to the top of the world and I'm not

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.670 
cane to the top of the world and I'm not
sure<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:26.479> this<00:01:26.630> works<00:01:26.869> on<00:01:26.990> survival<00:01:27.470> I'm<00:01:27.530> not

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
sure if this works on survival I'm not

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.950 
sure if this works on survival I'm not
sure<00:01:27.799> but<00:01:27.979> since<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.939> sugar<00:01:29.149> cane<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:29.570> on<00:01:29.689> top

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
sure but since the sugar cane is on top

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.609 
sure but since the sugar cane is on top
of<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.140> world<00:01:31.539> what<00:01:32.539> you<00:01:32.659> do<00:01:32.810> when<00:01:33.350> you're<00:01:33.500> on

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
of the world what you do when you're on

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.180 
of the world what you do when you're on
top<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:33.920> sugars<00:01:34.340> can<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:35.240> just<00:01:35.420> mine<00:01:35.720> down

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
top of sugars can you just mine down

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.219 
top of sugars can you just mine down
like<00:01:37.190> really<00:01:37.429> fast<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:37.940> boom<00:01:38.390> better<00:01:39.049> off

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
like really fast and boom better off

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.460 
like really fast and boom better off
broken<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:41.330> I'm<00:01:41.479> chef<00:01:41.659> crane<00:01:41.840> falls<00:01:42.110> on<00:01:42.259> head

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
broken and I'm chef crane falls on head

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.910 
broken and I'm chef crane falls on head
but<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:43.869> cover<00:01:44.869> up<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.140> water<00:01:48.520> better<00:01:49.520> okay

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
but just cover up the water better okay

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.199 
but just cover up the water better okay
I'm<00:01:51.920> not<00:01:52.069> sure<00:01:52.159> if<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:52.429> works<00:01:52.670> on<00:01:52.759> survival

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
I'm not sure if this works on survival

00:01:53.209 --> 00:02:03.039 
I'm not sure if this works on survival
or<00:01:53.270> not<00:01:53.509> but<00:01:57.789> broken<00:01:59.049> no<00:02:00.049> yeah<00:02:01.630> do<00:02:02.630> place<00:02:02.840> like

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
or not but broken no yeah do place like

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.859 
or not but broken no yeah do place like
any<00:02:03.289> block<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:04.039> think<00:02:04.280> yeah<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.450> place<00:02:05.659> any

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
any block I think yeah you place any

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.660 
any block I think yeah you place any
block<00:02:06.170> there<00:02:06.439> I'll<00:02:06.560> turns<00:02:06.799> back<00:02:07.070> into<00:02:07.100> bedrock

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
block there I'll turns back into bedrock

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.609 
block there I'll turns back into bedrock
and<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.600> can't<00:02:08.780> break<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.049> but<00:02:09.170> when

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
and then you can't break it but when

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.630 
and then you can't break it but when
you're<00:02:09.709> not<00:02:09.829> creative<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.190> can<00:02:10.280> break<00:02:10.489> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
you're not creative you can break the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.930 
you're not creative you can break the
top<00:02:10.880> ones<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:12.680> not<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.400> bottom<00:02:13.549> one<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:15.940> just

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
top ones but not the bottom one so just

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.120 
top ones but not the bottom one so just
completely<00:02:17.750> ran<00:02:18.109> the<00:02:18.260> glitch<00:02:18.440> I'm<00:02:18.650> not<00:02:18.920> sure

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
completely ran the glitch I'm not sure

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.930 
completely ran the glitch I'm not sure
if<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.310> works<00:02:19.489> on<00:02:19.609> survival<00:02:20.030> again<00:02:20.299> but<00:02:24.940> and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
if it works on survival again but and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.030 
if it works on survival again but and
I'm<00:02:26.120> not<00:02:26.660> sure<00:02:26.930> if<00:02:27.049> you<00:02:27.200> need<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.500> think<00:02:27.859> it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
I'm not sure if you need a think it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.430
