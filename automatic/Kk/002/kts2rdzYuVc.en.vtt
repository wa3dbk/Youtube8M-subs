bearings it says install on 180 out of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
bearings it says install on 180 out of
phase<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:03.989> gonna<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.199> worrying

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
phase but we're not gonna be worrying

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.690 
phase but we're not gonna be worrying
about<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> bearings<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.400> now

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
about the bearings for now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.310 
about the bearings for now
I<00:01:05.729> mean<00:01:06.060> worrying<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.659> three<00:01:06.960> things

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
I mean worrying about these three things

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.289 
I mean worrying about these three things
well<00:01:07.680> basically<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.280> two<00:01:08.340> things<00:01:08.820> these<00:01:09.060> go

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
well basically these two things these go

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.050 
well basically these two things these go
in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.840> oil<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.740> oil<00:01:10.770> pump<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.430> then

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
in the oil and the oil pump and then

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.719 
in the oil and the oil pump and then
this<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.020> spacer<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.220> space<00:01:14.490> out

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
this this is just a spacer to space out

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.990 
this this is just a spacer to space out
what<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> would<00:01:15.689> normally<00:01:16.229> use<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:17.310> sprocket

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
what you would normally use a sprocket

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.690 
what you would normally use a sprocket
you<00:01:18.479> put<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.860> between<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you put this in between there and it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.810 
you put this in between there and it
takes<00:01:20.880> place<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> sprocket<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.950> um<00:01:23.310> you've

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
takes place of the sprocket so um you've

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.780 
takes place of the sprocket so um you've
got<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> two<00:01:24.180> bearings<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> front

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
got the two bearings for the front

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.880 
got the two bearings for the front
dollars<00:01:26.790> balance<00:01:27.509> shaft<00:01:27.720> basically<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> put

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
dollars balance shaft basically you put

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.670 
dollars balance shaft basically you put
them<00:01:28.979> 180<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.880> phase<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> back<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
them 180 out of phase but the back one I

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.170 
them 180 out of phase but the back one I
don't<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.310> matters<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
don't think it really matters because it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.910 
don't think it really matters because it
has<00:01:33.299> no<00:01:33.509> hole<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.770> you're

has no hole in it so this is what you're

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.990

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
the feed tube here's a stubby shaft and

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.119 
the feed tube here's a stubby shaft and
here's<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.670> sprocket<00:02:18.239> this<00:02:19.170> sprocket<00:02:19.500> goes

right in here right in here alright so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.650 
right in here right in here alright so
basically<00:02:25.680> where<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> dot<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.360> facing

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
basically where the dot is it's facing

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.199 
basically where the dot is it's facing
up<00:02:28.019> so<00:02:28.319> this<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> stubby<00:02:29.700> shaft<00:02:29.940> goes

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
up so this so the stubby shaft goes

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.410 
up so this so the stubby shaft goes
right<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.629> there<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:32.390> there's<00:02:33.390> only

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
right in there like this there's only

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690 
right in there like this there's only
one<00:02:33.599> way<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.049> can<00:02:34.319> put<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.709> there<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.580> then

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
one way you can put it in there and then

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.009 
one way you can put it in there and then
you<00:02:35.849> screw<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.299> bolt<00:02:36.569> down<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:42.660> want<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.900> put

it's starves the shaft right here which

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.970 
it's starves the shaft right here which
can<00:03:04.680> lead<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.599> serious<00:03:06.599> engine<00:03:07.170> damage<00:03:07.590> in
