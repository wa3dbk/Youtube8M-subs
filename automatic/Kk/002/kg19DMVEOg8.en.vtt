I've<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.570> marked<00:01:49.079> them<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.350> using<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> fine

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
I've just marked them on using a fine

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.830 
I've just marked them on using a fine
liner<00:01:50.280> first<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.149> easier<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> do

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
liner first so that it's easier to do

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 
liner first so that it's easier to do
and<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.710> I'm<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.310> use<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.610> black

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and then I'm just going to use my black

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.480 
and then I'm just going to use my black
threads<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> go<00:01:55.229> over<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:55.680> lines<00:01:55.950> using<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
threads and go over these lines using a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.580 
threads and go over these lines using a
chain<00:01:56.790> stitch<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.290> looks

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
chain stitch so here is what that looks

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.310 
chain stitch so here is what that looks
like<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:02:00.090> using<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.540> chain<00:02:00.780> stitch<00:02:01.049> but

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
like and I'm using a chain stitch but

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.109 
like and I'm using a chain stitch but
I'm<00:02:01.409> only<00:02:01.590> using<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.189> because<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.759> just

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
I'm only using that because I just

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.670 
I'm only using that because I just
learnt<00:02:03.360> how<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.079> wanted<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
blanket stitch all the way is what your

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.470 
blanket stitch all the way is what your
little<00:02:32.070> leaf<00:02:32.340> should<00:02:32.550> look<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.940> once<00:02:33.240> you're

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
done as you can see I haven't added any

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.670 
done as you can see I haven't added any
stuffing<00:02:36.420> because<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.660> wanted<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.230> be<00:02:37.350> flat

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
stuffing because I wanted it to be flat

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800 
stuffing because I wanted it to be flat
but<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.460> can<00:02:38.730> add<00:02:38.910> some<00:02:39.150> stuffing<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.660> you

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
but you can add some stuffing if you

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.140 
but you can add some stuffing if you
want<00:02:40.280> okay<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.340> now<00:02:41.580> we're<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
want okay so now we're just going to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.810 
want okay so now we're just going to
attach<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.600> leaf<00:02:42.750> onto<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.650> face<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.550> this

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
attach the leaf onto the face like this
