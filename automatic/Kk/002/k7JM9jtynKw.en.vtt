hello and welcome to this very short

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.400 
hello and welcome to this very short
tutorial<00:00:05.450> in<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:06.569> tutorial<00:00:06.629> going<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> make

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
tutorial in this tutorial going to make

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.749 
tutorial in this tutorial going to make
turn<00:00:08.010> shading<00:00:08.519> or<00:00:09.240> two<00:00:09.480> ways<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.960> make<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.040> toon

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
turn shading or two ways to make a toon

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.620 
turn shading or two ways to make a toon
shaded<00:00:12.210> object<00:00:12.599> first<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.530> gotta<00:00:13.710> q<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.630> then

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
shaded object first we gotta q and then

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.970 
shaded object first we gotta q and then
we're<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.260> into<00:00:16.560> our<00:00:20.600> scene<00:00:21.600> buttons<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.650> 10

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
we're going into our scene buttons of 10

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.529 
we're going into our scene buttons of 10
and<00:00:23.310> then<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.269> go<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.380> output<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.330> say<00:00:27.330> edge

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and then we go in the output I say edge

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.230 
and then we go in the output I say edge
i<00:00:28.050> click<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.830> edge<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.279> then<00:00:29.580> edge<00:00:29.760> settings

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
i click on edge and then edge settings

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.010 
i click on edge and then edge settings
now<00:00:31.250> here<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.309> 10<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.910> 410<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> micro

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
now here is 10 it's 410 so a micro

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.010 
now here is 10 it's 410 so a micro
render<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:35.610> these<00:00:35.730> lines<00:00:36.020> but

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
render and now you see these lines but

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
render and now you see these lines but
now<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.680> make<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.850> higher<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:40.320> 255<00:00:41.570> okay

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
now if I make this higher like 255 okay

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.779 
now if I make this higher like 255 okay
that's<00:00:42.809> no<00:00:42.989> big<00:00:43.410> wire<00:00:43.649> frame<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.670> it's

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
that's no big wire frame on this so it's

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.690 
that's no big wire frame on this so it's
a<00:00:44.850> tab<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.480> subdivide<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.289> sometimes<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
a tab and I subdivide this sometimes and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.290 
a tab and I subdivide this sometimes and
I<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> render<00:00:48.239> again<00:00:48.890> but<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.730> set

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I make a render again but if you set

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.630 
I make a render again but if you set
that<00:00:51.420> value<00:00:51.840> higher<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.430> with

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that value higher you will see with

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.260 
that value higher you will see with
objects<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.360> much<00:00:54.570> add<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.969> given

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
objects with much add it will be given

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.310 
objects with much add it will be given
more<00:00:57.360> lines<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.530> simple<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> shading

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
more lines so this is simple to shading

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.920 
more lines so this is simple to shading
but<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:02.190> make<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.550> two<00:01:02.730> shading<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> has

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
but to make the two shading like it has

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.200 
but to make the two shading like it has
to<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> other<00:01:05.549> way<00:01:05.729> with

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to be you have to do the other way with

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
to be you have to do the other way with
materials<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> control<00:01:07.590> x<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.100> erase

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
materials so it's a control x and erase

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
materials so it's a control x and erase
all<00:01:10.970> for<00:01:12.080> this<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.500> shade<00:01:13.740> i'm<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
all for this to in shade i'm going to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.929 
all for this to in shade i'm going to
use<00:01:14.490> another<00:01:15.000> object<00:01:15.380> another<00:01:16.380> cube<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> say

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
use another object another cube so I say

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.289 
use another object another cube so I say
X<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.990> space<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.500> add<00:01:19.650> UV<00:01:20.250> sphere<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.000> say

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
X and space you add UV sphere and say

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.640 
X and space you add UV sphere and say
tap<00:01:21.540> let's<00:01:22.409> move<00:01:23.420> in<00:01:24.420> camera<00:01:24.780> view<00:01:24.990> yeah<00:01:25.290> okay

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
tap let's move in camera view yeah okay

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.149 
tap let's move in camera view yeah okay
i'm<00:01:26.090> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> select<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.509> camera<00:01:27.979> after<00:01:28.979> that

i'm going to select a camera after that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.060 
i'm going to select a camera after that

render so make the preview here yeah and
now<00:02:18.879> we<00:02:18.939> add<00:02:19.150> new<00:02:20.189> material<00:02:21.189> and<00:02:21.370> i'm<00:02:22.000> going<00:02:22.299> to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
now we add new material and i'm going to

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.970 
now we add new material and i'm going to
call<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:22.989> is<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:25.439> so<00:02:26.439> it's<00:02:26.530> looking<00:02:26.650> right

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.759 
call it is this so it's looking right
now<00:02:27.040> like<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.700> okay<00:02:28.060> can<00:02:28.209> be<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> bit<00:02:28.510> strong

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.449 

hello<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.879> camera<00:02:34.239> view<00:02:34.450> looks<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:35.079> this

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.569 

but<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.670> isn't<00:02:40.319> too<00:02:41.319> shaded<00:02:41.859> right<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:42.220> but

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
but it isn't too shaded right now but

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.080 
but it isn't too shaded right now but
really<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:44.349> we<00:02:44.650> don't<00:02:44.769> need<00:02:44.950> links<00:02:45.400> pipelines

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
really so we don't need links pipelines

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.160 
really so we don't need links pipelines
nope<00:02:46.750> material<00:02:47.290> or<00:02:47.409> color<00:02:48.129> branding<00:02:48.959> but<00:02:49.959> we

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
nope material or color branding but we

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.280 
nope material or color branding but we
need<00:02:50.290> your<00:02:50.560> shaders<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:52.510> turn<00:02:53.109> up

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
need your shaders and can turn up

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.089 
need your shaders and can turn up
specularity<00:02:55.109> much<00:02:57.629> much<00:02:58.629> reflection<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.409> bit

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
specularity much much reflection a bit

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.170 
specularity much much reflection a bit
more<00:03:00.220> harness<00:03:01.260> no<00:03:02.260> 50<00:03:02.829> again<00:03:03.129> sorry<00:03:03.700> that's

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
more harness no 50 again sorry that's

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.860 
more harness no 50 again sorry that's
good<00:03:04.359> and<00:03:05.139> then<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.609> get<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.209> tune<00:03:07.420> shading

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
good and then to get the tune shading

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.979 
good and then to get the tune shading
effect<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.439> see<00:03:08.650> Lou<00:03:08.889> I<00:03:09.280> can't<00:03:09.700> spell<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.239> but

effect you see Lou I can't spell it but

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.500 
effect you see Lou I can't spell it but
there's<00:03:11.260> tune<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.920> here<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:12.730> go<00:03:12.819> also<00:03:13.269> tune

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
there's tune and here we go also tune

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.220 
there's tune and here we go also tune
and<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.680> always<00:03:14.859> thing<00:03:15.760> we<00:03:16.450> have<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.659> do<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.959> move

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
and I always thing we have to do is move

and I always thing we have to do is move
this<00:03:17.409> up<00:03:17.470> at<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.069> white<00:03:18.430> ball<00:03:18.669> and<00:03:19.199> also<00:03:20.199> sighs

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
this up at a white ball and also sighs

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.270 
this up at a white ball and also sighs
this<00:03:21.879> one<00:03:22.120> up<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.480> smooth<00:03:22.900> up<00:03:23.139> and<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:24.069> white

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
this one up and smooth up and the white

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.680 
this one up and smooth up and the white
ball<00:03:24.459> must<00:03:24.699> be<00:03:24.849> bigger<00:03:25.090> no<00:03:25.359> must<00:03:26.260> be<00:03:26.319> smaller

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
ball must be bigger no must be smaller

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:36.330 
ball must be bigger no must be smaller
but<00:03:28.690> can<00:03:28.930> be<00:03:29.079> smooth<00:03:29.349> still<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:35.069> take<00:03:36.069> moose

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
but can be smooth still and take moose

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.319 
but can be smooth still and take moose
must<00:03:36.849> be<00:03:37.000> bigger<00:03:37.859> bit<00:03:39.659> smoothie<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:43.000> little

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
must be bigger bit smoothie and little

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.569 
must be bigger bit smoothie and little
bit<00:03:43.419> smaller<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.930> there<00:03:44.680> we<00:03:44.799> got<00:03:44.949> our<00:03:45.159> tune

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
bit smaller and there we got our tune

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:54.719 
bit smaller and there we got our tune
shade<00:03:46.030> effect<00:03:47.519> oops<00:03:48.599> I<00:03:49.599> save<00:03:50.109> 12<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:53.639> there<00:03:54.639> we

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
shade effect oops I save 12 and there we

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.699 
shade effect oops I save 12 and there we
got<00:03:54.849> our<00:03:55.030> tune<00:03:55.269> she<00:03:55.479> ate<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.569> bowl<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.079> that's

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
got our tune she ate a bowl and that's

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.089 
got our tune she ate a bowl and that's
how<00:03:56.919> you<00:03:56.979> make<00:03:57.489> don't<00:03:58.030> shadings<00:03:58.479> on<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:59.739> right

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
how you make don't shadings on the right

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.119 
how you make don't shadings on the right
way<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.909> old<00:04:01.090> way<00:04:01.359> was<00:04:01.389> just<00:04:01.989> that<00:04:02.889> etch

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
way the old way was just that etch

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.699 
way the old way was just that etch
settings<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.919> get<00:04:05.919> that<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:07.260> that's<00:04:08.260> all<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
settings and get that up that's all the

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.789 
settings and get that up that's all the
way<00:04:09.269> anyway<00:04:10.269> stay<00:04:10.299> away<00:04:11.010> with<00:04:12.010> their<00:04:12.220> material

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
way anyway stay away with their material

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.529 
way anyway stay away with their material
I'm<00:04:14.799> going<00:04:14.979> to<00:04:15.069> make<00:04:15.510> no<00:04:16.510> it's<00:04:16.870> okay<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:18.539> thanks
