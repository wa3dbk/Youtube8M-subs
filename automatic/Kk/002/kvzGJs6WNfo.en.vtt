let's<00:06:12.099> see<00:06:12.249> how<00:06:12.399> big<00:06:12.610> the<00:06:12.759> trunk<00:06:12.969> is

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:53.589 

we're<00:06:45.710> still<00:06:45.889> plenty<00:06:46.129> of<00:06:46.159> room<00:06:46.249> in<00:06:46.460> here<00:06:52.599> so

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
we're still plenty of room in here so

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.779 
we're still plenty of room in here so
the<00:06:53.749> truck<00:06:53.990> is<00:06:54.199> indeed<00:06:54.860> very<00:06:55.189> massive

00:06:57.609 --> 00:06:57.619 
but that isn't as surprising once you

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:59.859 
but that isn't as surprising once you
see<00:06:57.830> how<00:06:58.009> oddly<00:06:58.339> little<00:06:58.819> rear<00:06:59.059> legroom<00:06:59.389> there

00:06:59.859 --> 00:06:59.869
