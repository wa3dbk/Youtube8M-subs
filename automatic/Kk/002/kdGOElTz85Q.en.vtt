00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 So today I want you a lot 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:19.949
 stable case of the company ag for the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:21.689
 Introduce iphone 5 so first of all 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.180
 I have a good time with the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.670
 company for the provision 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 thank these cases 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.480
 and then let's start with me 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.390
 I have already introduced 1 on iphone 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.870
 the second we will be the same 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.610
 unpacking 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 the case exists in different ones 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.320
 to find colors on the website 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.570
 they have different names 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.570
 but in principle they are all the same 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.059
 case only in different colors here 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.379
 just now in white and here in so 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.699
 dark blue black then we look 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 times the scope of delivery 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.739
 it is just a protective film here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.750
 This is a very stable case like this 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.890
 We already ten ought to bump the whole thing 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:25.770
 and then we just pack this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:28.500
 Let's have the case hour 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.299
 outside then we can still do this here 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.869
 Protective film issued the free 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.710
 and whatever gets one 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.229
 very nice thing is we can 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.700
 Now put aside and then 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.130
 we just get here 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.299
 cleaning cloth internet card for 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.180
 Align the bubbles fooled 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.439
 then we'll take a look at the case 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.979
 we have a rubber inside 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.340
 incorporated 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.020
 this is just to protect the iphone and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.020
 also dampen shocks 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.729
 so here really nothing scratched it 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.280
 everything is a bit soft that middle 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.040
 we have a hard plastic like 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.590
 also outside 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.090
 that is kept so smooth here in the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.760
 In the middle we have a small ag 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:29.099
 worked in with werner just had to 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.349
 still and then we have five here 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.610
 screw it with just that 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.500
 be technically very nice 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.260
 the new switch is free here 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.569
 cut the louder quieter and too 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.180
 the dear may button are included 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.110
 and everything is free here, too 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.239
 sliced 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.549
 Let's take a look 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.370
 this blue case to this is too 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.549
 an iphone attached is the version 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.150
 10, the connections here are wonderful 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:05.819
 accessible nicely cut out here 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.980
 mut switch is also still operable and 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.180
 louder keys are still soft 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.989
 wonderfully usable 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.139
 here is the song like button 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.940
 incorporated and works quite well 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.549
 you have to say that they are touching 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.190
 go a little harder with this case 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.980
 but that's fine 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.780
 operated 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.870
 here on the right side we have like 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.850
 not used to anything and then we have 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.609
 just what was shown before what 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.069
 may be a criticism is 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.340
 here this generously cut out 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.790
 Camera but also be an advantage 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.280
 can 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.260
 but some just do not like that one 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.920
 here this strip from the back 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.660
 we still see here, of course 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.790
 being a teacher and a tablet that's what it means 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.099
 do not mind if this is here 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.799
 now also the calls had fallen 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:06.209
 And in addition, that could be there as well 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:09.669
 protect the supplied protective film 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.380
 the iphone is with me now 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.810
 this case a few times down 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.810
 fallen and it is absolutely nothing 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.260
 that means it meets the protection 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.630
 in front 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.330
 there really really good we can do that 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.590
 Now take it off and then we bring 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.590
 it on the white iphone 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.470
 It does not go that easy going out 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.740
 as we bring it pure 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:51.190
 but that is with such a stable case 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:53.800
 usually also standard we can do that 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.720
 Here is also times to lie down next to each other 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.960
 then we will see it will be 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.260
 significantly thicker with this case tract 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.570
 just bring something up then 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.140
 here we have the black model smart in 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.260
 the white case here with these buttons 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.550
 reinlegen left first 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:18.010
 and then we just let it in 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.840
 press and then sits the already too 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.420
 I personally like the white too 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.160
 case on black iphone pretty good on 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.530
 White iPhone will probably 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.300
 even better, but here too 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.990
 really very design-wise 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.420
 successful 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.470
 So I'm really with this case 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.690
 very satisfied 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.750
 the only criticism I have 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.340
 here's that lax down here 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.660
 this something is a little too soft 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.220
 but otherwise this product 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.170
 really very well done 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.090
 if you like the product looks like 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.220
 just pass the bottom of the website 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.290
 I hope the video has failed 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.720
 if yes could my thumb high 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.880
 or leave in comments if he still 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.680
 no subscriber could do it all the time 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.600
 easy and free change 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.600
 thanks for seeing and yes
