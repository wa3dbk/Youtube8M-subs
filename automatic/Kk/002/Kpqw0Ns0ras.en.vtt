00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
from the beginning was to actually match

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.670 
from the beginning was to actually match
what<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.210> real<00:00:33.329> life<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.410> want

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
what you have in real life if you want

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.710 
what you have in real life if you want
that<00:00:34.800> formula<00:00:35.040> one<00:00:35.309> experience<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.420> stuff

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
that formula one experience the stuff

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.660 
that formula one experience the stuff
we've<00:00:36.870> been<00:00:36.899> doing<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> 2012<00:00:38.040> has<00:00:38.190> moved<00:00:38.519> that

we've been doing the 2012 has moved that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.509 
we've been doing the 2012 has moved that
on<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.030> whole<00:00:39.239> new<00:00:39.420> generation<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> whole

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
on a whole new generation now the whole

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.280 
on a whole new generation now the whole
weather<00:00:44.730> scenario<00:00:45.329> system<00:00:45.720> has<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.110> been

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
weather scenario system has really been

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.079 
weather scenario system has really been
refined<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.829> year<00:00:47.040> so<00:00:47.339> you'll<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.850> weather

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
refined this year so you'll get weather

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.430 
refined this year so you'll get weather
friends<00:00:48.449> come<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.659> now<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> could<00:00:49.320> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
friends come in now and it could be

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.079 
friends come in now and it could be
raining<00:00:49.589> at<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.220> this<00:00:50.339> section<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.909> track

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
raining at one this section of the track

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.970 
raining at one this section of the track
but<00:00:51.360> dry<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.720> another<00:00:52.019> so<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:52.589> those<00:00:52.710> real

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
but dry on another so you get those real

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619 
but dry on another so you get those real
moments<00:00:53.489> where<00:00:53.640> you're<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.269> sure<00:00:54.510> which

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
moments where you're not sure which

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.719 
moments where you're not sure which
tires<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.470> so<00:00:55.769> that<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.220> mixes<00:00:56.610> up

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
tires to be on so that really mixes up

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.369 
tires to be on so that really mixes up
the<00:00:56.760> racing<00:00:57.180> quite<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> lot<00:00:57.659> you're<00:00:57.989> having<00:00:58.260> to

the racing quite a lot you're having to
wear<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.769> mind<00:00:59.010> should<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.250> switch<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
wear for your mind should I switch the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
wear for your mind should I switch the
interns<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.180> wet<00:01:00.420> sore<00:01:00.719> dries<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.680> really

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
interns or wet sore dries it's really

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
interns or wet sore dries it's really
unpredictable<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.899> matching

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
unpredictable now it's really matching

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.499 
unpredictable now it's really matching
what<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.649> people<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.160> seeing<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.489> TV

significant work has gone into the
physics<00:01:11.039> model<00:01:11.340> particularly<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
physics model particularly the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and make you fill up a real formula one

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.699 
and make you fill up a real formula one
driver<00:01:32.539> we've<00:01:33.539> got<00:01:33.660> some<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:33.989> cool<00:01:34.229> engine

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
driver we've got some really cool engine

audio what's your driving the car the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.570 
audio what's your driving the car the
other<00:01:37.349> cars<00:01:37.649> were<00:01:37.709> out<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.039> circuit<00:01:38.459> and

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
other cars were out in circuit and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.770 
other cars were out in circuit and
particularly<00:01:38.910> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> pass<00:01:39.300> wires<00:01:39.599> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
particularly on the pass wires and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.440 
particularly on the pass wires and
things<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:40.319> much<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.649> realistic<00:01:40.830> I

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
things are just so much more realistic I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.419 
things are just so much more realistic I
think<00:01:42.450> players<00:01:42.869> who<00:01:43.080> played<00:01:43.349> f1<00:01:43.649> 2010<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.160> f1

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
think players who played f1 2010 in f1

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.740 
think players who played f1 2010 in f1
2011<00:01:44.940> are<00:01:45.060> really<00:01:45.239> going<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.569> a<00:01:45.599> big

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
2011 are really going to see a big

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.160 
2011 are really going to see a big
uplift<00:01:46.050> in<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.229> area<00:01:46.380> issue

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
we've had a bit of a change in direction

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.840 
we've had a bit of a change in direction
for<00:01:52.060> 2012<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.290> 10<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:54.159> 11<00:01:54.250> for<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.610> player

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
for 2012 and 10 and 11 for the player

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.640 
for 2012 and 10 and 11 for the player
had<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.360> main<00:01:55.509> user<00:01:55.750> interface<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.470> main

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
had the main user interface the main

you have the interviews but for 2012 and
wanted<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.149> try<00:02:01.299> something<00:02:01.540> different<00:02:01.899> so<00:02:02.590> now

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
wanted to try something different so now

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.740 
wanted to try something different so now
it's<00:02:02.920> about<00:02:03.040> projecting<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:04.119> passion<00:02:04.570> and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
it's about projecting the passion and

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.480 
it's about projecting the passion and
the<00:02:04.840> technicality<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.590> forming<00:02:05.979> on<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.340> make

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the technicality of forming on to make

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.040 
the technicality of forming on to make
it<00:02:06.610> really<00:02:06.850> look<00:02:06.970> cool<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.390> also<00:02:07.659> ease
