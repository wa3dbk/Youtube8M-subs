guys<00:00:11.160> here<00:00:11.840> now<00:00:12.840> why<00:00:13.530> pilots<00:00:13.980> seems<00:00:14.790> sort<00:00:15.150> of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
guys here now why pilots seems sort of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.420 
guys here now why pilots seems sort of
really<00:00:16.080> just<00:00:16.289> little<00:00:16.710> bits<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:16.980> pieces<00:00:17.039> well

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
really just little bits and pieces well

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.120 
really just little bits and pieces well
actually<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:18.480> chose<00:00:18.750> these<00:00:19.020> because<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:20.010> were

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
actually we chose these because we were

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.550 
actually we chose these because we were
actually<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.520> quite<00:00:20.820> impressed<00:00:21.210> even<00:00:22.140> for

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
actually really quite impressed even for

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.960 
actually really quite impressed even for
fire<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.920> probably<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.400> straight<00:00:23.699> away<00:00:23.820> but

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
fire you probably see straight away but

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.550 
fire you probably see straight away but
they're<00:00:24.210> quite<00:00:24.390> well<00:00:24.630> detailed<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> come<00:00:25.529> back

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
they're quite well detailed to come back

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.029 
they're quite well detailed to come back
to<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> site<00:00:26.240> but<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> main<00:00:27.630> thing<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.680> that

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
to the site but the main thing what that

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.320 
to the site but the main thing what that
we<00:00:29.160> picked<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.670> was<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> fact<00:00:29.939> they're

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
we picked up on was the fact they're

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.350 
we picked up on was the fact they're
very<00:00:30.359> very<00:00:30.990> light<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.830> they<00:00:32.790> also<00:00:33.000> kind<00:00:33.270> of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
very very light and they also kind of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
very very light and they also kind of
cover<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.780> multitude<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:35.149> scale<00:00:36.649> areas<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
cover a multitude of scale areas if you

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.959 
cover a multitude of scale areas if you
like<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:39.059> are<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.270> too<00:00:39.620> commonly<00:00:40.620> covered

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
like that are not too commonly covered

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
like that are not too commonly covered
particularly<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> smaller<00:00:42.660> models<00:00:43.050> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
particularly on the smaller models so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.549 
particularly on the smaller models so
perfect<00:00:44.340> ideal<00:00:44.730> um<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> must<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.260> left

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
perfect ideal um so I must not go left

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.810 
perfect ideal um so I must not go left
to<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:47.129> start<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.550> little

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to right we start with this little

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.760 
to right we start with this little
fellow<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.649> probably<00:00:50.390> 1930s<00:00:51.770> again

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
fellow here and I'm probably 1930s again

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.220 
fellow here and I'm probably 1930s again
what<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.219> really<00:00:53.460> impressive<00:00:53.870> was<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> fact

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
what was really impressive was the fact

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.959 
what was really impressive was the fact
that<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.920> light<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.399> weighs<00:00:56.579> nothing

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that it is so light it weighs nothing

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.790 
that it is so light it weighs nothing
you<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> couple<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.590> grams

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you know what a couple of grams

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
you know what a couple of grams
literally<00:00:59.520> perfect<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.930> those<00:01:00.989> really

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
literally perfect for those really

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.160 
literally perfect for those really
really<00:01:01.500> small<00:01:01.770> scale<00:01:02.730> plates<00:01:03.059> without<00:01:03.809> adding

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
really small scale plates without adding

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590 
really small scale plates without adding
excess<00:01:04.559> weight<00:01:04.799> moving<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> little<00:01:06.090> bit<00:01:06.299> bit

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
excess weight moving up a little bit bit

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.740 
excess weight moving up a little bit bit
more<00:01:06.630> detailed<00:01:07.760> very<00:01:08.760> slightly<00:01:09.030> heavier<00:01:09.450> but

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
more detailed very slightly heavier but

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
more detailed very slightly heavier but
at<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> end<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> day<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.460> nicely
