the Nissan was fairly good carpet up

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.500 
the Nissan was fairly good carpet up
next<00:02:23.220> we're<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.430> gonna<00:02:23.940> do<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> quick<00:02:24.360> little

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the Mazda rx-7 yeah is definitely a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.130 
the Mazda rx-7 yeah is definitely a
pretty<00:02:32.250> decent<00:02:32.580> car<00:02:32.760> obviously<00:02:33.390> row<00:02:33.989> wheel

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
pretty decent car obviously row wheel

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.900 
pretty decent car obviously row wheel
drive<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.950> didn't<00:02:35.190> exactly<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> best

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
drive so it didn't exactly get the best

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.150 
drive so it didn't exactly get the best

there sort of drifted and cut the inside

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.960 
there sort of drifted and cut the inside
of<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.980> hairpin<00:02:41.940> there<00:02:42.209> but<00:02:43.730> obviously<00:02:44.730> great

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
of the hairpin there but obviously great

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.580 
of the hairpin there but obviously great
doesn't<00:02:45.299> uh<00:02:45.390> doesn't<00:02:45.690> exactly<00:02:45.870> penalize<00:02:46.380> you

well<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.230> guess<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.620> actually<00:02:49.769> does<00:02:50.040> follow

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
well I guess I actually does follow

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.380 
well I guess I actually does follow
after<00:02:50.549> real<00:02:50.700> f1<00:02:50.880> but<00:02:51.739> anyways<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.880> I'm<00:02:54.239> coming

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
after real f1 but anyways is I'm coming

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.940 
after real f1 but anyways is I'm coming
around<00:02:54.570> here<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> final<00:02:55.290> corner<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.739> indie

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
around here a final corner on the indie

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.170 
around here a final corner on the indie
circuit<00:02:57.019> yeah<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.280> car<00:02:59.549> was<00:02:59.730> it<00:03:00.030> was

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
circuit yeah this this car was it was

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.910 
circuit yeah this this car was it was
pretty<00:03:00.359> good<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.600> mean<00:03:00.690> overall<00:03:01.260> speed<00:03:01.500> wise<00:03:01.680> it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
pretty good I mean overall speed wise it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.430 
pretty good I mean overall speed wise it
felt<00:03:02.070> like<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:02.579> had<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.450> even<00:03:04.170> even

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
felt like it just had that even even

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.710 
felt like it just had that even even
with<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.769> serve<00:03:05.160> power<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.700> Nissan<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.239> it

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
with the serve power of the Nissan it it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.400 
with the serve power of the Nissan it it
definitely<00:03:07.200> felt<00:03:07.940> comparable<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.570> level<00:03:09.840> I

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
definitely felt comparable on a level I

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410 
definitely felt comparable on a level I
didn't<00:03:11.280> actually<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.609> any<00:03:11.760> comparisons<00:03:12.269> to

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
didn't actually do any comparisons to

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.200 
didn't actually do any comparisons to
see<00:03:12.540> how<00:03:12.660> these<00:03:12.780> cars<00:03:13.049> sort<00:03:13.380> of

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
see how these cars sort of

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.150 
see how these cars sort of
pure<00:03:15.210> lap<00:03:15.420> time<00:03:15.630> performance<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:17.010> wanted

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160

with<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.150> Tamiya<00:03:43.750> Cuzco<00:03:44.230> Subaru<00:03:44.590> WRX<00:03:44.770> and<00:03:45.520> I

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
with the Tamiya Cuzco Subaru WRX and I

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.330 
with the Tamiya Cuzco Subaru WRX and I
actually<00:03:46.660> put<00:03:46.990> this<00:03:47.110> on<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.350> random<00:03:47.710> grid<00:03:48.070> I

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
actually put this on a random grid I

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.890 
actually put this on a random grid I
mean<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.090> knew<00:03:49.240> obviously<00:03:49.630> with<00:03:49.780> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
mean I knew obviously with the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.720 
mean I knew obviously with the
four-wheel<00:03:50.200> drive<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:51.070> this<00:03:51.220> car<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.459> knew

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
four-wheel drive on on this car I knew

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.430 
four-wheel drive on on this car I knew
it<00:03:51.880> was<00:03:52.000> just<00:03:52.030> gonna<00:03:52.270> launch<00:03:52.570> off<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.780> line<00:03:53.050> so

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
it was just gonna launch off the line so

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.430 
it was just gonna launch off the line so
as<00:03:54.280> soon<00:03:54.400> as<00:03:54.459> soon<00:03:54.790> as<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.000> leave<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:56.200> line<00:03:56.410> I

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
as soon as soon as I leave the line I

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.980 
as soon as soon as I leave the line I
pretty<00:03:56.800> much<00:03:56.980> immediately<00:03:57.810> was<00:03:58.810> right

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
pretty much immediately was right

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.050 
pretty much immediately was right
alongside<00:03:59.230> first<00:03:59.650> place<00:03:59.890> here<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.490> was

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
alongside first place here and I was

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.310 
alongside first place here and I was
like<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.300> know<00:04:01.390> what<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:02.020> isn't<00:04:02.260> exactly

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
like you know what this isn't exactly

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.260 
like you know what this isn't exactly
gonna<00:04:02.709> be<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:02.860> very<00:04:03.070> interesting<00:04:03.370> lap<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.030> I

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
gonna be a very interesting lap so I

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.140 
gonna be a very interesting lap so I
just<00:04:04.750> went<00:04:04.870> ahead<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.520> pulled<00:04:06.520> aside<00:04:06.640> here

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
just went ahead and pulled aside here

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.770 
just went ahead and pulled aside here
and<00:04:07.750> just<00:04:08.820> go<00:04:09.820> ahead<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.090> let<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.300> AI<00:04:10.420> through

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and just go ahead and let the AI through

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.140 
and just go ahead and let the AI through
so<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:10.989> can<00:04:11.140> actually<00:04:11.260> sort<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.730> make<00:04:12.730> this<00:04:12.880> lap

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
so I can actually sort of make this lap

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.060 
so I can actually sort of make this lap
fairly<00:04:14.050> interesting<00:04:14.380> for<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.560> guys<00:04:14.709> as<00:04:14.950> they

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
fairly interesting for you guys as they

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.280 
fairly interesting for you guys as they
I<00:04:15.160> sort<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.610> ran<00:04:15.760> into<00:04:15.910> each<00:04:16.090> other<00:04:16.209> there

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.320 

yeah<00:04:21.860> I<00:04:21.890> notice<00:04:22.190> straightaway<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:22.820> uh<00:04:22.850> the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
yeah I notice straightaway that uh the

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.490 
yeah I notice straightaway that uh the
four-wheel<00:04:23.660> drive<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.140> car<00:04:24.380> is

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
four-wheel drive on this car is

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.650 
four-wheel drive on this car is
definitely<00:04:24.680> not<00:04:25.640> quite<00:04:25.850> as<00:04:25.940> much<00:04:26.090> turn<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:26.510> as

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
definitely not quite as much turn in as

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.050 
definitely not quite as much turn in as
the<00:04:26.890> mp4<00:04:27.890> they're<00:04:28.070> sort<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.340> runs<00:04:28.520> me<00:04:28.640> wide<00:04:28.820> and

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
the mp4 they're sort of runs me wide and

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.400 
the mp4 they're sort of runs me wide and
the<00:04:29.120> rest<00:04:29.420> of<00:04:29.540> AI<00:04:29.660> are<00:04:29.900> kicking<00:04:30.170> up<00:04:30.260> dust

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
the rest of AI are kicking up dust

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.320 
the rest of AI are kicking up dust
running<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.770> each<00:04:30.890> other<00:04:33.910> over<00:04:34.910> although<00:04:35.180> I

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
running to each other over although I

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.880 
running to each other over although I
mean<00:04:35.540> -<00:04:35.720> even<00:04:36.260> though<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.440> car<00:04:36.620> was<00:04:36.650> four

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
mean - even though the car was four

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.140 
mean - even though the car was four
wheel<00:04:37.040> drive<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.370> did<00:04:37.490> drift<00:04:37.700> around<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:38.060> little

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
wheel drive it did drift around a little

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.130 
wheel drive it did drift around a little
bit

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
bit

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.320 
bit
definitely<00:04:39.830> pretty<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.460> mean<00:04:40.760> just<00:04:40.970> overall

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
definitely pretty I mean just overall

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.910 
definitely pretty I mean just overall
description<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.930> that<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.110> mean<00:04:42.350> combined<00:04:42.710> with

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
description of that I mean combined with

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.510 
description of that I mean combined with
the<00:04:43.040> grid<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:44.420> directly<00:04:44.780> physics<00:04:45.200> it's<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:46.460> was

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
the grid to directly physics it's it was

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.830 
the grid to directly physics it's it was
felt<00:04:46.790> like<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.000> pretty<00:04:47.210> balanced<00:04:47.630> car

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
felt like a pretty balanced car

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.810 
felt like a pretty balanced car
four-wheel<00:04:48.770> drive<00:04:48.980> and<00:04:49.010> grip<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.460> think<00:04:49.670> with<00:04:49.790> a

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
four-wheel drive and grip I think with a

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.510 
four-wheel drive and grip I think with a
the<00:04:50.420> stats<00:04:50.690> on<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:50.900> so<00:04:51.200> is<00:04:51.260> fairly<00:04:52.040> comfortable

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
the stats on it so is fairly comfortable

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.510 
the stats on it so is fairly comfortable
the<00:04:52.940> drift<00:04:53.150> cars<00:04:53.740> are<00:04:54.740> normally<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.310> put<00:04:55.460> the

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
the drift cars are normally to put the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.880 
the drift cars are normally to put the
stars<00:04:55.760> but<00:04:56.090> yeah<00:04:56.960> this<00:04:57.080> this<00:04:57.590> thing<00:04:57.770> actually

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
stars but yeah this this thing actually

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.270 
stars but yeah this this thing actually
felt<00:04:58.280> fairly<00:04:58.430> competitive<00:04:59.920> so<00:05:00.920> I'm<00:05:00.980> trying<00:05:01.220> to

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
felt fairly competitive so I'm trying to

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.950 
felt fairly competitive so I'm trying to
get<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.400> run<00:05:01.580> on<00:05:01.640> these<00:05:01.970> maybe<00:05:02.360> they're<00:05:02.540> pulling

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
get a run on these maybe they're pulling

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.020 
get a run on these maybe they're pulling
over<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:03.380> I<00:05:03.650> was<00:05:04.250> expecting<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.670> just<00:05:04.880> come

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
over and I was expecting to just come

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.790 
over and I was expecting to just come
back<00:05:05.210> through<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.810> AI<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.320> hit<00:05:06.620> on<00:05:06.710> the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
back through and the AI is hit on the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.990 
back through and the AI is hit on the
horse<00:05:06.980> difficulty<00:05:07.400> arrow<00:05:07.580> is<00:05:07.670> just<00:05:07.820> sort<00:05:07.940> of

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
horse difficulty arrow is just sort of

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.250 
horse difficulty arrow is just sort of
come<00:05:08.210> expecting<00:05:08.570> to<00:05:08.840> come<00:05:08.990> right<00:05:09.140> back

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
come expecting to come right back

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.960 
come expecting to come right back
through<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.650> pass<00:05:09.890> all<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.160> AI<00:05:10.310> in<00:05:10.610> one<00:05:10.760> lap

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
through and pass all the AI in one lap

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.510 
through and pass all the AI in one lap
but<00:05:11.470> yeah<00:05:12.470> obviously<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:13.100> was<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.250> little<00:05:13.430> bit

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
but yeah obviously I was a little bit

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.720 
but yeah obviously I was a little bit
overeager<00:05:14.290> of<00:05:15.290> my<00:05:15.530> abilities<00:05:16.070> in<00:05:16.310> this<00:05:16.460> car

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
overeager of my abilities in this car

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.520 
overeager of my abilities in this car
and<00:05:17.150> I'm<00:05:17.510> just<00:05:17.690> gonna<00:05:17.780> be<00:05:17.990> lucky<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.410> even

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
and I'm just gonna be lucky to even

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.230 
and I'm just gonna be lucky to even
squeak<00:05:19.010> into<00:05:19.160> the<00:05:19.280> top<00:05:19.460> five<00:05:19.670> here<00:05:19.910> is<00:05:20.060> I'm

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
squeak into the top five here is I'm

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.360 
squeak into the top five here is I'm
drag<00:05:20.960> racing<00:05:21.350> these<00:05:21.470> Ariel<00:05:21.830> Adams<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.340> I

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
drag racing these Ariel Adams and I

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.100 
drag racing these Ariel Adams and I
think<00:05:22.550> I'd<00:05:22.670> just<00:05:22.700> pit<00:05:23.240> fifth<00:05:23.510> place<00:05:23.750> there<00:05:23.990> at

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
think I'd just pit fifth place there at

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.740 
think I'd just pit fifth place there at
the<00:05:24.200> line<00:05:24.380> so<00:05:25.370> we<00:05:25.490> have<00:05:25.670> one<00:05:25.940> final<00:05:26.120> car<00:05:26.480> here

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
the line so we have one final car here

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.650 
the line so we have one final car here
in<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.370> Honda<00:05:28.370> Civic<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.970> super<00:05:29.540> modified

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
in the Honda Civic the super modified

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.610 
in the Honda Civic the super modified
think<00:05:32.660> this<00:05:32.780> time<00:05:32.960> I<00:05:32.990> started<00:05:33.350> a<00:05:33.380> little<00:05:33.470> bit

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
think this time I started a little bit

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.930 
think this time I started a little bit
further<00:05:33.830> back<00:05:33.980> on<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:34.190> grid<00:05:34.490> so<00:05:34.640> there<00:05:34.790> will

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
further back on the grid so there will

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.510 
further back on the grid so there will
not<00:05:35.270> be<00:05:35.300> any<00:05:35.750> pulling<00:05:36.410> over<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.040> once<00:05:37.220> again

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
not be any pulling over and once again

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.430 
not be any pulling over and once again
one<00:05:37.760> of<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.940> super<00:05:38.690> light<00:05:38.840> cars<00:05:39.080> are<00:05:39.290> right

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
one of the super light cars are right

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.290 
one of the super light cars are right
out<00:05:39.560> front<00:05:39.800> so<00:05:40.010> I'm<00:05:40.070> sure<00:05:40.280> they<00:05:40.430> might<00:05:40.640> end<00:05:41.210> up

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
out front so I'm sure they might end up

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.490 
out front so I'm sure they might end up
running<00:05:41.540> away<00:05:41.930> with<00:05:42.170> the<00:05:42.350> victory<00:05:44.110> yeah<00:05:45.110> this

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
running away with the victory yeah this

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.170 
running away with the victory yeah this
car<00:05:45.830> is<00:05:45.980> actually<00:05:46.100> fairly<00:05:46.400> interesting<00:05:46.910> I<00:05:46.970> see

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
car is actually fairly interesting I see

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.400

the<00:05:47.270> front-wheel<00:05:47.600> drive<00:05:47.630> they're<00:05:48.020> obviously

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
the front-wheel drive they're obviously

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.160 
the front-wheel drive they're obviously
just<00:05:48.500> spinning<00:05:49.040> up<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.220> tires<00:05:50.170> definitely

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
just spinning up the tires definitely

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.630 
just spinning up the tires definitely
front<00:05:51.440> front-engine<00:05:51.770> front-wheel-drive<00:05:52.250> is

front front-engine front-wheel-drive is

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
not a good mixture for a great starts to

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.370 
not a good mixture for a great starts to
get<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.390> good<00:05:56.540> run<00:05:56.720> there<00:05:56.840> out<00:05:57.020> of<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.170> first

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
get a good run there out of the first

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.629 
get a good run there out of the first
corner

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
corner

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.550 
corner
catching<00:05:59.300> up<00:05:59.389> the<00:05:59.479> back<00:05:59.629> of<00:05:59.780> this<00:05:59.840> Ariel<00:06:00.439> Atom

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
catching up the back of this Ariel Atom

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.960 
catching up the back of this Ariel Atom
here<00:06:00.889> and<00:06:01.039> I<00:06:01.069> thought<00:06:01.250> I'd<00:06:01.400> actually<00:06:01.580> clear

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
here and I thought I'd actually clear

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.600 
here and I thought I'd actually clear
that<00:06:02.120> alpha<00:06:02.419> and<00:06:02.870> luckily<00:06:03.319> I<00:06:03.409> wasn't<00:06:04.310> turned

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
that alpha and luckily I wasn't turned

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.119 
that alpha and luckily I wasn't turned
into<00:06:04.759> the<00:06:04.909> wall<00:06:05.229> this<00:06:06.229> stupid<00:06:06.500> on<00:06:06.590> my<00:06:06.680> part<00:06:06.710> but

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
into the wall this stupid on my part but

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.929 
into the wall this stupid on my part but
oh<00:06:07.370> well<00:06:08.300> I<00:06:08.360> thought<00:06:08.599> I<00:06:08.659> had<00:06:08.840> them<00:06:08.900> cleared

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:09.939 
oh well I thought I had them cleared

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.820 
oh well I thought I had them cleared
looks<00:06:10.939> like<00:06:11.090> that<00:06:11.240> Volvo<00:06:11.449> there<00:06:11.780> is<00:06:11.900> just

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
looks like that Volvo there is just

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.010 
looks like that Volvo there is just
doing<00:06:13.069> it<00:06:13.189> in<00:06:13.550> Indian<00:06:14.180> Grand<00:06:14.419> Prix<00:06:14.689> running

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
doing it in Indian Grand Prix running

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.619 
doing it in Indian Grand Prix running
ten<00:06:15.379> miles<00:06:15.590> off<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:15.889> track<00:06:16.219> but<00:06:16.569> seems<00:06:17.569> like

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:17.629 
ten miles off the track but seems like

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:18.760 
ten miles off the track but seems like
you<00:06:17.780> didn't<00:06:17.990> get<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.229> good<00:06:18.409> of<00:06:18.500> a<00:06:18.560> run<00:06:18.680> off

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
you didn't get that good of a run off

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.700 
you didn't get that good of a run off
the<00:06:18.889> corner<00:06:19.039> saw<00:06:19.400> probably<00:06:20.090> have<00:06:20.180> a<00:06:20.210> dive<00:06:20.449> bomb

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
the corner saw probably have a dive bomb

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.809 
the corner saw probably have a dive bomb
at<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.800> bottom<00:06:22.039> of<00:06:22.129> the<00:06:22.189> hill<00:06:22.340> here<00:06:22.520> into<00:06:22.699> this

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
at the bottom of the hill here into this

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.899 
at the bottom of the hill here into this
right-hander<00:06:23.300> see<00:06:23.930> if<00:06:24.020> I<00:06:24.080> get<00:06:24.259> past<00:06:24.469> them

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
right-hander see if I get past them

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.369 
right-hander see if I get past them
broke<00:06:25.909> pretty<00:06:26.150> late<00:06:26.389> didn't<00:06:27.080> mean<00:06:27.199> to<00:06:27.289> run

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:27.379

broke pretty late didn't mean to run
into<00:06:27.560> that<00:06:27.650> Corvette<00:06:28.069> but<00:06:28.509> that's<00:06:29.509> about

that's<00:06:30.319> pretty<00:06:30.590> pretty<00:06:31.129> freakin<00:06:31.550> clean<00:06:31.759> I

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
that's pretty pretty freakin clean I

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.610 
that's pretty pretty freakin clean I
would<00:06:32.030> say<00:06:32.210> for<00:06:32.479> a<00:06:32.629> grid<00:06:32.900> to<00:06:33.050> overtake<00:06:33.440> this

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
would say for a grid to overtake this

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.159 
would say for a grid to overtake this
and<00:06:33.830> very<00:06:34.610> nearly<00:06:34.940> just<00:06:35.240> freakin<00:06:35.960> plow<00:06:36.139> over

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
and very nearly just freakin plow over

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.430 
and very nearly just freakin plow over
the<00:06:36.500> back<00:06:36.650> with<00:06:36.830> that<00:06:36.949> Ariel<00:06:37.280> Atom<00:06:37.400> there<00:06:38.440> yeah

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
the back with that Ariel Atom there yeah

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.749 
the back with that Ariel Atom there yeah
the<00:06:39.560> AI<00:06:39.650> definitely<00:06:39.949> don't<00:06:40.250> seem<00:06:40.370> to<00:06:40.460> be<00:06:40.520> quite

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
the AI definitely don't seem to be quite

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.309 
the AI definitely don't seem to be quite
as<00:06:40.879> competitive<00:06:41.330> around<00:06:41.599> this<00:06:41.719> track<00:06:41.960> cuz<00:06:42.169> I

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
as competitive around this track cuz I

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.140 
as competitive around this track cuz I
didn't<00:06:42.770> feel<00:06:42.949> so<00:06:43.310> comfortable<00:06:43.550> in<00:06:43.789> this<00:06:43.940> car

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
didn't feel so comfortable in this car

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.610 
didn't feel so comfortable in this car
it's<00:06:44.389> quite<00:06:44.569> a<00:06:44.599> bit<00:06:44.750> of<00:06:44.810> understeer<00:06:45.169> obviously

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
it's quite a bit of understeer obviously

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.309 
it's quite a bit of understeer obviously
from<00:06:45.800> the<00:06:45.919> front<00:06:46.879> wheel<00:06:47.030> drive<00:06:47.270> and<00:06:47.870> so

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
from the front wheel drive and so

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.540 
from the front wheel drive and so
through<00:06:48.500> that<00:06:48.530> through<00:06:48.949> that<00:06:48.979> middle<00:06:49.250> segment

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
through that through that middle segment

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.610 
through that through that middle segment
I<00:06:49.789> was<00:06:49.909> expecting<00:06:50.360> his<00:06:50.509> car<00:06:51.020> section<00:06:51.409> pulled

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
I was expecting his car section pulled

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.709 
I was expecting his car section pulled
away<00:06:51.680> whereas<00:06:52.490> actually<00:06:52.849> I<00:06:52.879> was<00:06:53.060> I<00:06:53.270> was

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:53.719 
away whereas actually I was I was

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:55.779 
away whereas actually I was I was
gaining<00:06:54.050> on<00:06:54.199> them<00:06:54.319> so<00:06:54.529> it's<00:06:54.620> probably<00:06:54.860> just<00:06:54.979> AI

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
gaining on them so it's probably just AI

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.290 
gaining on them so it's probably just AI
imbalances<00:06:56.539> or<00:06:56.689> something<00:06:57.879> but<00:06:58.879> yeah<00:06:59.000> nice

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
imbalances or something but yeah nice

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.570 
imbalances or something but yeah nice
nice<00:06:59.629> sound<00:06:59.930> for<00:07:00.110> this<00:07:00.199> car<00:07:00.439> obviously<00:07:01.219> on<00:07:01.490> the

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
nice sound for this car obviously on the

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.100 
nice sound for this car obviously on the
hood<00:07:01.729> camera<00:07:02.120> the<00:07:02.270> car<00:07:02.479> has<00:07:02.629> this<00:07:02.810> front

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
hood camera the car has this front

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.629 
hood camera the car has this front
exhaust<00:07:03.379> as<00:07:03.650> you<00:07:03.740> can<00:07:03.860> see<00:07:04.069> right<00:07:04.219> there<00:07:04.460> on
