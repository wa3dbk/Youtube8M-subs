00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.320
 for now the time to try it is it's own 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.810
 for me it is the musical production a guy well enough of tienee that makes 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 a routine anyway that their fate 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.950
 will be several million copies this is not even 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.860
 leave room for the legitimate fears of the people she cried on 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.240

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.930

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.989
 to endorse the idea that I remember a classroom yes but a 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.289
 message where he is wise I played to my attacker 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.289
 on his side of the fence the patrons 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.599

 the English musician will be especially so are in their way of using 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.629
 Palestinians need to understand why debit cards are going 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.569
 sometimes for big extraterrestrials we understand why not can 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.859
 bring the code of the consumer closer to the field was the 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:50.129
 goal 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.589
 more in the sense of the words 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.689
 which is going more and more growing banks 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.890
 beaten 1-3 counts that people are very very impressed because these are 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.159
 true creative and franck have difficulty in performance 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.209
 while the side then the trick is to first lower the variable levels and 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 then you put your hands on the deck like that 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.849
 Why 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.989
 title today the siic status has its codes its rules its notes 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.049
 and even the same story for them to pursue 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.049
 k 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.989
 here for the scratch in fact the simple we knew as a bit of resentment 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.189
 not 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.859
 Finally, I know that when I go to France when you are at the expense of his 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.779
 beginnings of the team 2 0 offering scratcher and we try to conceive 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.579
 like a chorus reminded what 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.140
 that is to say that the each chac statue should be asked as how 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.239
 grind on the dick when will we crack a list 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.179
 this show is the same month 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:03.439
 me with the girls at least five small and big problems according to him one 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.439
 Probable may - type of ballot 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.659
 e 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.239
 when we have a report 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.909
 14 arrange charms to the same blue achieves that is of the order of 2 5 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.340
 may with his guitar 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.340
 facing the strong head 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.059
 attacked it takes years the coach lyonnais she talked about the psg 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.680
 and the town hall 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.440
 different 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.710
 he also quoted angels 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.629
 reindeer 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:34.750
 the greens were vain 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.750
 it's also unfortunate at the space at reindeers this season 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.529
 the platinum musical instruments demonstration with 38 2 who with two 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.529
 records fell by 3 8 billion 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.939
 we turn we turn we turn 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.289
 we will do everything for the whole 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.639
 brampton have 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.620
 tone up 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.319
 everything for the role-play 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.319
 so everything for the whole 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:24.999
 for the world tour 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.559
 if I can not do anything about it 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.169
 at the level for two months 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.490
 technip sold stadium and the turntables market which costs on average between 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.199
 5 and 6 euros each the price of a cell low from 30 to 230 euros and 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.820
 at the tables they can go up to 2400 the limited platinum role no 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.900
 cross-cell worlds imagined and designed in close collaboration with 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.080
 their stealing authors 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.659
 the tigers 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.569
 following the cell you will get a sound that is different 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.889
 but the most important is also the person who will use it and the 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.939
 techniques that will be able to develop 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.559
 now it is certain that we will not ask 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.650
 the same thing at the level of a cell that is going to be 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.150
 more capture for the scratch that will have the opportunity to react is 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.619
 a particular way 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:23.639
 for different techniques 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.049
 and yes we will not ask the same thing for example in techno to power 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:31.339
 or, as a rule, the children will be able to have good 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:35.990
 big bass game things very focused on the sound level recently they 

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:38.919
 have the ten with weapon 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.909
 dented on an alert on arrival this what's called a samurai this 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:42.589
 series 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:46.659
 so 065 - 0 5 and 0 7 samurai in fact this is the first factor 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.729
 we go hard photo j -cr and hymns downright optical 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:54.599
 it changes everything is a fact this goal is a beam of light that is 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:55.189
 complete 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.300
 it's more of a rub on the carbon by here com 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.059
 in fact it is a beam of light 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:01.129
 I cut 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.909
 so what 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.089
 patrick klugman m 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.099
 still 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:10.309
 m 

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:13.309
 the Republic 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.169
 against 

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:25.539
 the map 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:28.539
 out of curiosity 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.379

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:35.479
 clerk 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.699
 not 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:41.330
