00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.120 
people handle each other so what I felt
was<00:00:37.390> that<00:00:37.420> in<00:00:37.720> tango<00:00:38.140> I<00:00:38.170> saw<00:00:38.500> some<00:00:38.800> sort<00:00:39.010> of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
communication going on that was

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.320 
communication going on that was
completely<00:00:43.900> without<00:00:44.320> any<00:00:44.739> sign<00:00:45.580> of<00:00:45.610> even

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
completely without any sign of even

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.470 
completely without any sign of even
almost<00:00:46.840> visual<00:00:47.530> contact<00:00:47.920> or<00:00:48.160> or<00:00:48.550> words<00:00:49.059> and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
against the nature of tango the most

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.910 
against the nature of tango the most
important<00:02:17.260> thing<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:17.860> tango<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.510> feeling

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
important thing in tango is the feeling

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.160 
important thing in tango is the feeling
most<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.220> time<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:22.000> people<00:02:22.209> is<00:02:22.569> thinking

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
most of the time the people is thinking

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.350 
most of the time the people is thinking
about<00:02:23.319> steps<00:02:24.630> about<00:02:25.920> choreography<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.819> I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
about steps about choreography and I

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.420 
about steps about choreography and I
think<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:28.810> very<00:02:28.959> important<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.799> course<00:02:29.830> that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
think it's very important of course that

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.979 
think it's very important of course that
stands<00:02:31.350> but<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.860> case<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.310> tango<00:02:33.760> in

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
stands but in the case of tango in

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.770 
stands but in the case of tango in
especial<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.580> think<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.910> most<00:02:37.150> important

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
especial I think the most important

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.949 
especial I think the most important
thing<00:02:37.989> that<00:02:38.019> we<00:02:38.560> need<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.450> translate<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
thing that we need to translate to the

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.370 
thing that we need to translate to the
audience<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:43.090> strong<00:02:43.540> feeling<00:02:44.140> that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
audience is that a strong feeling that

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.820 
audience is that a strong feeling that
we<00:02:44.860> feel<00:02:45.220> when<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.239> are<00:02:46.269> dancing<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.170> I've

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
we feel when we are dancing this I've

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.259 
we feel when we are dancing this I've
learned<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.250> lot<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.640> mean<00:02:48.790> I've<00:02:48.910> learned<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.239> lot

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
learned a lot I mean I've learned a lot

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.170 
learned a lot I mean I've learned a lot
of<00:02:49.569> tango<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.200> spent<00:02:50.560> three<00:02:50.739> years<00:02:50.769> on<00:02:51.069> that

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
of tango so I spent three years on that

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.880 
of tango so I spent three years on that
being<00:02:52.180> able<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.540> read<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.650> able<00:02:53.739> to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
being able to read it and to be able to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.890 
being able to read it and to be able to
see<00:02:54.489> how<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.420> know<00:02:55.540> what's<00:02:55.720> actually

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
see how you know what's actually

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.330 
see how you know what's actually
happening<00:02:56.500> because<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.860> can<00:02:57.010> be<00:02:57.130> quite

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
happening because it can be quite

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.770 
happening because it can be quite
confusing<00:02:57.370> when<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.120> not<00:02:58.269> your<00:02:58.420> language

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
confusing when it's not your language

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.069 
confusing when it's not your language
and<00:02:58.989> so<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.739> had<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.130> really<00:03:00.340> study<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.900> now

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
and so I had to really study but now

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.259 
and so I had to really study but now
it's<00:03:02.620> become<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:03.100> second<00:03:03.700> nature<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.209> think

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
it's become like second nature I think

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.319 
it's become like second nature I think
as<00:03:04.750> with<00:03:05.320> many<00:03:05.680> other<00:03:06.040> traditional<00:03:06.940> forms

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
as with many other traditional forms

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.970 
as with many other traditional forms
what<00:03:07.570> I<00:03:07.600> always<00:03:07.930> tend<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.410> try<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.739> do<00:03:08.859> is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
what I always tend to try and do is

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.970 
what I always tend to try and do is
bring<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.670> into<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.630> place<00:03:11.079> where<00:03:11.350> people<00:03:11.739> stop

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
bring it into a place where people stop

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.530 
bring it into a place where people stop
looking<00:03:12.250> at<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.670> from<00:03:12.850> a<00:03:13.030> traditional

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
looking at it from a traditional

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.930 
looking at it from a traditional
perspective<00:03:13.840> only<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.680> try<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.040> look<00:03:15.700> at<00:03:15.850> it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
perspective only I try to look at it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.400 
perspective only I try to look at it
from<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.150> perspective<00:03:16.299> that<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.900> can<00:03:17.109> maybe

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
from a perspective that it can maybe

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.590 
from a perspective that it can maybe
surprise<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.160> at<00:03:18.489> times<00:03:18.850> really<00:03:19.150> suddenly

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
surprise you at times really suddenly

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.410 
surprise you at times really suddenly
make<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.260> look<00:03:20.410> at<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.680> differently<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.459> by

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
make you look at it differently and by

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.479 
make you look at it differently and by
using<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.019> plea<00:03:23.200> she<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.560> not<00:03:23.799> by<00:03:24.160> going

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
using the plea she is not by going

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.309 
using the plea she is not by going
against<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.180> because<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.569> cliches<00:03:25.870> are<00:03:26.079> are

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
against and because the cliches are are

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.460 
against and because the cliches are are
important<00:03:27.010> they<00:03:27.160> are<00:03:27.190> part<00:03:27.549> of<00:03:27.760> recognition

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
important they are part of recognition

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.020 
important they are part of recognition
they<00:03:29.470> make<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.769> understand<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.880> you

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
they make you understand that you

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.300 
they make you understand that you
already<00:03:31.150> know<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.870> then<00:03:32.440> from<00:03:32.680> those<00:03:32.859> cliches

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
already know and then from those cliches

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.879 
already know and then from those cliches
you<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.700> go<00:03:33.880> into<00:03:34.150> into<00:03:35.109> places<00:03:35.560> where<00:03:35.590> it

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
you can go into into places where it

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.470 
you can go into into places where it
there's<00:03:36.160> more<00:03:36.370> grey<00:03:36.579> zones<00:03:36.910> where<00:03:37.150> things<00:03:37.329> are

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
there's more grey zones where things are

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.420 
there's more grey zones where things are
maybe<00:03:37.600> more<00:03:37.840> complicated<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.739> our<00:03:39.010> reality

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
maybe more complicated and our reality

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.680 
maybe more complicated and our reality
today<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:39.940> relationships<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.630> very

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
today in relationships is very

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.900 
today in relationships is very
complicated<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.650> think<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.430> think<00:03:42.730> it's

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
complicated I think so I think it's

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.260 
complicated I think so I think it's
important<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:43.660> show<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.220> complexity

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
important to show that complexity

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.750 
important to show that complexity
I<00:03:48.840> don't<00:03:49.840> need<00:03:49.960> to<00:03:50.110> feed<00:03:50.410> on<00:03:50.620> other<00:03:51.010> styles<00:03:51.370> in

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
I don't need to feed on other styles in

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.670 
I don't need to feed on other styles in
order<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.240> be<00:03:52.450> inspired<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:53.170> think<00:03:53.410> I<00:03:53.500> have<00:03:53.650> a

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
order to be inspired I think I have a

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.160 
order to be inspired I think I have a
lot<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.100> inspiration<00:03:54.760> without<00:03:55.450> having<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.050> do

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
lot of inspiration without having to do

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.380 
lot of inspiration without having to do
that<00:03:56.410> what<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.040> am<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.490> curious<00:03:57.970> I'm<00:03:58.210> very

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
that what I am is curious I'm very

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.260 
that what I am is curious I'm very
curious<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:59.020> what<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.170> want<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.770> to<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.970> honor

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
curious and what I want is to to honor

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.630 
curious and what I want is to to honor
quality<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.170> so<00:04:02.800> when<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:02.980> see<00:04:03.220> something<00:04:03.610> that

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
quality and so when I see something that

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.880 
quality and so when I see something that
has<00:04:03.910> quality<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.660> might<00:04:04.930> be<00:04:05.200> kind<00:04:05.830> of

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
has quality and that might be kind of

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.490 
has quality and that might be kind of
put<00:04:06.100> in<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.310> museum<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:07.030> lost<00:04:07.300> you<00:04:08.140> know<00:04:08.290> as

put in a museum and lost you know as

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.680 
put in a museum and lost you know as
being<00:04:08.680> some<00:04:09.220> sort<00:04:09.430> of<00:04:09.490> cultural<00:04:09.910> heritage<00:04:10.120> I

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
being some sort of cultural heritage I

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.930 
being some sort of cultural heritage I
think<00:04:11.140> it's<00:04:11.350> dangerous<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:12.070> what<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.280> try<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.670> do

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
think it's dangerous so what I try to do

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.450 
think it's dangerous so what I try to do
is<00:04:13.120> just<00:04:13.330> bring<00:04:14.170> life<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.740> by<00:04:15.010> by

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
is just bring life to it by by

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.410 
is just bring life to it by by
challenging<00:04:16.060> it

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
challenging it

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.560 
challenging it
I<00:04:16.450> challenge<00:04:17.110> these<00:04:17.320> things<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.709> don't<00:04:17.920> just

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
I challenge these things I don't just
