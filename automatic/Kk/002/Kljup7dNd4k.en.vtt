00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.610
 hello in this video i would like you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.190
 tell actively aplia store 80 40 in order 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.259
 to get started with the device 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.320
 Kinap need to run the program 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.629
 search engine 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.820
 Click on the device name 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.129
 we will switch to iwoodwood interface 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.659
 we are dealing with faith store 80 40 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.719
 This device is designed for 8 

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:24.310
 female drives 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.140
 and 40 channels 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.189
 First, let's go in the setup 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.140
 A wide range of options is available here. 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 but in order to get to work 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.870
 you need to create a desktop 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.110
 this is done in the configuration tab 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.590
 devices 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.130
 and in the configuration of the new volume visually 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.120
 the pictures show all our 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.660
 opportunities 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.870
 in this case, the volume is already created 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.060
 Further redistribution of camera settings 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.190
 in order to find add camera we 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 let's use auto search 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.520
 here you can check work 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.520
 camera or not 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.120
 after adding the camera automatically 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.120
 starts his record 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 next we will go recording options 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 here we can adjust the quality 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.150
 recordings for each camera separately 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.030
 adjusting the compression format 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.080
 permission which is here for some reason 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.380
 relative value 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.300
 frame rate 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.240
 and quality 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.939
 if necessary we can enable 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.520
 note canaka world 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.480
 or enable manual recording 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.570
 in the schedule settings we can 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.100
 on build weekly schedule for each 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.970
 cameras 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.820
 sagryni repair in 15 points 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.659
 from the additional parameters you can 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.440
 set up the characteristics of such 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.290
 as 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.119
 rewrite setting and maximum 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.250
 the duration of each 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.069
 recordable files 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.099
 another device has a number of system 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.019
 settings 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.939
 such as setting notification of 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.169
 mistakes 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:20.709
 message options with most 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.450
 remote reboot 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.769
 completion of work 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.169
 hardware parameter 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.659
 system update 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.659
 at the construction site backup 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.959
 remote replication 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.289
 e-card settings 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.309
 and advanced system settings in 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.049
 which includes automatic 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.549
 end of session at a certain time 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.179
 just me 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.329
 now go to the observation page 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.949
 here we can view videos from 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.479
 live cameras this page 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.449
 have a wide selection of modes 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.999

 and barely losing the net 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.069
 size which is regulated dumping 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.409
 four by four 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.389
 yes mesh 7 by 6 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.189

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.509
 recorded video 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.629
 First you need to note which camera 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.129
 you want to see the record 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.949
 then on the timeline can be noted 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.879

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.329
 and run it 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.519
 up to four can be displayed on the screen. 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.519
