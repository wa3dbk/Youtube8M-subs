variation<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.439> maggots<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.790> called

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
variation of maggots is what are called

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.069 
variation of maggots is what are called
mousies<00:01:48.780> now<00:01:49.740> these<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.310> simply<00:01:51.079> maggots

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
mousies now these are simply maggots

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.179 
mousies now these are simply maggots
with<00:01:52.560> tails<00:01:53.040> you'll<00:01:54.000> notice<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:54.659> have
