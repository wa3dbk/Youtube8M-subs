00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.819 
I would have minded it to be a little
bit<00:01:53.189> thinner<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.750> terms<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.500> wow

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
bit thinner but in terms of the wow

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.080 
bit thinner but in terms of the wow
factor<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.369> reckon<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.939> good

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
factor I reckon it is a good

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.719 
factor I reckon it is a good
conversation<00:01:57.719> starter<00:01:57.750> at<00:01:58.710> many<00:01:59.040> places<00:01:59.250> or

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
conversation starter at many places or

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.069 
conversation starter at many places or
whenever<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.210> go<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.360> coffee<00:02:00.630> ends<00:02:00.899> on

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
whenever you go for coffee ends on

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.780 
whenever you go for coffee ends on
Google<00:02:01.320> time<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.100> BAM<00:02:02.310> check<00:02:02.670> this

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
Google time you know what BAM check this

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.510 
Google time you know what BAM check this
out<00:02:03.229> now<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.560> actually<00:02:04.890> pretty<00:02:05.040> easy<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
out now it's actually pretty easy to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.089 
out now it's actually pretty easy to
tell<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.899> my<00:02:07.049> sort<00:02:08.039> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
tell the time but it's one of my sort of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.410 
tell the time but it's one of my sort of
issues<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.580> picked<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.149> straight

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
issues that I picked up with straight

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.580 
issues that I picked up with straight
away<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:11.629> separation<00:02:12.629> but

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
away the separation but

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.210 
away the separation but
the<00:02:13.739> time<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.150> actual<00:02:15.739> LEDs<00:02:16.739> it'll<00:02:17.130> be

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the time and the actual LEDs it'll be

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.250 
the time and the actual LEDs it'll be
hard<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.520> tell<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.510> see<00:02:18.720> here<00:02:18.989> they've

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
hard to tell as you can see here they've

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.110 
hard to tell as you can see here they've
got<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.530> little<00:02:19.739> inner<00:02:20.280> circle<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.730> says

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
got the little inner circle that says

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.630 
got the little inner circle that says
five<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.319> little<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.860> don't<00:02:23.459> know<00:02:23.520> if<00:02:23.580> you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
five so that little I don't know if you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.800 
five so that little I don't know if you
can<00:02:23.760> see<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.060> well<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.300> video<00:02:24.510> by<00:02:24.750> it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
can see it so well in the video by it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.260 
can see it so well in the video by it
says<00:02:25.020> five<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> top<00:02:26.670> part<00:02:26.970> is

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
says five and then the top part is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.540 
says five and then the top part is
actually<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:27.959> bit<00:02:28.140> sort<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.950> dull<00:02:29.190> which

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
actually a little bit sort of dull which

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.610 
actually a little bit sort of dull which
indicates<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.269> five<00:02:30.540> o'clock<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
indicates a five o'clock and in the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.140 
indicates a five o'clock and in the
bottom<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> minutes<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:32.849> basically

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
bottom of the minutes so it's basically

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.259 
bottom of the minutes so it's basically
five<00:02:33.540> oh<00:02:33.569> five<00:02:34.410> something<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.220> now<00:02:36.209> I

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
five oh five something like that now I

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.390 
five oh five something like that now I
would<00:02:36.569> have<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.930> said<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.739> LEDs<00:02:38.190> we

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
would have like said like the LEDs we

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.979 
would have like said like the LEDs we
separated<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.000> bit<00:02:39.150> more<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.569> it's<00:02:39.690> easy<00:02:39.840> to

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
separated a bit more so it's easy to

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.589 
separated a bit more so it's easy to
tell<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.500> quick<00:02:40.680> glance<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.910> sitting<00:02:42.480> on

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
tell at a quick glance but sitting on

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.960 
tell at a quick glance but sitting on
your<00:02:42.810> wrist<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.650> from<00:02:43.800> an<00:02:43.890> angle<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.640> doesn't

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
your wrist and from an angle it doesn't

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.120 
your wrist and from an angle it doesn't
look<00:02:45.060> too<00:02:45.269> bad<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.720> suppose<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.830> something<00:02:47.040> you

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
look too bad I suppose is something you

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.729 
look too bad I suppose is something you
live<00:02:47.370> with<00:02:47.549> but<00:02:47.760> considering<00:02:48.450> there<00:02:48.600> are<00:02:48.739> 139

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
live with but considering there are 139

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.430 
live with but considering there are 139

the<00:03:17.730> battery<00:03:17.970> life<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.420> because<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> just

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
the battery life is because I just

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.110 
the battery life is because I just
started<00:03:19.170> using<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:20.489> they<00:03:20.640> do<00:03:20.700> give<00:03:21.030> you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
started using it but they do give you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.470 
started using it but they do give you
some<00:03:21.299> components<00:03:21.930> with<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.170> actual<00:03:23.090> watch<00:03:24.090> to
