and square up with all the fingers and
that's<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> actual<00:00:52.469> legitimate<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270

that's the actual legitimate way to do a
poker<00:00:54.899> shuffle<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> come<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:56.010> fingers<00:00:56.940> are

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
poker shuffle is to come up fingers are

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.729 
poker shuffle is to come up fingers are
on<00:00:57.180> top<00:00:57.590> thumbs<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.800> let<00:00:59.699> each<00:00:59.730> card<00:01:00.149> drop

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
on top thumbs just let each card drop

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.830 
on top thumbs just let each card drop
like<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.090> then<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> pinkies<00:01:03.480> come<00:01:03.690> around

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
like so then the pinkies come around

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.380 
like so then the pinkies come around
back<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:04.830> push<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.880> fingers<00:01:06.210> stay

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
back and they push in the fingers stay

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
back and they push in the fingers stay
on<00:01:06.510> top<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> thumbs<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> back<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
on top and the thumbs in the back to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
on top and the thumbs in the back to
keep<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.549> from<00:01:08.729> sliding<00:01:08.970> around<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.600> then

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
keep them from sliding around and then

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440 
keep them from sliding around and then
they<00:01:10.170> give<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> square<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
they give it a square up and that's the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
they give it a square up and that's the
actual<00:01:12.689> legitimate<00:01:12.930> poker<00:01:13.229> shuffle<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.070> want

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
actual legitimate poker shuffle you want

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
actual legitimate poker shuffle you want
to<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> table<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.299> guess

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
to do it on a table I guess

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
to do it on a table I guess
theoretically<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.770> could<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.250> without

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
theoretically you could do that without

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.870 
theoretically you could do that without
a<00:01:17.759> table<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.869> look<00:01:18.900> funny<00:01:19.880> doing

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
a table it would just look funny doing

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.219 
a table it would just look funny doing
one<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.210> these<00:01:21.330> things<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:21.810> coming<00:01:22.140> in

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
one of these things and then coming in

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.039 
one of these things and then coming in
like<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.409> without<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> table<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.390> looks

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
like that without a table it just looks

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
like that without a table it just looks
more<00:01:25.110> awkward<00:01:25.409> than<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.950> doing<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.610> riffle

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
more awkward than just doing your riffle

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.039 
more awkward than just doing your riffle
shuffle<00:01:27.259> without<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> table<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.930> do

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
shuffle without a table so when you do

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
shuffle without a table so when you do
your<00:01:31.200> paper<00:01:31.380> shuffles<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.460> sure<00:01:32.610> you

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
your paper shuffles just make sure you

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.780 
your paper shuffles just make sure you
split<00:01:33.600> half<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> deck<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.619> actually<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.700> in

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
split half the deck and actually get in

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.399 
split half the deck and actually get in
that<00:01:35.909> position<00:01:36.090> both<00:01:36.540> hands<00:01:36.780> start<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.200> top
