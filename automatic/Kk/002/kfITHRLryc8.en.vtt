00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.540
 The first video got to know the air masses and Cap laschen today I show 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.460
 you fixed meshes what air meshes and strong stitches you can for example 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.460
 already a potholder can 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:17.769
 allowed her rounds or finely crocheted 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.769
 initially marched is usually set by air meshes 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.409
 with fixed stitches this is not some air 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.939
 1 another air bottle 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.730
 Air mass of the advantages a stinging 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.210
 this loop of air mesh pervades where and thread 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.290
 nine questions in what 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 slept on the hick-hack pull through 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.080
 solid mesh 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.080
 then she had reached the end of a row since 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380
 always a jump-off 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.390
 Pick up the car again to ask questions and I pull both loops 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.709
 a sting 

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:03.709
 Ask where to go for rides 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.860
 going to take the work away 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.150
 he starts again 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 a bubble 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.590
 the advantage again each one 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 crochet 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.110
 now out of the right stitch 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 no longer nibble from air under the two upper loops of the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 Ash is also a puncture site 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.909
 He passes through to the end as well as the first row 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.839
 the special is now 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.079
 At first some of the air passes by 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.009
 even this man already has to be considered because it forms 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.149
 yes the first solid machine 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.269
 the over 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.629
 as well 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.930
 if you can hardly recognize them in this scam must also be a solid 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.589
 Mesh in 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:48.419
 turn everything around again and the next row starts from the beginning 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.469
 that was nothing Team wish you much fun with our other videos 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.099
 visited including preparations for www Obelix de
