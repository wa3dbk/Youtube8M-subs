class set up video and let's get right

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.940 
class set up video and let's get right
into<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.389> ASM<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:10.110> with

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
into it so I have the ASM one with

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.640 
into it so I have the ASM one with
advanced<00:00:11.700> rifling<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:12.599> grip<00:00:12.840> then<00:00:13.500> you

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
advanced rifling and for grip then you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.589 
advanced rifling and for grip then you
have<00:00:13.799> danger<00:00:14.190> close<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.759> then<00:00:15.179> your<00:00:15.360> clothes

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
have danger close and then your clothes

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.870 
have danger close and then your clothes
is<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.379> know<00:00:16.470> scorestreak<00:00:17.130> damage<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
is for you know scorestreak damage the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.450 
is for you know scorestreak damage the
extras<00:00:18.300> go<00:00:18.449> through<00:00:18.810> damage<00:00:19.189> peripherals<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
extras go through damage peripherals the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.010 
extras go through damage peripherals the
ghost<00:00:20.699> map<00:00:20.970> because<00:00:21.240> I'm<00:00:21.390> used<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.840> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
ghost map because I'm used to it and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.500 
ghost map because I'm used to it and
it's<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.550> needed<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.820> game<00:00:24.060> arm

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
it's like needed in this game arm

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.000 
it's like needed in this game arm
hardline<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.779> scavenger<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.680> reason<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
hardline and scavenger and the reason I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.780 
hardline and scavenger and the reason I
run<00:00:29.250> hard<00:00:29.609> line<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.430> 100

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
run hard line is so that it's a 100

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
run hard line is so that it's a 100
points<00:00:33.239> decrease<00:00:33.660> courts<00:00:34.230> drink<00:00:34.440> by<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
points decrease courts drink by a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.819 
points decrease courts drink by a
hundred<00:00:35.730> points<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.630> scavenger<00:00:37.260> obviously

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
hundred points and scavenger obviously

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.080 
hundred points and scavenger obviously
you<00:00:38.040> don't<00:00:38.219> want<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.430> run<00:00:38.610> out<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.850> bullets

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
you don't want to run out of bullets

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.440 
you don't want to run out of bullets
when<00:00:39.570> you're<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> streak<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.219> yeah<00:00:41.450> first

things first you have the bombing run

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.270 
things first you have the bombing run

bomber additional bomber obviously to
call<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.980> two<00:00:50.640> bombers<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> same<00:00:51.480> time<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
call in two bombers at the same time and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.830 
call in two bombers at the same time and
stuff<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.190> know<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.879> case<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.360> call<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
stuff you know just in case if I call it

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.860 
stuff you know just in case if I call it
in<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.260> don't<00:00:56.219> want<00:00:56.370> them<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.480> from

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
in I don't want them to like see from

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.560 
in I don't want them to like see from
which<00:00:58.079> direction<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.300> bombing<00:01:00.300> run<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
which direction that the bombing run is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.660 
which direction that the bombing run is
coming<00:01:00.780> from<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:01.980> won't<00:01:02.219> hide<00:01:02.430> in

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
coming from so they won't hide in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.370 
coming from so they won't hide in
buildings<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> yeah<00:01:05.040> um<00:01:05.869> next<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
buildings so yeah um next you got the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.460 
buildings so yeah um next you got the
aerial<00:01:07.890> assault<00:01:08.159> drone<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.729> AI<00:01:09.659> control<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
aerial assault drone and AI control and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
aerial assault drone and AI control and
rockets<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:11.850> helpful<00:01:12.119> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
rockets this is very very helpful it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.210 
rockets this is very very helpful it
gets<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> few<00:01:13.140> kills<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> guess<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
gets you a few kills and I guess you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
gets you a few kills and I guess you
kills<00:01:14.490> towards<00:01:14.939> your<00:01:15.150> warbird<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.229> well<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
kills towards your warbird as well so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.399 
kills towards your warbird as well so
that's<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.310> arm<00:01:17.840> now<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
that's pretty good arm now on the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.880 
that's pretty good arm now on the
warbird<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.939> fender<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
warbird I have the fender on it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.560 
warbird I have the fender on it
aggressor<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.340> seeks<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:24.000> enemy

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
aggressor is just seeks out enemy

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.499 
aggressor is just seeks out enemy
targets<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.439> defender<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.939> basically

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
targets but this defender it's basically

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.950 
targets but this defender it's basically
arm<00:01:28.220> like<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.549> escort<00:01:30.030> drone<00:01:30.240> black<00:01:30.570> ops<00:01:30.780> ooh

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
arm like the escort drone black ops ooh

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.050 
arm like the escort drone black ops ooh
it<00:01:31.140> follows<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.590> around<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.759> shoots

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it follows you around and it shoots

it follows you around and it shoots
people<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.509> well<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.990> that's<00:01:34.140> pretty<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
I have the UAV which is um which I have

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.280 
I have the UAV which is um which I have
extra<00:01:41.009> time<00:01:41.220> enemy<00:01:42.060> direction<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.720> threat

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
extra time enemy direction and threat

extra time enemy direction and threat
detection<00:01:44.180> you<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.329> uh<00:01:46.159> extra<00:01:47.159> time<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.700> last

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
detection you know uh extra time to last

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.749 
detection you know uh extra time to last
you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.810> long<00:01:49.530> time<00:01:49.860> towards<00:01:50.399> my<00:01:50.549> neck

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you know a long time towards my neck

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.410 
you know a long time towards my neck
stinks<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.869> yet<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.009> my<00:01:53.220> DNA<00:01:54.090> class

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
whenever they get a UAV because it is so

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.930 
whenever they get a UAV because it is so
easy<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.060> spam<00:02:06.710> UAVs<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.740> killstreaks<00:02:08.399> all

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
easy to spam UAVs and killstreaks all

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609 
easy to spam UAVs and killstreaks all
kinds<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.270> kill<00:02:09.450> streaks<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.929> domination<00:02:10.349> now

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
kinds of kill streaks and domination now

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.580 
kinds of kill streaks and domination now
so<00:02:11.310> yeah<00:02:11.489> peripherals<00:02:12.209> toughness<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.260> know

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
so yeah peripherals toughness you know

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.460 
so yeah peripherals toughness you know
you<00:02:13.950> don't<00:02:14.099> want<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> get<00:02:14.400> outgunned<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.470> she

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
you don't want to get outgunned and she

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.650 
you don't want to get outgunned and she
put<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> hard<00:02:16.950> line<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.370> nine<00:02:17.970> times<00:02:18.330> out<00:02:18.599> of

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
put a hard line on it nine times out of

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.920 
put a hard line on it nine times out of
ten<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.319> will<00:02:19.769> get<00:02:20.099> out<00:02:20.250> gun<00:02:20.580> in<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:21.690> gunfight

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
ten you will get out gun in a gunfight

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.759 
ten you will get out gun in a gunfight
so<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.650> careful<00:02:23.209> if<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.540> decide<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.260> run<00:02:25.410> hard

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
so be careful if you decide to run hard

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.630 
so be careful if you decide to run hard
line<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.030> freaking<00:02:27.720> flank<00:02:28.470> them<00:02:28.709> so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
line you have to freaking flank them so

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.759 
line you have to freaking flank them so
yeah<00:02:29.819> scavenger<00:02:30.480> obviously<00:02:31.140> not<00:02:31.290> running<00:02:31.620> out

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
yeah scavenger obviously not running out

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.589 
yeah scavenger obviously not running out
of<00:02:31.799> bullets<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.370> basically<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> same

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
of bullets and basically it's the same

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.059 
of bullets and basically it's the same
setup<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.769> UAV<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:36.470> have<00:02:37.470> extra<00:02:37.830> time

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
setup for the UAV I have extra time

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.640 
setup for the UAV I have extra time
enemy<00:02:38.790> direction<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.330> threat<00:02:39.569> detection<00:02:39.930> then

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
enemy direction in threat detection then

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.309 
enemy direction in threat detection then
I<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.860> double<00:02:41.310> extended<00:02:41.790> time<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.420> disabled

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
I have double extended time and disabled

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.030 
I have double extended time and disabled
exosuit<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.910> sable<00:02:45.239> axle<00:02:45.630> soup<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.079> like

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
exosuit and the sable axle soup is like

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.640 
exosuit and the sable axle soup is like
so<00:02:47.370> they<00:02:47.519> won't<00:02:47.730> jump<00:02:48.090> or<00:02:48.420> XO<00:02:48.900> dash<00:02:49.140> whoever

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
so they won't jump or XO dash whoever

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.430 
so they won't jump or XO dash whoever
doesn't<00:02:49.829> have<00:02:50.069> hardwired<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.110> double<00:02:52.110> extend

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
doesn't have hardwired and double extend

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.190 
doesn't have hardwired and double extend
the<00:02:52.530> time<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.819> last<00:02:54.000> up<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.329> like<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.840> minute

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the time it can last up to like a minute

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.680 
the time it can last up to like a minute
I<00:02:55.319> believe<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.980> minute<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.370> more<00:02:56.579> so<00:02:57.480> yeah
