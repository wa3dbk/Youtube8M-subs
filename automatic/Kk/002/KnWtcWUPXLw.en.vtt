00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.490 

there<00:04:10.960> is<00:04:11.110> one<00:04:11.320> advantage<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:13.140> buying<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.380> new

one<00:04:14.650> each<00:04:14.830> time<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.190> breaks<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:16.540> is<00:04:16.750> I

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.050 
one each time it breaks and that is I

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.150 
one each time it breaks and that is I
believe<00:04:17.110> that<00:04:17.380> there<00:04:17.650> is<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.769> ten<00:04:17.980> percent

believe that there is a ten percent

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.539 
believe that there is a ten percent
chance<00:04:18.670> of<00:04:19.290> or<00:04:20.290> there's<00:04:20.890> some<00:04:21.040> chance<00:04:21.250> of

chance of getting twice as much XP as

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.720 
chance of getting twice as much XP as
you<00:04:28.780> normally<00:04:28.900> would<00:04:29.110> have<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.620> believe<00:04:30.610> it's

quite sure though because it's been a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.760 
quite sure though because it's been a
while<00:04:40.500> but<00:04:42.150> okay<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:43.440> once<00:04:44.440> you're<00:04:44.590> done<00:04:44.710> with

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
while but okay so once you're done with

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.090 
while but okay so once you're done with
that<00:04:46.260> what<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:47.380> would<00:04:47.470> do<00:04:47.590> is<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:47.890> keep

bank and the altar but uh if you're
going<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:03.960> use<00:05:04.960> multiple<00:05:05.380> staffs<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.950> would

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
going to use multiple staffs I would

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.670 
going to use multiple staffs I would
recommend<00:05:06.340> having<00:05:06.760> them<00:05:07.030> banked<00:05:07.420> already<00:05:07.870> um

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
recommend having them banked already um

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:18.180 
recommend having them banked already um

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
I think I used 15 law staffs to give me

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.050 
I think I used 15 law staffs to give me
20<00:05:18.310> Jamil<00:05:18.640> um<00:05:20.580> yeah<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:22.030> I<00:05:23.040> mean<00:05:24.040> it's<00:05:24.280> 1.5<00:05:24.850> k

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
20 Jamil um yeah so I mean it's 1.5 k

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.700 
20 Jamil um yeah so I mean it's 1.5 k
points<00:05:25.419> but<00:05:25.510> that's<00:05:25.630> easy<00:05:25.930> as<00:05:26.200> had<00:05:26.380> to<00:05:26.530> get

the moms that are in there I believe

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.379

that all of the mobs in there will drop

that all of the mobs in there will drop
pouches<00:06:22.190> but<00:06:23.190> not<00:06:23.880> entirely<00:06:24.300> sure<00:06:25.789> after

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
pouches but not entirely sure after

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.050 
pouches but not entirely sure after
about<00:06:27.090> 50<00:06:27.660> kills<00:06:27.930> I<00:06:28.229> think<00:06:29.100> I<00:06:29.190> had<00:06:29.340> like<00:06:29.520> four

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
about 50 kills I think I had like four

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.230 
about 50 kills I think I had like four
or<00:06:30.180> five<00:06:30.210> small<00:06:30.900> pouches<00:06:31.139> and<00:06:34.639> one<00:06:35.639> large<00:06:35.910> and

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
or five small pouches and one large and

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:46.700 
or five small pouches and one large and
two<00:06:36.360> medium<00:06:36.810> pouches<00:06:39.470> um<00:06:42.050> so<00:06:43.050> yeah<00:06:43.620> um<00:06:45.260> I<00:06:46.260> don't

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
two medium pouches um so yeah um I don't

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.779 
two medium pouches um so yeah um I don't
think<00:06:46.889> it's<00:06:47.250> worth<00:06:47.639> it<00:06:47.820> to<00:06:48.110> have<00:06:50.360> multiple

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
think it's worth it to have multiple

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.310 
think it's worth it to have multiple
like<00:06:53.789> small<00:06:54.210> pouches<00:06:54.479> I<00:06:54.840> don't<00:06:55.080> think<00:06:55.110> it's

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
like small pouches I don't think it's

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.379 
like small pouches I don't think it's
worth<00:06:55.440> it<00:06:55.530> to<00:06:55.620> have<00:06:55.710> a<00:06:55.770> small<00:06:56.010> pouch<00:06:56.389> because

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
worth it to have a small pouch because

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.540 
worth it to have a small pouch because
it<00:06:57.479> seems<00:06:57.690> like<00:06:57.780> just<00:06:58.020> one<00:06:58.289> inventory<00:06:59.039> space<00:06:59.310> I

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
it seems like just one inventory space I

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.270 
it seems like just one inventory space I
mean<00:06:59.760> if<00:07:00.720> you<00:07:00.900> think<00:07:01.139> it's<00:07:01.289> worth<00:07:01.410> it<00:07:01.620> then<00:07:02.099> do

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
mean if you think it's worth it then do

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.909 
mean if you think it's worth it then do
it<00:07:02.310> but<00:07:02.820> I<00:07:03.090> just<00:07:04.050> wasn't<00:07:04.349> into<00:07:04.770> using<00:07:04.979> pouches

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
it but I just wasn't into using pouches

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.430 
it but I just wasn't into using pouches
if<00:07:07.919> you<00:07:08.070> do<00:07:08.310> use<00:07:08.580> pouches<00:07:09.000> up<00:07:09.150> make<00:07:09.840> sure<00:07:09.870> that

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
if you do use pouches up make sure that

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.980 
if you do use pouches up make sure that
you<00:07:10.590> use<00:07:10.650> a<00:07:11.099> large<00:07:11.789> pouch<00:07:12.120> and<00:07:12.419> the<00:07:12.690> medium

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
you use a large pouch and the medium

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.480 
you use a large pouch and the medium
pouch<00:07:13.169> at<00:07:13.410> least<00:07:15.199> um<00:07:16.199> if<00:07:16.410> you<00:07:17.160> have<00:07:17.250> more<00:07:17.430> than

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
pouch at least um if you have more than

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.670 
pouch at least um if you have more than
one<00:07:17.610> of<00:07:17.940> a<00:07:18.300> certain<00:07:18.810> type<00:07:18.990> of<00:07:19.020> pouch<00:07:19.410> in<00:07:19.590> the

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
one of a certain type of pouch in the

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.969 
one of a certain type of pouch in the
inventory<00:07:19.919> it<00:07:20.760> only<00:07:21.240> the<00:07:22.050> game<00:07:22.830> only

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
inventory it only the game only

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.760 
inventory it only the game only
recognizes<00:07:23.849> it<00:07:24.030> as<00:07:24.150> one<00:07:24.389> so<00:07:25.199> if<00:07:25.289> you<00:07:25.410> stored

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
recognizes it as one so if you stored

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.680 
recognizes it as one so if you stored
one<00:07:26.099> small<00:07:26.370> pouch<00:07:26.550> and<00:07:26.820> then<00:07:27.270> store<00:07:27.660> it

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.690 
one small pouch and then store it

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.529 
one small pouch and then store it
another<00:07:27.960> salt<00:07:28.229> small<00:07:28.560> pouch<00:07:28.770> it<00:07:29.539> wouldn't

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 
another salt small pouch it wouldn't

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:32.210 
another salt small pouch it wouldn't
work<00:07:30.660> it<00:07:30.960> would<00:07:31.050> be<00:07:31.110> as<00:07:31.320> if<00:07:31.349> field<00:07:31.740> at<00:07:31.949> only

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
work it would be as if field at only

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.540 
work it would be as if field at only
stored<00:07:32.580> one<00:07:33.180> so<00:07:33.830> you're<00:07:34.830> not<00:07:34.919> actually<00:07:35.130> saving

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:35.550 
stored one so you're not actually saving

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.510 
stored one so you're not actually saving
any<00:07:35.760> room<00:07:35.970> when<00:07:36.120> you<00:07:36.210> have<00:07:36.419> multiple<00:07:37.520> pouches

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 
any room when you have multiple pouches

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.939 
any room when you have multiple pouches
and<00:07:38.789> this<00:07:38.970> is<00:07:39.060> also<00:07:39.210> a<00:07:39.330> place<00:07:39.570> to<00:07:39.720> get
