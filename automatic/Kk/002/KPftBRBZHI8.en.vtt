00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
once you activate generator 1 and the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
once you activate generator 1 and the
spawn<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> blood<00:01:30.720> leave<00:01:30.960> that

spawn is you have a blood leave that
blood<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.860> pick<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.729> shoot

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
blood there go pick that up and shoot

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
blood there go pick that up and shoot
the<00:01:33.360> plane<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.740> glowing

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the plane down you will see a glowing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.160 
the plane down you will see a glowing
outside<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.759> once<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> goes<00:01:36.210> down<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.990> guys

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
outside so once it goes down the guys

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.020 
outside so once it goes down the guys
Takeo<00:01:37.740> needs<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.280> zombie<00:01:38.640> blood<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.970> he

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
will see a zombie spawn that no other

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.429 
will see a zombie spawn that no other
person<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.259> go

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
person can so what you got to do is go

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
person can so what you got to do is go
kill<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> pick<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> the

kill that pick up that and go on to the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.080 
kill that pick up that and go on to the
next<00:01:45.810> step<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> next<00:01:47.100> step<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
next step so the next step is to get the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.700 
next step so the next step is to get the
Thunder<00:01:48.450> fist<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.810> go<00:01:48.960> downstairs<00:01:49.530> near
