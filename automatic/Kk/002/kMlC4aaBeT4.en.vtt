00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.070 
space and comfort as you can see knee
room<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.980> really<00:03:38.760> very<00:03:38.940> good<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.299> Headroom<00:03:39.810> is

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
room is really very good and Headroom is

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.839 
room is really very good and Headroom is
generous<00:03:40.440> as<00:03:40.620> well<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.040> because<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.640> front

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
generous as well and because the front

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.130 
generous as well and because the front
seats<00:03:42.060> are<00:03:42.150> slightly<00:03:42.540> raised<00:03:42.780> what<00:03:42.989> that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
seats are slightly raised what that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.780 
seats are slightly raised what that
means<00:03:43.379> is<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.799> get<00:03:43.950> place<00:03:44.489> where<00:03:44.730> you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
means is that you get place where you

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.180 
means is that you get place where you
can<00:03:45.030> stretch<00:03:45.540> your<00:03:45.569> feet<00:03:45.870> below<00:03:46.170> them<00:03:46.440> well

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
can stretch your feet below them well

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.280 
can stretch your feet below them well
the<00:03:47.310> big<00:03:47.519> glass<00:03:47.819> area<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.569> nano<00:03:48.750> really

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
the big glass area on the nano really

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.830 
the big glass area on the nano really
does<00:03:49.470> help<00:03:49.709> give<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.579> sense<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:51.000> space<00:03:51.060> well

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
does help give it a sense of space well

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.899 
does help give it a sense of space well
the<00:03:51.930> other<00:03:52.079> plus<00:03:52.290> point<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.190> Nano<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.730> of

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
the other plus point of the Nano is of

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.149 
the other plus point of the Nano is of
course<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.209> fact<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.930> floor<00:03:55.769> board<00:03:56.010> is

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
course the fact that the floor board is

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.729 
course the fact that the floor board is
very<00:03:56.489> flat<00:03:56.849> ish<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.230> white<00:03:58.470> guy<00:03:58.500> at

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
very flat ish and it is a white guy at

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.410 
very flat ish and it is a white guy at
the<00:03:58.890> back<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.280> what<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.519> means<00:03:59.819> is<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.030> you

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
the back so what that means is that you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.479 
the back so what that means is that you
can<00:04:00.660> generally<00:04:01.140> have<00:04:01.319> three<00:04:01.950> occupants<00:04:02.250> over

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
can generally have three occupants over

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.610 
can generally have three occupants over
here<00:04:02.700> for<00:04:03.120> those<00:04:03.209> long<00:04:03.420> journeys<00:04:03.810> well<00:04:04.410> even

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
here for those long journeys well even

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.110 
here for those long journeys well even
like<00:04:04.769> other<00:04:05.040> affordable<00:04:05.280> hatchbacks<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
like other affordable hatchbacks the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.580 
like other affordable hatchbacks the
Nano<00:04:06.359> is<00:04:06.569> pretty<00:04:06.840> poor<00:04:07.019> when<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.290> comes<00:04:07.470> to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
Nano is pretty poor when it comes to

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.830 
Nano is pretty poor when it comes to

well<00:04:20.860> so<00:04:21.040> here<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.250> am<00:04:21.370> now<00:04:21.489> driving<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.030> new

engine too much on this car so it's the

refinement<00:04:35.980> this<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.370> pretty<00:04:36.580> decent<00:04:36.850> end

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
refinement this is a pretty decent end

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.300

in<00:04:37.660> considering<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.170> is<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.380> course<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.830> very

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
in considering it is of course a very

affordable and a very inexpensive car
but<00:04:42.040> yes<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.640> does<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:43.050> fall<00:04:44.050> behind<00:04:44.860> its<00:04:45.040> main

but yes it does a fall behind its main
rivals<00:04:45.670> well<00:04:46.060> because<00:04:46.360> it<00:04:46.480> gets<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.810> very<00:04:46.990> light

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
rivals well because it gets a very light

was in a bigger hatchback I would have

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.280 
was in a bigger hatchback I would have

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
had to make at least five different

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.000 
had to make at least five different

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
maneuvers to get a u-turn done but with

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:20.720 
maneuvers to get a u-turn done but with
the<00:05:12.160> Nano<00:05:12.370> I<00:05:12.580> can<00:05:12.820> do<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.090> in<00:05:13.330> one<00:05:16.830> two

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.600 

and<00:05:20.820> three<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:24.350> as<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:25.740> can<00:05:25.830> see<00:05:25.890> we<00:05:26.430> are<00:05:26.460> off

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
and three and as you can see we are off

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.490 
and three and as you can see we are off
back<00:05:26.820> on<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.060> road<00:05:27.210> in<00:05:27.780> fact<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.110> steering<00:05:28.410> is

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
back on the road in fact the steering is

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.470 
back on the road in fact the steering is
so<00:05:28.530> light<00:05:28.920> you<00:05:29.070> can<00:05:29.130> actually<00:05:29.430> just<00:05:30.150> move<00:05:30.330> it

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
so light you can actually just move it

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.060 
so light you can actually just move it
around<00:05:30.570> with<00:05:30.870> your<00:05:31.020> single<00:05:31.290> finger<00:05:31.710> and<00:05:31.950> you

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
around with your single finger and you

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.340 
around with your single finger and you
can<00:05:32.190> really<00:05:32.340> negotiate<00:05:32.850> that<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.540> learn<00:05:33.780> all

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
can really negotiate that you learn all

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.130 
can really negotiate that you learn all

this s modo here which are four stands
for<00:06:24.750> sports<00:06:25.080> but<00:06:25.530> I<00:06:25.590> like<00:06:25.800> the<00:06:25.950> zest<00:06:26.190> and<00:06:26.340> the

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
for sports but I like the zest and the

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.880

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.740 
in performance over here this s button
really<00:06:31.110> does<00:06:31.710> seem<00:06:31.920> like<00:06:32.220> a<00:06:32.250> bit<00:06:32.430> of<00:06:32.520> a<00:06:32.580> gimmick

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
really does seem like a bit of a gimmick

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.360 
really does seem like a bit of a gimmick
well<00:06:33.750> if<00:06:33.870> you<00:06:33.960> are<00:06:34.080> someone<00:06:34.440> who<00:06:34.470> enjoys<00:06:34.860> risk

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
well if you are someone who enjoys risk

performance<00:06:35.850> then<00:06:36.000> of<00:06:36.120> course<00:06:36.300> you<00:06:36.420> can<00:06:36.570> also

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
performance then of course you can also

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.990 
performance then of course you can also
use<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:37.410> gas<00:06:37.560> manually<00:06:38.100> by<00:06:38.340> pushing<00:06:38.580> it<00:06:38.760> here

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
use the gas manually by pushing it here

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.690 
use the gas manually by pushing it here

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
shifts and pushing it up pop shifts well

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.710 
shifts and pushing it up pop shifts well
even<00:06:44.310> though<00:06:44.460> the<00:06:44.490> Nano<00:06:44.760> has<00:06:45.000> a<00:06:45.030> very<00:06:45.300> short
