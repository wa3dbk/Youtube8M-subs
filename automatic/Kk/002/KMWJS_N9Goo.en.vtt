those days we took lot of reference so

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
those days we took lot of reference so
the<00:00:39.239> textures<00:00:39.690> which<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.079> used<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> sets

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the textures which we used on the sets

tar roads with soil and we had the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
tar roads with soil and we had the
problem<00:01:24.960> facing<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.890> covering<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
problem facing like covering up the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.569 
problem facing like covering up the
electrical<00:01:26.939> poles<00:01:27.240> all<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.890> wore<00:01:29.340> up

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
electrical poles all that so we wore up

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
electrical poles all that so we wore up
all<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.689> coconut<00:01:31.170> trees<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.680> all

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.340 
all that like with coconut trees and all
that<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.430> good

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.050 

every<00:01:39.350> scene<00:01:39.590> in<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:39.799> film<00:01:39.860> goes<00:01:40.369> back<00:01:40.670> into

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
every scene in this film goes back into

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.910 
every scene in this film goes back into
a<00:01:41.329> lot<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.570> period<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.080> comes<00:01:42.229> back<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:42.770> that

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
a lot of period and comes back so that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.370 
a lot of period and comes back so that
is<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.729> always<00:01:43.939> a<00:01:44.119> back<00:01:44.540> story<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:45.229> every

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
is a that always a back story in every

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.710 
is a that always a back story in every
scene<00:01:45.710> that<00:01:45.740> happens<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:46.850> once<00:01:47.119> that<00:01:47.240> sequence

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
scene that happens so once that sequence

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.679 
scene that happens so once that sequence
is<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:48.140> full<00:01:48.470> balloon<00:01:48.770> effect<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:49.670> this<00:01:50.270> whole

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
is a full balloon effect so this whole

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.200 
is a full balloon effect so this whole
idea<00:01:50.869> was<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:51.860> had<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.189> stuff<00:01:52.460> about<00:01:52.700> man<00:01:53.060> like

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
idea was we had to stuff about man like

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.639 
idea was we had to stuff about man like
gas<00:01:53.450> filled<00:01:53.780> balloons<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.439> when<00:01:54.530> we

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
gas filled balloons and when we

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.830 
gas filled balloons and when we
conceived<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.070> tent<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.909> that<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.270> top<00:01:56.479> opens

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
conceived a tent so that the top opens

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.469 
conceived a tent so that the top opens
up<00:01:56.990> for<00:01:57.860> all<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.220> balloons<00:01:58.340> could<00:01:58.729> go<00:01:58.909> up<00:01:59.060> see

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
up for all the balloons could go up see

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.580 
up for all the balloons could go up see
these<00:01:59.659> balloons<00:02:00.020> are<00:02:00.200> filled<00:02:00.380> with<00:02:00.500> helium

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
these balloons are filled with helium

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.039 
these balloons are filled with helium
balloons<00:02:01.220> because<00:02:01.369> your<00:02:01.970> normal<00:02:02.360> gas<00:02:02.600> what

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
balloons because your normal gas what

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.090 
balloons because your normal gas what
you<00:02:03.170> fill<00:02:03.470> are<00:02:04.220> highly<00:02:05.170> inflammable<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.799> when

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
you fill are highly inflammable so when

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.440 
you fill are highly inflammable so when
the<00:02:07.220> protagonist<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.850> standing<00:02:08.179> in<00:02:08.269> routine

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
the protagonist is standing in routine

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.150 
the protagonist is standing in routine
Soni<00:02:08.810> balloon<00:02:09.110> some<00:02:09.649> spark<00:02:09.979> happens

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
Soni balloon some spark happens

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.410 
Soni balloon some spark happens
somewhere<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.910> whole<00:02:11.060> thing<00:02:11.239> goes<00:02:11.390> up

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
somewhere and the whole thing goes up

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.809 
somewhere and the whole thing goes up
each<00:02:11.660> day<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.230> we<00:02:12.739> had<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.980> pump<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.549> lot<00:02:13.700> of

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
each day so we had to pump in a lot of

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.490 
each day so we had to pump in a lot of
money<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.450> pump<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.870> helium<00:02:15.170> into<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
money to pump in the helium into the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.530 
money to pump in the helium into the
balloon<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.920> was<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.370> big<00:02:16.670> challenge<00:02:17.090> as<00:02:17.360> a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
balloon it was a big challenge as a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.120 
balloon it was a big challenge as a
