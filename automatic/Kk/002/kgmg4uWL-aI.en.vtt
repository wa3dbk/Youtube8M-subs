00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.359
 and there will be a warm welcome 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.359
 made little 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 unbelievably exciting thing 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.250
 by day and who 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.880
 she represents 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.880
 to do so 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.939
 Herr Schmidt 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.210
 to have something 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.930
 but before I go barefoot now 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 show a bit small and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.070
 say that's an idea that I have 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.590
 I said you know no idea of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 something would ever happen that is 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.120
 pure speculation and no box out 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 would play before films and I believe 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.610
 I think I would not know that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.180
 somehow just gonna be fine in clash 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.360
 fit in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.670
 in my opinion and zack there it is 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.649
 clear war tournaments 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.280
 For example, we have left for it 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.720
 page 4 clans fighting each other and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.190
 in the very normal clear against each other 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.289
 to say enemy and was clear in this 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.479
 The winner clearly then fights against the winner 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.789
 So bottom winner can play 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.530
 one or clear 3 1 and can only 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.630
 two, the two then play again 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.119
 give and you can build that up quite a bit 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.560
 like a tournament stop and the winners 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.720
 at the very end or maybe also 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.830
 the best three clowns you can do it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.090
 not just with somehow eight 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.580
 You can do that to different clans 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.420
 also with 16 clans and the top 3 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.770
 Clans then get certain number 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.940
 gold and somehow completely 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.739
 you could find exciting then you could 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.780
 for example somehow such a final round 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.280
 play where you did that then that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.190
 for example with the clear ones 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.959
 war the clear attacker attacks that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.700
 not the sound that is attacking you 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.319
 but that you change so through 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.640
 so by 3 by change I found 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.690
 somehow also tense and find the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.800
 idea somehow very cool 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.720
 and of course we have to stop then 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.789
 put really fat loaded and that would have to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.619
 somehow so no idea anywhere 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.000
 Germany and then everywhere 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.649
 all other countries and then 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.479
 somehow in europe and then nobody man 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.950
 could whole season so now first 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.270
 European championship then make it 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.530
 maybe a world championship out of it 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.739
 because I have somehow that 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.319
 feeling that I have found this clear 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.250
 event and that's all 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.900
 I have no idea 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.190
 of course, through this whole other 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.840
 complete program because I take me 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.280
 Doing a lot of tournaments again and doing so 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.930
 and I have the feeling on equal 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.099
 Little is missing so where the people are 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.360
 I mean I could not go there 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.290
 I could easily moderate that, though 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.030
 I definitely could not not 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.470
 do not participate because I'm too weak 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.700
 I'm just gonna and I will 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.110
 Care what you think about it 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.319
 I personally think the idea is pretty 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.550
 of course , of course, is not cool 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.430
 my idea, the idea had determined 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.140
 someone else but I have 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.340
 now such a picture painted to quasi 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.560
 and if that's a few more 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.430
 I give other freedom or see 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.209
 just a little way off 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.989
 for what could or could stack 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.269
 all the more 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.920
 on the one hand you could of course so 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.970
 make the hands moderately easy 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.930
 would be thrown together with 16 clans 28 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.849
 clear or with 32 clans 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.120
 thrown together and then one 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.920
 winner 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.860
 take a while 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.380
 a small od 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.370
 in the preparation service hours 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:25.049
 day of battle clear 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.049
 40 hours maximum 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.390
 1 half 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.600
 after days of a 4 something like that 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.890
 and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.090
 because we, of course, how to do it then 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.090
 another global leader burgundy 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.280
 in addition to cup gets with the stands 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:54.450
 third place was clear 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.730
 tournament 2015 july no 2000 and me 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.380
 think that could be right 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.490
 really cold 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.830
 That would be something because I have the feeling 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.300
 somehow the normal plan horst is called 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.900
 So are a 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.629
 really you can 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.210
 I measure that's gonna be something like that 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.310
 the people can chat with each other 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.950
 drag later 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.760
 the song with the 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.109
 while chatting you can 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.660
 Furthermore, that requires you, for example 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.070
 Informs father of the complete check 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.070
 where all the people are inside 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.960
 that together with what I have 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.580
 use like music but I can 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.930
 give them more cool at müller of course 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.129
 would still be worth a little 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.030
 a little bit so rumpold will become 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:38.879
 plate will be the same person 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:42.580
 mtv really terrible 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:44.830
 hinders thinking about it 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.060
 perfectly make the audience about it 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.999
 which possible addresses couple 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.409
 to show a thousand people and you can 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:51.669
 Write me your opinion for it 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.830
 the cool finds if you like that too 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.020
 can wanted to make the best deal 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.879
 counts also in Canada and asks her 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.879
 what they would think and exactly 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.000
 really fat man 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.000
 finished 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.430
 a few other things in my head because 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.990
 such videos do not just like that 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.920
 an idea will take that little bit more 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.840
 graphic work out 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.880
 permit you can still definitely 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.780
 clear upwards otherwise 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.730
 go here now a little far 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.900
 I know shortly after the video has to be yes 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.000
 do not always go for ten minutes 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.560
 this time just five or ten 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.480
 minutes I think it's five minutes 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.160
 crisp a good information good 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.690
 really relax the idea of ​​my 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.860
 opinion , you have finally fallen 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.750
 know how it works thank you 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.410
 Watching does it all the way 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.410
 next time
