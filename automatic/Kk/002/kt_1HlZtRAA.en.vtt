00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.480
 p jackson 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.480
 all that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.619
 Puntland region 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.869
 Lima - 1 min 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.149
 the protesters ask the suh a person 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.039
 but some complain 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.390
 that oil or the world is known by all 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.720
 who has the oil 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.960
 You have the money 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.960
 and with money we can buy whatever we want 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.490
 let's apply this career monopoly 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.820
 tell me moslem 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.510
 the new proposal of extreme driving developed by hovered study 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.520
 the presenter 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.250
 fort worth master 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.710
 with the extension of land of 14 thousand square kilometers at present 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.390
 more than 160 thousand kilometers of routes 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.270
 we could say that this bridge is an engine goal the storm vigo 24 maltraer 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.260
 but much longer free 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.470
 and for climatic effects of by means 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.920
 more showy than influential in career 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.790
 focused on arcade driving but without presenting physical years 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.220
 we will drive six types of vehicles among which we find quads bikes 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.910
 mouths and more than others 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.570
 the game proposes to us leg to realize a series of predetermined races or 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.590
 to be able to circulate freely throughout the land 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.570
 looking for events the various times 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.860
 the gps indicates the way forward 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.620
 like those of veneers 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.470
 in the case of the tests these are typical races against another rival is 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.510
 go through the extinct 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 win a race against an ezeta helicopter 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.830
 each test won 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.460
 because there is no prize for the second 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.330
 will make us the corresponding fuel according to the difficulty with which we have 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.100
 chosen to take the test 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.330
 the fuel that the money that we earn allows us to buy new vehicles 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.260
 as accessories for pilots 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.890
 the vehicles can not be improved 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.279
 although it does change color 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.290
 70 are the challenges that await us in the main mode 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.940
 divided into different progressively unlockable zones of a 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:18.969
 huge map 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.420
 some sections will only be accessible and we will get certain 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:23.609
 vehicles 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.659
 level or stars 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.659
 during the races there are the odd shortcuts 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.750
 It seems to me that our rivals are unaware, because they almost never use them 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.560
 when we control which ones the motorcycles in each assault the pilot 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.279
 will perform pirouettes automatically 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:44.809
 spectacular although they do not give us any extra points and we can not do anything to 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.049
 that varies 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.849
 the different vehicles behave almost identical shape 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.719
 with slight differences 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.459
 circuits are healthier in photos of real places 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.480
 not so the vehicles july design is original 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:02.709
 the multiplayer up to 16 players online 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.279
 lots of evidence the visual aspect the freedom of terrain and a gameplay 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.569
 suitable for all thanks to a fever and difficulty 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.750
 they manage to place 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.119
 between the great argÃ¡ez extreme driving 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.999
 so this was the one it is highly recommended
