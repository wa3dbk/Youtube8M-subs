00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.510
 child hello i am galya 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.519
 year old kid so long ago he was 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.530
 tiny defenseless and doctors 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.020
 patronage programs helped him 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.359
 develop properly now baby feed 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:29.429
 adult but the care of doctors is important to him not 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:32.040
 less healthy guy will help prove why 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.700
 so important programs is the observation of the child from 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.700
 years and older 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.840
 each question and why do we need a program 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.660
 you can act like this 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.610
 got sick come to the doctor let's be 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 Itâ€™s wiser to try not to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.600
 sick after a year the child gets to his feet 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 begins to walk and walk actively 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.570
 there is a huge increase 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.339
 vertically network load on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.260
 musculoskeletal system and how 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.750
 consequence of a sharp jump in the abdominal 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.119
 pressure at this exact moment hidden 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.549
 troubles such as dropsy hernia and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.830
 cystic education which does nothing 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.869
 not shown before now amenable 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:29.159
 diagnosis and we can prevent 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:29.549
 disease in the early period when this 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.280
 a game 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.150
 I see I do not see it sounds funny but in the office 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.490
 rafal malaga 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.570
 this game gains another very 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.700
 important meaning 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.790
 when the baby is one year old is necessary 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.439
 be examined by an ophthalmologist 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.270
 direct ophthalmoscope gives detailed 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.729
 analysis of the fundus with a 50-fold 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.950
 magnification only so accurate 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.770
 diagnosis allows you to identify congenital 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
 malformations on the device plus optics 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.360
 check the refraction of the eye as well 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.189
 possible presence of strabismus if 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.590
 indication does not match age 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.790
 the norm is a reason to write points to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.170
 avoid negative consequences 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.220
 diseases 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.619
 eat a spoon for mom for dad 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.390
 when the kid is going over adult chair 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.610
 it is important to not only the number of spoons and well 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.980
 the quality of food that spoons 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.319
 important question it seems that after here 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.410
 the child is completely adult and can eat 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.690
 that and parents but this is a big mistake of him 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.819
 the body cannot physically handle and 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.160
 digest many foods 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.760
 just not yet formed the necessary 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.010
 enzyme 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.130
 after a year at children we often reveal 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.940
 malformations of the gallbladder 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.980
 liver structural change 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.620
 pancreas it can be 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.390
 physiological changes and is extremely important 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.880
 reveal them now you just think 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.280
 40 percent of these cases are 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.370
 the consequences of the wrong first 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.250
 spoons that's why it is so important to go through ultrasound 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.860
 it is at this age that every night 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.519
