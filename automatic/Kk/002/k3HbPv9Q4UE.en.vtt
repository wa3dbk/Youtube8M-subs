feel good all the time if you're full of
time<00:03:45.870> really<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.830> only<00:03:46.920> hard<00:03:47.280> part<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.730> just

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
time really the only hard part is just

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.430 
time really the only hard part is just
remembering<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:51.480> eat<00:03:51.660> as<00:03:51.840> much<00:03:52.110> as<00:03:52.320> humanly

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
remembering to to eat as much as humanly

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.500

possible<00:03:52.680> i<00:03:53.160> mean<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.580> mean<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.940> mean<00:03:54.030> no<00:03:54.330> I

guess the hardest part is just running

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.430 
guess the hardest part is just running
out<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.280> food<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.390> then<00:03:57.540> go<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.780> have<00:03:57.960> to<00:03:58.110> go
