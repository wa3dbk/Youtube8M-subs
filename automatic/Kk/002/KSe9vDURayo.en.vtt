00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
hey guys deadly shadow fire here um I've

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.599 
hey guys deadly shadow fire here um I've
got<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:16.199> another<00:00:17.150> well<00:00:18.150> first<00:00:18.690> great<00:00:19.609> minecraft

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
got a another well first great minecraft

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.089 
got a another well first great minecraft
build<00:00:21.140> it<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:23.390> gigantic<00:00:24.390> self<00:00:25.289> building<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
build it is a gigantic self building and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.000 
build it is a gigantic self building and
repairing<00:00:26.670> fortress<00:00:27.590> okay<00:00:28.590> looks<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.980> got

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
repairing fortress okay looks like I got

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:41.350 
repairing fortress okay looks like I got
to<00:00:29.189> turn<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.369> off<00:00:29.900> okay<00:00:31.189> good

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.610 

oh<00:00:42.430> okay<00:00:45.970> unlike<00:00:46.970> most<00:00:47.210> other<00:00:47.450> self<00:00:48.200> building

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
oh okay unlike most other self building

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.650 
oh okay unlike most other self building
houses<00:00:48.830> this<00:00:49.460> one<00:00:49.670> as<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:49.850> can<00:00:49.970> see<00:00:50.180> doesn't

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
houses this one as you can see doesn't

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.520 
houses this one as you can see doesn't
have<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.780> massive<00:00:51.260> redstone<00:00:52.040> circuit<00:00:52.280> outside

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
have a massive redstone circuit outside

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.810 
have a massive redstone circuit outside
it's<00:00:54.530> not<00:00:54.740> limited<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.780> wait<00:00:56.780> yeah<00:00:57.580> it's<00:00:58.580> not

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
it's not limited to wait yeah it's not

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.799 
it's not limited to wait yeah it's not
limited<00:00:59.180> to<00:01:00.100> just<00:01:01.420> make<00:01:02.420> sure<00:01:02.540> everything's

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
limited to just make sure everything's

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.680 
limited to just make sure everything's
connected<00:01:03.050> it's<00:01:03.739> not<00:01:03.860> limited<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.699> the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
connected it's not limited to just the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.130 
connected it's not limited to just the
square<00:01:06.020> like<00:01:06.530> as<00:01:06.979> you<00:01:07.220> can<00:01:07.370> see<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.450> giant

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
square like as you can see this is giant

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.590 
square like as you can see this is giant
fortress<00:01:09.710> made<00:01:10.040> out<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.310> several<00:01:10.670> diamonds

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
fortress made out of several diamonds

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.510 
fortress made out of several diamonds
the<00:01:12.110> only<00:01:12.290> thing<00:01:12.410> is<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:12.590> can't<00:01:12.800> make<00:01:12.920> two<00:01:13.220> balls

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
the only thing is I can't make two balls

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.160 
the only thing is I can't make two balls
connecting<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.210> two<00:01:14.360> fortresses<00:01:14.660> together

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
connecting the two fortresses together

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.330 
connecting the two fortresses together
the<00:01:15.590> lava<00:01:15.800> just<00:01:16.070> keeps<00:01:16.220> spilling<00:01:16.490> out<00:01:16.700> on<00:01:16.790> me

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
the lava just keeps spilling out on me

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.310 
the lava just keeps spilling out on me
there's<00:01:19.340> no<00:01:19.729> giant<00:01:20.060> redstone<00:01:20.570> circuit<00:01:20.810> needed

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
there's no giant redstone circuit needed

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.800 
there's no giant redstone circuit needed
and<00:01:21.500> well<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.490> can<00:01:22.820> make<00:01:22.970> i'm<00:01:23.300> pretty<00:01:23.660> sure

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
and well you can make i'm pretty sure

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.090 
and well you can make i'm pretty sure
somebody<00:01:24.140> else<00:01:24.259> can<00:01:24.500> with<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.890> same

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
somebody else can with the same

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.440 
somebody else can with the same
principle<00:01:25.520> as<00:01:25.550> this<00:01:25.700> make<00:01:25.940> something<00:01:26.270> even

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
principle as this make something even

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:37.210 
principle as this make something even
better<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.190> here<00:01:28.190> we<00:01:28.220> go<00:01:34.479> as<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.770> can<00:01:36.860> see<00:01:37.100> it

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
better and here we go as you can see it

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:45.040 
better and here we go as you can see it
actually<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.820> relatively<00:01:38.270> really<00:01:39.140> fast<00:01:44.050> Aereo

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
actually is relatively really fast Aereo

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.680 
actually is relatively really fast Aereo
that<00:01:45.590> hits<00:01:45.770> lagging<00:01:46.690> quite<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.720> bit<00:01:49.570> early<00:01:50.570> cuz

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
that hits lagging quite a bit early cuz

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.719 
that hits lagging quite a bit early cuz
the<00:01:50.900> rain<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.440> all<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.130> blocks<00:01:52.430> being

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
the rain and all the blocks being

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:02.920 
the rain and all the blocks being
created<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.880> only<00:02:02.119> problem<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.690> house

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
created the only problem with this house

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.820 
created the only problem with this house
is<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.530> doesn't<00:02:04.159> um<00:02:04.750> build<00:02:05.750> floors<00:02:06.320> but

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
is that it doesn't um build floors but

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.169 
is that it doesn't um build floors but
i'm<00:02:06.920> pretty<00:02:07.100> sure<00:02:07.400> with<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.700> principle

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
i'm pretty sure with this principle

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.590 
i'm pretty sure with this principle
somebody<00:02:08.600> else<00:02:08.869> could<00:02:09.610> make<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.880> builds

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
somebody else could make it builds

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.270 
somebody else could make it builds
different<00:02:11.989> quarters<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.709> shut<00:02:12.920> off<00:02:12.950> in

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
different quarters that you shut off in

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.310 
different quarters that you shut off in
different<00:02:13.400> directions<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:14.600> aren't<00:02:15.290> even

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
different directions that aren't even

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.449 
different directions that aren't even
the<00:02:15.590> same<00:02:15.620> size<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.160> house<00:02:18.070> i'm<00:02:19.070> pretty<00:02:19.370> sure

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
the same size the house i'm pretty sure

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.770 
the same size the house i'm pretty sure
with<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.640> same<00:02:19.850> principle<00:02:20.269> on<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.420> redstone

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
with the same principle on the redstone

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.020 
with the same principle on the redstone
circuits<00:02:21.230> i<00:02:21.350> have<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:21.769> somebody<00:02:22.730> can<00:02:22.880> make

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
circuits i have here somebody can make

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.440 
circuits i have here somebody can make
something<00:02:23.450> much<00:02:24.019> much<00:02:24.530> better<00:02:24.860> as<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:26.330> is

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
something much much better as that is

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.130 
something much much better as that is
all<00:02:26.570> please<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.320> comment<00:02:27.769> and<00:02:28.040> subscribe
