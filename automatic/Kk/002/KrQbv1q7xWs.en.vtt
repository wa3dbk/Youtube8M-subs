thread it on and close your loop so once

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.580 
thread it on and close your loop so once

your<00:04:51.910> copper<00:04:52.360> jump<00:04:52.600> rings<00:04:52.870> then<00:04:53.380> you'll

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
your copper jump rings then you'll

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.900 
your copper jump rings then you'll
simply<00:04:53.860> close<00:04:54.400> your<00:04:54.850> self<00:04:55.150> or<00:04:55.300> jump<00:04:55.510> ring<00:04:59.910> so

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
simply close your self or jump ring so

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.320 
simply close your self or jump ring so
we've<00:05:01.060> threaded<00:05:01.420> on<00:05:01.540> our<00:05:01.720> ear<00:05:01.960> wire<00:05:03.270> now<00:05:04.270> we

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
we've threaded on our ear wire now we

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:17.220 
we've threaded on our ear wire now we
