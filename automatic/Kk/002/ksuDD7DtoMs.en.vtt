00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.689
 or carved that as we are we are 

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:07.080
 here the next part of the team by 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.549
 ricky and that touches us now it seems that it is 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 the tour stage of qatar which is the 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.929
 time trials are all flat stages 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.059
 minus one is a time trial that is 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.010
 this one and it sounds to me that it gives by equipment me 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.870
 it seems and well first of all 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.000
 thank you all for the help there with the 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.000
 commands and what you give for the game 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 because ricky bush we are all like 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.200
 you know or it could be another slogan 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.170
 bullrich and lobato and hamburgers and 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.750
 bullrich and we are all with this seems 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.300
 that everything is already here 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.370
 I 'll tell you how well and we'll go to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.170
 there to see how it comes out but I think it's 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.950
 controlled by teams so to see 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.950
 how it comes out so far 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.379
 several we are here is controlled by 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.190
 equipment and so we 'll see we 'll see to see 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.190
 how does this come out 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.000
 we'll see how it comes out here we're with 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.000
 the output of the equipment 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.750
 this I do not know what it will be if this will be relays 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.680
 and the other one will be suppose to stay in 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.680
 the group I do not know 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.439
 I do not know if to put only remain relays 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.640
 those who are good time trialists who 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.350
 I have not done any time trials 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 teams 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.560
 I do not know how this will go but good 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 we will try to get the best out of it 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.330
 but we do not have a team here either 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.490
 good to do against the clock 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.490
 the eurocargo is about to leave 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.100
 I do not know if we're going to do I do not know if we're going to 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.170
 make a time trial per team is 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.030
 euskatel type to stay last or 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.030
 penultimate 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.920
 and they are already there arriving some equipment 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.920
 well here we are and we 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.980
 lars ytting bak that I think will be the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.980
 best time trialists we have 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.070
 and here we start 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.810
 this I do not know if they will be the relays I suppose 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.090
 that the strength of the relays 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.869
 Leonardo Duque has some serra and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.869
 rasmussen 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.110
 this is to lower it to remove the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.930
 relief is that 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.890
 red all day 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.890
 we upload them 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.670
 for this to lower them and this is for 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.610
 download them and this is to download them from the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.310
 position 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.560
 now yes what such cabbage looks like cole 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.800
 there is the best logist accounts 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800
 cel 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.030
 62-67 logists that has been 63 that 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.150
 it will also be the best I suppose 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.150
 there is 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.620
 Now this bet has been 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.620
 red let's remove it again 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.950
 anacona we remove it 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.040
 I'm trying to make them with the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.850
 with the best and now we're going to butt 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.850
 now we're going here to butt 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.930
 the tuberose duke how much is 62 too if 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.930
 it's one is a birria 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.810
 this is the line below I do not know if they will be 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.810
 the ones 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.160
 this will be the effort of those who do not know no 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.390
 I understand I do not understand well 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.390
 I do not understand very well 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.460
 we had not reached the line below 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.350
 maybe it 's the strength of the 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.040
 relays almost bend us but well no 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.660
 they have doubled us 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.110
 let's see how we are going to be at the end 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.110
 but 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.799
 but hey I know a little something one 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.650
 key is to download them from the relay what 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.810
 well that's fine and the date below 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.400
 I do not know why if there are two arrows up 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.200
 will be for the effort and the one below will not 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 I dont know 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.990
 let's say this at the end we say this 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.620
 is in the first partial and in the last 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.620
 partial here 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.160
 we say seconds to see how many teams 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.160
 They are still to come but good 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.660
 we could open a little more maybe 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.650
 fast that yes thirteenth at the moment 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.910
 fourteenth and fifteenth we have left 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.910
 the last we will see the last 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.669
 Fifteenth in the end we have been 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.940
 well we have not been in last so 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.940
 less 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.270
 how many teams would be here 18 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.680
 or 16 how many teams knew 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.280
 cavendish what the bastard we will try 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.230
 bother cavendish that's not 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.480
 that's very clear let's go to 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.810
 bother him here because they are bored already 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.130
 butt 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.130
 by the sponsor 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:31.689
 the time trial is by teams that the 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:35.549
 This tour of Qatar does not benefit us 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.549
 much what would be for the tour 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:46.599
 it has not destroyed us the general is 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.599
 is against the clock 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.960
 if we do not appear in any good place 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.479
 there are red was the fourth the third 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.020
 I created the third one by the network of the 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.020
 regularity 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.949
 how many teams had 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.520
 we have been last so we have been 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.520
 last and 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.330
 We have already been the last 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:27.820
 besides long good we are not going to 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.820
 scratch good 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.069
 Well we do not leave it here for sure 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.659
 we're going to come back from nothing 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.639
 well this was not our land was 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:37.840
 our territory our our zone 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.430
 of war and see you in the next 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.639
 chapter goodbye years until then chau 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.639
 bye
