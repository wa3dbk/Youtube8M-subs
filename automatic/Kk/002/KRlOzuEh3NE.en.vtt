forth onto your face and it rubs and
pulls<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.640> hairs<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.680> paint<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
pulls the hairs out and the paint it's a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.670 
pulls the hairs out and the paint it's a
painful<00:00:35.640> process<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:36.390> not<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> lie<00:00:36.930> um

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
painful process I'm not going to lie um

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.459 
painful process I'm not going to lie um
I<00:00:37.770> think<00:00:38.300> waxing<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.840> faster<00:00:40.350> obviously

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I think waxing is a lot faster obviously

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
I think waxing is a lot faster obviously
because<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.370> swipe<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.000> tons<00:00:42.360> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
because it's just a swipe and tons of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
because it's just a swipe and tons of
hairs<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.930> removed<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.190> lot<00:00:44.399> of

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
hairs are removed but it's a lot of

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
hairs are removed but it's a lot of
trauma<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.120> skin<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.840> I've<00:00:46.079> been<00:00:46.320> doing

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
trauma to your skin and I've been doing

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.150 
trauma to your skin and I've been doing
waxing<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.100> home<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.149> lot<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.989> I'm<00:00:49.890> just

wish<00:03:10.489> this<00:03:10.670> was<00:03:10.849> a<00:03:10.879> wand<00:03:11.359> because<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.170> feel<00:03:12.650> like

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
wish this was a wand because I feel like

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
wish this was a wand because I feel like
wands<00:03:13.269> really<00:03:14.269> blend<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.349> lot<00:03:15.739> better<00:03:15.980> than<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
wands really blend a lot better than the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.460 
wands really blend a lot better than the
brush<00:03:16.940> or<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.900> brush<00:03:18.109> or<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.290> little<00:03:18.500> comb<00:03:20.319> but<00:03:21.319> it

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
brush or a brush or a little comb but it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.199 
brush or a brush or a little comb but it
still<00:03:21.709> does<00:03:21.949> the<00:03:22.099> job<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.699> just<00:03:22.730> use<00:03:23.060> that

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
still does the job and I just use that

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.110 
still does the job and I just use that
basically<00:03:23.660> just<00:03:23.959> for<00:03:24.169> the<00:03:24.260> front<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:26.030> for

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
basically just for the front just for

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.720 
basically just for the front just for
the<00:03:26.329> top<00:03:26.540> half<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.620> comb<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:28.040> little<00:03:28.250> hairs<00:03:28.459> up

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
the top half to comb the little hairs up

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.020 
the top half to comb the little hairs up
and<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:30.440> fade<00:03:30.739> in<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.190> front<00:03:31.519> because<00:03:31.639> this<00:03:31.910> is

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
and to fade in the front because this is

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.369 
and to fade in the front because this is
the<00:03:32.180> most<00:03:32.329> important<00:03:32.930> part<00:03:33.169> because<00:03:33.199> you

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
the most important part because you

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.050 
the most important part because you
don't<00:03:33.530> want<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.769> be<00:03:33.889> too<00:03:34.099> boxing<00:03:34.669> in<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.790> front

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
don't want to be too boxing in the front

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.959 
don't want to be too boxing in the front
because<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.750> just<00:03:35.930> looks<00:03:36.109> kind<00:03:36.319> of<00:03:36.440> funky

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:40.969 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.910 

oops

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.230 

there<00:03:45.610> we<00:03:45.730> go

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.970 

just<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.820> woohoo<00:03:51.440> now<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> lot<00:03:52.860> of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
just like that woohoo now a lot of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.620 
just like that woohoo now a lot of
people<00:03:53.220> like<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.520> clean<00:03:53.790> up<00:03:54.000> their<00:03:54.210> eyebrows

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
people like to clean up their eyebrows

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.590 
people like to clean up their eyebrows
by<00:03:54.870> putting<00:03:55.260> concealer<00:03:55.830> all<00:03:56.450> around<00:03:57.450> their

by putting concealer all around their

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.660 
by putting concealer all around their
eyebrows<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.410> just<00:03:58.860> think<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.190> too<00:03:59.640> much

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
eyebrows but I just think it's too much

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.630 
eyebrows but I just think it's too much
for<00:04:00.210> a<00:04:00.450> natural<00:04:00.810> look<00:04:00.960> skip<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:01.710> make<00:04:02.490> sure

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
for a natural look skip that make sure

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.870 
for a natural look skip that make sure
you<00:04:02.790> put<00:04:03.000> your<00:04:03.680> your<00:04:04.680> face<00:04:05.070> makeup<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.580> first

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
you put your your face makeup on first

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.910 
you put your your face makeup on first
your<00:04:06.210> concealer<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:06.840> your<00:04:07.650> foundation

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
your concealer and your foundation

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.390 
your concealer and your foundation
because<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.820> will<00:04:09.000> clean<00:04:09.360> up<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.600> area<00:04:10.400> just

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
because that will clean up the area just

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400 
because that will clean up the area just
