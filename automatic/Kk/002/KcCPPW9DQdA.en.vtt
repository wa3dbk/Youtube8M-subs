00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
reduces reload speed that's why ambush

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210

good but the main thing out of that I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.530 
good but the main thing out of that I
can<00:01:28.979> deal<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.490> having<00:01:29.520> these<00:01:30.000> two<00:01:30.329> as

so<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:04.619> rodeo<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.520> then

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
so that's rodeo and then

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.340

definitely feel like it does make a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.470 
definitely feel like it does make a
difference<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:33.080> my<00:02:33.470> Queens<00:02:34.160> breaker<00:02:34.550> Queen

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480

Queen<00:02:36.200> breakers<00:02:37.040> bow<00:02:37.430> when<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.240> unlock<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:39.020> in

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580

headshots<00:02:41.060> with<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.110> definitely<00:02:42.710> think

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
headshots with it so I definitely think

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.880 
headshots with it so I definitely think
it<00:02:43.310> does<00:02:43.550> make<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.820> difference<00:02:44.260> for<00:02:45.260> snipers<00:02:45.709> at

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
it does make a difference for snipers at

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.670 
it does make a difference for snipers at
least<00:02:46.660> we're<00:02:47.660> not<00:02:47.870> we're<00:02:48.260> not<00:02:48.320> getting

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
least we're not we're not getting

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.410 
least we're not we're not getting
unflinching<00:02:49.250> at<00:02:49.400> all<00:02:49.580> we're<00:02:49.910> getting<00:02:50.120> hit<00:02:50.270> in

hopefully we get something good I know
this<00:02:58.040> gun<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.310> probably<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.060> best<00:02:59.450> gun<00:02:59.840> or

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
this gun is probably the best gun or

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.080 
this gun is probably the best gun or
best<00:03:00.680> sniper<00:03:00.950> rifle<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.670> can<00:03:01.820> get

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
best sniper rifle that you can get

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.660 
best sniper rifle that you can get
without<00:03:02.480> using<00:03:02.930> last<00:03:03.290> round<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.920> with<00:03:04.550> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
without using last round and with the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.770 
without using last round and with the
nerf<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.209> special<00:03:05.750> ammo<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.820> availability<00:03:08.720> I

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
nerf to special ammo the availability I

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.410 
nerf to special ammo the availability I
guess<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.080> special<00:03:09.560> ammo<00:03:09.890> around<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.459> maps<00:03:11.030> in

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
guess a special ammo around the maps in

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.750 
guess a special ammo around the maps in
crucible<00:03:12.080> definitely<00:03:12.800> make<00:03:12.980> last<00:03:13.489> round

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
crucible definitely make last round

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.910 
crucible definitely make last round
sniping<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.300> lot<00:03:14.540> harder<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.290> definitely<00:03:15.800> can

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
sniping a lot harder you definitely can

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.640 
sniping a lot harder you definitely can
still<00:03:16.160> do<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.640> trials<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.630> Osiris<00:03:18.050> but<00:03:18.260> I'd

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
still do it in trials of Osiris but I'd

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.590 
still do it in trials of Osiris but I'd
rather<00:03:18.830> just<00:03:19.220> have<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.400> gun<00:03:19.700> that's<00:03:20.030> good<00:03:20.450> at

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600

getting<00:03:20.840> headshots<00:03:20.989> oh<00:03:21.410> that's<00:03:21.769> why<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:21.950> want

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
getting headshots oh that's why I want

to<00:03:22.340> upgrade<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:23.000> low-grade<00:03:23.239> humility<00:03:23.930> to

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
to upgrade this low-grade humility to

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.060 
to upgrade this low-grade humility to
hidden<00:03:25.100> hand<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.670> unflinching<00:03:26.420> um

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.780 
hidden hand and unflinching um
unflinching<00:03:28.070> definitely<00:03:28.489> makes<00:03:28.670> a

unflinching definitely makes a

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.390 
unflinching definitely makes a

difference on my effort eat spear that I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.520 
difference on my effort eat spear that I
have<00:03:31.700> okay<00:03:32.450> we<00:03:32.570> got<00:03:32.720> hidden<00:03:32.870> hand<00:03:33.140> there<00:03:33.350> but

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
have okay we got hidden hand there but

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.340 
have okay we got hidden hand there but
nope<00:03:33.820> on<00:03:34.820> my<00:03:35.030> effort<00:03:35.330> eat<00:03:35.450> spear<00:03:35.780> I've<00:03:35.959> last

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
nope on my effort eat spear I've last

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.740 
nope on my effort eat spear I've last
round<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.400> our<00:03:38.060> final<00:03:38.390> round<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:40.750> spraying

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
round in our final round and spraying

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.660 
round in our final round and spraying
parade<00:03:42.170> I've<00:03:42.350> fun<00:03:42.950> around<00:03:43.220> in<00:03:43.370> spraying

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
parade I've fun around in spraying

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.160 
parade I've fun around in spraying
prayer<00:03:43.880> which<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.209> nice<00:03:44.450> combo<00:03:44.959> but

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
prayer which is a nice combo but

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.660 
prayer which is a nice combo but
unflinching<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.070> think<00:03:46.280> would<00:03:46.459> have<00:03:46.550> been

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
unflinching I think would have been

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.550 
unflinching I think would have been
better<00:03:46.970> for<00:03:47.300> that<00:03:47.690> one<00:03:47.989> because<00:03:48.260> there<00:03:48.440> are

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
better for that one because there are

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.530 
better for that one because there are
times<00:03:48.890> I'm<00:03:49.130> getting<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:49.550> gun<00:03:49.730> fights<00:03:49.760> with<00:03:50.390> the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
last round and I'm missing because the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.070 
last round and I'm missing because the
they're<00:03:54.170> using<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.650> thorn<00:03:55.250> or<00:03:55.519> last<00:03:56.300> word<00:03:56.630> or
