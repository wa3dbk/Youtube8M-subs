grenade<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> gas<00:01:50.820> Canada<00:01:51.240> canister<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:53.250> an

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
grenade a gas Canada canister so it's an

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.850 
grenade a gas Canada canister so it's an
AoE<00:01:53.610> spell<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> throw<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.560> somebody

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
AoE spell so if you throw it on somebody

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.550 
AoE spell so if you throw it on somebody
they'll<00:01:56.790> take<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.120> damage<00:01:57.570> over<00:01:57.780> time<00:01:57.810> slowly

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
they'll take a damage over time slowly

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.950 
they'll take a damage over time slowly
and<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.670> makes<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.360> your<00:02:00.600> Q

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and it also makes it so that your Q

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
and it also makes it so that your Q
spell<00:02:01.260> cannot<00:02:01.530> miss<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.280> combination

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
spell cannot miss so it's a combination

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.000 
spell cannot miss so it's a combination
between<00:02:02.790> these<00:02:03.360> two<00:02:03.540> spells<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:04.650> you<00:02:04.740> hit<00:02:04.890> them

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
between these two spells if you hit them

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.280 
between these two spells if you hit them
with<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.820> gas<00:02:06.060> canister<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:07.140> can

with the with the gas canister you can

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.930 
with the with the gas canister you can
then<00:02:07.500> hit<00:02:07.710> them<00:02:07.830> with<00:02:08.009> your<00:02:08.190> Q<00:02:08.489> over<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.849> over

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
then hit them with your Q over and over

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.369 
then hit them with your Q over and over
and<00:02:09.090> over<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.810> knit<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.140> I'll<00:02:10.170> try

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and over and you will knit so I'll try

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.520 
and over and you will knit so I'll try
to<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:12.420> throw<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.349> gas

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to do that now so throw this gas

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.750 
to do that now so throw this gas
canister<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> Dean's<00:02:14.250> back<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:14.580> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
canister on the Dean's back here and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.059 
canister on the Dean's back here and
you'll<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.300> little<00:02:15.450> red<00:02:15.569> reticle<00:02:16.260> when<00:02:16.980> I'm

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
you'll see a little red reticle when I'm

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.140 
you'll see a little red reticle when I'm
popping<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.700> them

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
popping it on them

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.149 
popping it on them
to<00:02:18.659> show<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.019> can't<00:02:19.290> miss<00:02:19.409> with<00:02:19.620> my<00:02:19.829> view

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
to show that I can't miss with my view

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.949 
to show that I can't miss with my view
so<00:02:20.579> it's<00:02:20.700> kind<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:21.000> combo<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.810> hit

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
so it's kind of a combo you want to hit

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.809 
so it's kind of a combo you want to hit
them<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.319> e<00:02:22.349> with<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.010> corrosive

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
them with the e with the corrosive

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.009 
them with the e with the corrosive
charge<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.569> want<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.750> hit<00:02:24.840> them

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
charge and then you want to hit them

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.550 
charge and then you want to hit them
repeatedly<00:02:25.439> with<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.829> cuse<00:02:26.040> bone<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:28.230> that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
repeatedly with the cuse bone so that

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.990 
repeatedly with the cuse bone so that
kind<00:02:28.799> of<00:02:28.829> makes<00:02:28.890> him<00:02:29.159> he's<00:02:29.430> kind<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.760> ranged

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.260 
level 6 and get that the meantime i'll
just<00:03:10.739> try<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.920> kill<00:03:11.129> this<00:03:11.250> master<00:03:11.609> diva

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:24.570 

Oh<00:03:14.330> in<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.140> shower<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.650> killing<00:03:16.130> me

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.250 

so<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.480> waiting<00:03:25.780> time<00:03:25.960> we're<00:03:26.170> going

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
okay cool all right so the last spell

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.980 
okay cool all right so the last spell
that<00:04:56.380> God<00:04:56.920> has<00:04:57.100> is<00:04:57.400> a<00:04:57.430> swap<00:04:57.880> so<00:04:58.720> that<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:58.900> can

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
that God has is a swap so that you can

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.930 
that God has is a swap so that you can
see<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.230> is<00:04:59.350> ultimate<00:04:59.770> so<00:05:00.040> what<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:00.790> does<00:05:00.910> is

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
see that is ultimate so what it does is

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.580 
see that is ultimate so what it does is
which<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.720> place<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.140> you<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.530> an

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
which is the place of you and an

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.990 
which is the place of you and an
opponent<00:05:03.040> it<00:05:03.130> stuns<00:05:03.400> them<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.820> switch

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
opponent it stuns them and you switch

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.370 
opponent it stuns them and you switch
places<00:05:04.210> so<00:05:04.810> if<00:05:04.870> you're<00:05:04.960> too<00:05:05.080> kind<00:05:05.170> of<00:05:05.290> a

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
places so if you're too kind of a

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.960 
places so if you're too kind of a
standoff<00:05:05.860> it's<00:05:06.070> a<00:05:06.100> really<00:05:06.280> good<00:05:06.430> spell<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.760> use

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970

in order to kind of engage the enemy

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.760 
in order to kind of engage the enemy
after<00:05:10.420> you<00:05:10.540> use<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.690> you<00:05:11.020> get<00:05:11.200> a<00:05:11.260> like<00:05:11.740> a

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770
