financial aid to undergraduates at

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.410 
financial aid to undergraduates at
Stanford<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.309> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.519> probably<00:00:53.790> one<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
Stanford and this is probably one of the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.770 
Stanford and this is probably one of the
highest<00:00:54.839> numbers<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:56.519> United<00:00:56.850> States<00:00:56.879> go

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
highest numbers in the United States go

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.890 
highest numbers in the United States go
to<00:00:57.839> Stanford<00:00:58.470> if<00:00:58.650> you<00:00:58.830> if<00:00:59.790> you<00:01:00.000> work<00:01:00.239> part-time

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
to Stanford if you if you work part-time

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.420 
to Stanford if you if you work part-time
and<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:01.650> there's<00:01:01.830> there's<00:01:02.129> great<00:01:02.400> value

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and we think there's there's great value

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
and we think there's there's great value
and<00:01:02.879> being<00:01:03.119> you<00:01:03.540> know<00:01:03.659> contributing<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> little

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and being you know contributing a little

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
and being you know contributing a little
bit<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.830> own<00:01:04.920> education<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.670> for

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
bit to your own education that is for

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.350 
bit to your own education that is for
students<00:01:06.950> if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.220> work<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.920> think<00:01:10.920> it's

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
students if you work about I think it's

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.230 
students if you work about I think it's
7.5<00:01:12.360> hours<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.750> week<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.080> term<00:01:13.590> time<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
7.5 hours a week for term time you can

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
7.5 hours a week for term time you can
you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> meet<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> student<00:01:16.320> contribution

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you can meet the student contribution

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.790 
you can meet the student contribution
expectation<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> key<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.470> fear

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
expectation I think the key is the fear

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.540 
expectation I think the key is the fear
about<00:01:20.100> cost<00:01:20.870> concerns<00:01:21.870> about<00:01:22.170> cost<00:01:22.650> anxiety

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
about cost concerns about cost anxiety

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.730 
about cost concerns about cost anxiety
about<00:01:23.670> cost<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.600> you're<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> student<00:01:25.110> has

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
about cost when you're a student has

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070 
about cost when you're a student has
impact<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.730> opportunity<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.390> learn<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
impact on your opportunity to learn and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.870 
impact on your opportunity to learn and
therefore<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.760> think<00:01:30.090> by<00:01:30.240> by<00:01:30.690> having<00:01:31.050> really

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
therefore we think by by having really

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.220 
therefore we think by by having really
significant<00:01:32.880> financial<00:01:33.090> aid<00:01:33.510> programs<00:01:33.690> we're

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
significant financial aid programs we're

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.290 
significant financial aid programs we're
going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.440> have<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:35.400> opportunity<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.030> give

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
going to have the opportunity to give

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.040 
going to have the opportunity to give
students<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.290> tools<00:01:38.040> necessary<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:39.050> take

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
students the tools necessary to take

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:51.460 
students the tools necessary to take
advantage<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.950> world<00:01:41.160> class<00:01:41.400> education
