of<00:00:36.000> them<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> offensive<00:00:36.809> side<00:00:36.960> now<00:00:37.410> they

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
of them on the offensive side now they

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.430 
of them on the offensive side now they
do<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.460> needs<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.910> wide<00:00:39.239> receiver

tires for a running back if that's the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560 
tires for a running back if that's the
case<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.429> offensive<00:01:30.060> linemen<00:01:30.299> would<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.450> a

think that's an ideal fit for the New

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:46.309 
think that's an ideal fit for the New
York<00:01:39.390> Jets<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:44.450> believe<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.569> jets<00:01:45.719> get<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> steal

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
York Jets I believe the jets get a steal

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.839 
York Jets I believe the jets get a steal
in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> third<00:01:46.830> round<00:01:47.039> with<00:01:47.340> Stedman<00:01:47.670> Bailey

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
in the third round with Stedman Bailey

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.059

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
out of West Virginia the most consistent

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.100 
out of West Virginia the most consistent
receiver<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.060> I've<00:01:51.209> seen<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.659> college

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
lot of Steve Smith that place for the

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.679 
lot of Steve Smith that place for the
Carolina<00:01:58.619> Panthers<00:01:59.159> may<00:01:59.489> not<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.819> as<00:01:59.970> fast<00:02:00.239> may

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
Carolina Panthers may not be as fast may

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
Carolina Panthers may not be as fast may
not<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.989> as<00:02:01.140> flashy<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.739> he's<00:02:01.890> consistent<00:02:02.429> and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
not be as flashy but he's consistent and

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
not be as flashy but he's consistent and
one<00:02:02.789> thing<00:02:02.970> he<00:02:03.149> will<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:03.720> well<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
one thing he will do very well and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.199 
one thing he will do very well and
that's<00:02:04.799> catch<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.340> football<00:02:11.209> you're

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
that's catch the football you're

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.580 
that's catch the football you're
starting<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.660> see<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.840> theme<00:02:13.110> here<00:02:13.410> I'm

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
starting to see the theme here I'm

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.380 
starting to see the theme here I'm
rebuilding<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.370> Jets<00:02:14.670> offerings<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
rebuilding that Jets offerings and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.420 
rebuilding that Jets offerings and
making<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.959> explosive<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:16.890> potent<00:02:17.310> and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
making it more explosive and potent and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
making it more explosive and potent and
I<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:17.670> Jordan<00:02:18.030> Reed<00:02:18.209> at<00:02:18.420> tight<00:02:18.959> end<00:02:18.989> can

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
I think Jordan Reed at tight end can

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.440 
I think Jordan Reed at tight end can
also<00:02:19.739> play<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> little<00:02:20.160> H<00:02:20.370> pack<00:02:20.700> gives<00:02:21.239> them

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
also play a little H pack gives them

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.180 
also play a little H pack gives them
that<00:02:21.480> flexibility<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.410> their<00:02:22.620> offerings<00:02:23.100> to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that flexibility in their offerings to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.770 
that flexibility in their offerings to
get<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.519> guy<00:02:23.670> out<00:02:23.940> there<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> perimeter

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
get this guy out there on a perimeter

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.879 
get this guy out there on a perimeter
you<00:02:25.049> want<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> football<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.799> his

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:25.889 
you want to get the football in his

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.920 
you want to get the football in his
hands<00:02:26.040> quickly<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.609> he<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> dangerous<00:02:27.690> guy

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
hands quickly as he is a dangerous guy

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.369 
hands quickly as he is a dangerous guy
after<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.470> catch

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.690 

let's<00:02:34.379> go<00:02:34.530> back<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.950> defensive<00:02:35.519> side<00:02:35.640> of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
let's go back to the defensive side of

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.220 
let's go back to the defensive side of
the<00:02:35.790> football<00:02:35.849> with<00:02:36.330> Duke<00:02:36.569> Williams<00:02:37.050> out<00:02:37.170> of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the football with Duke Williams out of

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.680 
the football with Duke Williams out of
Nevada<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.860> strong<00:02:38.250> safety<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.180> definitely

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
Nevada a strong safety but definitely

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.690 
Nevada a strong safety but definitely
has<00:02:39.840> some<00:02:40.080> ball<00:02:40.290> skills<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.830> my<00:02:40.950> opinion<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.580> it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
has some ball skills in my opinion so it

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.460 
has some ball skills in my opinion so it
makes<00:02:41.879> them<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.090> versatile<00:02:42.510> guy<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.290> play

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
makes them a versatile guy you can play

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.690 
makes them a versatile guy you can play
him<00:02:43.650> close<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.040> line<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.310> scrimmage<00:02:44.340> and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
him close to the line of scrimmage and

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.670 
him close to the line of scrimmage and
you<00:02:44.819> also<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.420> be<00:02:45.450> protected<00:02:46.019> with<00:02:46.410> him

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
you also can be protected with him

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.199 
you also can be protected with him
covering<00:02:47.069> tight<00:02:47.250> end<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.940> great

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
covering tight end so this is a great

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.080 
covering tight end so this is a great
fit<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.050> aggressive<00:02:49.530> Jets<00:02:49.830> defense

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.729 

let's<00:02:57.090> go<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.480> offensive<00:02:57.810> line<00:02:57.959> now<00:02:58.290> eric

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.420 
herman out of ohio played on the
fabulous<00:03:00.780> offense<00:03:01.170> out<00:03:01.319> there<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.739> college
