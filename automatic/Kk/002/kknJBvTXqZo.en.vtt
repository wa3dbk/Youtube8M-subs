00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
spots for your world of tanks weak spots

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.440 
spots for your world of tanks weak spots
are<00:00:12.570> areas<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.469> an<00:00:13.650> opponent's<00:00:14.219> armor<00:00:15.210> that

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
are areas of an opponent's armor that

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.000 
are areas of an opponent's armor that
are<00:00:15.599> particularly<00:00:15.960> vulnerable<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.619> being

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
are particularly vulnerable to being

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.130 
are particularly vulnerable to being
penetrated<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.180> want<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> make<00:00:18.570> sure<00:00:18.600> as

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
penetrated so you want to make sure as

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.330 
penetrated so you want to make sure as
much<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.500> possible<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:20.100> you're<00:00:20.220> hitting

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
your opponent in their weak spots so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.980 
your opponent in their weak spots so
that<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.310> deal<00:00:23.519> consistent<00:00:24.300> HP<00:00:24.779> damage

and<00:00:25.380> by<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> same<00:00:26.250> token<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.699> want<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
and by the same token you want to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.730

protect<00:00:27.390> your<00:00:27.689> weak<00:00:27.900> spots<00:00:28.199> these<00:00:28.529> two

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
protect your weak spots these two

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.279 
protect your weak spots these two
concepts<00:00:29.340> combined<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:30.119> key<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.170> good

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
concepts combined are key to good

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.880 
concepts combined are key to good

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
gameplay in World of Tanks and before I

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.470 
gameplay in World of Tanks and before I
talk<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.340> about<00:00:35.399> weak<00:00:35.700> spots<00:00:35.969> let<00:00:36.210> me<00:00:36.300> touch

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
talk more about weak spots let me touch

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
talk more about weak spots let me touch
on<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> related<00:00:37.020> topic<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.710> that's<00:00:37.829> alpha

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
on a related topic and that's alpha

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.869 
on a related topic and that's alpha
damage<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.629> gun<00:00:40.230> has<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.920> range<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.430> damage<00:00:41.760> it

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
damage so a gun has a range of damage it

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.020 
damage so a gun has a range of damage it
will<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.450> plus<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:42.899> minus<00:00:43.140> 25%<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.760> gun

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
will do a plus or minus 25% so this gun

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
will do a plus or minus 25% so this gun
does<00:00:45.420> alpha<00:00:46.140> damage<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> 390<00:00:47.010> plus<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:47.340> minus

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
does alpha damage of 390 plus or minus

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.580 
does alpha damage of 390 plus or minus
25%<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> range<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:50.570> 293<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:53.300> 488<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.469> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
25% for a range of 293 to 488 and so you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
25% for a range of 293 to 488 and so you
can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> deal<00:00:56.100> dealt<00:00:56.579> 307<00:00:57.480> damage<00:00:57.870> there

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
can see I deal dealt 307 damage there

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.150 
can see I deal dealt 307 damage there
there's<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.649> low<00:00:58.890> damage

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
there's actually a pretty low damage

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.099 
there's actually a pretty low damage
role<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> should<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.690> been<00:01:00.809> able<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
role but I should have been able to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.410 
role but I should have been able to
one-shot<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.280> light<00:01:02.850> tank<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.329> its

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
one-shot that light tank for its

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.840 
one-shot that light tank for its
remaining<00:01:03.690> HP<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.549> important

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
remaining HP and you know it's important

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.950 
remaining HP and you know it's important
to<00:01:05.909> think<00:01:05.939> about<00:01:06.060> alpha<00:01:06.420> damage<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
to think about alpha damage because you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
to think about alpha damage because you
want<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> guess<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:08.340> approximate<00:01:08.909> how<00:01:09.090> many

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
want to guess or approximate how many

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.899 
want to guess or approximate how many
shots<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> take<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.439> order<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
shots it's going to take in order to

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.390 
shots it's going to take in order to
kill<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.060> enemy<00:01:12.330> tank<00:01:12.920> coming<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.220> weak

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
kill an enemy tank coming back to weak

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.789 
kill an enemy tank coming back to weak
spots<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:15.150> are<00:01:15.420> common<00:01:16.049> weak<00:01:16.200> spots<00:01:16.470> across

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
spots there are common weak spots across

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
spots there are common weak spots across
all<00:01:17.070> tanks<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.970> cupula<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.110> the

corners that are ready to snipe at me

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
but I don't get that little orange light

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.830 
but I don't get that little orange light
bulb<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.519> off<00:03:20.730> which<00:03:21.450> means<00:03:21.690> there's

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
bulb going off which means there's

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.420 
bulb going off which means there's
probably<00:03:22.290> no<00:03:22.500> one<00:03:22.620> over<00:03:22.829> there<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.220> feel

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
probably no one over there so I feel

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.309 
probably no one over there so I feel
confident<00:03:23.850> turning<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.269> into<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:24.959> tree<00:03:25.170> and

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
confident turning up into this tree and

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.740 
confident turning up into this tree and
not<00:03:25.440> worrying<00:03:25.739> about<00:03:25.829> my<00:03:26.130> flank<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.660> know

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
not worrying about my flank and you know

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.390 
not worrying about my flank and you know
for<00:03:27.959> some<00:03:28.109> tanks<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.010> whole<00:03:29.160> tank

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
for some tanks it's like the whole tank

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.949 
for some tanks it's like the whole tank
is<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.579> weak<00:03:29.760> spot<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.209> poor<00:03:30.540> Hellcat

and<00:04:05.269> I<00:04:06.049> aim<00:04:06.499> for<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.799> t29<00:04:07.370> machine-gun<00:04:08.180> port

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
and I aim for that t29 machine-gun port

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.390 
and I aim for that t29 machine-gun port

top<00:04:22.039> of<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.639> turret<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.470> get<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.500> penetration

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
top of the turret and get a penetration

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.589 
top of the turret and get a penetration
it<00:04:25.520> turns<00:04:25.699> out<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.030> Tigers<00:04:26.300> armor<00:04:26.539> is

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
it turns out like the Tigers armor is

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.270 
it turns out like the Tigers armor is
actually<00:04:26.690> fairly<00:04:27.050> thin<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.650> can<00:04:27.800> aim<00:04:27.919> for<00:04:28.160> its

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
actually fairly thin you can aim for its

other places especially down here the
underbelly<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.690> tends<00:04:33.199> to<00:04:33.289> be<00:04:33.380> a<00:04:33.470> common

underbelly that tends to be a common

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.689 
underbelly that tends to be a common
weak<00:04:34.910> point<00:04:35.240> for<00:04:35.770> German<00:04:36.770> tanks<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.340> because

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
weak point for German tanks and because

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.010 
weak point for German tanks and because
the<00:04:37.789> engines<00:04:38.060> there<00:04:38.330> you<00:04:38.479> can<00:04:38.570> do<00:04:38.630> engineer

the engines there you can do engineer

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.920 
the engines there you can do engineer
damage<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.710> catch<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.639> on<00:04:40.729> fire<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.389> aiming

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
damage and catch it on fire so aiming

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.300 
damage and catch it on fire so aiming
low<00:04:42.110> on<00:04:42.289> German<00:04:42.560> tanks<00:04:42.740> when<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.919> can<00:04:43.130> is

low on German tanks when you can is

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.370 
low on German tanks when you can is
generally<00:04:43.699> very<00:04:43.880> good<00:04:44.000> thing<00:04:44.360> now<00:04:45.050> check<00:04:45.289> this

he's getting flanked from behind but if
you've<00:04:56.360> angled<00:04:56.780> his<00:04:56.900> tank<00:04:57.169> it<00:04:57.320> would<00:04:57.440> have

you've angled his tank it would have
actually<00:04:57.680> helped<00:04:58.190> him<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:59.060> potentially

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
actually helped him to potentially

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.409

front rear but you can see he's pretty
flat<00:05:04.099> to<00:05:04.340> me<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:04.699> I<00:05:04.729> get<00:05:04.910> a<00:05:04.940> clean<00:05:05.180> penetration

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810

match<00:06:06.719> I<00:06:06.930> played<00:06:07.409> very<00:06:07.620> attentively<00:06:08.189> and

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
match I played very attentively and

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.059 
match I played very attentively and
sharp<00:06:08.939> up<00:06:09.449> until<00:06:09.900> this<00:06:10.289> little<00:06:10.469> sequence<00:06:10.889> here

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
sharp up until this little sequence here

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.879 
sharp up until this little sequence here
but<00:06:11.939> I<00:06:11.969> really<00:06:12.300> should<00:06:12.330> have<00:06:12.719> aimed<00:06:13.020> at<00:06:13.349> those

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
but I really should have aimed at those

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.800 
but I really should have aimed at those
Artie's<00:06:14.309> first<00:06:14.639> because<00:06:15.150> they're<00:06:15.389> one-shot

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
Artie's first because they're one-shot

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.360 
Artie's first because they're one-shot
material<00:06:16.319> again<00:06:16.529> it's<00:06:16.650> really<00:06:16.919> important<00:06:17.279> to

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
material again it's really important to

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.969 
material again it's really important to
think<00:06:17.550> about<00:06:17.729> alpha<00:06:18.210> damage<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:19.560> two<00:06:19.740> Artie's

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
think about alpha damage the two Artie's

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.739 
think about alpha damage the two Artie's
would<00:06:20.099> have<00:06:20.189> been<00:06:20.310> dead<00:06:20.490> if<00:06:20.729> I<00:06:21.210> fired<00:06:21.449> at<00:06:21.629> them

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:21.749 
would have been dead if I fired at them

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:24.079 
would have been dead if I fired at them
and<00:06:21.900> instead<00:06:22.139> you<00:06:22.469> know<00:06:22.589> I<00:06:22.830> get<00:06:23.339> hit<00:06:23.699> a<00:06:23.729> lot

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.089

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.689 
and instead you know I get hit a lot
and<00:06:24.360> you<00:06:25.229> know<00:06:25.319> lose<00:06:25.560> some<00:06:26.069> crew<00:06:26.219> members<00:06:26.520> and

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
and you know lose some crew members and

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.839 
and you know lose some crew members and
have<00:06:26.849> to<00:06:26.969> use<00:06:27.120> first-aid<00:06:27.629> kit<00:06:28.289> to<00:06:28.729> get<00:06:29.729> my

have to use first-aid kit to get my

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:30.980 
have to use first-aid kit to get my

you<00:06:31.439> know<00:06:31.529> the<00:06:31.620> aiming<00:06:31.919> time<00:06:32.099> and<00:06:32.310> the<00:06:32.370> size<00:06:32.550> of

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
you know the aiming time and the size of

you know the aiming time and the size of
reticle<00:06:33.060> is<00:06:33.180> just<00:06:33.449> really<00:06:34.229> really<00:06:34.409> slow<00:06:34.680> now

the<00:06:49.349> damage<00:06:50.249> number<00:06:50.729> cut<00:06:51.449> it<00:06:51.569> in<00:06:51.659> half<00:06:51.899> and

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
the damage number cut it in half and

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:55.309 
the damage number cut it in half and
then<00:06:52.409> subtract<00:06:52.830> your<00:06:53.249> the<00:06:54.120> armor<00:06:54.539> from<00:06:55.080> that

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
then subtract your the armor from that

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.360 
then subtract your the armor from that
number<00:06:55.589> that<00:06:55.770> will<00:06:55.860> give<00:06:55.979> you<00:06:56.069> the<00:06:56.159> damage

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
number that will give you the damage

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.040 
number that will give you the damage
from<00:06:56.729> an<00:06:56.879> HG<00:06:57.180> round<00:06:57.389> so<00:06:57.479> HT<00:06:57.719> round<00:06:57.899> will

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
from an HG round so HT round will

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.869 
from an HG round so HT round will
generally<00:06:58.409> do<00:06:58.560> some<00:06:58.889> damage<00:06:59.279> if<00:06:59.430> not<00:06:59.610> a<00:06:59.639> lot

00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 
generally do some damage if not a lot

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.909 
generally do some damage if not a lot
sometimes<00:07:00.389> a<00:07:00.479> lot<00:07:00.659> sometimes<00:07:00.899> a<00:07:01.139> little<00:07:01.409> but

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
sometimes a lot sometimes a little but

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.889 
sometimes a lot sometimes a little but
that's<00:07:02.039> why<00:07:02.129> people<00:07:02.279> carry<00:07:02.580> a<00:07:02.699> cheer<00:07:03.060> ounds<00:07:03.449> to

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:03.899 
that's why people carry a cheer ounds to

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:05.629 
that's why people carry a cheer ounds to
