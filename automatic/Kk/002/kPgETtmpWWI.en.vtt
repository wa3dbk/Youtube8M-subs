00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.180
 I use every day but unfortunately 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.250
 do it I will not just you 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.949
 I'll tell you the first thing I do 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.349
 cleansing your favorite lotions skin 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.269
 chanel 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.519
 he smells very nice and them 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.730
 enjoy really present 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.450
 enjoyment in the morning before applying 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.629
 make up so and after i make 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.670
 I also took it off 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.980
 if it's winter I use 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.469
 Chanel and pro beauty moisturizer 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.110
 cream 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.379
 in the summer I try not to use at all 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.539
 cream and the same day I do not use 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.820
 tonal tool I aim for 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.840
 naturalness and do not want to overload 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.789
 your skin is superfluous 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.620
 layers of makeup after i 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.750
 applied cream between for a while 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.189
 she absorbs and draws attention 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.409
 tonal water from chanel 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.130
 it's not even concealer is 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.110
 tonal 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 and actually very light texture 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.119
 channel to if i go to some party 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.310
 in general, I want to spend more 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.799
 time for makeup or 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.929
 if i shoot a video i use my 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:38.789
 proofreader is also a twentieth scientist 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:42.670
 concealer concealer in twentieth shades 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:46.240
 I always check before makeup 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.729
 new hairs that appeared if 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:55.299
 they eat yours I go on 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:00.060
 eyebrows used to always shadow from 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:04.020
 mac liner eyebrows 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.500
 but now I switched to a pencil recently 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.900
 bought korando lively 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.670
 color number one is very comfortable here here 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.530
 on the one hand pencil on the other 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.980
 sides of the tassels when they start 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.280
 let eyebrows back down 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.640
 about half a centimeter and somewhere here 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.250
 from here I start to apply color and the most 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.580
 bright falls on this part of the eyebrow 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.090
 to break 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.180
 here i am shading what i already have 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.470
 there is on the eyebrows and also in this direction where 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.450
 I also blend to the very beginning 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.450
 remnants of shadow or pencil 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.540
 the next is eyelashes I really love 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:00.180
 build up eyelashes because it's 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.640
 incredibly reduces the time to make me 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.340
 really like waking up and looking 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.670
 immediately beautiful 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.190
 for others in the second it is very 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.750
 comfortable while relaxing and i'm not at all 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.420
 I see not a single minus which is 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.090
 eyelash extension it's beautiful it 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.000
 comfortable practical ladder holding 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.430
 from about 3 weeks more in 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.109
 whichever you wear them like 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:31.440
 would not care and also your personal 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.560
 features of the body in general for 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.220
 young mom is just a godsend 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.620
 increased eyelashes 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.400
 once in 3 weeks once a month and go 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.959
 always ready always beautiful 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.319
 well-groomed then two and a half years 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.540
 I increase eyelashes of course with pauses 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.389
 new during the pause, I do not really like 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.799
 paints eyelashes with mascara 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.530
 because it seems to me that it looks 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:02.370
 unnatural and beautiful they stick together 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.220
 how are these legs shelf and how long 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.150
 you didn't try anyway 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.610
 be perfect once honest and like that 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.310
 beautiful as in advertising or as wrist 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.400
 eyelashes but despite that i always 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.959
 buy mascara here for example recently I 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.670
 bought mascara from chanel new mascara before 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.900
 they had square packing here 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.840
 now tidy well so very great and 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.640
 pretty in general in a beautician she is not 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.540
 there so now when these mine 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.150
 eyelashes disappear 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.910
 I will definitely try it, but since 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.060
 I don't have eyelashes dough on them 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.960
 I just brush them with a brush on it 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.170
 eye makeup 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.210
 finish further lips depending on 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.690
 mood either 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.830
 bright lipstick is my favorite bright lipstick 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:05:02.000
 again this is chanel in color 102 rouge 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:06.440
 allure just red classic 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.890
 shade i put it either with a finger or 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.419
 I donâ€™t brush very brightly with a brush right from 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.960
 tube because it turns out super 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.560
 brightly 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.440
 method really like if the mood is on 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.040
 there is no red lipstick either this is my morning 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.340
 dior's favorite shine 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.710
 which increases lips just gently 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:35.410
 gently gently pink this did not give 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:38.590
 shade following what i do is powder 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.590
 Chanel powder 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:46.259
 and and the final blush is blush i 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:48.539
 I use these are not very bright 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:53.069
 it's not really blush 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:57.360
 and powder Chanel with tanning effect 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:59.699
 but it's blush I don't know she is impossible 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.619
 powder her whole face she turns 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.039
 red as if you were overcooked 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:07.499
 tanning bed so i use it only 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:10.429
 as blush on the line of cheekbones and not growth 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:14.330
 hair on the nose and on the chin 

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:17.610
 This is probably all I do makeup 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.659
 when i wash my face in the evening i use 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:25.849
 his skin Vichy 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:27.539
 I did a review and after that I use 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:31.139
 your lotion 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:36.089
 Well that's all it is my daily makeup 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:40.499
 which i do 90 percent of the time 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:43.439
 and in the summer I can not painted at all 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:46.249
 bring only eyebrows and shine or you 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:48.119
 eyelash extensions or none at all 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:50.579

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:53.249
