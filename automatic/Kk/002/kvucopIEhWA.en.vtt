00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
because they can get extremely hot and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.950 
because they can get extremely hot and
are<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.760> bright<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.059> they<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.510> literally

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
are so bright that they can literally

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
straight into them if you have a hundred

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.250 
straight into them if you have a hundred
dollars<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.879> spend<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.629> get<00:00:48.780> some<00:00:48.989> lights

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
dollars to spend you can get some lights

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.279 
dollars to spend you can get some lights
that<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.860> pretty<00:00:50.460> good<00:00:51.020> this<00:00:52.020> kit

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that are actually pretty good this kit

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.650 
that are actually pretty good this kit
is<00:00:52.500> branded<00:00:52.949> differently<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.699> almost<00:00:54.090> every

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
is branded differently at almost every

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.510 
is branded differently at almost every
store<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.260> my<00:00:55.410> guess<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.039> they're<00:00:56.309> all

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
store but my guess is that they're all

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.610 
store but my guess is that they're all
pretty<00:00:57.000> much<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> same<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.469> we're

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
pretty much the same and what we're

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
pretty much the same and what we're
watching<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> first<00:00:59.699> time<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> ever

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
watching here is the first time I ever

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
watching here is the first time I ever
lay<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.930> eyes<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.469> gear<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> show

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
lay my eyes on the gear just to show

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.870 
lay my eyes on the gear just to show
that<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.120> easy<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> use<00:01:04.369> it<00:01:05.369> comes<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that it's that easy to use it comes in a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
that it's that easy to use it comes in a
sweet<00:01:06.240> bag<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.810> has<00:01:06.990> room<00:01:07.260> left<00:01:07.530> over<00:01:07.680> for

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
sweet bag that has room left over for

tightening nuts and bolts super hard

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.529 
tightening nuts and bolts super hard
there<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.429> only<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:09.000> light<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.450> it's

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
there we go only one light and it's

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.480 
there we go only one light and it's
already<00:02:09.959> looking<00:02:10.379> better

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
already looking better

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.090 
already looking better
I'm<00:02:12.330> only<00:02:12.570> testing<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> stuff<00:02:13.620> here<00:02:13.890> and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
I'm only testing the stuff here and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.010 
I'm only testing the stuff here and
putting<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> lights<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:14.910> as<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> random<00:02:15.540> so

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
putting the lights out as a random so

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.780 
putting the lights out as a random so
you<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.860> reflection<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
you can see I get the reflection in the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.670 
you can see I get the reflection in the
window<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.510> would<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.720> easy<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.320> avoid

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
window but that would be easy to avoid

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.850 
window but that would be easy to avoid
by<00:02:19.950> moving<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.580> lights<00:02:20.760> or<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.540> camera<00:02:21.900> now<00:02:22.830> I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
by moving the lights or the camera now I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:32.690 
by moving the lights or the camera now I
have<00:02:23.040> both<00:02:23.460> lights<00:02:23.820> set<00:02:24.150> up<00:02:30.650> there<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.800> go<00:02:31.980> 100

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
have both lights set up there you go 100

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
have both lights set up there you go 100
