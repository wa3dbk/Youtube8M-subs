00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.910
 Hello friends, this is our small 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.879
 podcast for newly arrived people yes and 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.740
 generally a podcast to the life of the channel can 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:15.500
 say well let's start newcomers I 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:20.769
 xander frolov with nickname frau my channel 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:23.179
 is engaged in all kinds of cosplay and all 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:27.230
 tell me more about yourself and what is straightforward 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.480
 you have an elephant in general, we have a podcast 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.690
 a little further we go under to the stack 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.680
 plans for a channel on a channel that is 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.540
 we are passing house of course in 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.060
 first it took us Michael 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.430
 ends does not end 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.200
 continues then there was a pretty 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.050
 big break break when i'm not 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.410
 rented nigma but now I think about 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.030
 the trap is removed there is all that 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.290
 All interesting about half plays 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.640
 took off another half off take off soon 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:05.570
 the closest you a few days a week 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:13.039
 your data until the end of the month with x 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:15.619
 cam with take xcom we are all nigma and bureau 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:20.509
 xcom lay out before the end of this month I 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:25.939
 I hope once I started talking about wix.com will take 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.950
 d-class fight m well, in general, then you can 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.179
 say that zafeil this passage 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.359
 because of the lags and how sad it is 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.490
 recognize but most everyone wrote and 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:41.409
 spoke but nobody said how 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.109
 fix these lags last episodes i 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.539
 I understand how all this have to assemble all 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:51.049
 did not lag there everything was fine but to 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.109
 Sorry lags when walking and others 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:58.369
 minor such lags but how do I 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:01.490
 wrote quite noticeable spoil everything 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.889
 passing so you can take it for 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.810
 eagle owl but in principle he is the last 

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:12.700
 cool in general 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:18.090
 But in general, so and the protein scum I will 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.060
 further spread but so to speak with us 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.040
 I start talking wix.com we have the passage 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.709
 I take the game xcom moves back 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.300
 plan second plan on now probably 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.800
 the main passage will be soon 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.870
 minecraft is not a passage but just games 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.819
 in maykravt and main took place with us 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.000
 now it’s still a nigma channel 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:48.670
 the house which is the last to change about 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.610
 formation from you aside 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.610
 talk under authority put off and then u 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.569
 I have a list here about what I have to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.170
 say in general, then here we go further 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.280
 xcom enemy 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.849
 she i think everyone is a famous game x kanon 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.859
 I have to drain that twenty years ago recorded 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:15.010
 multiplayer for it and I can say that 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.109
 xcom enemy on we have a good game but also 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.180
 I will not pass I will pass 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.820
 xcom and us she 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.760
 filling and evil and now i will 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.620
 record games in multiplayer a little bit i 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.690
 before him that I will be quite a lot 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.290
 record needles and your multi held by 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.040
 x to whom 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:39.700
 but unfortunately almost no vegetables 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.510
 not playing sadness in general is pretty pretty 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.190
 fight find 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.799
 I stayed here for half an hour no one came 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.319
 then somehow with someone I played there on 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.850
 some kind of card left with some kind of left 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:59.590
 parameters but in general it is by the way xcom 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.500
 we still have a contest he will end soon 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.400
 in five six days somewhere so you 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.600
 you can still have time to participate so well 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.569
 we are on the list further I could not get sick I 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.849
 already said this 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.609
 okay, then we have the list goes 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.729
 mail far as old that is, in the rear of the enemy 2 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.729
 storm 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.070
 multiplayer I will soon lay out by 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.310
 I even recorded this game 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.720
 several battles I will soon be on her 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.300
 probably will not be recorded as both 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.120
 the game itself is luzhuchy it is better 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.470
 rigidly laguous and more precisely even multiplayer 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.449
 laguish and the game itself laguchy 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.940
 but about her, I will be sure to editor by 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.430
 the game editor write me this very 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.210
 interesting to tell show your 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.580
 some experience i played quite a lot in 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.900
 I am interested in the editor just for people 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.680
 to tell about 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.440
 the experience that is acquired in this editor 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.710
 maybe someone will find it entertaining and 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.590
 any such years photo 2 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.530
 if anyone is interested, I do not plan 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.530
 write nothing at all if someone 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.430
 call from friends to write something possible 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.190
 we will continue with us 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.139
 and the formation goes outlast right after 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:28.610
 I will lay out all the passage of xcom 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:32.060
 I will take to class fight and this nigma 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.800
 House in general, I think I'll post it before 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.409
 the end of the month I will go further 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.460
 outlast and after outlast and i will 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.449
 pass xcom enemy announcements of mind that is 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.070
 river 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.389
 or whatever it is called, I definitely don’t 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:51.889
 I remember and xcom enemy she even got 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:53.570
 go out with us november 15 november but i 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:57.560
 I think that what'll do the passage somewhere 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:01.610
 20 knots max of this layer there every 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.550
 Is I somewhere 20 I will do Casco moms 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.860
 because there will be some other 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.990
 projects projects there multiplayer and 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.560
 co-operatives with other people will 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.440
 necessarily peremeshku ie with all 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.159
 By this I can not guess at 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.919
 one and a half month 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:21.560
 what will we have there next month 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:25.040
 what will we have after the next month 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.780
 but I just can't regret it 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.090
 guess and I want to play xcom myself 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.690
 and us she 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.980
 filling in when we win in general 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.250
 I think on this podcast 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.990
 we have enough I text everything 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.050
 lay out for some games I will soon 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:46.790
 Soon we will do all this 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.860
 passing general is possible with me 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.360
 such chaotic thoughts here I am not I do not 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.540
 I said about minecraft here I have it 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.320
 was separately marked let's craft you 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:00.229
 will always I don't ask yell no 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.210
 I plan to shoot minekravt more precisely 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.400
 I plan but I just can’t pack up 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.320
 there is a metro to do it normal 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.750
 finally metro because many in 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.860
 comments to the previous version of the subway writing 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:16.010
 every shit really metro happened 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.979
 not very so tough epic and all as 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:21.290
 I wanted to but I'm doing it 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:25.630
 Here is real brutally such clearly 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:28.580
 In general, I did not drive now , I conveniently record 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:32.229
 did but now i need to remember how 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:35.210
 a year ago I collected some kind of subway there 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:37.280
 calculating it is quite difficult but me and mike 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.320
 just for now 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.190
 record maykravt and still eat there 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:47.060
 some ideas on maycroft so all 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:51.020
 I think it will be soon in this 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.850
 month somewhere so may be next 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.990
 be sure to be next will be 

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.090
 next year maykravt maykravt 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.010
 Minecraft is nowhere excellent 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.740
 the game will be minecraft cooperatives then 

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.979
 there are 3 maynkavt will be as soon as I 

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.340
 find a man with whom to shoot all 

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:06.340
 nothing else 

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.400
 They are all in general, that's all 

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:16.380
