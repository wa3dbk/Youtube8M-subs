00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.030 
my standards for that have gone way
higher<00:00:55.030> like<00:00:55.360> it's<00:00:55.510> got<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.780> be<00:00:55.870> an<00:00:56.110> above<00:00:56.440> 20

the reason I want to do that is lately I
felt<00:01:47.709> really<00:01:47.859> pressed<00:01:48.429> to<00:01:48.609> upload<00:01:48.999> and<00:01:49.179> I've

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
felt really pressed to upload and I've

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.120 
felt really pressed to upload and I've
been<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.689> uploading<00:01:50.200> really<00:01:50.469> quickly<00:01:50.859> like

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
been just uploading really quickly like

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.469 
been just uploading really quickly like
every<00:01:51.399> three<00:01:51.639> days<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:52.119> that's<00:01:52.179> how<00:01:52.359> I've

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
every three days and that's how I've

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.999 
every three days and that's how I've
usually<00:01:52.659> done<00:01:53.079> it<00:01:53.229> but<00:01:53.349> I<00:01:53.380> realized<00:01:53.770> lately

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
usually done it but I realized lately

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.120 
usually done it but I realized lately
that<00:01:54.130> I've<00:01:54.340> been<00:01:54.520> feeling<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:55.779> a<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:56.829> it's

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
that I've been feeling that a like it's

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.709 
that I've been feeling that a like it's
been<00:01:57.310> really<00:01:57.520> forced<00:01:58.090> like<00:01:58.299> I<00:01:58.419> haven't<00:01:58.599> been

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
been really forced like I haven't been

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.479 
been really forced like I haven't been
spending<00:01:58.959> a<00:01:59.139> lot<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.319> time<00:01:59.409> on<00:01:59.829> my<00:01:59.859> videos<00:02:00.279> and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
spending a lot of time on my videos and

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:02.370 
spending a lot of time on my videos and
I<00:02:00.549> felt<00:02:00.789> like<00:02:00.880> they've<00:02:01.119> been<00:02:01.359> thrown<00:02:02.200> together

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
I felt like they've been thrown together

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.229 
I felt like they've been thrown together
really<00:02:02.799> quickly<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:03.549> sometimes<00:02:03.939> I<00:02:04.060> feel<00:02:04.209> like

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
really quickly and sometimes I feel like

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.029 
really quickly and sometimes I feel like
they<00:02:04.450> even<00:02:04.630> look<00:02:04.779> sloppy<00:02:05.049> even<00:02:05.499> though<00:02:05.649> nobody

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
they even look sloppy even though nobody

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.769 
they even look sloppy even though nobody
said<00:02:06.429> anything<00:02:06.459> about<00:02:06.819> it<00:02:07.119> but<00:02:07.270> sometimes<00:02:07.509> I

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:07.779 
said anything about it but sometimes I

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:09.059 
said anything about it but sometimes I
feel<00:02:07.989> that<00:02:08.020> way<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:08.679> don't<00:02:08.830> like<00:02:08.920> the

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
feel that way and I just don't like the

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.320 
feel that way and I just don't like the
way<00:02:09.160> they<00:02:09.310> look<00:02:09.340> sometimes<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.090> they<00:02:10.180> could

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
way they look sometimes like they could

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.730 
way they look sometimes like they could
have<00:02:10.450> had<00:02:10.540> more<00:02:10.690> time<00:02:10.899> put<00:02:11.140> into<00:02:11.170> them<00:02:11.590> and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
have had more time put into them and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.950 
have had more time put into them and
made<00:02:12.310> them<00:02:12.340> look<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.640> little

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
made them look a little

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.590 
made them look a little
it<00:02:13.050> more<00:02:13.290> professional<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.490> at<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.390> same

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it more professional but at the same

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.930 
it more professional but at the same
time<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.230> shouldn't<00:02:16.890> be<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.010> serious<00:02:17.490> but

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
time it shouldn't be that serious but

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.370 
time it shouldn't be that serious but
I'm<00:02:18.180> kind<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> neat<00:02:18.750> freak<00:02:18.780> when<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.200> comes
