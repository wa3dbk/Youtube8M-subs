Josh<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.210> fastest<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:05.020> everything<00:02:05.500> you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
Josh is the fastest not everything you

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.449 
Josh is the fastest not everything you
need<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.160> keep<00:02:06.460> them<00:02:06.729> in<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.510> car<00:02:07.780> too<00:02:08.459> but

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
need to keep them in the car too but

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.930 
need to keep them in the car too but
that's<00:02:09.759> dropped<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.890> come<00:02:12.190> dance<00:02:12.730> with

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
that's dropped it you come dance with

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:21.570 
that's dropped it you come dance with
one<00:02:13.300> kiss<00:02:13.570> too<00:02:14.190> sad<00:02:15.190> situation<00:02:20.280> another<00:02:21.280> one

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
one kiss too sad situation another one

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.820 
one kiss too sad situation another one
that's<00:02:21.940> roughly<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.050> for<00:02:23.290> dance<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.740> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
that's roughly so for dance is the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.060 
that's roughly so for dance is the
fastest<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:25.120> dance<00:02:25.390> could<00:02:25.630> not<00:02:25.810> carry<00:02:26.200> both

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
fastest but dance could not carry both

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.970 
fastest but dance could not carry both
the<00:02:27.490> crystals<00:02:27.970> he<00:02:28.540> dropped<00:02:28.900> one<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:29.739> cannot

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the crystals he dropped one so we cannot

let's<00:02:47.890> see<00:02:48.070> how<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.220> almost<00:02:48.580> us<00:02:48.820> oh<00:02:49.120> it's

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
let's see how to almost us oh it's

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.870 
let's see how to almost us oh it's
almost<00:02:50.260> as<00:02:50.440> fast<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.160> he's<00:02:51.370> done<00:02:51.580> dropping

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
almost as fast and he's done dropping

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.190 
almost as fast and he's done dropping
anything<00:02:52.209> how<00:02:53.170> much<00:02:53.709> closer<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.070> 30<00:02:54.959> yo<00:02:55.959> keep

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
anything how much closer to 30 yo keep

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.430 
anything how much closer to 30 yo keep
cool<00:02:56.650> place<00:02:57.430> almost<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.910> see<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.150> test<00:02:58.480> with

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
cool place almost to see the test with

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.400 
cool place almost to see the test with
one<00:02:59.650> happen<00:03:00.209> hopefully<00:03:01.209> how<00:03:01.630> much<00:03:01.810> one<00:03:02.019> drop

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
one happen hopefully how much one drop

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.470 
one happen hopefully how much one drop
