00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.190
 Welcome to the new Range Rover, already the fourth generation since 1970. 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.410
 And it's Land Rover that 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.580
 the name Range Rover carries from the beginning succeeded to an icon down 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.620
 to put. Because before the world spoke about SUVs and crossovers 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.720
 they invented it in England for a long time. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.220
 Well, the fourth generation 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.899
 it is mainly in appearance 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.979
 remained strong. For example, we see elements in the lighting 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.080
 that come from the Evoque. 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.570
 But otherwise, the large, bulky appearance of the Range Rover has been preserved 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.380
 stayed. 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.260
 Some details have shifted. The gills that were first on the front fenders, 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.360
 are now on the doors. And there are still some small issues 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.670
 changed. And yet this new Range Rover is completely new from front to back. 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.490
 And Land Rover and Range Rover have development wherever possible 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.409
 used aluminum and that explains in part 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.409
 the fact that the car has been considerably reduced in weight. 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.930
 Range Rover makes the bodywork but also a large part of the suspension 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.140
 aluminum. 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.179
 They have gone further than the previous model. 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.859
 And that provides a substantial weight benefit. 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.189
 At the same time, because the body has become lighter, 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.680
 can Range Rover in the basic model with a V6 diesel instead of 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.729
 formerly the V8 diesel. 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:25.439
 That ultimately yields an advantage of 320 kilos, 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.019
 320 kilos that need to be taken less 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.779
 with the same performance, 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.299
 means one 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.939
 advantage ultimately in fuel consumption and CO2. 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.709
 That explains 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.749
 why the entry level Range Rover of the fourth generation is no less than 22,000 euros 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:42.890
 cheaper 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.890
 than the entry-level model of the previous model. 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:12.759
 The Range Rover has more than enough of course. Think of 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.569
 interior space, think of motor power, 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.079
 also think of terrain capacities, because despite the luxury 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.549
 of such a Range Rover he will not let you in the most extreme circumstances 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:31.549
 stab. 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.569
 As we are now used to from the brand, there is here in the center console between the 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.509
 seats in a button with which various positions for the four-wheel drive can 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:45.299
 be set. For example, you choose a specific substrate and then the 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.099
 car with suggestions for the ride height, shift program 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.149
 etc. etc. etc. And every time they go with Land Rover and Range Rover with model 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.710
 coming 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.369
 they go one step further in that technique. 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.769
 We were able to try this car out a few months ago in the 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.480
 desert in morocco and i can 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.289
 insure you, 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:06.139
 that car has no problem with that. But not with one either 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.859
 trailer of 3,500 kilos, because that is still one of the big ones 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.419
 advantages of this car. 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.569
 Luxury, strength and that for a price that is considerably more favorable 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:18.599
 is then the previous model. 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.419
 These are sales arguments, not only in the Netherlands, where of course the 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.960
 sales numbers are modest but all over the world. 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.759
 Of course you sit high on the buck in this Range Rover with a perfect view 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.990
 on top of the hood. 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.470
 But also to everything that comes before and next to it 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.469
 the car happens. 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.740
 That can be expanded with a camera system 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.630
 whose images here on the center console appear on the central display 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.139
 shown. 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.560
 This allows the side of the car to be monitored. That is handy with 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.770
 parking, but also under tight conditions such as in the terrain 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.909
 is being driven. 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.330
 The car is for that matter 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.969
 prepared for anything. 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.150
 He has a 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.510
 chic dress and chic direction, 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.029
 but at times when the substrate disappears 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.870
 then you can even if there is no way 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.499
 anyway with this Range Rover everywhere. 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:35.239
 And with that, Range Rover keeps its original concept nice and faithful 

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.999
 they must keep it that way.
