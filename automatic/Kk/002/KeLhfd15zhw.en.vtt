00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
bike box huh how does that work let me

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.120 
bike box huh how does that work let me
show<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.849> when<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> light<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> green

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130

show you when the light is green
cyclists<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.250> cars<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.970> travel<00:00:30.359> through

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
cyclists and cars just travel through

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.330 
cyclists and cars just travel through
like<00:00:30.689> they<00:00:30.810> normally<00:00:30.960> would

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.430 

and<00:00:34.090> of<00:00:34.180> course<00:00:34.390> if<00:00:34.540> cars<00:00:34.750> are<00:00:34.960> turning<00:00:35.230> right

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
and of course if cars are turning right

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.960 
and of course if cars are turning right
they<00:00:35.710> should<00:00:35.890> check<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.250> bike<00:00:36.430> lane<00:00:36.640> before

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
they should check the bike lane before

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.240 
they should check the bike lane before
they<00:00:37.120> turn

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.950 

well<00:00:42.250> that<00:00:42.400> makes<00:00:42.610> sense<00:00:42.940> but<00:00:43.600> what<00:00:43.750> if<00:00:43.840> the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
well that makes sense but what if the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.560 
well that makes sense but what if the
light<00:00:44.140> is<00:00:44.320> red<00:00:44.550> well<00:00:45.550> if<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:45.910> light<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:46.270> red

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
light is red well if the light is red

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.780 
light is red well if the light is red
the<00:00:46.960> cars<00:00:47.260> have<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.650> stop<00:00:47.890> at<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.190> white<00:00:48.400> stop

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
the cars have to stop at the white stop

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.670 
the cars have to stop at the white stop
bar<00:00:49.060> that's<00:00:49.390> located<00:00:49.930> behind<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.260> green<00:00:50.440> box

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
bar that's located behind the green box

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.920 
bar that's located behind the green box
and<00:00:51.010> cyclists<00:00:51.850> just<00:00:52.030> go<00:00:52.150> into<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.540> box<00:00:52.720> and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
and cyclists just go into the box and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.110 
and cyclists just go into the box and
get<00:00:53.080> into<00:00:53.290> position<00:00:53.320> so<00:00:54.100> if<00:00:54.400> a<00:00:54.520> cyclist<00:00:54.940> wants

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
get into position so if a cyclist wants

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.730 
get into position so if a cyclist wants
to<00:00:55.180> turn<00:00:55.390> left<00:00:55.600> they<00:00:55.900> go<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.350> left<00:00:56.530> side<00:00:56.680> of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
to turn left they go to the left side of

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.080 
to turn left they go to the left side of
the<00:00:56.800> box<00:00:56.950> and<00:00:57.280> if<00:00:57.520> they<00:00:57.670> want<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:57.910> turn<00:00:58.030> right

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
the box and if they want to turn right

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.390 
the box and if they want to turn right
they<00:00:58.660> go<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.380> right<00:00:59.620> side<00:00:59.980> of<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.220> box

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
they go to the right side of the box

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.470 
they go to the right side of the box
that's<00:01:00.850> pretty<00:01:01.030> easy

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
that's pretty easy

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.750 
that's pretty easy
exactly<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.380> remember<00:01:03.130> to<00:01:03.220> use<00:01:03.340> your<00:01:03.520> hand

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
signals so cars know what you're gonna

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.640 
signals so cars know what you're gonna

have to watch out for one another you're

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.210 
have to watch out for one another you're
right<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:22.420> when<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.020> light<00:01:23.200> turns<00:01:23.440> green<00:01:23.590> the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
right so when the light turns green the

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.130 
right so when the light turns green the
cyclist<00:01:24.670> go<00:01:24.790> first<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.420> once<00:01:25.930> they've

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
cyclist go first and once they've

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.780 
cyclist go first and once they've
cleared<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.560> bike<00:01:26.710> box<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.280> cars<00:01:27.490> can<00:01:27.670> go

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
cleared the bike box the cars can go

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.310 
cleared the bike box the cars can go
sounds<00:01:28.450> simple<00:01:28.750> enough

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
sounds simple enough

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.650 
sounds simple enough
so<00:01:29.710> since<00:01:30.100> we're<00:01:30.280> going<00:01:30.430> left<00:01:30.729> we<00:01:31.210> move<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.540> the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
so since we're going left we move to the

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so since we're going left we move to the
left<00:01:31.840> side<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.200> box<00:01:32.380> right<00:01:32.710> no<00:01:33.550> left<00:01:34.680> I'm

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
left side of the box right no left I'm

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.550 
left side of the box right no left I'm
just<00:01:35.979> kidding<00:01:36.220> you're<00:01:36.340> right
