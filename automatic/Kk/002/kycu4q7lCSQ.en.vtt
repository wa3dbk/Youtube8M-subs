00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
mind pulled into question on how

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.280 
mind pulled into question on how
reliable<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.310> mean<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> might<00:01:09.030> not

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
reliable they are I mean that might not

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.420 
reliable they are I mean that might not
obviously<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.500> case<00:01:10.770> especially<00:01:10.979> after

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
obviously be the case especially after

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.630 
obviously be the case especially after
reading<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.460> made<00:01:14.460> me

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
reading this now it just kind of made me

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.100 
reading this now it just kind of made me
doubt<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.330> actually<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
doubt if it was actually going to be a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.160 
doubt if it was actually going to be a
reliable<00:01:16.350> resource<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.310> she<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.360> learning

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
reliable resource if she was learning

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
reliable resource if she was learning
what<00:01:19.590> silver<00:01:19.860> raven<00:01:20.130> wolf<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.490> teaching<00:01:20.880> but

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
not really working with energy

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.569 
not really working with energy
manipulation<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.680> need<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.310> start<00:03:17.459> working

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
manipulation so I need to start working

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.890 
manipulation so I need to start working
on<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:17.940> before<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.329> can<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.599> some<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.840> these

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
on that before I can do some of these

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.520 
on that before I can do some of these
exercises<00:03:19.340> but<00:03:20.510> she<00:03:21.510> takes<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> Wicca<00:03:22.049> 101

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
exercises but she takes the Wicca 101

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.069 
exercises but she takes the Wicca 101
concepts<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.519> expounds<00:03:24.299> upon<00:03:24.359> them<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.049> that

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
concepts and expounds upon them so that

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.650 
concepts and expounds upon them so that
they're<00:03:25.440> more<00:03:25.620> advanced<00:03:26.250> it's<00:03:26.760> still<00:03:27.030> I'd<00:03:27.329> say

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
they're more advanced it's still I'd say

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.659 
they're more advanced it's still I'd say
an<00:03:27.870> intermediate<00:03:28.379> book<00:03:28.560> read<00:03:29.129> like<00:03:29.310> one<00:03:29.519> or

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
an intermediate book read like one or

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.119 
an intermediate book read like one or
two<00:03:29.699> maybe<00:03:30.299> three<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:30.750> four<00:03:31.019> with<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.680> 101

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
two maybe three or four with the 101

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.369 
two maybe three or four with the 101
books<00:03:32.400> read<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.329> few<00:03:33.480> ritual<00:03:33.870> books<00:03:34.109> like

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
books read a few ritual books like

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.039 
books read a few ritual books like
elements<00:03:35.129> of<00:03:35.310> ritual<00:03:35.699> and<00:03:35.970> then<00:03:36.599> read<00:03:36.810> this

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
elements of ritual and then read this

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.619 
elements of ritual and then read this
I'd<00:03:37.889> say<00:03:38.129> it<00:03:38.250> comes<00:03:38.459> before<00:03:38.699> reading<00:03:39.180> ritual

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
I'd say it comes before reading ritual

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.599 
I'd say it comes before reading ritual
craft<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.230> be<00:03:40.349> honest<00:03:40.910> but<00:03:42.919> yeah<00:03:43.919> it's<00:03:44.400> amazing

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
prepared so it's good that she talks

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.470

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
about the warnings in there too because

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.680 
about the warnings in there too because
not<00:04:35.230> having<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.740> teacher<00:04:35.950> you<00:04:36.670> might<00:04:36.850> not<00:04:37.420> be

not having a teacher you might not be

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.870 
not having a teacher you might not be
aware<00:04:37.720> of<00:04:38.020> what<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.860> really<00:04:39.220> involved<00:04:39.490> in<00:04:39.760> that

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
aware of what is really involved in that

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.860
