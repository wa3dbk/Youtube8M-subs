00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 hello everyone i did last summer 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.690
 soundproofing your car 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:16.230
 9 months have passed I want to share 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:22.430
 your impressions are white 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.430
 vibroplast step2 and two millimeters 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.830
 from captivity eight elements 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:50.520
 was made so here were made arches 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:54.770
 They were also made lockers Doors 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.890
 three steps were made 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 vibroplast s.n. vibroplast 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 its here on plastic again 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.890
 vibroplast 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.170
 caps were completely made 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.950
 the back door the doors became heavy but 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:32.649
 have become very nice to close 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:42.789
 so here it was access isolation back 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:46.390
 door and fully factory gods 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:55.030
 insulation was just 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:02:00.039
 Here is the main question became love and of course 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.159
 I became a finger and I did not measure white, but in 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.880
 percentage ratio of 20 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.989
 30 became quieter that is if you drive 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.780
 on the highway 130 kilometers per hour while 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:19.329
 do not look at the speedometer then it seems to you 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.870
 what you drive about 90 disappeared external 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.970
 noises 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.510
 but there were more loud so to speak 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.739
 internal that is somewhere creaks 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.010
 plastic somewhere knocks something even 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.920
 trunk of a station wagon so things 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.910
 in the trunk have become much more difficult so 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.130
 how all the external noise disappeared 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.269
 turned out for noise isolate it 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:53.829
 torpedo I could not shoot there Japanese 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:57.730
 some clips are on which hangs 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:00.750
 all wiring but this is not the place that 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.750
 I could not isolate for noise 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:10.770
 what I want to say about the arches and locker 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:16.950
 many cars for some reason noticed 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:20.250
 no back and lockers and front stand 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.340
 curl rockers don't call it this 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:29.680
 thin such plastic 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:34.060
 plastinochki whether that well, noise insulation 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:39.700
 it was like this 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:42.150
 and so it was such a sound from all 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.150
 four sides 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.270
 after soundproofing 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.070
 it will all disappear and now either just 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.240
 deaf sound if it is a large stone if 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:04:00.270
 small that of course and not heard at all that 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:05.590
 I can say about the floor insulation floor 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.260
 got rid of asphalt noise practically 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:13.900
 eliminated noise flips are also valid 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:18.100
 if you drive through the forest then the twigs here 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:25.360
 dry grass yes yes noise isolation looked 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:28.390
 around here and so now it is not 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.010
 can hear even s drive through for some 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:37.360
 twigs or dry scrub this 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.810
 I can hear about the ceiling what can I say 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.600
 about the ceiling 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.650
 But if you were to sound insulation under the 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.720
 a tree after the rain that happened here 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:58.900
 a sound that is very strong 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:05:04.150
 annoyed the drops fell from the tree and now 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.930
 imagine the millions of drops that 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.260
 rain time from this to the roof and 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.310
 it turned out so you're sitting in some kind 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:19.690
 the bell tower and the top of your hammer 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.550
 hammers sometimes even music was in 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:26.320
 basically not audible if it was good 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.850
 it's not raining right now all that 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.230
 now you can hear it here 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:38.920
 drops fall on the windshield but it 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:45.670
 very so quiet sound and what i want 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:49.170
 say about the door noise insulation do 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.390
 then I started sound insulation precisely because 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:06:05.140
 what I wanted to hear more such 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:06:10.000
 quality music unfortunately after 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.800
 sound insulation did not happen even 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.080
 on the contrary, what I don't like right now 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.470
 it's sometimes bass 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.790
 why is trying to break out from under 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:27.040
 these gums though did everything right 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:33.340
 did everything according to the book box all as 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:37.180
 written well and now move on to this 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.760
 the topic will i make noise insulation if 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.090
 I will buy 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:47.740
 another car no more do i don't 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:53.440
 I will because the first weight increases 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:57.220
 car one sheet vibroplast weighs 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.940
 one and a half kilograms I used 30 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:03.850
 sheets that is the car I have 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:11.280
 put on weight almost 50 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:14.050
 kilogram it affects acceleration on 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:19.830
 braking especially on the car which 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.830
 engine in the area of ​​1 and 3 liters 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.570
 also 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.900
 second why i won't do it 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:33.580
 laborious and it is very strong 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:37.890
 laborious and here I did it with my father 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.890
 have to do it together 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.200
 which is not always convenient in principle of course 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.540
 if you make yourself, that's it 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.870
 ten thousand rubles service from me 

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:53.920
 asked for 30,000 rubles and the third 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:59.410
 why I won't do it literally 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:02.590
 there in a month my ears got used to 

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:08.610
 such soundproofing and at the moment 

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:14.980
 it seems to me that she is not there again but to do 

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:19.200
 In principle, nothing is impossible but 

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.200
 all on it all bye
