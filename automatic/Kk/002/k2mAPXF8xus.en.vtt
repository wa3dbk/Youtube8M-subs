00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
nasty place right over here we have a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.590

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
minifigures but you need to be a bit

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.340 
minifigures but you need to be a bit
careful<00:01:22.670> because<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:23.570> can<00:01:23.750> actually<00:01:23.900> release

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
careful because you can actually release

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.860 
careful because you can actually release
a<00:01:24.410> function<00:01:24.980> on<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.220> back<00:01:25.370> side<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.850> make<00:01:26.600> the

a function on the back side and make the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.100 
a function on the back side and make the
letter<00:01:27.260> fall<00:01:27.560> forward<00:01:29.770> if<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:31.400> get<00:01:31.640> up<00:01:31.760> here

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
letter fall forward if you get up here

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.160 
letter fall forward if you get up here
you<00:01:33.110> can<00:01:33.320> actually<00:01:33.470> cross<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.280> bridge<00:01:35.170> but

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
you can actually cross the bridge but

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
again be careful because there's

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.149 
again be careful because there's
actually<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.300> function<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.620> can<00:01:39.800> release

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
actually a function and you can release

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.219 
actually a function and you can release
and<00:01:40.520> make<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.000> bridge<00:01:41.300> fall<00:01:41.810> down<00:01:43.750> up<00:01:44.750> here<00:01:44.810> we
