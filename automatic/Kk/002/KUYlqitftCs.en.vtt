00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.590 
look at that it doesn't move it I mean
it<00:03:06.860> moves<00:03:07.100> but<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:07.549> not<00:03:07.700> flimsy<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.450> it

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
it moves but it's not flimsy and it

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.729 
it moves but it's not flimsy and it
doesn't<00:03:08.900> feel<00:03:08.989> like<00:03:09.049> it's<00:03:09.290> going<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.500> break

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
doesn't feel like it's going to break

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.660 
doesn't feel like it's going to break
when<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> put<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.370> my<00:03:10.430> lashes<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.130> so

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
when I put it on my lashes this is so

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.759 
when I put it on my lashes this is so
that's<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.150> first<00:03:14.390> card<00:03:14.870> about<00:03:15.260> this<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.739> that

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
that's the first card about this is that

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.849 
that's the first card about this is that
it's<00:03:16.040> too<00:03:16.280> small<00:03:16.609> the<00:03:17.420> base<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:17.989> has<00:03:18.709> that

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
it's too small the base is has that

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.860 
it's too small the base is has that
little<00:03:19.010> indention<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.850> just<00:03:20.390> feel<00:03:20.540> like<00:03:20.690> it's

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
little indention and just feel like it's

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.840 
little indention and just feel like it's
going<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.109> break<00:03:21.260> when<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.560> get<00:03:21.829> ready<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.250> you

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
going to break when I get ready to you

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.650 
going to break when I get ready to you
know<00:03:22.880> do<00:03:23.390> my<00:03:23.420> lashes<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.079> don't<00:03:24.109> like<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:25.660> the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
know do my lashes I don't like that the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.259 
know do my lashes I don't like that the
other<00:03:26.900> thing<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.310> personally<00:03:29.030> don't

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
other thing is is I personally don't

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.720 
other thing is is I personally don't
know<00:03:29.660> if<00:03:29.989> it's<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.230> same<00:03:30.320> formula<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.280> think<00:03:31.579> it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
know if it's the same formula I think it

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.470 
know if it's the same formula I think it
is<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.120> same<00:03:32.709> mascara<00:03:33.709> formula<00:03:34.220> but<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.090> like

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
is the same mascara formula but I like

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.680 
is the same mascara formula but I like
this<00:03:35.690> brush<00:03:36.079> better<00:03:36.410> than<00:03:36.769> this<00:03:36.950> brush<00:03:37.690> this

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
this brush better than this brush this

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.830 
this brush better than this brush this
brush<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.560> older<00:03:40.160> brush<00:03:40.430> grips<00:03:41.269> my<00:03:41.570> lashes

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
brush the older brush grips my lashes

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.680 
brush the older brush grips my lashes
more<00:03:42.620> this<00:03:43.190> brush<00:03:43.519> doesn't<00:03:43.880> really<00:03:44.060> grip<00:03:44.450> them

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
more this brush doesn't really grip them

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.160 
more this brush doesn't really grip them
back<00:03:44.720> that<00:03:45.290> well<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.920> don't<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:47.480> doesn't<00:03:47.750> make

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
back that well I don't it doesn't make

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.740 
back that well I don't it doesn't make
them<00:03:48.380> as<00:03:48.590> thick<00:03:48.620> as<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:50.060> would<00:03:50.269> like<00:03:50.450> for<00:03:50.690> them

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
them as thick as I would like for them

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.110 
them as thick as I would like for them
to<00:03:50.840> be<00:03:51.109> as<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:51.829> does<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.579> just<00:03:52.790> think<00:03:52.940> that

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
to be as this does I just think that

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.979 
to be as this does I just think that
this<00:03:53.329> brush<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:54.549> cooler<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.880> me<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.209> just<00:03:56.269> makes

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
this brush is cooler to me it just makes

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.470 
this brush is cooler to me it just makes
my<00:03:57.319> lashes<00:03:57.530> bigger<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.430> darker<00:03:59.209> fuller

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
my lashes bigger a darker fuller

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.729 
my lashes bigger a darker fuller
then<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:01.349> new<00:04:01.800> one<00:04:01.830> does<00:04:03.080> if<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.230> formula<00:04:04.709> is

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
then the new one does if the formula is

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.990 
then the new one does if the formula is
the<00:04:05.040> same<00:04:05.420> then<00:04:06.420> it's<00:04:06.629> a<00:04:06.720> brush<00:04:07.159> and<00:04:08.159> not<00:04:08.730> the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
the same then it's a brush and not the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.680 
the same then it's a brush and not the
formula<00:04:09.629> but<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:10.709> don't<00:04:11.310> know<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.420> know

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
formula but I don't know so I just know

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.640 
formula but I don't know so I just know
I<00:04:12.720> like<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.200> older<00:04:13.500> one<00:04:13.650> better<00:04:13.890> also<00:04:15.650> but

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
I like the older one better also but

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.349 
I like the older one better also but
that's<00:04:17.100> not<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.459> say<00:04:17.579> that<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.820> don't<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.150> this

putting<00:04:51.750> them<00:04:51.900> on<00:04:52.639> without<00:04:53.639> being<00:04:53.940> so<00:04:54.510> that's

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
putting them on without being so that's

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.800 
putting them on without being so that's
why<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.470> don't<00:04:55.560> wear<00:04:55.770> false<00:04:56.070> eyelashes<00:04:56.720> but<00:04:57.720> I

there's<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.919> little<00:05:20.130> thing<00:05:20.400> that<00:05:20.430> catches<00:05:20.849> the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210
