people pushing these forwards as these

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.130 
people pushing these forwards as these
archetypes<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.820> know<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.420> don't<00:04:56.630> see<00:04:56.960> that

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
archetypes you know and I don't see that

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.140 
archetypes you know and I don't see that
because<00:04:57.350> they<00:04:57.470> seem<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.010> have<00:04:58.160> them<00:04:58.670> you<00:04:59.000> know

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
justification yeah of course of course

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.680 
justification yeah of course of course
and<00:05:04.730> so<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.620> could<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.980> pc<00:05:07.310> i<00:05:07.669> perceive<00:05:08.330> this<00:05:08.510> is

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
and so I could to pc i perceive this is

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.120 
and so I could to pc i perceive this is
something<00:05:09.080> that's<00:05:09.200> being<00:05:09.410> hijacked<00:05:10.390> hmm<00:05:12.130> you

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
something that's being hijacked hmm you

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.590 
something that's being hijacked hmm you
know<00:05:13.220> i<00:05:13.250> mean<00:05:13.370> obviously<00:05:13.820> all<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.180> this<00:05:14.360> oh

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
program and because we actually have

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.630 
program and because we actually have
gone<00:05:46.350> through<00:05:46.530> basically<00:05:46.890> two<00:05:47.160> hours<00:05:47.460> now<00:05:47.610> i

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640

think that this is a good amount of

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.710 
think that this is a good amount of
information<00:05:50.040> for<00:05:50.490> this<00:05:50.610> time<00:05:50.940> so<00:05:51.240> what<00:05:51.690> is

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
information for this time so what is

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.570 
information for this time so what is
that<00:05:51.900> real<00:05:52.110> or<00:05:52.380> you<00:05:52.500> are<00:05:52.680> we<00:05:52.800> up<00:05:52.890> for<00:05:52.920> a<00:05:53.100> part<00:05:53.430> 2

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
that real or you are we up for a part 2

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.310 
that real or you are we up for a part 2
here<00:05:53.820> in<00:05:53.970> a<00:05:54.030> while<00:05:54.210> yeah<00:05:54.570> that's<00:05:54.900> fine<00:05:55.080> i<00:05:55.140> know
