using<00:00:14.759> two<00:00:15.089> fingers<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.740> trick<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.279> make

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
using two fingers the trick is to make

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.670 
using two fingers the trick is to make
this<00:00:17.850> sound<00:00:18.119> really<00:00:18.539> good<00:00:18.690> crank<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.289> your<00:00:19.470> amp

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
this sound really good crank up your amp

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.670 
this sound really good crank up your amp
and<00:00:19.920> use<00:00:20.220> plenty<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.580> distortion<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:22.439> major

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and use plenty of distortion the major

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.150 
and use plenty of distortion the major
scale<00:00:23.130> has<00:00:23.490> seven<00:00:23.970> tones<00:00:24.590> here's<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.890> major

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.749 
scale has seven tones here's an a major
scale<00:00:29.689> each<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.140> tones<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.920> an<00:00:32.250> interval

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
scale each of these tones is an interval

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.020 
scale each of these tones is an interval
of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> major<00:00:33.300> scale<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:35.309> first<00:00:35.579> tone<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
of the major scale the first tone is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.990 
of the major scale the first tone is
called<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> root<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.230> next<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.520> second

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
called the root the next is the second

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.369 
called the root the next is the second
it's<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> second<00:00:40.170> interval<00:00:40.530> from<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> root

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
it's the second interval from the root

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.209 
it's the second interval from the root
fifth<00:00:43.379> sixth<00:00:44.280> seventh<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:46.379> eighth<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.860> the

fifth sixth seventh the eighth is the
octave<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.120> same<00:00:48.420> note<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.530> first<00:00:49.770> tone

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
octave the same note as the first tone

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
octave the same note as the first tone
an<00:00:51.660> octave<00:00:52.140> higher<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.370> point<00:00:53.610> the

scale starts all over
it's<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.739> each<00:00:55.949> note<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> an<00:00:56.699> octave<00:00:57.030> higher

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it's just each note is an octave higher

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.389 
it's just each note is an octave higher
don't<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:58.350> complicated<00:00:58.800> than<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
don't make it more complicated than it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.160 
don't make it more complicated than it
is<00:00:59.430> instead<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> assigning<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.629> name<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.140> each

is instead of assigning a name to each

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.390 
is instead of assigning a name to each
note<00:01:01.590> you're<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.699> assigning<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.180> number<00:01:03.359> root

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
note you're just assigning a number root

second third six seven eight and then it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.450 
second third six seven eight and then it
just<00:01:12.930> continues<00:01:13.439> an<00:01:13.619> octave<00:01:13.920> higher

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
just continues an octave higher

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.280 
just continues an octave higher
since<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> guitar<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:15.900> tuned<00:01:16.170> to

learned in exercise 5 are fretted like
this

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
this

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.300 
this
notice<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.260> these<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.710> both<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.190> notes<00:01:25.310> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
notice that these are both a notes and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
notice that these are both a notes and
this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:28.080> fifth<00:01:28.830> of<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> there<00:01:34.350> are<00:01:34.440> only

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this is the fifth of a so there are only

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.190 
this is the fifth of a so there are only
two<00:01:35.070> different<00:01:35.670> tones<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.630> fifth<00:01:36.930> type

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
two different tones in this fifth type

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
two different tones in this fifth type
interval<00:01:37.830> even<00:01:38.520> though<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:38.730> playing<00:01:39.030> three

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
interval even though I'm playing three

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.290 
interval even though I'm playing three
strings<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.160> chord<00:01:41.160> must<00:01:41.460> contain<00:01:41.820> three<00:01:42.180> or

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
strings a chord must contain three or

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.050 
strings a chord must contain three or
more<00:01:42.420> different<00:01:42.660> notes<00:01:43.400> since<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:44.610> only<00:01:44.790> has

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
more different notes since this only has

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
more different notes since this only has
two<00:01:45.420> different<00:01:45.690> notes<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.410> considered<00:01:46.950> an

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
two different notes it's considered an

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.780 
two different notes it's considered an
interval<00:01:47.910> instead<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.690> chord<00:01:49.700> before<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
interval instead of a chord before you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
interval instead of a chord before you
start<00:01:51.060> practicing<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.870> with<00:01:52.110> three

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
start practicing this with three

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.140 
start practicing this with three
strengths<00:01:52.800> let's<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:53.460> fun<00:01:53.730> with<00:01:53.760> just

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
strengths let's have some fun with just

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.760 
strengths let's have some fun with just
two<00:01:54.390> strings<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.050> bit<00:01:55.260> easier<00:01:55.620> to<00:01:55.650> play

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
two strings it's a bit easier to play

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.230 
two strings it's a bit easier to play
and<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.250> still<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.510> fifth<00:01:57.870> type<00:01:58.230> interval

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
and it's still the fifth type interval

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
and it's still the fifth type interval
the<00:02:00.240> root<00:02:00.540> note<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.290> interval<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.160> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
the root note of this interval is on the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.250 
the root note of this interval is on the
sixth<00:02:02.580> string<00:02:02.760> so<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.300> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.480> g5<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.140> an

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
sixth string so this is a g5 this is an

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.130 
sixth string so this is a g5 this is an
a5<00:02:07.800> c<00:02:08.490> v<00:02:08.730> g5<00:02:10.340> f5<00:02:11.510> these<00:02:12.510> are<00:02:12.690> often<00:02:12.900> called

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
a5 c v g5 f5 these are often called

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.200 
a5 c v g5 f5 these are often called
power<00:02:13.710> chords<00:02:14.280> although<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.910> are<00:02:15.030> not

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
power chords although they are not

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.600 
power chords although they are not
actually<00:02:15.810> chords<00:02:16.230> as<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:17.130> said<00:02:17.400> their

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
actually chords as I said their

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:35.140 
actually chords as I said their
intervals<00:02:18.300> here's<00:02:18.960> exercise<00:02:19.440> six

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.509 

by<00:02:36.049> changing<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.530> guitar<00:02:36.890> tone<00:02:37.099> and<00:02:37.340> lightly

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
by changing the guitar tone and lightly

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.490 
by changing the guitar tone and lightly
touching<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.150> sixth<00:02:38.540> 5th<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:38.989> 4th<00:02:39.170> strings
