napkin you need some silicon spray and
the<00:00:40.910> vacuum<00:00:41.180> cleaner<00:00:42.760> start<00:00:43.760> by<00:00:43.910> unfolding

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
the vacuum cleaner start by unfolding

besides<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.780> end<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.949> paperclip<00:00:49.519> is<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
besides the end the paperclip is the

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.729 
besides the end the paperclip is the
preparation<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.809> start<00:00:51.379> vacuum<00:00:51.920> your<00:00:52.570> cooling

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
preparation to start vacuum your cooling

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.009 
preparation to start vacuum your cooling
so<00:00:54.739> what<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:55.640> are<00:00:55.729> going<00:00:55.879> to<00:00:55.969> do<00:00:56.059> now<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.540> to

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
so what we are going to do now is to

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.670 
so what we are going to do now is to
find<00:00:57.589> the<00:00:57.739> entry<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.100> your<00:00:58.370> cooling<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:58.850> to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
find the entry of your cooling and to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.049 
find the entry of your cooling and to
make<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:00.799> stack<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:01.670> cannot<00:01:01.850> turn

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
make it stack so that it cannot turn

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.090 
make it stack so that it cannot turn
when<00:01:02.600> we<00:01:02.719> are<00:01:02.839> going<00:01:03.110> over<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:03.440> with<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> vacuum

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
when we are going over it with a vacuum

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.060 
when we are going over it with a vacuum
cleaner<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:05.080> start<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.229> hollow<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:06.770> vacuum

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
cleaner and start to hollow this vacuum

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
cleaner and start to hollow this vacuum
cleaner<00:01:07.490> above<00:01:07.820> it<00:01:07.970> be<00:01:08.960> cautious

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
cleaner above it be cautious

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.510 
cleaner above it be cautious
now<00:01:11.090> take<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.479> paperclip<00:01:12.050> out<00:01:12.460> open<00:01:13.460> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
now take the paperclip out open the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.249 
now take the paperclip out open the
laptop<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.060> we<00:01:14.420> will<00:01:14.509> start<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:15.020> just

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
laptop and we will start to just

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.370 
laptop and we will start to just
assemble<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.950> keyboard<00:01:17.080> before<00:01:18.080> you

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
assemble the keyboard before you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.680 
assemble the keyboard before you
disassemble<00:01:18.649> make<00:01:19.429> sure<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.179> have<00:01:20.360> an

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
disassemble make sure that you have an

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.080 
disassemble make sure that you have an
idea<00:01:21.080> where<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.470> kids<00:01:21.830> belong<00:01:22.100> again<00:01:22.280> or<00:01:22.789> just

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
idea where the kids belong again or just

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.270 
idea where the kids belong again or just
take<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.270> picture

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
take a picture

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.499 
take a picture
this<00:01:25.280> step<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.610> way<00:01:25.819> more<00:01:26.030> easy<00:01:26.210> than<00:01:26.300> you

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
this step is way more easy than you

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.540 
this step is way more easy than you
believe<00:01:26.659> because<00:01:27.289> you<00:01:27.530> just<00:01:27.740> go<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.190> top

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
believe because you just go to the top

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.600 
believe because you just go to the top
left<00:01:28.810> try<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.869> get<00:01:30.080> somehow<00:01:30.800> under<00:01:31.280> it<00:01:31.429> with

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
left try to get somehow under it with

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.639 
left try to get somehow under it with
your<00:01:31.729> finger<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.360> lift<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:32.899> up<00:01:33.020> until

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
your finger and just lift it up until

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.730 
your finger and just lift it up until
you<00:01:33.950> feel<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.780> it's<00:01:35.780> not<00:01:35.869> resisting<00:01:36.409> anymore

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
you feel that it's not resisting anymore

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.249 
you feel that it's not resisting anymore
and<00:01:36.979> then<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.159> can<00:01:37.729> just<00:01:37.909> take<00:01:38.360> one<00:01:38.630> key<00:01:39.049> after

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
and then you can just take one key after

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.869 
and then you can just take one key after
the<00:01:39.619> next<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:41.149> keyboard<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.879> start

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:43.879 
the next of the keyboard and start

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:47.260 
the next of the keyboard and start
cleaning<00:01:44.360> afterwards<00:01:45.670> now<00:01:46.670> take<00:01:46.879> one<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
cleaning afterwards now take one of the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.059 
cleaning afterwards now take one of the
cotton<00:01:47.569> sticks<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.020> add<00:01:48.259> some<00:01:48.470> silicon<00:01:48.860> spray

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
cotton sticks and add some silicon spray

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.210 
cotton sticks and add some silicon spray
onto<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:50.569> start<00:01:51.140> cleaning<00:01:51.560> behind<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
onto it then start cleaning behind the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.779 
onto it then start cleaning behind the
gaps<00:01:52.459> of<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.759> keys<00:01:54.310> when<00:01:55.310> you're<00:01:55.429> done<00:01:55.580> with

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
gaps of the keys when you're done with

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.460 
gaps of the keys when you're done with
cleaning<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.149> gaps<00:01:56.330> you'll<00:01:56.810> just<00:01:57.020> take<00:01:57.259> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
cleaning the gaps you'll just take the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.449 
cleaning the gaps you'll just take the
clean<00:01:57.920> sheet<00:01:58.780> put<00:01:59.780> again<00:02:00.229> also<00:02:00.800> some<00:02:01.039> silicon

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
clean sheet put again also some silicon

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.760 
clean sheet put again also some silicon
spray<00:02:01.640> onto<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.300> then<00:02:02.599> just<00:02:02.899> before<00:02:03.289> you

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
spray onto it and then just before you
