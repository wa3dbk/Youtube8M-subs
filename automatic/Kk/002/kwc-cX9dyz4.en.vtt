00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
so I'm going to go ahead and double

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.330 
so I'm going to go ahead and double
click<00:05:33.240> horizontal<00:05:33.750> see<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.590> as<00:05:34.979> you<00:05:35.160> can<00:05:35.280> see

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
click horizontal see and as you can see

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.450 
click horizontal see and as you can see
it's<00:05:36.090> got<00:05:36.389> the<00:05:36.419> red<00:05:36.720> flag<00:05:37.020> there<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.680> actually

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
it's got the red flag there and actually

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.279 
it's got the red flag there and actually
if<00:05:38.520> i<00:05:38.610> zoom<00:05:38.880> in<00:05:39.090> it's<00:05:39.660> a<00:05:39.720> little<00:05:39.870> bit<00:05:39.960> easier<00:05:40.229> to

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
if i zoom in it's a little bit easier to

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.310 
if i zoom in it's a little bit easier to
see<00:05:40.410> so<00:05:41.270> it's<00:05:42.270> already<00:05:42.419> got<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.810> red<00:05:42.960> flag

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
see so it's already got the red flag

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.740 
see so it's already got the red flag
field<00:05:44.010> on<00:05:44.220> here<00:05:44.639> another<00:05:45.330> question<00:05:45.720> that

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
field on here another question that

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.920 
field on here another question that
we've<00:05:46.020> gotten<00:05:46.380> is<00:05:46.770> how<00:05:47.370> can<00:05:47.580> I<00:05:47.639> print<00:05:48.090> my<00:05:48.389> strip

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
we've gotten is how can I print my strip

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.240 
we've gotten is how can I print my strip
board<00:05:49.139> without<00:05:49.470> showing<00:05:49.860> those<00:05:50.010> red<00:05:50.220> flags

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
board without showing those red flags

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.390 
board without showing those red flags
well<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.210> easiest<00:05:51.479> way<00:05:51.599> to<00:05:51.690> do<00:05:51.960> that<00:05:52.169> is<00:05:52.409> to

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
well the easiest way to do that is to

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.800 
well the easiest way to do that is to
select<00:05:53.909> your<00:05:55.430> layout<00:05:56.430> so<00:05:57.300> you<00:05:57.389> can<00:05:57.539> take<00:05:57.720> your

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
select your layout so you can take your

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.689 
select your layout so you can take your
layout<00:05:58.169> I'm<00:05:58.560> gonna<00:05:58.770> take<00:05:58.919> horizontal<00:05:59.430> see<00:05:59.580> and

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
layout I'm gonna take horizontal see and

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.450 
layout I'm gonna take horizontal see and
I'm<00:05:59.789> gonna<00:05:59.880> duplicate<00:06:00.510> it<00:06:00.800> I'm<00:06:01.800> gonna<00:06:02.099> call<00:06:02.250> it

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
I'm gonna duplicate it I'm gonna call it

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.629 
I'm gonna duplicate it I'm gonna call it
horizontal<00:06:03.449> see<00:06:07.190> no<00:06:08.190> red<00:06:08.909> flag<00:06:10.039> click<00:06:11.039> OK<00:06:11.400> and

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
horizontal see no red flag click OK and

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.640 
horizontal see no red flag click OK and
you're<00:06:12.090> in<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.300> design<00:06:12.630> window<00:06:12.900> here<00:06:13.380> I'm

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
you're in the design window here I'm

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.399 
you're in the design window here I'm
gonna<00:06:14.550> select<00:06:14.849> the<00:06:15.000> red<00:06:15.150> flag<00:06:15.419> field<00:06:15.780> and<00:06:16.229> just

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
gonna select the red flag field and just

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.080 
gonna select the red flag field and just
delete<00:06:16.740> it

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
delete it

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.279 
delete it
I'm<00:06:18.090> gonna<00:06:18.240> go<00:06:18.330> ahead<00:06:18.419> and<00:06:18.539> save<00:06:18.840> that<00:06:19.020> and

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
I'm gonna go ahead and save that and

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.830 
I'm gonna go ahead and save that and
that<00:06:19.919> way<00:06:20.539> when<00:06:21.539> I<00:06:21.570> go<00:06:21.750> up<00:06:21.870> to<00:06:21.900> print<00:06:23.659> you<00:06:24.659> can

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
that way when I go up to print you can

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.230 
that way when I go up to print you can
select<00:06:25.050> horizontal<00:06:25.560> sea<00:06:26.099> or<00:06:26.370> horizontal<00:06:27.060> see

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
select horizontal sea or horizontal see

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.680 
select horizontal sea or horizontal see
no<00:06:27.630> red<00:06:27.840> flag<00:06:29.150> so<00:06:30.150> that's<00:06:30.270> a<00:06:30.330> way<00:06:30.419> to<00:06:30.479> get

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
no red flag so that's a way to get

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.629 
no red flag so that's a way to get
around<00:06:30.900> that<00:06:33.080> but<00:06:34.080> also<00:06:34.260> let's<00:06:35.219> say<00:06:35.340> you<00:06:35.400> want

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
around that but also let's say you want

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.730 
around that but also let's say you want
to<00:06:35.700> add<00:06:35.760> the<00:06:36.000> red<00:06:36.120> flag<00:06:36.360> back<00:06:36.630> in<00:06:36.900> so<00:06:37.500> I'll<00:06:37.590> take

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
to add the red flag back in so I'll take

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.500 
to add the red flag back in so I'll take
that<00:06:37.889> horizontal<00:06:38.250> see<00:06:38.639> no<00:06:38.940> red<00:06:39.120> flag

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
that horizontal see no red flag

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.810 
that horizontal see no red flag
or<00:06:39.810> this<00:06:40.290> can<00:06:40.470> be<00:06:40.530> one<00:06:40.800> of<00:06:40.890> your<00:06:41.040> own<00:06:41.190> strip

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
or this can be one of your own strip

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.280 
or this can be one of your own strip
layouts<00:06:42.180> that<00:06:42.480> just<00:06:42.660> doesn't<00:06:42.810> have<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:43.080> red

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
layouts that just doesn't have the red

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.700 
layouts that just doesn't have the red
flag<00:06:43.500> that<00:06:43.530> you<00:06:43.710> want<00:06:43.920> to<00:06:43.980> edit<00:06:44.070> add<00:06:44.370> it<00:06:44.820> to<00:06:45.710> you

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
flag that you want to edit add it to you

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.380 
flag that you want to edit add it to you
can<00:06:46.890> take<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.190> red<00:06:47.340> flag<00:06:47.580> field<00:06:47.880> over<00:06:48.150> here<00:06:48.300> on

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
can take the red flag field over here on

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.460 
can take the red flag field over here on
the<00:06:48.480> left<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:48.960> just<00:06:49.500> drop<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:49.890> in<00:06:50.270> and<00:06:51.470> again

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470
