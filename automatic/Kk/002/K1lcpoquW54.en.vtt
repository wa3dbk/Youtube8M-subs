00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
bit on the outside which i think is a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
bit on the outside which i think is a
great<00:01:51.479> detail<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> bag<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.040> wear<00:01:53.189> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
great detail to the bag when you wear it

great detail to the bag when you wear it
as<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> clutch<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.119> love<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> fact<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> has

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
as a clutch I love the fact that it has

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.319 
as a clutch I love the fact that it has
the<00:01:55.560> rich<00:01:55.860> Burgundy<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> inside<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the rich Burgundy on the inside of the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.649 
the rich Burgundy on the inside of the
bag<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.770> has<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.460> ton<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> room<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.540> the
