 These are some of the formulas adopted by the so-called cities 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.070
 sustainable but the European Union goes further and you no longer have only 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.119
 clean energies and that polluting gases are reduced 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.409
 will also demand green buildings 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.800
 this week the european parliament has approved an initiative that aims to 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 boost in the next decade it becomes difficult is smart those who do not 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 waste energy and that they regulate it automatically according to their 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.150

 living in a completely sustainable building is now possible 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.899
 This is shown by this old brussels palace where 100 people work

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.760

 small pieces of fuel made from forest waste 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.740
 the solar panels on the roof and windows complete the capture of

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.510
