 that is products you have tried over time 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.359

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.250

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.379
 I don't know how to do writers I have 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.440
 always had general problems a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.090
 part of the pimples that when I had cd 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.180
 then in the advance and did not have 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.640
 adolescence with no tears will not 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.160
 I've never had white dots acne 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.100
 under skin especially around here 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.570
 lips this way a thing I hate 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.140
 because they are made to be taken away because 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:10.710
 in the end at least for me it never is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.930
 managed to solve we say in everything 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.960
 however, I have found some products 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.340
 especially lately that really 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.090
 make your skin from behind pussy 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.880
 then my product toc toc toc toc 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.350
 toc of the moment is absolutely this 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.340
 Dead Sea flavored face mask 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.840
 marble from the dead sea 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.000
 oh my goddess i then to the mud of the sea 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 dead is a refreshing mask 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.319
 purifying astringent girls for i 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.909
 pores then it is a love and shop 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.020
 then I took this green gods 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.520
 you can have products ready I 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.670
 made an order some time ago because they were there 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 of the discounts is one and a direction with 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.420
 clay is not a very full mask 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.479
 very rich and has enough action 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.220
 strong what does it mean that super leather 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.200
 mega delicate with the super- medium pear 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.989
 delicate nas advice but girls 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.650
 supermega delicate I mean that if you 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.810
 do so without strength there remains the sign 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.450
 that is precisely those skins that are not there 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.940
 but it should be because otherwise 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.590
 I recommend it to you 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.049
 absolutely recommended for those 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.910
 skins that are to be degreased or otherwise 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.420
 which tend to be fat mixed 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.099
 because then he puts on a light one 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.930
 scrub because inside the 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.079
 microgranules make only one feo read 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.139
 exchange then at the beginning and transparent 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.450
 it remains like this, in short, to keep it 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.230
 super 10 minutes that happens after 10 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.639
 minutes 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.739
 she is completely white 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:50.340
 completely dried to you do 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:55.859
 hard to smile because it dries and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.359
 so yes how can I say it solidifies 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.650
 almost so that it becomes that 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.599
 completely white at the beginning 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.359
 transparent you do not realize it is not 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.709
 completely white and then dolars 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.060
 rinse can do it with water 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.510
 lukewarm comes all the way 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.849
 quietly some people and also 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.459
 I've found things like that 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.980
 when you hold it up it burns a little then 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.530
 pinch the first two or three a little 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.299
 minutes because it acts boys and acts 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.250
 because you realize it later then many 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.349
 people never pretended to use it for 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.329
 that for fear they rinsed immediately 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.190
 away the resistant face because after two 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.930
 minutes that little feeling of 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.940
 burning come away 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.550
 and you and continue the last seven 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.890
 six minutes quietly the scrub has 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.040
 therefore already acted your skin lovingly 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.380
 but then fans in general have it 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.990
 people cheat boys I see a murder 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.890
 splendor when I go to put on makeup 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.870
 after make-up the foundation runs smoothly 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.210
 like oil a video advice given 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.280
 which uses a beautiful fat degreaser 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.470
 moisturizer after I show you 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.290
 and I found one that was mine 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.060
 always preferred by green shop and but 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.650
 I did try it also Easter I have 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.630
 made to do the barbaric of of 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.280
 completely new make the mask e 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.410
 he a very delicate skin more 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.030
 delicate of mine as a cream I stand 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.100
 using the King always this many 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.440
 that I took from a green shop and it's one 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.690
 cream in a little bit of day cream 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.810
 of the little green purple shop though 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.590
 this is definitely my favorite one 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.150
 compared to the others you find with 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.490
 I found the trade because now I don't 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.430
 I buy more Libya exception that is not 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.770
 just as you can see the difference 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.560
 this is where the cream flowers tear to 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.100
 flowers always of green shop and it is 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.320
 in its simplicity nothing really is 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.440
 he spreads a lot even with a mass 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.940
 incredible ease has a scent 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.070
 delicious fresh and above all the skin 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.710
 snow eats it there in the sense that 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.150
 as soon as I put it I found I used it 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.210
 creams that they did with effort to 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.210
 to absorb this the mouth to hair 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.890
 eat because it really hydrates in one 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.930
 incredible average dries 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.490
 quickly because it stretches with 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.680
 very easy and dries quickly 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.930
 you are ready to do immediately after the 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.130
 facial base of the makeup with the 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.410
 foundation etc. etc. 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.880
 without the skin being oily geese 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.280
 absolutely no one tells you that he has 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.169
 then mixed dementia skin 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.880
 recommended also this year in this 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.560
 it doesn't cost much and we are prices here 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.360
 with me it is a thing that costs more and 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.600
 this on the 100 euros I repeat took it in 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.700
 discount 9 euros 8 euros 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.980
 the 8 euros best spent by my vineyard 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.930
 I can say as much as an eye instead 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.710
 for the night I use it the night the 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.190
 eye contour 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.440
 is this here of this here 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.120
 even all the anti age is okay 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.090
 beautiful and nourishing for the eye area 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.130
 it's just as good as rewarding or time 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.010
 also favors the view that months ago from 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.530
 sm nature this company found on 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.180
 their internet site is this that 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.370
 completely natural in origin 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.100
 organic so really good too 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.350
 at the level of in c is and is a beautiful cream 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.660
 beautiful rich for the eye contour makes a 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.820
 little bit of effort to absorb so I did 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.770
 I only go first to sleep if 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.040
 you have trouble getting help bags 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.590
 the hydrated eye contour and therefore 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.120
 also possibly deflate of 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.150
 bag problems I found myself 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.920
 really good with this cream 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.500
 certainly in the jamele I spoke is this 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.960
 god hair is this peeling this 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.970
 scrub of Siena also ensure that 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.160
 you want to coast really very little 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.660
 it is not evil at the level of compositions 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.620
 at least they say I do n't always have it 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.890
 say with certainty let us say for today 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.330
 mine saves nothing heavenly so you do 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.430
 take a screen with this point 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.440
 take some healthy sugar 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:53.210
 home to dry a face oil 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.100
 particular make a nice make a scrub is 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.490
 the veil you do at home there is no need 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:02.180
 to spend 199 duero how much it costs me 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.000
 praised for me it's fresh water with 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.590
 the microgranules, that is, two euros are not 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.590
 so he spends it on me 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:13.700
 absolutely and then I found myself 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:15.890
 also bad with the cream this soul vein 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.960
 be it girls fog this is the includes 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.450
 long ago and still full there is full ea 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.520
 half and half there is still me in half 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.950
 because I used to type three times me 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.590
 I find myself very badly 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.160
 and those there 95 people of origin 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.490
 natural 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.500
 the other 5 percent and pure tar though 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.670
 only 15 percent is fine 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.250
 apart from that it is not 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:40.820
 I know looks at lynx however at least it is 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.740
 made for skins and this war contains 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.660
 for mixed skin tending to fat 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.970
 that is, my skin remains on the surface 

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.330
 does not want the cunning practically e 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.850
 massage propellers though even if you absorb them 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.490
 then anyway I still have people of one 

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.930
 oily patina is absolutely a bit of 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.750

 I hope I have started some advice 

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.430
 however useful some idea of ​​some 

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:15.080
 product to try but that's right
