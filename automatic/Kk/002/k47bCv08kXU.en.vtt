 Hello, my name is Luis Estrada and I am a software developer. In this video I will show you how to convert documents in Microsoft Word format to HTML. Word is a registered trademark of Microsoft and I do not have any affiliation with Microsoft. If you already have a document like this in Word format and you want to display the same information on a web page, there is a simple way to do it, but first let's examine a bit the characteristics of the document. As you can see, we have 2 columns, we have titles, hyperlinks, images that are used as hyperlinks, tables, paragraphs, words in bold, in italics, different font types and colors, diagrams, wordart, etc. I even have a video clip inserted inside the document. Most of the features of a Word document can be replicated in HTML; However, there are some, as in this case, the margins of Word and the use of video files, which may not be replicated successfully. The easiest way to know if your entire document will be successfully converted to a web page is to save the file as HTML. The original document will remain intact and a new copy of the document will be created. Select File, Save As and then select the HTML option; Now open the new file in your browser and you will see the differences. In this case, the 2 columns became one; Bold fonts, in italics, titles remain; Hyperlinks work in the same way. Now, you will also see that the wordart and the diagrams were converted to gif images; the paragraphs remain, the same as the colors of the font and you will see that the table is exactly the same; however, in this case, the video can not be reproduced because it is only an image. Word creates a folder or a folder that includes all the images. If you included an image in the original Word file and then made it smaller, then the original image and the image that was modified is in this folder. For this case you can delete the higher resolution image and in this way the total size of the files that you will have to upload to the server will be smaller. This was Luis Estrada and I just showed you how to create web pages using HTML.
