opposite<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.970> what<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> should

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
opposite of what I think that you should

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.630 
opposite of what I think that you should
do<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.649> other<00:01:53.189> teams<00:01:53.520> have

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
do and what I think other teams have

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060 
do and what I think other teams have
proven<00:01:54.119> has<00:01:54.329> been<00:01:54.540> successful<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.799> wanted

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
proven has been successful but I wanted

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.230 
proven has been successful but I wanted
to<00:01:56.130> throw<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.399> out<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:56.820> guys<00:01:57.000> that's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
to throw that out there guys that's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.730 
to throw that out there guys that's
going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> least<00:01:57.780> important<00:01:58.350> roster

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
going to be the least important roster

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.560 
going to be the least important roster
change<00:01:58.950> here<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.399> least<00:01:59.640> significant<00:02:00.479> I

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
change here the least significant I

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
like it's going to happen so leverage I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.940 
like it's going to happen so leverage I
believe<00:03:11.400> has<00:03:11.970> gotten<00:03:12.390> rid<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.690> leverage<00:03:13.590> proof

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
believe has gotten rid of leverage proof

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.980 
believe has gotten rid of leverage proof
II<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.400> leverage<00:03:15.060> skunk<00:03:15.450> now<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.870> has

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
II and leverage skunk now this has

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.050
