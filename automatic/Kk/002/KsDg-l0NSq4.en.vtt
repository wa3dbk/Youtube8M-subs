 it was the tn 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.259
 since it will include an X like the one in 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.909

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.140
 On the other hand, it will have access to 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.720
 playstation network is to say that the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.580
 own custom firmware for pleasure 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.570
 places from p esp to playstation vita 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.299
 because he will have the support to be able 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.870
 access playstation network but only 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.420

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.860
 playstation vita obviously this only 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.970
