00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
thoughts to that when I would come to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.040 
thoughts to that when I would come to
say<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.610> dad<00:02:36.060> what<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.930> think

closing doors in a way for example of

these<00:02:44.310> kind<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.640> lyrics<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.030> never<00:02:45.360> tell

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
these kind of lyrics I never tell

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.500 
these kind of lyrics I never tell
because<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.680> would<00:02:47.459> be<00:02:47.640> fair<00:02:47.880> for<00:02:47.910> them<00:02:48.209> maybe

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
because it would be fair for them maybe

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.300 
because it would be fair for them maybe
they<00:02:48.660> see<00:02:48.900> absolutely<00:02:49.680> different<00:02:49.950> things

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
they see absolutely different things

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.780 
they see absolutely different things
than<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.670> have<00:02:50.819> intended<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.790> remain

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
than I have intended so so I remain

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:03.900 
than I have intended so so I remain
silent<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.269> that

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.100 

I<00:03:05.310> mean<00:03:06.310> throughout<00:03:07.150> personal<00:03:07.720> research

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
I mean throughout personal research

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.560 
I mean throughout personal research
let's<00:03:08.440> put<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.710> way<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.070> know<00:03:09.190> if<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:10.330> if

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
let's put it this way you know if you if

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.910 
let's put it this way you know if you if
there<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.900> something<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.710> and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
there is something that you like and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.440 
there is something that you like and
you're<00:03:12.010> really<00:03:12.340> touched<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.060> get<00:03:13.270> into

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
you're really touched and you get into

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.660 
you're really touched and you get into
that<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.170> go<00:03:14.350> every<00:03:14.770> time<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.040> go<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.340> step

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
that you go every time you go a step

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.400 
that you go every time you go a step
further<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.180> that's<00:03:16.540> what<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.960> brings<00:03:17.230> you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
further and that's what you brings you

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.380 
further and that's what you brings you
in<00:03:17.590> but<00:03:18.280> it's<00:03:18.430> not<00:03:18.490> really<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.120> need

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
in but it's not really that you need

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.760 
in but it's not really that you need
like<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> circuit<00:03:20.140> background<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.500> somewhere

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
like a circuit background that somewhere

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.430 
like a circuit background that somewhere
say<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.220> had<00:03:21.490> mentors<00:03:22.060> other<00:03:22.450> guys<00:03:22.780> which<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.260> met

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
say I had mentors other guys which I met

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.440 
say I had mentors other guys which I met
at<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.680> record<00:03:23.980> store<00:03:24.100> but<00:03:24.640> not<00:03:24.820> at<00:03:24.940> home<00:03:25.120> you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
at the record store but not at home you

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.310 
at the record store but not at home you
know<00:03:27.420> sometimes<00:03:28.420> people<00:03:28.660> wanted<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.170> believe

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
know sometimes people wanted to believe

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.680 
know sometimes people wanted to believe
that<00:03:29.710> there<00:03:29.890> is<00:03:30.040> some<00:03:30.280> sort<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.790> awakening<00:03:31.480> and

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
that there is some sort of awakening and

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.690 
that there is some sort of awakening and
that<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.020> was<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.410> before<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.280> turned<00:03:33.520> it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
that it was that before and it turned it

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.950 
that it was that before and it turned it
to<00:03:33.730> something<00:03:34.000> that's<00:03:34.270> actually

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
to something that's actually

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.020 
to something that's actually
because<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.740> actually<00:03:35.950> coexisted<00:03:36.820> at<00:03:36.940> all

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
because that actually coexisted at all

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.790 
because that actually coexisted at all
the<00:03:37.210> times<00:03:37.420> around<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.930> group<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:38.290> Berlin<00:03:38.620> where

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
the times around a group in Berlin where

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.100 
the times around a group in Berlin where
it<00:03:38.860> was<00:03:39.010> pretty<00:03:39.220> much<00:03:39.430> like<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:40.180> sound<00:03:40.660> around

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
it was pretty much like the sound around

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.940 
it was pretty much like the sound around
so<00:03:42.030> there<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.210> not<00:03:43.420> something<00:03:43.720> except<00:03:44.110> it<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.920> a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
so there is not something except it is a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.800 
so there is not something except it is a
certain<00:03:45.400> sound<00:03:45.520> of<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.670> place<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.270> know<00:03:46.390> there

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
certain sound of a place you know there

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.450 
certain sound of a place you know there
is<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.960> sound<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.440> club<00:03:47.650> there<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.130> sound

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
is a sound of a club there is a sound

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.100 
is a sound of a club there is a sound
which<00:03:48.640> goes<00:03:48.880> out<00:03:49.090> on<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:49.270> street<00:03:49.600> or<00:03:49.630> at<00:03:49.930> home

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
which goes out on the street or at home

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.200 
which goes out on the street or at home
or<00:03:50.170> something<00:03:50.560> like<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:51.130> it's<00:03:51.670> not<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
or something like that and it's not the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.660 
or something like that and it's not the
same<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.900> different<00:03:53.170> varieties<00:03:53.800> of<00:03:53.830> maybe

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
same it is different varieties of maybe

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:04.300 
same it is different varieties of maybe
the<00:03:55.000> same<00:03:55.240> definition<00:03:55.840> who<00:03:56.320> knows

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.339 

you<00:04:05.310> learn<00:04:05.550> every<00:04:06.180> time<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.450> new<00:04:06.660> thing<00:04:07.080> a<00:04:07.200> new

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
you learn every time a new thing a new

you learn every time a new thing a new
flip<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.920> new<00:04:08.190> trick<00:04:08.550> which<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.360> course<00:04:09.390> you

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
flip a new trick which of course you

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.630 
flip a new trick which of course you
don't<00:04:09.810> tell<00:04:10.170> because<00:04:10.950> these<00:04:11.190> tricks<00:04:11.550> are

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
don't tell because these tricks are

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:21.770 
don't tell because these tricks are
great<00:04:19.639> there<00:04:20.639> is<00:04:20.790> this<00:04:20.970> track<00:04:21.299> which<00:04:21.660> is

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
great there is this track which is

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.300 
great there is this track which is
called<00:04:21.989> front<00:04:22.290> of<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.440> world<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.950> mean<00:04:23.160> like

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
called front of the world I mean like

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.610 
called front of the world I mean like
this<00:04:23.639> was<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.000> one<00:04:24.150> which<00:04:24.510> leads<00:04:24.960> me<00:04:25.169> most

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620
