hi<00:00:01.050> guys<00:00:01.290> I've<00:00:01.800> got<00:00:01.860> never<00:00:02.190> trapped<00:00:02.399> you<00:00:02.550> today

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hi guys I've got never trapped you today

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.059 
hi guys I've got never trapped you today
it's<00:00:03.030> called<00:00:03.240> halo<00:00:03.510> spider-boy<00:00:04.319> hyperlink

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
it's called halo spider-boy hyperlink

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.030 
it's called halo spider-boy hyperlink
this<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.430> absolutely<00:00:05.940> amazing<00:00:06.660> track<00:00:07.140> it's

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
this is absolutely amazing track it's

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.339 
this is absolutely amazing track it's
not<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.429> like<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.420> new<00:00:09.660> track<00:00:09.960> when<00:00:10.200> we

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
not it's like a is a new track when we

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.959 
not it's like a is a new track when we
downloaded<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.130> I'm<00:00:11.429> not<00:00:11.460> too<00:00:11.639> sure<00:00:11.880> how

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
downloaded it so I'm not too sure how

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.879 
downloaded it so I'm not too sure how
many<00:00:12.150> downloads<00:00:12.630> or<00:00:13.139> range<00:00:13.469> that's<00:00:13.679> gone<00:00:13.860> now

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
many downloads or range that's gone now

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.910 
many downloads or range that's gone now
but<00:00:14.299> yet<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.450> was<00:00:15.599> actually<00:00:15.960> run<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.680> when

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
but yet it was actually run you out when

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.429 
but yet it was actually run you out when
I<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.670> eyesore<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.240> downloaded<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.050> yeah

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
I an eyesore and downloaded it so yeah

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.910 
I an eyesore and downloaded it so yeah
I'm<00:00:20.250> gonna<00:00:20.400> jump<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.760> straight<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> looks

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
I'm gonna jump in straight to the looks

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.830 
I'm gonna jump in straight to the looks
what<00:00:22.920> looks<00:00:23.160> absolutely<00:00:23.880> amazing<00:00:24.390> he's<00:00:24.660> made

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
what looks absolutely amazing he's made

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.929 
what looks absolutely amazing he's made
it<00:00:25.019> feel<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.529> real<00:00:25.830> bat<00:00:26.039> build<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.580> sound

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
it feel like a real bat build the sound

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.550 
it feel like a real bat build the sound
around<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.660> absolute<00:00:27.810> amazing<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.470> can

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
around you is absolute amazing you can

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.490 
around you is absolute amazing you can
it<00:00:28.710> shoot<00:00:28.980> them<00:00:29.630> you<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.779> hear<00:00:30.900> things<00:00:31.230> flying

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it shoot them you can hear things flying

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
it shoot them you can hear things flying
around<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.250> feel<00:00:32.430> real<00:00:32.640> battle<00:00:33.149> it's

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
around you I feel real battle it's

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.900 
around you I feel real battle it's
absolutely<00:00:34.079> amazing<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:35.070> looks<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
absolutely amazing it it looks it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.959 
absolutely amazing it it looks it
visually<00:00:36.450> looks<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:36.930> impressive<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.820> I'm

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
visually looks really impressive so I'm

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.760 
visually looks really impressive so I'm
going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> start<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.690> 5<00:00:39.899> out<00:00:40.110> 5<00:00:40.140> but

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
going to start with a 5 out 5 but

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.779 
going to start with a 5 out 5 but
overall<00:00:41.190> Luxor<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.750> yeah<00:00:42.920> physics<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.129> haven't

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
overall Luxor and yeah physics I haven't

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
overall Luxor and yeah physics I haven't
agreed<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.390> receive<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.870> many<00:00:46.079> physics<00:00:46.500> in

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
agreed to receive that many physics in

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.160 
agreed to receive that many physics in
here<00:00:46.890> there's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> cup<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> parts<00:00:48.420> were<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> lot

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
here there's a cup of parts were a lot

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.139 
here there's a cup of parts were a lot
of<00:00:49.200> physics<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.070> suppose<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
of physics are I suppose you know the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.040 
of physics are I suppose you know the
spaceships<00:00:51.840> going<00:00:52.079> biophysics<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> then

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
spaceships going biophysics and then

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.959 
spaceships going biophysics and then
there's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.170> part<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.920> where<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> lazy<00:00:56.610> or

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
there's a part of here where the lazy or

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.420 
there's a part of here where the lazy or
take<00:00:57.210> down<00:00:57.420> which<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> lot<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.399> with

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
take down which is a lot to do with

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760 
take down which is a lot to do with
physics<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.660> yeah<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.500> some<00:01:01.590> really

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
physics so yeah there are some really

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.189 
physics so yeah there are some really
nice<00:01:01.980> physics<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:03.000> he's<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> really<00:01:04.019> well

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
nice physics in here he's a really well

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.940 
nice physics in here he's a really well
obviously<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> space<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.460> house<00:01:05.850> again<00:01:06.950> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
obviously the space your house again so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.050 
obviously the space your house again so
yeah<00:01:08.159> physics<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.820> you're<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
yeah physics so much you're going to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.740 
yeah physics so much you're going to
give<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> 4<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> 5<00:01:10.460> but<00:01:11.460> idea<00:01:11.880> obviously<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
give a 4 out of 5 but idea obviously is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
give a 4 out of 5 but idea obviously is
an<00:01:12.869> amazing<00:01:13.380> idea<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:14.070> seen<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> hailey

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
an amazing idea I've not seen the hailey

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
an amazing idea I've not seen the hailey
map<00:01:15.000> done<00:01:15.210> before<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.750> he<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.080> done<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.470> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
map done before and he has done this so

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.789 
map done before and he has done this so
while<00:01:16.979> he's<00:01:17.220> gone<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> purple<00:01:18.210> theme

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
while he's gone with the purple theme

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.999 
while he's gone with the purple theme
for<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> idea<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> Covenant<00:01:21.619> which<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
for the idea of the Covenant which is a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.120 
for the idea of the Covenant which is a
pretty<00:01:23.670> calling<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.840> nicely<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
pretty calling it really nicely so the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
pretty calling it really nicely so the
idea<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.610> actually<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.450> good<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.869> I'm

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
idea is actually really good so I'm

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.719 
idea is actually really good so I'm
going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.110> give<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.409> 4<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> 5<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.400> idea

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
going to give a 4 out of 5 to the idea

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.480 
going to give a 4 out of 5 to the idea
but<00:01:30.720> complexity<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> complexity<00:01:32.130> map<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
but complexity the complexity map is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.240 
but complexity the complexity map is
actually<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.840> quite<00:01:34.140> complex<00:01:34.560> based<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
actually is quite complex based on the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.039 
actually is quite complex based on the
looks<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.759> yet<00:01:36.119> took<00:01:36.270> physics<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.780> he<00:01:36.960> has

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
looks and yet took physics that he has

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.850 
looks and yet took physics that he has
going<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> quite<00:01:38.729> complex<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.439> tracks

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
going for it is quite complex the tracks

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.770 
going for it is quite complex the tracks
not<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.280> hard<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> race<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> couple<00:01:42.630> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
not that hard to race as a couple of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.859 
not that hard to race as a couple of
hobbits<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.820> complexity<00:01:45.299> I'm<00:01:45.630> probably

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
hobbits but the complexity I'm probably

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.780 
hobbits but the complexity I'm probably
going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.140> give<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.439> 4<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> 5<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.640> well

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
going to give it a 4 out of 5 as well
