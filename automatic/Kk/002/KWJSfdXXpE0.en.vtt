00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
look at this beautiful 41 millimeter

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.229 
look at this beautiful 41 millimeter
case<00:02:19.830> now<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.069> case<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.640> used<00:02:21.940> throughout

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
case now this case is used throughout

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.320 
case now this case is used throughout
the<00:02:22.840> entire<00:02:23.200> line<00:02:23.620> but<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.099> bezels<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:25.300> a

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
the entire line but the bezels have a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.250 
the entire line but the bezels have a
different<00:02:25.900> color

now<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.860> case<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.430> death<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.909> reading<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.300> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
now the case is a death the reading of a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.149 
now the case is a death the reading of a
hundred<00:02:29.599> meters<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.470> thickness<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
hundred meters and the thickness of the

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.369 
hundred meters and the thickness of the
case<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.580> approximately<00:02:32.360> by<00:02:32.690> approximately

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
case is approximately by approximately

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.039 
case is approximately by approximately
11<00:02:33.799> millimeters<00:02:34.390> go<00:02:35.390> ahead<00:02:35.659> and<00:02:35.810> flip<00:02:35.930> it

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
11 millimeters go ahead and flip it

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.809 
11 millimeters go ahead and flip it
around<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.769> can<00:02:36.890> see<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.280> case<00:02:37.489> back
