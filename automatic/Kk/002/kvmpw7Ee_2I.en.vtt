00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
surprised how small it was when I first

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.919 
surprised how small it was when I first
picked<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> store<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.760> bought<00:00:30.750> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
picked it up at the store I bought it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.850 
picked it up at the store I bought it
for<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.439> 40<00:00:32.430> pounds<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.780> Curry's<00:00:34.410> which<00:00:34.680> is
