have the exact same buttons knobs
sliders<00:02:28.630> jog<00:02:29.110> wheel<00:02:29.350> they<00:02:29.890> work<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.190> exactly

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
sliders jog wheel they work in exactly

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.610 
sliders jog wheel they work in exactly
the<00:02:30.760> same<00:02:30.790> way<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.750> USB<00:02:32.080> up<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.500> your

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
the same way that USB up to your

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.380 
the same way that USB up to your
computer<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:33.790> come<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.210> same

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
computer they come with the same

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.570 
computer they come with the same
software<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.650> only<00:02:35.830> difference<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
software the only difference is that the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.180 
software the only difference is that the
control<00:02:36.970> one<00:02:37.210> hooks<00:02:37.540> up<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.040> uses<00:02:39.040> your

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
control one hooks up and uses your

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.949 
control one hooks up and uses your
computer<00:02:39.670> sound<00:02:39.940> card<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.330> output<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.630> sound

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
computer sound card to output the sound

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.180 
computer sound card to output the sound
so<00:02:41.170> typically<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.680> would<00:02:41.740> just<00:02:41.830> plug<00:02:42.040> an

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
so typically you would just plug an

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.860 
so typically you would just plug an
eighth<00:02:42.310> inch<00:02:42.520> jack<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.060> put<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.660> out<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
eighth inch jack and put that out to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.840 
eighth inch jack and put that out to
your<00:02:43.990> speakers<00:02:44.350> or<00:02:44.500> mixer<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.459> control

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
your speakers or mixer the control

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.240 
your speakers or mixer the control
sticks<00:02:46.060> has<00:02:46.209> an<00:02:46.330> internal<00:02:46.900> sound<00:02:47.170> card<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.770> it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
sticks has an internal sound card and it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.400 
sticks has an internal sound card and it
outputs<00:02:48.370> through<00:02:48.850> balanced<00:02:49.300> XLR<00:02:49.480> outputs

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
outputs through balanced XLR outputs

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.890 
outputs through balanced XLR outputs
it's<00:02:50.980> also<00:02:51.190> got<00:02:51.490> microphone<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.420> headphone

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
it's also got microphone and headphone

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.930 
it's also got microphone and headphone
inputs<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.560> front<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.520> back<00:02:54.730> you've

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
inputs on the front on the back you've

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.030 
inputs on the front on the back you've
got<00:02:54.970> dual<00:02:55.540> line<00:02:55.959> or<00:02:56.170> phono<00:02:56.380> inputs<00:02:56.890> you've

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
got dual line or phono inputs you've

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.010 
got dual line or phono inputs you've
also<00:02:57.190> got<00:02:57.430> record<00:02:57.790> master<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.360> booth<00:02:58.510> RCA

also got record master and booth RCA

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.770 
also got record master and booth RCA
outputs<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.310> really<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.880> only<00:03:01.090> difference

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
outputs so really the only difference

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.449 
outputs so really the only difference
between<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.290> six<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.740> one<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.190> six

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
between the six and the one is the six

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.660 
between the six and the one is the six
