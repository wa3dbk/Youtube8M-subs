00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.649
 a games cruise 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.409
 they analyzed 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.060
 the Chilean spent three days 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.480
 note still for the rise of the iva 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.210
 they agreed 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.679
 Of course, like any company any corner 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.869
 p / p someone may be negotiating to count on the years but on the other hand 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.670
 his 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.000
 Why do you control? 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 What the passenger asked for you does not control what the passenger is wasting time 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.770
 from your cabin 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.979
 if he buys any elective position this year 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.970
 the single-person in the newspaper today he can not take to the cabin 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.250
 only in the ninth on the last night before boarding 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.760
 when I saw that the passenger can not take any 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.990
 This changes the color of your life. 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.440
 She's waiting to start the journey again. 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.190
 he because why what the passenger loses 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.250
 inside the cabin you can not control 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.840
 so maybe 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.390
 that case happened that could acquire currency and happened to have lived 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.630
 inside the cabin and that the company does not have any team Diego 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.660
 for quercus cruises offers a great generation 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.020
 and quality 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.990
 that is the cost benefit of the trip 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.370
 it is virtually unbeatable within 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.370
 in comparison with other modalities via 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.530
 the foundation 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.720
 the amount of service that exists 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.880
 I do here it is estimated that the end consumer only on the track according to the folder 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.920
 some health companies of all 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.310
 has an internationalization process 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.310
 if a person due to rain 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.370
 the royal caribbean here in seven languages 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.650
 all ships everywhere 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.959
 phrases I would give 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.349
 and with one of them already the Spanish paulista and port 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:27.969
 braga 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:28.569
