00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.739
 goal and to do it after him is nothing 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.140
 Do you know how much your concave has ended? 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.950

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.750
 I look here at the bottom lashes 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.420
 Then I'll pass nude pencil on the line. 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.940
 because I think the eye is 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:50.030
 lighter and more open but if you 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.030
 prefer black pencil can also pass 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.380

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.010
 Then I'll move the eyelash mask 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.190
 I'm going to use natura's super mask 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.190
 watercolor 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:17.900
 I really like to add volume to my 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.900
 children I always use volume mask 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.669

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:30.479

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:33.150
