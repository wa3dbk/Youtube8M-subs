00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.000
 good friends this is my first tutorial 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.020
 let's show them how to enter the 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.110
 system of equations in the hp 48 g 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.380
 truth first let's make sure that 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.420
 the calculator is in the correct mode 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.010
 we take here in green we go here in 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.920
 molds 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.830
 we look for the way we want in this 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.830
 case for us it is in 20 degrees 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.739
 and I have the coordinate of rectangular 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.960
 and the first thing would be 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.010
 very come to the green green key 7 that 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.460
 I would be alone 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.340
 we search 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.160
 linear systems of master ok we are going to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.059
 present these three fields the field 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.150
 by x in the field and we will enter the 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.550
 left side of equality 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.920
 in the field see the right side to the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.980
 equality that for me would be these angles 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.530
 this is three factors and the field x we're going 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.330
 to give it that we're going to show the result 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 we go to field to enter the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.210
 equations are presented to us these two 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.740
 equations 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 with these two unknowns with two 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.750
 equations true and I have it here in 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.510
 rectangular mode my real part and my 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.900
 imaginary part denoted by the letter j 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.880
 now as income is a calculator 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.880
 I open parentheses in purple 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.460
 purple and division 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.640
 ah 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.180
 my real income that would be 5 and my 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.500
 imaginary would be 3 but the difference 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.260
 by the letter 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.540
 he separated him when I gave him the coma 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.540
 here it would be in came from key 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.150
 here I give him 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.030
 and it shows me 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.880
 we realize you are in 53 now 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.670
 for those two I'm going to enter this value 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.870
 I open parentheses 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.390
 here my real part is worth 0 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.390
 and my imaginary part is worth 1 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.600
 and it would be for me to be part of a 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.000
 imaginary as it would be in this case 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.420
 now we go to the field the second 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.060
 part of the occasion forgiveness 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.849
 I open parentheses 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.230
 it shows me that I only have one in 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.920
 the real part true the ten 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.740
 average income 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.580
 comma and the imaginary part is worth 0 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.500
 listeners I made my entry to this field 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.250
 again agro parenthesis entered on 6 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.380
 true separate the comma separate with as 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.470
 entered the 9 that would be my imaginary 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.210
 but as we see this negative easily 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.460
 I change this negative with this key 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.430
 of more unless it is above 7 and the 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.490
 8 I click and he changes less you go back 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.460
 electric changes more 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.640
 enter and since we have our system 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.180
 already and ready 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.180
 we verify 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.110
 now when we see between we go out to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.630
 field to give the campito we go to the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.010
 b field we give you to edit enter the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:29.610
 part of the part of equality 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.500
 in this case for me it would be this 3 angle 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.500
 of 0 and this 5 angle of 30 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.750
 as I enter it I open parentheses 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.430
 3 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.430
 it would be my module 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.190
 by the coma 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.530
 and I open my angle here I enter my angle 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.209
 Listener's wish 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.680
 and here he directly changes it to 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.660
 rectangular because I have it in the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 rectangular mode I will give field and 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.210
 remember that one on top of the other in 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.360
 the case of the equalities 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.200
 I open parentheses 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.200
 2005 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.550
 coma 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.810
 angle of 30 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.510
 I give him 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.150
 and he changes me to rectangle 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.060
 I have all this ready I give it to enter and I 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.790
 I go to the field x 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.070
 in the field x where they will show us here 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.040
 the result tells you this criterion is 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.130
 will solve 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.730
 I give it in and easily here I have my 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.040
 equation I have it the mode here in the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.050
 mode 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.050
 rectangular and the result is maintained 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.000
 and my real imaginary and I imagined 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.100
 Now let's do this procedure 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.460
 since I have it here here in this 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.910
 described green and here up here in mm 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.870
 th 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:03.200
 I can easily change it to polar 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.200
 if they realize that I have here my 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.919
 now let's do it with the 50 that is 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.900
 the same procedure the only thing that 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.900
 change is that to enter the angles 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.569
 and to the same procedure 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.169
 and we change it from 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.100
 let's edit we enter 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.879
 now parentheses 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.940
 I open parentheses 6 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.560
 9 - 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.689
 I give it to enter I go to the field to 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.889
 enter equality 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:39.099
 equality or parentheses placed 3 in 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.949
 this case only placed angle 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:47.179
 directly north place the comma of 0 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:49.899
 I give him enter and he went down the same euro 

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:49.899
 parenthesis 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.000
 of 30 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.050
 listeners 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.069
 it's something back 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:05.229
 and field x I give you solution only the 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:07.440
 seer school here I have my 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:07.440
 results 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.800
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:20.280
 comment any doubt warn and 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.280
 we will respond
