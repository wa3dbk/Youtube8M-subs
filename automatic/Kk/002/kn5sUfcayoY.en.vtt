00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
mold it was moving things on a little

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.900 
mold it was moving things on a little
bit<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.809> people's<00:00:16.139> tastes<00:00:16.740> had<00:00:16.890> changed<00:00:16.920> well

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
bit and people's tastes had changed well

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
this one to say it lay on f-4s team

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:39.650 
this one to say it lay on f-4s team
prove<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.539> point<00:00:21.779> even<00:00:22.199> more

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.000 

I<00:00:41.239> love<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> boot<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> lay<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.410> st

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I love the boot in the say it lay on st

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
I love the boot in the say it lay on st
it<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> little<00:00:44.670> party<00:00:45.120> trick<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.750> floor

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it has a little party trick the floor

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.450 
it has a little party trick the floor
lies<00:00:46.290> flat<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.830> this<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.220> you<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
lies flat like this but if you need to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
lies flat like this but if you need to
increase<00:00:47.790> an<00:00:48.059> extra<00:00:48.330> bit<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.480> space<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
increase an extra bit of space but you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.240 
increase an extra bit of space but you
don't<00:00:49.170> want<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> let<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> seats<00:00:49.739> down<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
don't want to let the seats down you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.540 
don't want to let the seats down you
simply<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:51.680> put<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> floor<00:00:53.040> down<00:00:53.070> little

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
simply just put the floor down little

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
simply just put the floor down little
bit<00:00:53.640> deeper<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> little<00:00:54.690> bit<00:00:54.780> more

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
bit deeper you get a little bit more

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.180 
bit deeper you get a little bit more
room<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.470> very<00:00:55.620> unsophisticated

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
room it's a very unsophisticated

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
room it's a very unsophisticated
solution<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> very<00:00:57.989> common<00:00:58.260> problem

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
solution but it's a very common problem

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:12.010 
solution but it's a very common problem
and<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.280> how<00:00:59.460> they've<00:00:59.610> implemented

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.880 

everything<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> interior<00:01:13.440> of<00:01:13.590> this

this<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> pretty<00:01:21.360> essential<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.170> going
