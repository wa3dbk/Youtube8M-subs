 lentils what you have here in the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.690
 pot and we're going to hit it with the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.770
 silicone 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.640
 Once we have already pasted it, we will 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.190
 to cover it to cover it I more or less 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.970
 I make an idea with the rubber eva I always 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.610
 I usually do everything to the eye, so it was marked 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.680
 a little bit and cut it out and now the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.880
 corrals, we're going to stay like that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.500
 little by little and we can do it to do it 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.770
 from here the ones above and the ones below 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.780
 circle because also local camos with the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.940
 help from a toothpick 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.220
 and so we do not stay 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.430
 marked but does not get dirty neither from boli ni 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.170
 nothing and we also stick the stick of 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.240
 skewer moruno what I have done has been 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 cut it because it was too long 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.070
 we can make it from the measure 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.840
 what do you want and how do you see that right here 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.890
 It has a hole for good is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.050
 great to put it in and I'll hit it 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.450
 and the stick was also radio but what 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.160
 line and now after you no longer have the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.370
 hole well with the help of a 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.790
 you can do it very well screwdriver 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.120
 tight and the cec 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.230
 I'm going to cover it and now I go back once 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.230
 that we have lined 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.069
 on all sides we will cover the 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.620
 stick to make the stick I cut 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.860
 a rectangular piece of rubber eva also 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.810
 and we're going to hit it, let's go rolling 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.420
 little by little and we're hitting it with 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.970
 silicone and we already cover the stick 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.780
 Well, since I have covered it as you see 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.080
 where it all ends up behind 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.750
 so that it does not look good and now we're going to 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.520
 decorate to decorate the first thing I go 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.900
 to do is to do a little lacito 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.670
 which is super easy and super cute 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.549
 what we have to do is cut back a 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.140
 small square of the size that we want in 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.700
 tie if you want it bigger by the 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.069
 you make bigger what is smaller 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.110
 Well, a little more kid and a strip 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.870
 elongated it is worth that you can do it 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.109
 same color but I to change as is 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.549
 the same rose as the rattle 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:30.909
 to highlight a little bit and what 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.909
 we're going to do is fold it like this 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.650
 and does 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.079
 is that with one hand I manage a little 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.269
 bad but good but I can not wait to look 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.430
 now we put the strip is by the 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.980
 medium and we paste it here behind and already 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.030
 we have the tie ready as you have seen 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.400
 super easy very fast and very cute I have 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.470
 in a loop and now what I said 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.500
 before this back here that we have left 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.849
 we'll cut it in what we're going to do in 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.340
 the template of the hello kitty 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.099
 cut it out and we're going to move it to rubber eva 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.069
 with the help of a stick we will copy it 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.590
 here I have it ready and what I have 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.650
 It has also been painted the edge 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.260

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.230
 finite black marker and here also you 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.510

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.160
 paste everything to the rattle and now I teach it 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.880
 and it has been 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.950
 rattle finished look as you see has 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.990

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.810
