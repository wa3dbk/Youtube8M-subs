 all categories are going to have days 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.579
 with the marathon modality that is the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.850
 marathon modality what was implemented 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.790
 this year but it was only for motorcycles and 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.979
 Four-wheelers make a journey 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.019
 to the camp and between their own 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.439
 pilots have to help each other and can not 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.799
 receive assistance from any mechanic or 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.020
 from anyone oblivious to the competition for 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.180
 be fixing the car the motorcycle 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.700
 quadricycle change wheels axles 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.400
 any problem they have does not have 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.740
 a gram of external assistance have it 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.720
 what to do themselves or what can 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.310
 help other pilots 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.090
 and always all the time in the dakar 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.160
 because today he tried tomorrow morning 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.110
 well nobody clark in the middle of 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.520
 desert without a drop of water during 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.190
 breath days makes the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.220
 competition or much harder but 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.400
 much more difficult of certain is that in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.030
 principle there would be three stages in the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.690
 Argentina 6 in Chile with the 3 days of 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.240
 breaks alternates 24 in bolivia for a 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.270
 edition that promises to be as we say 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.510
 hard and very interesting because 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.960
 returns after 25 years proposed to do 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.720
 part of the rally dakar with a monster to 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.170
 the head like the Spaniard Carlos Sainz 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.380
 who goes from the mini and again returns 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.110
 to the French brand the truth is that the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.380
 Lacquer 2015 is already underway only 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.150
 we have to wait until next week for the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.280
 different governments confirm which 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.280
 will be the routes and stages
