this<00:00:10.920> episode<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> be

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
this episode I'm just going to be

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.970 
this episode I'm just going to be
introducing<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> program<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.740> works

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
introducing the program and how it works

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.220 
introducing the program and how it works
from<00:00:14.280> other<00:00:14.580> programs<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.120> need<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.420> get

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
from other programs that you need to get

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.480 
from other programs that you need to get
the<00:00:16.350> full<00:00:16.529> use<00:00:16.800> out<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:19.220> first<00:00:20.220> off

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the full use out of it first off

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.390 
the full use out of it first off
basically<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.910> guess<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.330> introduced<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
basically I guess I just introduced it

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.450 
basically I guess I just introduced it
its<00:00:23.400> program<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.029> allows<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:25.460> export

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
its program that allows you to export

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.210 
its program that allows you to export
your<00:00:26.609> minecraft<00:00:27.180> worlds<00:00:27.660> into<00:00:28.050> dot<00:00:28.349> obj<00:00:28.920> files

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
your minecraft worlds into dot obj files

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.490 
your minecraft worlds into dot obj files
which<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.550> opening<00:00:29.910> bull<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.210> 3d<00:00:31.199> editing

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
which are opening bull in 3d editing

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
which are opening bull in 3d editing
programs<00:00:32.070> such<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.430> blender<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.450> we're

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
programs such as blender which we're

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.299 
programs such as blender which we're
going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.840> using<00:00:33.989> today<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.500> cinema<00:00:35.070> 4d

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

here something I've made and also you're
going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> need<00:01:16.409> blender<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.490> well<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:18.450> if

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
going to need blender as well down if

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.080 
going to need blender as well down if
you<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.470> blend<00:01:19.680> already<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> have

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you do have blend already and you have

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.969 
you do have blend already and you have
an<00:01:21.180> old<00:01:21.299> version<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.900> recommend<00:01:22.380> updating<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
an old version I recommend updating it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.020 
an old version I recommend updating it
to<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> newer<00:01:23.280> version<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> just

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to the newer version because it just

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.730 
to the newer version because it just
works<00:01:24.869> better<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.450> with<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> obj<00:01:28.500> files

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
works better with the with the obj files

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.640 
works better with the with the obj files
of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.970> program<00:01:30.329> produces<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.470> just

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650

um rajd open jamesy figure I've already
done<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> few<00:01:49.970> basically<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> program<00:01:51.390> looks

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
done a few basically the program looks

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920 
done a few basically the program looks
like<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:54.119> need<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
like this you need to do what you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.340 
like this you need to do what you
downloaded<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> need<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.570> open<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:58.049> if

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
downloaded it you need to open with if

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.620 
downloaded it you need to open with if
I've<00:01:58.920> got<00:01:59.189> a<00:02:00.860> extraction<00:02:01.860> program<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.270> if

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
I've got a extraction program here so if

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.170 
I've got a extraction program here so if
it<00:02:03.960> does<00:02:04.140> come<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:04.920> not

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
it does come up with that and it's not

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.210 
it does come up with that and it's not
executable<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.509> Java<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.799> open<00:02:08.069> with

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
executable in Java I just do open with

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.980 
executable in Java I just do open with
Java<00:02:08.670> platform

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.960 

this<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.110> basically<00:02:14.800> will<00:02:15.800> look<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:16.160> first

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
this is basically will look like first

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.590 
this is basically will look like first
off<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.720> can<00:02:18.050> choose<00:02:18.350> your<00:02:18.470> saves<00:02:18.710> here<00:02:19.600> in

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
off you can choose your saves here in

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.510 
off you can choose your saves here in
the<00:02:21.020> next<00:02:21.170> episode<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.500> making<00:02:21.950> new<00:02:22.130> save<00:02:22.370> and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
the next episode of making new save and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.190 
the next episode of making new save and
then<00:02:22.580> we'll<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:22.820> using<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.650> then<00:02:24.650> also

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
then we'll be using that and then also

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:35.650 
then we'll be using that and then also
blender<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:34.250> that's<00:02:34.430> what<00:02:35.180> blender<00:02:35.480> should

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
blender and that's what blender should

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.760 
blender and that's what blender should
look<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.140> newest<00:02:36.380> version<00:02:37.390> okay<00:02:38.390> so
