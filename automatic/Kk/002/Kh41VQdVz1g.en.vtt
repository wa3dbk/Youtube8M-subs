00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
during a six foot drop there is a bit of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.630 
glare coming from the screen protector
and<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.689> fact<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.079> got<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.380> pay<00:01:49.470> $15<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and the fact you got to pay $15 for a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.980 
and the fact you got to pay $15 for a
headphone<00:01:50.970> jack<00:01:51.030> extension<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.899> your

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
headphone jack extension if your

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.289 
headphone jack extension if your
headphones<00:01:52.350> don't<00:01:52.560> fit<00:01:52.799> into<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.820> hole<00:01:54.149> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
headphones don't fit into the hole in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.090 
headphones don't fit into the hole in
the<00:01:54.450> bottom<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> catalyst<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.829> take<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the bottom of the catalyst so you take a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.060 
the bottom of the catalyst so you take a
$65<00:01:56.790> case<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.270> add<00:01:57.390> $15<00:01:58.049> that's<00:01:58.229> an<00:01:58.320> $80<00:01:58.770> case

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
$65 case you add $15 that's an $80 case

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.649 
$65 case you add $15 that's an $80 case
so<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.119> include<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.540> those

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
so if you have to include all those

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.850 
so if you have to include all those
things<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.079> not<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.680> much

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
things that's really not that much

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.929 
things that's really not that much
cheaper<00:02:02.310> sorry

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
cheaper sorry

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.209 
cheaper sorry
also<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> headphone<00:02:04.229> jack<00:02:04.259> extension<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.040> not

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
also the headphone jack extension is not

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.950 
also the headphone jack extension is not
waterproof<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.360> we're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.719> take<00:02:06.869> the

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
hole I don't think is big enough so the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.100 
hole I don't think is big enough so the
edges<00:05:46.520> of<00:05:46.700> your<00:05:46.730> flash<00:05:47.150> photos<00:05:47.540> are<00:05:47.750> going<00:05:48.020> to

edges of your flash photos are going to

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.290 
edges of your flash photos are going to
be<00:05:48.260> slightly<00:05:48.590> discolored<00:05:49.190> in<00:05:49.520> terms<00:05:49.940> of<00:05:50.120> the

to<00:05:51.830> deal<00:05:52.130> with<00:05:52.250> but<00:05:52.370> you<00:05:52.490> guys<00:05:52.610> preferred<00:05:53.000> the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120

to deal with but you guys preferred the
catalyst<00:05:53.480> over<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.780> free<00:05:54.050> during<00:05:54.320> one<00:05:54.530> of<00:05:54.560> our

catalyst over the free during one of our
Facebook<00:05:55.160> polls<00:05:55.370> so<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.210> guess<00:05:56.420> the<00:05:56.540> score<00:05:56.750> is

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
Facebook polls so I guess the score is
