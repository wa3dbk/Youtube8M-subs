00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
transmission around here might be

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.470 
transmission around here might be
difficult<00:00:55.340> it's<00:00:55.430> probably<00:00:55.790> better<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.030> get<00:00:56.329> an

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
difficult it's probably better to get an

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.479 
difficult it's probably better to get an

automatic car 4x4 not really necessary
maybe<00:01:02.739> rows<00:01:03.739> are<00:01:04.100> paved

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
maybe rows are paved

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.020

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
probably ironically the smoothest in the
