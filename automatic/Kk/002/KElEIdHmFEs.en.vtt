00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.020

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.690
 weather and a little weather special 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.189
 on the subject of ground frost and air frustrates the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.400
 there will be widespread in the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.509
 coming clear night in germany in 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.950
 the past days and weeks have 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.690
 the hardware stores and garden centers the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.430
 summer flowers presented rausgehauen the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.930
 people are bought to the everything is beautiful 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.340
 everything is warm so nothing can be more 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.410
 happen and now it happened 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.789
 behind a cold front is polar air 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 you can tell that you have flown into germany 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.970
 their morning hours is still daytime 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.010
 pretty fresh actually apart 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.240
 of it when the sun stood and the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.279
 then come the night to Wednesday the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.420
 becomes clear in Germany and Germany 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.520
 accordingly it can too 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.050
 accordingly next to it spread 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.380
 ground frost or partially air out 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 give 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.620
 I've prepared my card there 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.329
 you can see the areas the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.680
 colored in blue are those in the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.270
 next night with ground frost too 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.010
 The only exceptions are the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.050
 immediate coastal areas if before 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.480
 especially the wind from the water towards the country 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.070
 blows the immediate inner cities and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 even if the man has summer flowers on 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.760
 balcony has somehow first second third 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680
 floor can not necessarily be much 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.460
 happen 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.079
 usually the plants are in 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.760
 on the ground and there just came 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.690
 soil frost damage to the plants 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.040
 cause 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.930
 especially affected are next to it 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.570
 begonia fuchsia geranium petunia 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350
 everything you actually want 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.549
 is frost sensitive then can 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 take damage in the coming night 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.299
 or partially come in and there are 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.590
 also on the map sees the areas 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.900
 they are dyed even slightly purple 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.299
 Air frost warts and air freezes occurs 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.619
 especially on it completely at night 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.270
 the stars to see so are no 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.009
 Clouds are in the sky and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.479
 accordingly also tal were like 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.400
 for example, the judgment behind me 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.140
 there the cold air collects on the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.729
 mountain hanging and then flows because 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.530
 heavier is so slow down in the valley 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.180
 Run the night and gather in the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.159
 valley and accordingly I was there 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.060
 this area is particularly at risk 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.340
 air blow 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.500
 in particular the areas just be of 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 the eifel then over sauerland 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.369
 spread then direction hessen too 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.100
 direction bavaria nordbayern bavarian 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.140
 forest alpenrand and accordingly 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.520
 The plants can also do the damage 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.450
 But there are plants that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.310
 can not protect themselves 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.020
 or just stand around outside 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.700
 and they can not be frustrated 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.200
 are the fruit trees and I am standing now 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.939
 just up in Germany in the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.829
 flowering does not do much 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.380
 the stage is usually high enough though 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.209
 Air France makes you see what's going on there 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.310
 I'll be there soon or later 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.700
 even more detail on what to do 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.050
 plant these with this woman 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.459
 how do you deal with it and what could? 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.690
 happen or how could you as 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.690
 Fruit growers protect these plants
