00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.589
 if one day you will see me old if you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.059
 dirty when I eat and I can't 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.380
 get dressed, patience, remember time 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.780
 that I spent teaching him 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.770
 if when I talk to you and always repeat 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.200
 the same things do not interrupt or 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.290
 listen to me when you were little I had to 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.680
 tell you the same story every night 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.079
 until you fall asleep when not 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.780
 I want to wash myself in a blame and not 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.120
 make me ashamed remember when i had to 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.060
 short behind inventing a thousand excuses 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.010
 because you didn't want to take a bath 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.090
 when you see my ignorance for the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.630
 new technologies 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.420
 give me time and don't look at me with that 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.810
 ironic smile I had the whole 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.030
 patience to teach you the bike when 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.490
 at some point I can't remember 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.470
 or lose the thread of my speech 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.090
 give me time to remember 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.489
 and if I can't 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.610
 don't worry about what's most important 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.979
 it's not what I say but my need 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.700
 to be caught and have you there 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.920
 listen when my tired legs don't 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.380
 let me keep your pace not 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.530
 treat me as if I were a weight come on 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.390
 towards me with your strong hands in the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.869
 same way I did it with you 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.969
 when he took his first steps 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.999
 when I say that I wish I were not dead 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.340
 get angry one day will understand and what 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:37.039
 pushes me to say try to understand that 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.770
 at my age one does not live, one survives 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.929
 yes above 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.640
 one day you will discover that despite the 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.039
 my mistakes I always wanted the best 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 for you and I tried to smooth it out

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.740
