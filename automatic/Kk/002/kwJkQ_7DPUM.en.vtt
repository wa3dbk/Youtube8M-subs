you know one thing that's really

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
you know one thing that's really
important<00:00:23.760> when<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.970> feel<00:00:24.270> efficient<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.200> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
important when you feel efficient is the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.320 
important when you feel efficient is the
type<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.650> line<00:00:26.040> that<00:00:26.220> you're<00:00:26.400> using<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:27.240> you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
type of line that you're using and you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.910 
type of line that you're using and you
can<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.600> the<00:00:27.720> line<00:00:27.930> that's<00:00:28.200> on<00:00:28.350> this<00:00:28.590> rod

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
can see the line that's on this rod

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.410 
can see the line that's on this rod
right<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> main<00:00:29.610> line<00:00:29.850> is<00:00:29.880> an<00:00:30.150> orange

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
right here the main line is an orange

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.780 
right here the main line is an orange
color<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.800> I've<00:00:31.890> been<00:00:31.920> doing<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.400> using

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
color so what I've been doing is using

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.060 
color so what I've been doing is using
this<00:00:33.120> whole<00:00:33.390> fall<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.440> Suffolk<00:00:34.890> it's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
this whole fall this is the Suffolk it's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.960 
this whole fall this is the Suffolk it's
called<00:00:35.340> siege<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.080> if<00:00:37.080> 6-pound<00:00:37.680> test<00:00:37.800> six<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
called siege and if 6-pound test six and

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.130 
called siege and if 6-pound test six and
eight<00:00:39.059> pound<00:00:39.300> test<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.660> probably<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> most

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
eight pound test is probably the most

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.830 
eight pound test is probably the most
common<00:00:40.650> for<00:00:40.860> most<00:00:41.100> steel<00:00:41.430> headers<00:00:41.699> to<00:00:41.970> use<00:00:42.180> but

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
common for most steel headers to use but

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.390 
common for most steel headers to use but
this<00:00:42.989> particular<00:00:43.199> one<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> bright<00:00:44.010> orange

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
this particular one is a bright orange

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.790 
this particular one is a bright orange
color<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:45.510> ideal<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.470> when

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
color and that's ideal because when

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.260 
color and that's ideal because when
you've<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.070> lots<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.460> lines<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.120> have

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you've got lots of lines like we have

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.549 
you've got lots of lines like we have
today<00:00:48.449> it's<00:00:48.809> nice<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.199> know<00:00:49.320> where<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
today it's nice to know where the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
today it's nice to know where the
anglers<00:00:49.949> are<00:00:50.100> casting<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.699> people<00:00:50.970> can<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.300> my

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
anglers are casting so people can see my

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.750 
anglers are casting so people can see my
line<00:00:51.690> also<00:00:51.930> when<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.290> fighting<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.710> fish<00:00:52.979> if

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
line also when I'm fighting a fish if

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.100 
line also when I'm fighting a fish if
it's<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.239> around<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.540> rock<00:00:54.720> I<00:00:54.750> can

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it's going to go around a rock I can

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.990 
it's going to go around a rock I can
guide<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.010> having<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> bright<00:00:56.640> line<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
guide it so having that bright line is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.030 
guide it so having that bright line is
important<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.479> only<00:00:57.570> problem<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.199> fish<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
important the only problem is fish can

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.490 
important the only problem is fish can
see<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.460> bright<00:00:59.699> line<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.629> most<00:01:01.019> anglers

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
see that bright line so most anglers

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.079 
see that bright line so most anglers
will<00:01:01.830> be<00:01:01.949> using<00:01:02.339> some<00:01:02.550> kind<00:01:02.729> of<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.909> leader

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
will be using some kind of a leader

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.119 
will be using some kind of a leader
material<00:01:03.330> what<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:03.809> holding<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.589> this

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
material what I'm holding up here this

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.600 
material what I'm holding up here this
is<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> suffix<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.720> 6-pound<00:01:07.320> test

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
is the suffix and it's 6-pound test

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.100 
is the suffix and it's 6-pound test
fluorocarbon<00:01:08.610> leader<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.750> literally

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
fluorocarbon leader which is literally

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.520 
fluorocarbon leader which is literally
clear<00:01:10.710> invisible<00:01:11.430> underwater<00:01:12.350> some<00:01:13.350> guys

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
clear invisible underwater some guys

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.770 
clear invisible underwater some guys
you're<00:01:13.740> using<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.250> pound<00:01:14.580> some<00:01:15.240> guys<00:01:15.450> six

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
you're using for pound some guys six

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020 
you're using for pound some guys six
some<00:01:16.020> guys<00:01:16.229> eight<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> idea<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> using

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
some guys eight I like the idea of using

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.310 
some guys eight I like the idea of using
six<00:01:18.540> pound<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.740> strong<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.320> it's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
six pound because it's strong and it's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:37.590 
six pound because it's strong and it's
still<00:01:22.530> invisible<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> fish

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.260 

in<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.720> boat<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.259> last<00:01:39.470> two<00:01:39.740> hours<00:01:39.799> I'd<00:01:40.520> say<00:01:40.850> 80%

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
in a boat the last two hours I'd say 80%

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.200 
in a boat the last two hours I'd say 80%
of<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.290> fishermen<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.159> worked<00:01:43.400> on<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
of the fishermen that worked on the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.640 
of the fishermen that worked on the
tributary<00:01:44.780> here<00:01:44.990> cleared<00:01:45.380> out

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
tributary here cleared out

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.020 
tributary here cleared out
look<00:01:45.770> at<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.040> before<00:01:46.369> there<00:01:46.700> was<00:01:46.790> about<00:01:46.970> a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
look at this before there was about a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.560 
look at this before there was about a
hundred<00:01:47.119> 150<00:01:48.020> guys<00:01:48.790> now<00:01:49.790> because<00:01:50.119> it's<00:01:50.299> midday

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
hundred 150 guys now because it's midday

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.590 
hundred 150 guys now because it's midday
and<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.170> bite<00:01:51.830> on<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.430> spawn<00:01:52.850> sack<00:01:53.180> slowed

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
and the bite on the spawn sack slowed

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.320 
and the bite on the spawn sack slowed
down<00:01:53.869> I<00:01:54.200> thought<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:54.890> would<00:01:55.130> try<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:56.060> white

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
down I thought I would try just a white

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.609 
down I thought I would try just a white
little<00:01:57.140> jig<00:01:57.470> it's<00:01:57.649> actually<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.070> fly<00:01:58.399> jig<00:01:58.759> and

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
little jig it's actually a fly jig and

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.920 
little jig it's actually a fly jig and
this<00:02:00.619> was<00:02:00.799> my<00:02:00.950> second<00:02:01.399> cast<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.750> hooked

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
this was my second cast and I hooked

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.690 
this was my second cast and I hooked
this<00:02:03.049> beautiful<00:02:03.530> rainbow<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:04.039> I<00:02:04.100> hope<00:02:04.490> is

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.800 
I'm using are pretty small just give me
an<00:04:09.340> example<00:04:09.430> here<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.270> one<00:04:10.390> that<00:04:10.540> I've<00:04:10.600> got

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
an example here so the one that I've got

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.210 
an example here so the one that I've got
on<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.080> actually<00:04:11.230> one<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.740> bigger<00:04:11.920> ones

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
on is actually one of the bigger ones

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.880 
on is actually one of the bigger ones
but<00:04:12.970> let<00:04:13.120> me<00:04:13.210> show<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:13.480> how<00:04:13.960> I<00:04:13.990> sew<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.740> on

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
but let me show you how I sew it on

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.650 
but let me show you how I sew it on
because<00:04:15.550> I<00:04:15.730> don't<00:04:15.790> put<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.239> hook<00:04:16.450> right

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
because I don't put the hook right

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.690 
because I don't put the hook right
through<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.900> center<00:04:17.020> of<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.410> spawn<00:04:17.709> sack<00:04:18.040> the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
through the center of the spawn sack the

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.610 
through the center of the spawn sack the
hook<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:19.060> very<00:04:19.330> small<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:20.020> can<00:04:20.410> see<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.560> just

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
hook is very small you can see I just

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.400 
hook is very small you can see I just
have<00:04:20.920> it<00:04:21.040> pinned<00:04:21.250> by<00:04:21.450> one<00:04:22.450> little<00:04:22.690> spot<00:04:22.990> what<00:04:23.380> I

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
have it pinned by one little spot what I

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.860 
have it pinned by one little spot what I
do<00:04:23.530> is<00:04:23.710> just<00:04:23.740> sew<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.340> outside<00:04:24.760> edge<00:04:25.000> maybe

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
do is just sew the outside edge maybe

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.890 
do is just sew the outside edge maybe
two<00:04:26.230> or<00:04:26.380> three<00:04:26.410> times<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.330> hook<00:04:28.480> is<00:04:28.630> on<00:04:28.660> the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
two or three times so the hook is on the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.140 
two or three times so the hook is on the
outside<00:04:29.260> just<00:04:29.590> like<00:04:29.770> that<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.730> want<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.000> make

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
outside just like that you want to make

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.380 
outside just like that you want to make
sure<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.690> your<00:04:32.110> closest<00:04:32.710> split<00:04:33.190> shot<00:04:33.550> is<00:04:33.820> at

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
sure that your closest split shot is at

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.560 
sure that your closest split shot is at
least<00:04:34.630> up<00:04:34.870> about<00:04:35.200> 12<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.800> 14<00:04:36.280> inches<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:37.360> that's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
least up about 12 to 14 inches so that's

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.930 
least up about 12 to 14 inches so that's
probably<00:04:37.840> about<00:04:37.930> 16<00:04:38.500> inches<00:04:38.670> because<00:04:39.670> there's

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
probably about 16 inches because there's

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.520 
probably about 16 inches because there's
a<00:04:40.030> lot<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.300> rocks<00:04:40.540> here<00:04:40.750> on<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.960> bottom<00:04:41.320> so

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
a lot of rocks here on the bottom so

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.690 
a lot of rocks here on the bottom so
what<00:04:41.680> I'm<00:04:41.740> going<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.920> do<00:04:42.010> with<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.220> split<00:04:42.490> shot

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
what I'm going to do with the split shot

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.340 
what I'm going to do with the split shot
is<00:04:42.880> make<00:04:43.060> sure<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.360> they're<00:04:43.600> spaced<00:04:44.050> out

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
is make sure that they're spaced out

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.050 
is make sure that they're spaced out
pretty<00:04:44.950> evenly<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.640> you<00:04:45.700> can<00:04:45.880> see<00:04:45.970> that

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
pretty evenly and you can see that

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.670 
pretty evenly and you can see that
they're<00:04:46.210> not<00:04:46.240> pinched<00:04:46.690> on<00:04:46.780> too<00:04:47.020> strong<00:04:47.080> they

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
they're not pinched on too strong they

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.260 
they're not pinched on too strong they
can<00:04:47.830> actually<00:04:48.160> slide<00:04:48.370> up<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:48.730> down<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:49.060> line

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
can actually slide up and down the line

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.360 
can actually slide up and down the line
so<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.020> lead<00:04:50.320> I'm<00:04:50.470> using<00:04:50.710> here<00:04:50.980> because<00:04:51.250> of

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
so the lead I'm using here because of

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.300 
so the lead I'm using here because of
the<00:04:51.460> current<00:04:51.850> is<00:04:52.300> about<00:04:52.630> four<00:04:53.020> feet<00:04:53.350> so<00:04:54.220> I'm

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
the current is about four feet so I'm

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.190 
the current is about four feet so I'm
going<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.490> go<00:04:54.640> back<00:04:54.820> up<00:04:55.030> in<00:04:55.180> this<00:04:55.270> run<00:04:55.600> because

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
going to go back up in this run because

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.230 
going to go back up in this run because
it<00:04:56.350> looks<00:04:56.530> like<00:04:56.620> really<00:04:56.770> good<00:04:57.250> now<00:04:57.940> one<00:04:58.120> thing

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
it looks like really good now one thing

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.820 
it looks like really good now one thing
about<00:04:58.360> reading<00:04:58.780> water<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.260> see<00:04:59.470> here<00:04:59.710> we've

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
about reading water you see here we've

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.640 
about reading water you see here we've
got<00:04:59.920> all<00:04:59.980> these<00:05:00.280> big<00:05:00.550> boulders<00:05:01.380> every<00:05:02.380> time

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
got all these big boulders every time

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.890 
got all these big boulders every time
there's<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.130> slick<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.730> water<00:05:04.000> in<00:05:04.390> between<00:05:04.780> the

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
there's a slick of water in between the

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.630 
there's a slick of water in between the
boulders<00:05:05.110> that's<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.680> potential<00:05:06.040> of<00:05:06.220> holding

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
boulders that's the potential of holding

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.610 
boulders that's the potential of holding
place<00:05:06.880> for<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.210> truck<00:05:07.510> so<00:05:08.020> I'm<00:05:08.110> going<00:05:08.260> to<00:05:08.320> go<00:05:08.440> up

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
place for a truck so I'm going to go up

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.590 
place for a truck so I'm going to go up
just<00:05:08.650> above<00:05:09.070> this<00:05:09.250> logjam<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.970> just<00:05:10.150> watch<00:05:10.330> then

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
just above this logjam I just watch then

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.970 
just above this logjam I just watch then
I<00:05:10.720> switch<00:05:10.990> there<00:05:11.230> so<00:05:11.410> let's<00:05:11.590> see<00:05:11.710> if<00:05:11.800> there's

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
I switch there so let's see if there's

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.550 
I switch there so let's see if there's
another<00:05:12.160> one<00:05:12.370> there
