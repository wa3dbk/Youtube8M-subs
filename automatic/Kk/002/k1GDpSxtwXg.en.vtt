00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
in the pitcher I'm gonna muddle them I'm

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
in the pitcher I'm gonna muddle them I'm
just<00:01:08.130> gonna<00:01:08.220> break<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.150> mint<00:01:09.330> leaves<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.149 
just gonna break up the mint leaves to
create<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.260> really<00:01:10.590> intense<00:01:11.520> minty<00:01:12.000> flavor

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
create that really intense minty flavor

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.530 
create that really intense minty flavor
then<00:01:14.159> I'm<00:01:14.250> gonna<00:01:14.369> add<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.549> simple<00:01:15.060> syrup<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
then I'm gonna add some simple syrup and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.690 
then I'm gonna add some simple syrup and
simple<00:01:15.990> syrup<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.320> essentially<00:01:16.860> sugar<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
simple syrup is essentially sugar that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.730 
simple syrup is essentially sugar that
has<00:01:17.729> been<00:01:18.240> rendered<00:01:18.810> into<00:01:19.140> liquid<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
has been rendered into liquid so it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
has been rendered into liquid so it
makes<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.369> easy<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.909> mix<00:01:21.720> into

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
makes it really easy to mix into

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.080 
makes it really easy to mix into
cocktails<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.909> as

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
cocktails so I really like this as

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.600 
cocktails so I really like this as
opposed<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.540> trying<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> mix<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> know

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
opposed to trying to mix in but you know

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
opposed to trying to mix in but you know
regular<00:01:26.850> sugar<00:01:27.240> next<00:01:28.200> ingredient<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
regular sugar next ingredient is the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
regular sugar next ingredient is the
brew<00:01:29.009> tea<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.490> my<00:01:29.610> already<00:01:29.820> Ruchi<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.479> going
