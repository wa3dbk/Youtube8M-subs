00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
damage their own hair with heat so their

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.490 
damage their own hair with heat so their
protective<00:01:03.030> start<00:01:03.359> may<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.140> something

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
protective start may be in something

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
protective start may be in something
like<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> weave<00:01:04.949> or<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> wig<00:01:05.489> whereby<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.060> can

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
like a weave or a wig whereby they can

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.640 
like a weave or a wig whereby they can
have<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.600> star<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:06.960> desire<00:01:07.350> without

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
have the star they desire without

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.890 
have the star they desire without
damaging<00:01:08.640> their<00:01:08.820> own<00:01:09.000> hair<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.659> are<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
damaging their own hair so there are so

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
damaging their own hair so there are so
many<00:01:10.020> reasons<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.950> most<00:01:11.159> part<00:01:11.430> if

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
many reasons but for the most part if

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
many reasons but for the most part if
not<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.909> styling<00:01:12.299> reasons<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:13.200> done<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
not for styling reasons it's done to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.550 
not for styling reasons it's done to
help<00:01:14.250> look<00:01:14.490> after<00:01:14.729> your<00:01:15.119> hair<00:01:15.299> however<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
help look after your hair however and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.380 
help look after your hair however and
this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.799> why<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.729> contradictory

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this is why I think it's contradictory

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.929 
this is why I think it's contradictory
when<00:01:18.840> your<00:01:18.960> protective<00:01:19.380> styling<00:01:19.729> it's<00:01:20.729> not

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
when your protective styling it's not

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.490 
when your protective styling it's not
always<00:01:21.180> easy<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> look<00:01:21.840> after<00:01:21.990> your<00:01:22.259> hair

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
always easy to look after your hair

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.289 
always easy to look after your hair
right<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.460> you're<00:01:23.580> wearing<00:01:23.909> braids

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
right because if you're wearing braids

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.880 
right because if you're wearing braids
it<00:01:24.540> may<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.960> easy<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.350> access<00:01:25.710> your

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it may not be easy to access your

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.249 
it may not be easy to access your
strands<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.700> moisturize<00:01:27.180> them<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
strands and and moisturize them with a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350 
strands and and moisturize them with a
Sonnen<00:01:28.829> weave<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.310> example<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> may<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.270> be

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
Sonnen weave for example you may not be

I've<00:02:21.270> invested<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.140> two<00:02:22.410> different<00:02:22.800> types<00:02:23.010> of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
I've invested in two different types of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.750 
I've invested in two different types of
bottles

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
bottles

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.120 
bottles
the<00:02:24.420> first<00:02:24.690> bottle<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> dropper<00:02:25.890> bottle

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
the first bottle is a dropper bottle

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.340 
the first bottle is a dropper bottle
which<00:02:26.610> allows<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.330> feed<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.870> access<00:02:28.200> your

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
which allows you to feed and access your

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.340 
which allows you to feed and access your
scalp<00:02:28.710> using<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.730> pipette<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.200> guys

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
scalp using a pipette and as you guys

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.490 
scalp using a pipette and as you guys
can<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.860> pipette<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.370> tall<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.180> thin<00:02:33.900> so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
can see the pipette is tall and thin so

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.800 
can see the pipette is tall and thin so
it<00:02:34.650> should<00:02:34.950> allow<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.790> through<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
it should allow you to get through to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.210 
it should allow you to get through to
your<00:02:36.900> scalp<00:02:37.260> even<00:02:37.590> if<00:02:37.710> you're<00:02:37.830> wearing<00:02:38.010> a
