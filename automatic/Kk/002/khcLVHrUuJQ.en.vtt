00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 the Brazilian market for products and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 services for 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.849
 grows every year 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.650
 the so-called pet business that offers 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 basic items like medicines rations 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.420

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.789
 in spas 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.840
 this year the sector should close the year with 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.750
 a movement of 6 billion reais 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.050
 in the waiting room the little china 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.599
 Enjoy yourself very quietly on the owner's lap 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 electric does not stop quiet and he fell in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.290
 on the leg and we'll send him 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.000
 for here and the people by the x-ray to realize that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.500
 he had broken his paw 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.559
 I had no doubt brought it here because I 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.539
 I know I better not even think 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.039
 money or anything you need this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.469
 would march 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.050
 today is a day of joy for the poodle 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.750
 micro toy will take the splint and return to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.030
 normally but only after a 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.030
 small and necessary suffering 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.549
 the care with the pets 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.830
 go far beyond walking hygiene and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.530
 two servings of feed per day 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.680
 the nine year old rottweiler 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.840
 urinary and locomotion problems 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.130
 although the intimidating pot is an example 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.720
 pampered dog 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 It's getting old, it gets worse. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 this health even have to take care is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.110
 treated equal a duty 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.430
 some clinics even treat animals 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.229
 abandoned 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.840
 This pregnant little dog was referred 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.700
 to the veterinary center she has not yet 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.340
 earned a name but already has health 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.240
 monitored in equipment of the highest 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.310
 technology 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.909
 we use another veterinary catheter 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 early diagnosis of gestation and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.680
 to assess fetal viability 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.450
 It is to see the structures right to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.579
 classification amount of liquid at 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.159
 future mom, the little puppies will 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.540
 waiting for adoption the devices are 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.690
 identical to those used in beings 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.740
 years only treatment that adapted to dogs 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.930
 and cats 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.510
 this is one of the first meals of the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.700
 premature cub of persian cat 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.070
 he would have little chance of surviving 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.080
 without the care of veterinarians and 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.240
 warmth of the incubator 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.220
 there are even apartments for 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.920
 accommodate the owners while they wait 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.160
 recovery of the animals as well as a 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.710
 oratory for the most difficult moments 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.720
 the demand for all these services is so 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.630
 which caused the emergence of the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.400
 called pet business business 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.459
 involving animals should make a profit 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.580
 this year about 6 billion 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.720
 an increase of 17% in relation to 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.660
 2006 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.550
 various treatments and thousands of 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.310
 specialized products 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.320
 here the expense is very high with things with 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.459
 things needed and things 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.410
 superfluous 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.570
 so there are people who have a 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.180
 clothes closet for the dog from 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.610
 pajamas down to a little dress 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.920
 even a raincoat has still 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.050
 that client who still comes and does 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.900
 basic is to pass a veterinarian a 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.410
 once a year to make swimming vaccines 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.400
 care treadmill with 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.450
 nails and even pizza to stick on the 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.730
 fur 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.090
 at the end of the aesthetic session a bath of 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.070
 Hot tub with relaxing massage 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.170
 The expansion of the market reflects a 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.600
 change in the relations between humans and 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.850
 pets have owner who wants 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.070
 remember the animals forever 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.130
 This is the case of Jessica who has several 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.680
 tattoos with canine motives across the body 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.709
 in one of them the name of the two of nausea and 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.330
 of a hot dance when you set out to 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.180
 having a pet has to take good care of 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.470
 it's no use having to keep regulating 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.790
 have to take good care of themselves. 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.580
 to be a living being 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.260
 they are companions and she is just so the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.040
 love 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.650
 conditional they understand 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.420
 to strip the hand anyway and you 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.420
 It's all for her, it's not for me.
