now that sounds all quite interesting
but<00:04:09.300> earlier<00:04:09.660> today<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.440> guys<00:04:10.650> were<00:04:10.890> looking

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
but earlier today the guys were looking

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.740 
but earlier today the guys were looking
at<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.280> performance<00:04:11.519> parameters<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.660> the

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
speed here there was a problem the train

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.749 
speed here there was a problem the train
wasn't<00:04:31.870> getting<00:04:32.199> up<00:04:32.319> to<00:04:32.469> full<00:04:32.650> speed<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.340> they

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
wasn't getting up to full speed and they

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.999 
wasn't getting up to full speed and they
notice<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.389> on<00:04:34.569> the<00:04:34.689> test<00:04:34.930> train<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.500> said

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
notice this on the test train and said

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.279 
notice this on the test train and said
that<00:04:36.159> there's<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.400> problem<00:04:36.550> happening<00:04:37.180> here<00:04:37.509> we

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
that there's a problem happening here we

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.839 
that there's a problem happening here we
then<00:04:38.500> looked<00:04:38.710> at<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:38.979> trace<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.550> the

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
then looked at the trace of the

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.179 
then looked at the trace of the
temperature<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:40.840> see<00:04:41.169> here<00:04:41.409> the<00:04:41.560> igbt

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
temperature and you see here the igbt

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.640 
temperature and you see here the igbt
temperature<00:04:42.759> rises<00:04:43.629> as<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.870> Train<00:04:44.169> picks<00:04:44.469> up

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
temperature rises as the Train picks up

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.999 
temperature rises as the Train picks up
speed<00:04:45.030> Rises<00:04:46.030> at<00:04:46.180> rain<00:04:46.389> picks<00:04:46.689> up<00:04:46.870> speed<00:04:47.020> does

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
speed Rises at rain picks up speed does

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.149 
speed Rises at rain picks up speed does
nothing<00:04:48.539> there's<00:04:49.539> the<00:04:49.719> problem<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.889> during

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
nothing there's the problem so during

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.189 
nothing there's the problem so during
the<00:04:51.400> lunch<00:04:51.610> time<00:04:51.939> they<00:04:52.479> talk<00:04:52.539> to<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.050> guy

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
the lunch time they talk to the guy

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.200 
the lunch time they talk to the guy
who's<00:04:53.409> on<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.770> test<00:04:54.039> train<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.580> had<00:04:54.969> a<00:04:55.000> look

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
who's on the test train and had a look

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.879 
who's on the test train and had a look
to<00:04:55.389> see<00:04:55.419> what<00:04:55.750> was<00:04:55.900> actually<00:04:56.080> happening<00:04:56.319> and

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
to see what was actually happening and

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.490 
to see what was actually happening and
what<00:04:57.310> they<00:04:57.490> found<00:04:57.729> was<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.270> igbt<00:04:58.990> system

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
what they found was that the igbt system

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.429 
what they found was that the igbt system
had<00:04:59.949> a<00:04:59.979> problem<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.639> our<00:05:01.330> gate<00:05:01.750> dr<00:05:02.080> said

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:02.439 
had a problem and our gate dr said

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.260 
had a problem and our gate dr said
there's<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:02.860> problem<00:05:03.159> with<00:05:03.430> this<00:05:03.580> circuit<00:05:04.090> and

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
there's a problem with this circuit and

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.360 
there's a problem with this circuit and
in<00:05:04.389> order<00:05:04.539> to<00:05:04.719> protect<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.289> circuit<00:05:05.710> switched

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
in order to protect the circuit switched

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.700 
in order to protect the circuit switched
it<00:05:06.610> out<00:05:06.729> so<00:05:07.330> only<00:05:07.509> one<00:05:07.810> locomotive<00:05:08.259> was

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
it out so only one locomotive was

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.769 
it out so only one locomotive was
running<00:05:09.099> they<00:05:09.849> were<00:05:09.909> able<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.419> look<00:05:10.509> at<00:05:10.659> the

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:10.779 
running they were able to look at the

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:13.050 
running they were able to look at the
system<00:05:10.990> from<00:05:11.469> here<00:05:11.860> check<00:05:12.550> out<00:05:12.729> what<00:05:12.909> was

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
system from here check out what was

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.820 
system from here check out what was
actually<00:05:13.240> going<00:05:13.449> and<00:05:14.020> they<00:05:14.439> found<00:05:14.740> that

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
actually going and they found that

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.159 
actually going and they found that
there's<00:05:15.039> actually<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.580> problem<00:05:16.300> in<00:05:16.509> the<00:05:16.870> fiber

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
there's actually a problem in the fiber

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.399 
there's actually a problem in the fiber

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.200 
afternoon you can see checking out what
the<00:05:35.620> problem<00:05:35.770> was<00:05:36.129> during<00:05:36.580> lunch<00:05:36.759> time<00:05:37.029> the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
the problem was during lunch time the

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.180 
the problem was during lunch time the
train<00:05:37.449> is<00:05:37.569> static<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.139> then<00:05:38.650> here<00:05:38.889> we<00:05:38.919> go

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
train is static and then here we go

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.570 
train is static and then here we go
again<00:05:39.339> off<00:05:39.759> the<00:05:40.240> train<00:05:40.479> goes<00:05:40.810> and<00:05:41.139> now<00:05:41.800> the

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
again off the train goes and now the

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.430 
again off the train goes and now the
temperatures<00:05:43.029> rising<00:05:43.300> as<00:05:43.629> normal<00:05:44.080> the

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
temperatures rising as normal the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.800 
temperatures rising as normal the
trainings<00:05:44.919> operating<00:05:45.460> as<00:05:45.610> normal<00:05:45.639> if<00:05:46.180> this

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
trainings operating as normal if this

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.990 
trainings operating as normal if this
still<00:05:47.110> had<00:05:47.319> the<00:05:47.500> old<00:05:47.650> gto<00:05:48.069> system<00:05:48.610> in<00:05:48.729> there

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
still had the old gto system in there

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.360 
still had the old gto system in there
this<00:05:49.569> would<00:05:49.750> have<00:05:49.839> blown<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.229> system<00:05:50.650> with<00:05:51.339> a

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
this would have blown the system with a

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.700 
this would have blown the system with a
mantis<00:05:51.789> power<00:05:52.089> in<00:05:52.270> site<00:05:52.509> monitoring<00:05:52.990> built

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
mantis power in site monitoring built

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.550 
mantis power in site monitoring built
into<00:05:54.009> EMES<00:05:54.520> Lusa<00:05:54.909> gate<00:05:55.089> system<00:05:55.389> you<00:05:56.020> got<00:05:56.199> real

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
into EMES Lusa gate system you got real

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.589 
into EMES Lusa gate system you got real
time<00:05:56.830> monitoring<00:05:57.279> real<00:05:58.060> time<00:05:58.360> observation

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
time monitoring real time observation

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.140 
time monitoring real time observation
and<00:05:59.259> real-time<00:05:59.800> prognostics<00:06:00.789> of<00:06:00.939> what's

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
and real-time prognostics of what's

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.510 
and real-time prognostics of what's
happening<00:06:01.479> in<00:06:01.569> the<00:06:01.689> system<00:06:02.080> we<00:06:03.039> think<00:06:03.310> for

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
happening in the system we think for

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.399 
happening in the system we think for
once<00:06:03.849> our<00:06:04.150> customers<00:06:04.659> doing<00:06:04.900> what<00:06:05.050> we<00:06:05.169> asked

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
once our customers doing what we asked

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.230 
once our customers doing what we asked
them<00:06:05.469> to<00:06:05.620> do<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:06.009> maybe<00:06:06.490> they<00:06:06.759> believe<00:06:07.060> that

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
them to do and maybe they believe that

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.850 
them to do and maybe they believe that
what<00:06:07.389> we<00:06:07.539> were<00:06:07.659> offering<00:06:07.990> them<00:06:08.169> was<00:06:08.529> what<00:06:08.710> they

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
what we were offering them was what they

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.800 
what we were offering them was what they
wanted<00:06:09.009> us<00:06:09.310> to<00:06:09.490> do<00:06:09.639> I<00:06:09.879> hope<00:06:10.629> that's

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
wanted us to do I hope that's

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.339 
wanted us to do I hope that's
interesting<00:06:11.349> for<00:06:11.560> you<00:06:11.620> thank<00:06:11.889> you<00:06:11.979> very<00:06:12.129> much
