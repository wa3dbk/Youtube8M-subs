snake<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.720> other<00:03:03.840> side<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.410> push

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
snake on the other side and you push

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.280 
snake on the other side and you push
this<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.370> goes<00:03:05.520> fly<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.110> went

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
this and it goes fly in and it went

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.950 
this and it goes fly in and it went
pretty<00:03:07.590> far<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.580> yeah<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.450> i<00:03:09.510> think<00:03:09.780> this

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
pretty far so yeah and i think this

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.200 
pretty far so yeah and i think this
glows<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.530> dark<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.430> camera<00:03:11.850> sort<00:03:12.120> of

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
glows in the dark the camera sort of

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.920 
glows in the dark the camera sort of
shows<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.660> little<00:03:12.780> better<00:03:12.960> but<00:03:13.290> i<00:03:14.780> think<00:03:15.780> it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
shows it a little better but i think it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.240 
shows it a little better but i think it
might<00:03:16.080> blow<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.560> dark<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:16.890> don't<00:03:17.070> know<00:03:17.130> it

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
might blow in the dark I don't know it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.290 
might blow in the dark I don't know it
doesn't<00:03:17.550> say<00:03:17.700> anything<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.870> might<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:20.610> I

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
doesn't say anything but it might so I
