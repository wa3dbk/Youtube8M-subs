element right here and then over here
you<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.539> moon<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.350> only

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
you have the moon and that not only

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
you have the moon and that not only
shows<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.100> how<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.879> moon<00:00:48.329> basically<00:00:48.930> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
shows you how the moon basically is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.720 
shows you how the moon basically is
positioned<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.920> comparison<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> earth

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
positioned in comparison to the earth

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
positioned in comparison to the earth
and<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> Sun<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:51.809> also<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.079> moon

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and the Sun but there's also a moon

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
and the Sun but there's also a moon
phase<00:00:52.800> indicator<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.760> right<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.120> that's<00:00:54.660> just

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
phase indicator so right now that's just

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
phase indicator so right now that's just
a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.170> sliver<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.640> mostly

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
a little sliver on there but it's mostly

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
a little sliver on there but it's mostly
a<00:00:57.030> full<00:00:57.329> moon<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.780> addition<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> also

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
a full moon in addition to that it also

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.529 
a full moon in addition to that it also
has<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> time<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.820> there's<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> hour<00:01:00.180> hand<00:01:00.420> in

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
has a time so there's the hour hand in

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.380 
has a time so there's the hour hand in
the<00:01:00.600> minute<00:01:00.809> hand<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.699> GMT<00:01:02.699> hand<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the minute hand and a GMT hand and this

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.939 
the minute hand and a GMT hand and this
is<00:01:03.510> also<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.809> good<00:01:03.960> travelers<00:01:04.470> watch<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
is also a good travelers watch and you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
is also a good travelers watch and you
see<00:01:05.070> these<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.369> pushers<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> side<00:01:06.390> that's

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
see these two pushers on the side that's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.980 
see these two pushers on the side that's
for<00:01:07.110> adjusting<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.560> time<00:01:08.180> forward<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:10.610> back

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
for adjusting the time forward and back

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.600 
for adjusting the time forward and back
so<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> get<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> good<00:01:13.500> idea<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.159> sort<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> how<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so to get a good idea of sort of how the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.340 
so to get a good idea of sort of how the
launch<00:01:14.880> works<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.630> sort<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> an<00:01:16.020> adjust

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
launch works I'm just sort of an adjust

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.690 
launch works I'm just sort of an adjust
the<00:01:16.470> time<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.100> everything<00:01:17.490> moves

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the time you can see everything moves

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.789 
the time you can see everything moves
now<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> remember<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.619> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
now we're going to remember this is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
now we're going to remember this is
going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.009> tell<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> time<00:01:20.670> well<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:21.780> time

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
going to tell you the time well two time

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.749 
going to tell you the time well two time
zones<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> position<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> Sun

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
zones and then the position of the Sun

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.090 
zones and then the position of the Sun
and<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:25.229> moon<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:26.340> comparison<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:29.430> earth

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
and the moon in comparison to the earth

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.520 
and the moon in comparison to the earth
okay<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:32.640> as<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> time<00:01:33.180> moves

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
okay so you see how as the time moves

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.609 
okay so you see how as the time moves
the<00:01:34.530> moon<00:01:34.799> moves<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.720> Sun<00:01:36.990> moves<00:01:37.290> now

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the moon moves and the Sun moves now

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.410 
the moon moves and the Sun moves now
what's<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:38.070> happening<00:01:38.460> obviously<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
what's really happening obviously in the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.210 
what's really happening obviously in the
real<00:01:39.600> solar<00:01:39.960> system<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> earth<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.009> moving

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
real solar system is the earth is moving

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.010 
real solar system is the earth is moving
but<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.150> presents<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.630> sort<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> an

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
but this one presents you sort of an

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.069 
but this one presents you sort of an
earth<00:01:43.200> centric<00:01:43.799> viewpoint<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.079> really

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
earth centric viewpoint and really

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.600 
earth centric viewpoint and really
really<00:01:46.200> cool<00:01:46.439> because<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:47.009> looking<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
really cool because it's looking at a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.480 
really cool because it's looking at a
top-down<00:01:48.240> view<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> earth<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.799> North

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
top-down view of the earth so North

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.210 
top-down view of the earth so North
America<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.180> over<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.229> example<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
America is over here for example and you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.870 
America is over here for example and you
can<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.560> certain<00:01:55.979> time<00:01:56.189> when<00:01:56.700> it's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
can see that at a certain time when it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.569 
can see that at a certain time when it's
sort<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.630> daylight<00:01:58.049> hours<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> Sun

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
sort of the daylight hours then the Sun

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
sort of the daylight hours then the Sun
