00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350 
break-in time required and the only real
discomfort<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.159> had<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.909> very<00:01:48.119> very

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
discomfort that I had that was very very

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
discomfort that I had that was very very
minor<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:49.320> due<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> tying<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> laces<00:01:50.369> too

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
minor was due to tying the laces too

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.280 
minor was due to tying the laces too
tight<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> forefoot<00:01:51.540> area<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> shoe

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
tight in the forefoot area of the shoe

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499 
tight in the forefoot area of the shoe
and<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.220> an<00:01:53.369> easy<00:01:53.490> fix<00:01:53.850> by<00:01:54.090> simply

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and this was just an easy fix by simply

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
and this was just an easy fix by simply
loosening<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.110> laces<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.740> bit<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
loosening the laces a little bit and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
loosening the laces a little bit and
that<00:01:56.460> minor<00:01:56.759> foot<00:01:57.119> cramping<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> had<00:01:57.990> went

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that minor foot cramping that I had went

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.520 
that minor foot cramping that I had went
away<00:01:58.710> pretty<00:01:58.799> much

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
away pretty much

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.530 
away pretty much
due<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.190> tighter<00:02:01.430> fit<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.030> forefoot

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
due to the tighter fit in the forefoot

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.930 
due to the tighter fit in the forefoot
and<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.170> upper<00:02:03.440> materials<00:02:04.010> being<00:02:04.250> not<00:02:04.610> so

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
and the upper materials being not so

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.390 
and the upper materials being not so
flexible<00:02:05.240> or<00:02:05.810> stretchable<00:02:06.470> it's<00:02:06.950> probably

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
flexible or stretchable it's probably

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.010 
flexible or stretchable it's probably
not<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.790> best<00:02:07.820> choice<00:02:08.240> for<00:02:08.270> people<00:02:08.750> who<00:02:08.869> have

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
not the best choice for people who have

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.440 
not the best choice for people who have
excessively<00:02:09.590> wide<00:02:09.860> feet<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.729> again<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.270> you

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
excessively wide feet so again if you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.880 
excessively wide feet so again if you
have<00:02:11.480> wide<00:02:11.870> feet<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.290> probably<00:02:12.620> best<00:02:12.770> to

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
have wide feet it's probably best to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.650 
have wide feet it's probably best to
stay<00:02:12.980> away<00:02:13.220> but<00:02:13.850> for<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.090> most<00:02:14.240> part<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.569> think

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
stay away but for the most part I think

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.570 
stay away but for the most part I think
the<00:02:14.840> nitrocharge<00:02:15.170> 1.0<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.040> one<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.489> those

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
the nitrocharge 1.0 is one of those

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.520 
the nitrocharge 1.0 is one of those
shoes<00:02:16.850> that's<00:02:17.300> gonna<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.630> suitable<00:02:18.020> for<00:02:18.080> a

us<00:02:23.900> for<00:02:24.140> review<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:25.010> fit<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.280> length<00:02:25.520> was

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
us for review and the fit in length was

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.640 
us for review and the fit in length was
absolutely<00:02:26.630> perfect<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.319> you<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.500> looking

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
absolutely perfect so if you are looking

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.410 
absolutely perfect so if you are looking
to<00:02:27.830> order<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.160> pair<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.459> these<00:02:28.640> for<00:02:28.700> yourself<00:02:29.239> I

to order a pair of these for yourself I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420 
to order a pair of these for yourself I
would<00:02:29.870> strongly<00:02:30.230> recommend<00:02:30.380> going<00:02:31.010> true<00:02:31.310> to

would strongly recommend going true to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.540 
would strongly recommend going true to
size<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.510> best<00:02:32.750> possible<00:02:33.320> fit<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.950> terms

of ball feel I have mixed feelings the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.710 
of ball feel I have mixed feelings the

as other shoes that are going to be in

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.969 
as other shoes that are going to be in
this<00:05:27.300> particular<00:05:27.840> weight<00:05:28.080> range<00:05:28.350> but<00:05:28.890> that's

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
this particular weight range but that's

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.770 
this particular weight range but that's
really<00:05:29.310> how<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.460> go<00:05:29.760> about<00:05:29.790> recommending<00:05:30.600> this

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
really how I go about recommending this

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.840 
really how I go about recommending this
if<00:05:31.200> everything<00:05:31.590> sounds<00:05:31.950> good<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.430> then

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
if everything sounds good to you then

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.190 
if everything sounds good to you then
definitely<00:05:33.360> take<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.570> look<00:05:33.810> at<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
definitely take a look at the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.830 
definitely take a look at the
nitrocharge<00:05:34.560> 1.0<00:05:35.310> it's<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.729> great<00:05:35.970> boot<00:05:36.270> but<00:05:36.750> if

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
nitrocharge 1.0 it's a great boot but if

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.420 
nitrocharge 1.0 it's a great boot but if
you<00:05:36.900> don't<00:05:37.110> like<00:05:37.260> what<00:05:37.440> you<00:05:37.530> hear<00:05:37.800> or<00:05:38.040> what<00:05:38.250> you

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
you don't like what you hear or what you

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.790 
you don't like what you hear or what you
see<00:05:38.669> then<00:05:39.150> it's<00:05:39.300> probably<00:05:39.780> best<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.169> stay<00:05:40.470> away

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
see then it's probably best to stay away

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.200 
see then it's probably best to stay away
so<00:05:41.370> it's<00:05:41.490> pretty<00:05:41.580> much<00:05:41.669> it<00:05:41.910> for<00:05:42.060> my<00:05:42.180> review
