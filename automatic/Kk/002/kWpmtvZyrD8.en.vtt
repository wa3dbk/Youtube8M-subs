00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
think that I'm a huge youtuber mean I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.090

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I think I crossed the 20,000 mark the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.420 
I think I crossed the 20,000 mark the
point<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.020> i<00:01:43.500> mean<00:01:43.799> i<00:01:43.829> would<00:01:44.070> say<00:01:44.310> i'm

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
point is that a i mean i would say i'm

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.249 
point is that a i mean i would say i'm
decent<00:01:44.850> sized<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.299> I'm<00:01:45.420> by<00:01:45.600> no<00:01:45.659> means<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
decent sized but I'm by no means a

to accept the luck factor and what I

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.740 
to accept the luck factor and what I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.860 
mean by that is that no matter how
unique<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.349> idea

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
unique the idea

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.990 
unique the idea
that<00:02:14.049> you<00:02:14.140> had<00:02:14.319> no<00:02:14.530> matter<00:02:14.739> how<00:02:15.069> special<00:02:15.640> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
that you had no matter how special the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.390 
that you had no matter how special the
videos<00:02:16.269> that<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.540> make<00:02:16.750> are<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:18.010> have<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
videos that you make are you have to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.009 
videos that you make are you have to
accept<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.150> could<00:02:19.360> make<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.569> best

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
accept that you could make the best

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.240 
accept that you could make the best
video<00:02:20.409> on<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.739> planet<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.150> would<00:02:22.330> still

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
video on the planet and it would still

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.809 
video on the planet and it would still
flop<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.269> reason<00:02:25.629> is<00:02:26.310> unless<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.370> have

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
flop and the reason is unless you have

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.970 
flop and the reason is unless you have
massive<00:02:28.569> backing<00:02:29.049> behind<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.620> what<00:02:29.830> you

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
massive backing behind you what you

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.430 
massive backing behind you what you
won't<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.489> when<00:02:30.760> you're<00:02:30.909> starting<00:02:31.180> out<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
won't have when you're starting out the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.069 
won't have when you're starting out the
fact<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.280> need<00:02:33.459> luck<00:02:33.819> on<00:02:34.120> your<00:02:34.329> side<00:02:34.569> you

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
fact is you need luck on your side you

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.750 
fact is you need luck on your side you
need<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.319> have<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.500> right<00:02:35.799> idea<00:02:35.860> at<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.640> right

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
need to have the right idea at the right

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.390 
need to have the right idea at the right
time<00:02:37.329> for<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.690> right<00:02:37.959> audience<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.680> quite

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
time for the right audience and quite

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.490 
time for the right audience and quite
frankly<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:40.690> really<00:02:41.019> hard<00:02:41.200> for<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.440> to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
frankly it's really hard for have to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.319 
frankly it's really hard for have to
come<00:02:41.680> together<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.579> I<00:02:42.849> saw<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> statistic

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
come together I think I saw a statistic

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.539 
come together I think I saw a statistic
that<00:02:43.720> said<00:02:44.049> like<00:02:44.260> ninety<00:02:44.920> percent<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
that said like ninety percent of the

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.699 
that said like ninety percent of the
youtube<00:02:45.940> views<00:02:46.359> go<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.720> one<00:02:47.079> percent<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
youtube views go to one percent of the

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.800 
youtube views go to one percent of the
channels<00:02:48.129> so<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.030> tells<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.480> kind<00:02:49.690> of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
channels so that tells you the kind of
