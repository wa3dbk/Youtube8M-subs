00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
I don't know it really helps but it's

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.750 
I don't know it really helps but it's
kind<00:00:26.470> of<00:00:26.529> cool<00:00:26.740> that<00:00:26.770> you<00:00:26.980> can<00:00:27.100> actually<00:00:27.279> drive

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
kind of cool that you can actually drive

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.720 
kind of cool that you can actually drive
up<00:00:27.940> here<00:00:28.650> spot<00:00:29.650> on<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:29.830> south<00:00:30.070> side<00:00:30.340> you<00:00:30.580> can

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
up here spot on the south side you can

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:39.300 
up here spot on the south side you can
go<00:00:30.850> up<00:00:30.940> these<00:00:31.119> hills<00:00:31.359> here

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:51.050 

I<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:41.440> right<00:00:41.560> here

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:01:03.880 

first

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.670 

and<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.100> climb<00:01:05.309> along<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.820> whole

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
and you can climb along this whole

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:24.420 
and you can climb along this whole
mountainside

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.370 

so<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.060> think<00:01:25.150> it's<00:01:25.300> mostly<00:01:25.660> fun<00:01:25.990> for<00:01:26.260> people

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
so I think it's mostly fun for people

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:37.160 
so I think it's mostly fun for people
who<00:01:26.710> just<00:01:26.920> like<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.100> mess<00:01:27.370> around

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.920 

but<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.159> kind<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.400> fun<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.600> don't<00:01:39.689> know

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
but it's kind of fun like I don't know

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.780 
but it's kind of fun like I don't know
if<00:01:40.080> any<00:01:40.200> work<00:01:40.439> everyone<00:01:40.770> knows<00:01:40.950> about<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
if any work everyone knows about this I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.280 
if any work everyone knows about this I
don't<00:01:42.360> actually<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.810> how<00:01:42.900> functional

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
don't actually don't know how functional

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.289 
don't actually don't know how functional
