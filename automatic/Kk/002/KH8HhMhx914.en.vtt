00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 even if you are with the basic 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.069
 components of redstone technology already 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.020
 you can do a lot 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.970
 combination of elements still some 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.040
 other useful circuits the man 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.929
 definitely should know number one 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.429
 The tea flip flop pushes you 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 usually a button 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.180
 For example, this lamp only for one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.220
 few seconds gets and goes afterwards 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.050
 again, however, I press this 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.300
 button the lamp goes on for the first time 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 and it stays that way until I die 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.260
 Press the button the second time 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.119
 is that the repeater behind the button 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.859
 exactly 2 ticks is extended there 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 otherwise the timing is no longer correct 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.730
 you need a low-level flight, among other things 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.620
 if my karts things about a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.420
 activate detectors permanently 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.070
 The circuit is also practical 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.870
 When I have the lighting of my house 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.950
 from different places on and off 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.420
 want to turn off 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 I just have to have more for that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 redstone cable would like to lead the blog 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 you extend the signal of a button 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.370
 about one door longer to leave open 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.170
 You can either longer and longer 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.449
 expectant repeater chains use or 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.399
 just a tip from farmers 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.050
 and enjoin this with any number 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.000
 delays a second time to control 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.799
 you can transport to the top 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.780
 redstone signals on the one hand by such 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.100
 helical staircases save space 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.790
 but also with inverted redstone 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.140
 shilly-shally 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.479
 besides there are also the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.640
 basic logica in minecraft the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.500
 This folder will light up as soon as possible 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.009
 at least one switch is activated 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.720
 has been 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.580
 the gate nor is the signal 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.320
 invested so that the lamp is not more 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.280
 lights up as soon as at least one switch 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.049
 has been activated 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.299
 the end gate brings the lamps 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.970
 light up when both inputs are activated 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.070
 are and that exor gate only if exactly 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.990
 one of the two switches was pressed 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.090
 if you want to start an event exactly 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 then if a last signal is an exact one 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 Length is about a certain 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.430
 crate level or one time from 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.649
 daylight sensor you use this 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.329
 circuit reaches the last signal 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.939
 desired length becomes the repeater 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.619
 activates and deactivates the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.270
 lower rest and torch the turn 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.250
 green light for the remainder torch on 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.290
 output is the last signal 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.700
 but stronger than desired 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.320
 Also the rest of the line is a block 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.000
 known above so the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.810
 peter connected the torch again 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.810
 disabled
