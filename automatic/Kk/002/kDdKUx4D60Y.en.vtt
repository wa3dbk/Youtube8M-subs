00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.680
 let's make these delicious skewers 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.950
 summery if you do not want to get lost 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.420
 none of my videos subscribe to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.420
 channel we start 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.530
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.130
 12 pieces of baked potato 12 tails 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.620
 of gambÃ³n 12 slices of bacon a little 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.960
 of pepper and a little green sauce what 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.809
 first thing we will do is peel and cut 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.730
 the potatoes and peel the fallow tails 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.250
 but we will make the potatoes that previously 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.920
 we have cooked in water with salt and then the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.520
 we have gone through cold water so that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.520
 undo 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.149
 once we have peeled the potatoes the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.149
 let's go in half 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.330
 now we will peel the tails of the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.330
 gambones 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.410
 some as you see brings the little tripita inside 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.480
 then we pull her and she gets 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.930
 then let's assemble the 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.360
 skewers roll up we have the the bacon in 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.740
 the potato we are pricking the potato 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.040
 wrapped in the bacon and now we will click 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.070
 a prawn tail 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.250
 and again potatoes with bacon and now 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.380
 we puncture again the shrimp tail and 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.420
 we already have them mounted 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.470
 is already mounted and we will continue 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.470
 doing the same operation 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.850
 Bacon potato and prawn tail 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.580
 once we have the skewers 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.030
 we are going to put a little bit of 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.030
 Pepper 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.630
 and we are going to take a little sauce 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.630
 green 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.200
 we put the grill to fire to fire 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.200
 strong and we let it get hot 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.910
 to put the skewers we put them with 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.000
 the face of the green sauce that we have 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.300
 thrown down because as it leads 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.190
 oil we will not have to put once 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.660
 that we have had a good time 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.660
 this side we will turn around 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.319
 to be done on the other side 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.380
 we're done so we're going to 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.380
 try it out and see how it is 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.140
