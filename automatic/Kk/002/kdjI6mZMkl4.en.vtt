basically the other one went down to
level<00:00:29.640> 7<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.810> first<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.410> all<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.560> had<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.189> um

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
level 7 so first of all we had this um

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.690 
level 7 so first of all we had this um
ww<00:00:33.690> being<00:00:33.899> leave<00:00:34.050> us<00:00:34.170> level<00:00:34.500> 68<00:00:34.860> then<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.579> had<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
ww being leave us level 68 then we had a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
ww being leave us level 68 then we had a
level<00:00:35.969> 64<00:00:36.510> then<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.020> had<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> level<00:00:37.410> 62<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.489> then

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
level 64 then we had a level 62 but then

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400

of<00:00:55.890> strategy<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.420> they're

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
of strategy but that's what they're

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
of strategy but that's what they're
doing<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.960> still<00:00:58.230> level<00:00:58.440> 02<00:00:58.890> haven't<00:00:59.160> done

is he doing right now you should always

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.600 
is he doing right now you should always
check<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.480> guys<00:03:14.750> population<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.980> when<00:03:16.579> I

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
check the guys population so when I

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.720 
check the guys population so when I
attacked<00:03:17.090> before<00:03:17.799> without<00:03:18.799> my<00:03:18.980> catapult<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:19.700> I

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
attacked before without my catapult so I

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.460 
attacked before without my catapult so I
attacked<00:03:20.180> with<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.569> bunch<00:03:20.780> of<00:03:20.930> chiefs<00:03:21.170> and

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
attacked with the bunch of chiefs and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.840 
attacked with the bunch of chiefs and
none<00:03:21.859> of<00:03:21.889> them<00:03:22.010> worked<00:03:22.069> because<00:03:22.489> he<00:03:22.730> had<00:03:22.819> a

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
none of them worked because he had a

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.670 
none of them worked because he had a
residence<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:23.840> when<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.049> attacked<00:03:24.350> his

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
residence so when I attacked his

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.470 
residence so when I attacked his
population<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.730> village<00:03:25.760> was<00:03:27.940> 557<00:03:28.940> ok

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
population of the village was 557 ok

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.140 
population of the village was 557 ok
that<00:03:29.750> was<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.900> population<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.970> right<00:03:31.970> now

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
that was the population and right now

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.069 
that was the population and right now
the<00:03:32.209> population<00:03:33.109> as<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.620> see<00:03:33.950> it's<00:03:34.069> five<00:03:35.079> 574

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
the population as I see it's five 574

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.740 
the population as I see it's five 574
and<00:03:36.350> think<00:03:36.769> of<00:03:36.859> it<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.100> way<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.519> level<00:03:38.480> one

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
and think of it this way a level one

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.930 
and think of it this way a level one
heroes<00:03:39.109> mansion<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:40.040> population<00:03:40.730> and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
heroes mansion is to population and

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.960 
heroes mansion is to population and
level<00:03:41.780> one<00:03:42.049> residence<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.709> one<00:03:42.950> population<00:03:43.519> so

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
level one residence is one population so

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.509 
level one residence is one population so
one<00:03:44.480> plus<00:03:44.660> two<00:03:45.019> is<00:03:45.049> three<00:03:45.350> simple<00:03:46.010> math<00:03:46.220> and

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
one plus two is three simple math and

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.559 
one plus two is three simple math and
then<00:03:47.109> 574<00:03:48.109> plus<00:03:48.350> 3<00:03:48.620> that's<00:03:48.769> 577<00:03:49.670> that's<00:03:50.420> the

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
then 574 plus 3 that's 577 that's the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.349 
then 574 plus 3 that's 577 that's the
population<00:03:51.170> before<00:03:51.380> i<00:03:51.560> catapulted<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.790> now<00:03:53.060> i

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
population before i catapulted so now i

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.330 
population before i catapulted so now i
know<00:03:53.480> he's<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:53.900> active<00:03:54.380> he's<00:03:54.560> not<00:03:54.709> online<00:03:54.889> and

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
know he's on active he's not online and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.970 
know he's on active he's not online and
he<00:03:55.609> has<00:03:55.730> 574<00:03:56.599> population<00:03:57.200> so<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.349> means<00:03:57.650> he's

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
he has 574 population so that means he's

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.559 
he has 574 population so that means he's
not<00:03:58.190> building<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.549> residence<00:03:58.970> he's<00:03:59.329> not

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
not building a residence he's not

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.120 
not building a residence he's not
building<00:03:59.780> at<00:04:00.019> euros<00:04:00.260> mansion<00:04:00.680> if<00:04:00.769> he<00:04:00.889> wants<00:04:01.069> to

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
building at euros mansion if he wants to

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.620 
building at euros mansion if he wants to
build<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.400> hero<00:04:01.549> smash<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.030> he<00:04:02.090> would<00:04:02.209> go<00:04:02.420> did

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
build a hero smash and he would go did

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.599 
build a hero smash and he would go did
he<00:04:02.780> wouldn't<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:03.230> wait<00:04:03.530> for<00:04:03.799> it<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.310> that's

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
he wouldn't just wait for it so that's

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.400 
he wouldn't just wait for it so that's
another<00:04:04.760> tip<00:04:05.060> check<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.690> population<00:04:06.290> every

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
another tip check the population every

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.680 
another tip check the population every
single<00:04:06.980> second<00:04:07.250> even<00:04:07.819> if<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.030> changes<00:04:08.269> by<00:04:08.420> one

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
single second even if it changes by one

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.059 
single second even if it changes by one
it<00:04:09.079> could<00:04:09.260> make<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.470> really<00:04:09.889> big<00:04:10.010> difference

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
it could make a really big difference

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.819 
it could make a really big difference
