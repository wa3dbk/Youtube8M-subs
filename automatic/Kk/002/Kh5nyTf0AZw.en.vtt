00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
we're going to put in some fog lights

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.299 
we're going to put in some fog lights
from<00:00:09.360> factory<00:00:09.719> fog<00:00:09.959> lights<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:11.040> switch

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
from factory fog lights and a switch

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
inside that way this S model will be

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.100 
inside that way this S model will be
similar<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.460> an<00:00:14.639> SL<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.210> fog<00:00:15.389> lights<00:00:15.660> from

there<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.740> ring<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.480> where<00:03:03.660> they

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
there is a ring and that's where they

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.890 
there is a ring and that's where they
change<00:03:04.020> out<00:03:04.260> between<00:03:04.560> fixing<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.180> fog<00:03:06.630> light

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900

change out between fixing the fog light
non<00:03:07.140> fog<00:03:07.410> light<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.430> what<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.790> want<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> do<00:03:09.060> is

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
non fog light so what you want to do is

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.300 
non fog light so what you want to do is
you<00:03:09.209> want<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.510> cut<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.410> inside<00:03:10.560> all<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.220> way

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you want to cut the inside all the way

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.030 
you want to cut the inside all the way
up<00:03:11.400> until<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.670> ring<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.330> length<00:03:13.230> scribe<00:03:13.830> edge

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
up until I ring and length scribe edge

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.310 
up until I ring and length scribe edge
there<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.910> way<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.600> fog<00:03:15.810> lamp<00:03:16.020> will<00:03:16.140> fit

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
there that way the fog lamp will fit

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.010 
there that way the fog lamp will fit
directly<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.800> here<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:18.600> once<00:03:18.780> you're<00:03:18.870> done

car done the fog lights in the fascia
here's<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.110> easy<00:03:49.440> part<00:03:49.680> I'm<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.610> going<00:03:50.730> to

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
here's the easy part I'm just going to

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.830 
here's the easy part I'm just going to
use<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.030> simple<00:03:51.269> Philip<00:03:51.630> screwdriver

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
use this simple Philip screwdriver

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.170 
use this simple Philip screwdriver
around<00:03:52.230> underneath<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:53.610> steering<00:03:53.880> column

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
around underneath the steering column

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.320 
around underneath the steering column
cover<00:03:54.570> there's<00:03:55.350> three<00:03:55.650> screws<00:03:56.180> they'll<00:03:57.180> come

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
cover there's three screws they'll come

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.870 
cover there's three screws they'll come
out<00:03:57.450> once<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.170> take<00:03:58.320> those<00:03:58.500> out<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:59.549> upper

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
out once you take those out just upper

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.240 
out once you take those out just upper
and<00:04:00.000> lower<00:04:00.120> half<00:04:00.390> are<00:04:00.630> going<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.080> pop<00:04:01.320> apart<00:04:01.739> so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
and lower half are going to pop apart so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.039 
and lower half are going to pop apart so
you<00:04:02.310> seem<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.670> kind<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.180> give<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.720> little<00:04:03.780> bit<00:04:03.989> of

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
you seem to kind of give a little bit of

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.500 
you seem to kind of give a little bit of
pressure<00:04:04.200> here<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.100> recommend<00:04:05.700> letting<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
pressure here and recommend letting the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.360 
pressure here and recommend letting the
steering<00:04:06.750> column<00:04:06.900> move<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:08.100> these<00:04:08.220> will

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
steering column move so these will

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.580 
steering column move so these will
actually<00:04:08.430> pop<00:04:08.820> apart

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.199 

it's<00:04:14.190> just<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.580> take<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.760> little<00:04:15.000> bit<00:04:15.120> of

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
it's just going to take a little bit of

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.140 
it's just going to take a little bit of
pressure<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.709> get<00:04:16.980> them<00:04:17.100> apart<00:04:17.400> it's

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
pressure just to get them apart it's

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.390 
pressure just to get them apart it's
upper<00:04:18.510> one<00:04:18.660> will<00:04:19.590> come<00:04:19.769> right<00:04:19.919> out<00:04:19.980> and<00:04:20.160> you

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
upper one will come right out and you

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.370 
upper one will come right out and you
can<00:04:20.430> just<00:04:20.609> sit<00:04:20.730> on<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.880> floor<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:22.079> can<00:04:22.199> take

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
can just sit on the floor you can take

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.480 
can just sit on the floor you can take
your<00:04:22.530> key<00:04:22.710> ring<00:04:22.740> out<00:04:23.360> which<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.600> pops<00:04:24.840> out

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
your key ring out which just pops out

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.740 
your key ring out which just pops out
and<00:04:26.490> they<00:04:26.639> can<00:04:26.790> also<00:04:26.940> take<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.330> lower<00:04:27.510> out

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
and they can also take the lower out

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.719 
and they can also take the lower out
here<00:04:30.889> and<00:04:31.889> just<00:04:31.919> remember<00:04:32.250> everything's

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
here and just remember everything's

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.780

tight<00:04:33.000> it's<00:04:33.419> going<00:04:33.540> to<00:04:33.600> take<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> little<00:04:34.020> bit<00:04:34.229> of

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
tight it's going to take a little bit of

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.719 
tight it's going to take a little bit of
toggling<00:04:35.790> around<00:04:36.150> not<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:36.930> problem<00:04:37.729> there's

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
toggling around not a problem there's

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.810 
toggling around not a problem there's
the<00:04:38.940> lower<00:04:39.120> piece<00:04:39.830> here's<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.889> switch<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.460> the
