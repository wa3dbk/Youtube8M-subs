00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
LED you have this one I'm just going to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.320 
LED you have this one I'm just going to
use<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> twenty<00:01:34.470> LED<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.970> left

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
use the twenty LED one that I have left

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.109 
use the twenty LED one that I have left
over<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.930> interior<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.850> put<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.940> back

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
over from the interior so put it back

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
over from the interior so put it back
into<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.540> slot<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:44.630> LEDs<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:46.310> polarities

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
into the slot and LEDs have polarities

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
into the slot and LEDs have polarities
on<00:01:47.550> them<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.479> want<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.929> make<00:01:49.050> sure<00:01:49.080> it's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
on them so you want to make sure it's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
on them so you want to make sure it's
correct<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.920> leaders<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.490> put<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.789> in<00:01:50.940> turn

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
correct so leaders you put it in turn

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.630 
correct so leaders you put it in turn
your<00:01:51.929> head<00:01:52.050> light<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.679> if<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.920> lights<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.340> if

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
your head light see if your lights on if

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.180 
your head light see if your lights on if
it<00:01:53.820> doesn't<00:01:54.179> take<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.960> flip<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.009> put

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
it doesn't take it out flip it and put

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.350 
it doesn't take it out flip it and put
it<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.670> try<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.060> again

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
it in and try it again

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.990 
it in and try it again
so<00:01:57.929> one<00:01:58.229> way<00:01:58.440> or<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.619> other<00:01:58.830> will<00:01:59.160> work<00:01:59.369> okay<00:01:59.970> I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
so one way or the other will work okay I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.639 
so one way or the other will work okay I
turn<00:02:00.330> on<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> headlight<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.470> bulb

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
turn on the headlight and the bulb

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.740 
turn on the headlight and the bulb
didn't<00:02:01.890> come<00:02:02.039> on<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.759> I'm<00:02:03.090> gonna<00:02:03.240> take<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> off

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
didn't come on so I'm gonna take it off

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.330 
didn't come on so I'm gonna take it off
and<00:02:03.960> flip<00:02:04.800> ego

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and flip ego

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.980 
and flip ego
I<00:02:05.369> flipped<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.090> turn<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.509> my<00:02:06.539> headlights

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
I flipped it and turn on my headlights

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
I flipped it and turn on my headlights
and<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.440> on<00:02:07.679> so<00:02:08.100> do<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> test<00:02:08.970> before<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and it's on so do this test before you

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.969 
and it's on so do this test before you
put<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.690> back<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.050> socket<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.619> if<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
put it back in the socket because if you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.280 
put it back in the socket because if you
put<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> socket<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.780> try<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.930> test

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
put in the socket and you try to test

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.600 
put in the socket and you try to test
this<00:02:13.440> then<00:02:13.710> if<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.950> doesn't<00:02:14.130> work<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:14.550> you

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
this then if it doesn't work then you

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.910 
this then if it doesn't work then you
have<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.910> remove<00:02:15.180> everything<00:02:15.510> also<00:02:16.080> when<00:02:16.830> you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
have to remove everything also when you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.380 
have to remove everything also when you
do<00:02:17.069> put<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.520> there<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.760> take<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.060> out<00:02:18.180> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
do put it in there and take it out you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.110 
do put it in there and take it out you
