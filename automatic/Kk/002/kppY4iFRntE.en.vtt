 natural gas and cryogenic pump 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.610
 providing gas delivery to the traction 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.320
 liquefied natural gas heart 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.080
 necessary for gas turbine operation 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.689
 engine stored in a cryogenic tank 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.610

 specially gas filling complexes 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.799
 already refilled capacity can be 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.979
 delivered to any regions of Russia 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.930
 where it will be installed on gas turbine carriers without

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.829
 fed to the traction section it enters 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.240
 heat exchange loop located behind 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.820
 power turbine engine 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 exhaust us a device going on here 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 increasing the temperature of the fuel and its 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.760
 regasification to compensate for expansion 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.640
 fuel regasification result 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.040
 this receiver is used which capacity 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.870
 gas comes from the heat exchanger and from where 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.030
 they are then sent to the gas turbine 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.369
 installations 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.350
 for the operation of the gas turbine engine it 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.540
 the combustion chamber must flow mixture 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.799
 gas and air 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.509
 pull in atmospheric air 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.549
 input snail coming first to 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.830
 compressor low and then high 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.940
 pressure 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.490
 rotating compressor blades 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.320
 increase air pressure and it is served 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.149
 into the combustion chamber where it mixes with 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.170
 coming from the receiver of natural gas 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.060
 and ignites the building of the products 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.310
 combustion rotates the blades of the power turbine 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.140
 that transmit torque 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.350
 low and high pressure compressor 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.910
 and drive shaft generator products 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.380
 combustion is emitted through the exhaust 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.880
 heating system 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.489
 or gasify the fuel in

 heat exchanger registered 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.209
 emission indicators are 5 times lower 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.709
 what environmental standards require 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.209
 European Union nominated by 2012 in 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.280
 the result of the rotation of the turbine and rotor 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.470
 traction generator is produced 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.900
 electric current driving 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 traction motors are located on 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.180
 each of the 12 wheel pairs of gas turbine carriers 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.180
 reliability of aviation gas turbine 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.610
 engines allows you to bring them 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.440
 operating time up to 30,000 hours without disassembly 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.750
 engine 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.550
 and in the locomotive version of the gas turbine 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.640
 engine this value can be 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.710
 significantly higher cost of the black cycle 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.750
 locomotive with which installation on 20 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.490
 percent but also residents since 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.920
 gas turbine engine powered by 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.350
 more gentle modes has less 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.960
 rubbing parts which increases it 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.620
 resource and makes gas turbine carriers cheaper in 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.620
 repair and maintenance
