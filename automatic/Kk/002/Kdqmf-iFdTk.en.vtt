that's<00:00:13.559> been<00:00:13.769> really<00:00:14.009> bothering<00:00:14.130> me<00:00:14.549> ever

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
that's been really bothering me ever

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.120 
that's been really bothering me ever
since<00:00:15.059> they<00:00:15.299> initially<00:00:15.780> revealed<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.619> I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
since they initially revealed it and I

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.260 
since they initially revealed it and I
haven't<00:00:17.460> been<00:00:17.550> able<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.760> quite<00:00:17.940> put<00:00:18.150> my<00:00:18.180> finger

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
haven't been able to quite put my finger

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.750 
haven't been able to quite put my finger
on<00:00:18.570> why<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.590> something<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.189> grew<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.490> with

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
on why when something you grew up with

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.730 
on why when something you grew up with
is<00:00:20.910> brought<00:00:21.119> back<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.779> changed<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.410> easy<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
is brought back and changed it's easy to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.109 
is brought back and changed it's easy to
fall<00:00:22.859> into<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.220> trap<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.760> saying<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
fall into the trap of just saying I

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.759 
fall into the trap of just saying I
don't<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.170> different<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
don't like it because it's different and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.519 
don't like it because it's different and
I<00:00:26.580> thought<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.140> for

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
I thought that was what was going on for

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.929 
I thought that was what was going on for
a<00:00:28.590> while<00:00:28.619> especially<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.640> lots<00:00:29.789> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
a while especially because lots of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
a while especially because lots of
people<00:00:30.000> seem<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> really<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
people seem to really really like the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.950 
people seem to really really like the
new<00:00:32.309> moon<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.820> lot<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> people<00:00:33.270> felt<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
new moon a lot of people felt that the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
new moon a lot of people felt that the
original<00:00:34.170> moon<00:00:34.620> kind<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.489> looked<00:00:35.670> stupid<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
original moon kind of looked stupid and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
original moon kind of looked stupid and
those<00:00:36.989> same<00:00:37.230> people<00:00:37.410> felt<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> redesign

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
those same people felt that the redesign

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.170 
those same people felt that the redesign
gave<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.149> moon<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.570> much<00:00:40.290> more<00:00:40.770> menacing<00:00:41.190> look

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
gave the moon a much more menacing look

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.880 
gave the moon a much more menacing look
but<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> more<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> look<00:00:43.290> at<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
but the more I look at it the more I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
but the more I look at it the more I
think<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.370> that's<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.730> true<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.450> won't<00:00:45.989> argue

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
think that that's not true I won't argue

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.900 
think that that's not true I won't argue
that<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> redesign<00:00:46.950> moon<00:00:47.219> doesn't<00:00:47.520> look<00:00:47.730> more

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that the redesign moon doesn't look more

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.880 
that the redesign moon doesn't look more
aggressive<00:00:48.510> that's<00:00:48.960> definitely<00:00:49.469> definitely

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
aggressive that's definitely definitely

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.340 
aggressive that's definitely definitely
true<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.670> frightening<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:52.199> think

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
true but more frightening I don't think

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.439 
true but more frightening I don't think
so<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.149> comes<00:00:54.390> down

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
so and I think that what this comes down

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
so and I think that what this comes down
to<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.960> difference<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.590> perceptions<00:00:56.160> in

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
to is a difference in perceptions in

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.910 
to is a difference in perceptions in
terms<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.719> feel<00:00:58.109> frightened<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> bow

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
terms of what we feel frightened the bow

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
terms of what we feel frightened the bow
I<00:00:59.219> don't<00:00:59.850> believe<00:00:59.910> menace<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.629> itself<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I don't believe menace in itself is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
I don't believe menace in itself is
frightening<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.789> new<00:01:02.969> version<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
frightening and the new version of the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
frightening and the new version of the
moon<00:01:03.750> they've<00:01:03.960> created<00:01:04.229> has<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> sense<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
moon they've created has a sense of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
moon they've created has a sense of
character<00:01:05.430> has<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> lot<00:01:06.270> more<00:01:06.450> character<00:01:07.020> than

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
character has a lot more character than

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.830 
character has a lot more character than
the<00:01:07.650> original<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> original<00:01:08.400> moon<00:01:08.909> was

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the original the original moon was

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.820 
the original the original moon was
somehow<00:01:10.439> almost<00:01:10.920> void<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.700> vacant

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
somehow almost void this vacant

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.030 
somehow almost void this vacant
nothingness<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.299> did<00:01:15.689> look

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
nothingness of a thing it did look

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
nothingness of a thing it did look
strangely<00:01:17.040> stupid<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.759> an<00:01:17.850> odd<00:01:18.000> way<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.450> also

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
strangely stupid in an odd way but also

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.850 
strangely stupid in an odd way but also
just<00:01:19.640> uncaring<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.540> ball<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.259> apathy

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
just uncaring it was this ball of apathy

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.300 
just uncaring it was this ball of apathy
with<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> chilling<00:01:23.640> odd<00:01:24.049> grin<00:01:25.100> crushing<00:01:26.100> down
