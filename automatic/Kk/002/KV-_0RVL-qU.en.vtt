00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
than the performance itself but I think

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.699

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.649 
the best moment will be when the ballet
curtain<00:04:00.310> when<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.819> curtain<00:04:01.090> comes<00:04:01.239> down<00:04:01.299> on<00:04:01.450> the
