just going to show you the linking of
the<00:04:05.040> fingerprint<00:04:05.609> so<00:04:06.829> now<00:04:07.829> we're<00:04:07.980> going<00:04:08.069> to

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
the fingerprint so now we're going to

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.069 
the fingerprint so now we're going to
log<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.730> again<00:04:08.970> as<00:04:09.239> well<00:04:09.419> just<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.720> get<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.989> the

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
log in again as well just to get to the

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.479 
log in again as well just to get to the
settings<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.680> we're<00:04:10.799> going<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:10.979> do<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.220> again

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
settings so we're going to do that again

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.189 
settings so we're going to do that again
here<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.030> I'll<00:04:12.120> do<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.479> we'll<00:04:12.750> be<00:04:12.780> right<00:04:12.989> back

here so I'll do that we'll be right back

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.550 
here so I'll do that we'll be right back
again

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
process you'll have to link it again and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.900 
process you'll have to link it again and
just<00:04:42.510> hit<00:04:42.930> this<00:04:43.740> here<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.370> then<00:04:44.550> go<00:04:44.730> through

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
just hit this here and then go through

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.970 
just hit this here and then go through
the<00:04:45.000> process<00:04:45.030> quickly<00:04:45.990> one<00:04:46.170> one<00:04:46.530> more<00:04:46.740> time

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
the process quickly one one more time

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.640 
the process quickly one one more time
and<00:04:47.220> then<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:47.880> will<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:48.090> all<00:04:48.240> set<00:04:48.540> up<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.050> just

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
and then it will be all set up so just

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.220 
and then it will be all set up so just
keep<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:49.830> in<00:04:50.010> mind<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.670> then<00:04:51.120> now<00:04:51.870> any<00:04:52.020> time

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
keep that in mind and then now any time

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.380 
keep that in mind and then now any time

you log in to PayPal you will then need

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:06.410 
you log in to PayPal you will then need
to<00:04:58.190> use<00:04:59.690> your<00:05:00.690> PIN<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:04.760> it's<00:05:05.760> okay<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:06.240> there's

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.260 

it's<00:05:26.010> going<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.310> ask<00:05:26.400> me<00:05:26.460> for<00:05:26.610> my<00:05:26.700> fingerprint

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
it's going to ask me for my fingerprint

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.640 
it's going to ask me for my fingerprint
so<00:05:27.360> I'm<00:05:27.420> just<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.780> know<00:05:27.810> go<00:05:28.020> or<00:05:28.230> if<00:05:28.350> I<00:05:28.410> need<00:05:28.560> to

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
settings to make it simple so I have

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.580 
settings to make it simple so I have
that<00:05:32.910> finger<00:05:33.240> setup<00:05:33.540> yep<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:33.990> then<00:05:34.110> bingo<00:05:34.410> I'm

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
that finger setup yep and then bingo I'm

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.560 
that finger setup yep and then bingo I'm
in<00:05:34.770> so<00:05:36.140> that<00:05:37.140> is<00:05:37.520> that<00:05:38.520> is<00:05:38.670> it<00:05:38.820> so<00:05:39.090> it's<00:05:39.270> easy<00:05:39.450> to

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
in so that is that is it so it's easy to

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.230 
in so that is that is it so it's easy to
set<00:05:39.810> up<00:05:39.840> fingerprint<00:05:40.470> scanning<00:05:40.770> using<00:05:41.760> PayPal

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
set up fingerprint scanning using PayPal

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.910 
set up fingerprint scanning using PayPal
and<00:05:42.510> one<00:05:42.930> more<00:05:43.110> thing<00:05:43.380> I<00:05:43.500> want<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.680> show<00:05:43.830> you

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
as well using your fingerprint so if you

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.300 
as well using your fingerprint so if you
want<00:05:56.790> apps<00:05:57.030> and<00:05:57.330> things<00:05:57.510> like<00:05:57.660> that<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.590> you
