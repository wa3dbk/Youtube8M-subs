00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
it and it's really interesting how

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.110 
it and it's really interesting how
patients<00:04:16.229> with<00:04:16.350> such<00:04:16.650> problems<00:04:16.979> are<00:04:17.370> not<00:04:17.940> able

patients with such problems are not able
to<00:04:18.269> recognize<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.200> example<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.769> mobile<00:04:20.010> phone

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
to recognize for example a mobile phone

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.490 
to recognize for example a mobile phone
for<00:04:21.090> example<00:04:21.209> if<00:04:21.690> they<00:04:21.870> are<00:04:21.930> looking<00:04:22.049> at<00:04:22.320> it

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
for example if they are looking at it

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.740 
for example if they are looking at it
and<00:04:22.669> however<00:04:23.669> if<00:04:23.820> they<00:04:24.090> take<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.539> phone

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
and however if they take the phone

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.409 
and however if they take the phone
immediately<00:04:25.530> they<00:04:25.710> know<00:04:25.890> what<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.250> is

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
immediately they know what it is

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.809 
immediately they know what it is
okay<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:28.139> this<00:04:28.650> part<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.099> cortex<00:04:29.610> is

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
okay so this part of the cortex is

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.029 
okay so this part of the cortex is
important<00:04:30.300> for<00:04:30.449> receiving<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.379> auditory

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
important for receiving the auditory

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.629 
important for receiving the auditory
signal<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:33.479> is<00:04:33.569> not<00:04:33.780> important<00:04:34.439> for

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
signal it is not important for

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.249 
signal it is not important for
perception<00:04:35.639> of<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.509> signal<00:04:36.870> but<00:04:37.020> just

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
perception of the signal but just

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.879 
perception of the signal but just
receiving<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.740> signal<00:04:38.219> itself<00:04:39.650> okay<00:04:40.650> and

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
receiving the signal itself okay and

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.269 
receiving the signal itself okay and
this<00:04:41.039> gyrus<00:04:41.849> here<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.360> called<00:04:42.719> the

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:43.279 
this gyrus here is called the

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:48.200 
this gyrus here is called the
supramarginal<00:04:44.279> gyrus<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:46.789> this<00:04:47.789> area<00:04:48.029> is

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
supramarginal gyrus and this area is

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.890 
supramarginal gyrus and this area is
important<00:04:48.719> for<00:04:48.990> understanding<00:04:49.259> the<00:04:50.099> speech

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
important for understanding the speech

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.559 
important for understanding the speech
so<00:04:51.900> here<00:04:52.409> you<00:04:52.770> receive<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.610> signal<00:04:54.029> auditory

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
so here you receive the signal auditory

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.800 
so here you receive the signal auditory
signal<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.199> this<00:04:56.009> area<00:04:56.310> understand<00:04:57.180> the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
signal and this area understand the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.219 
signal and this area understand the
speech<00:04:59.210> if<00:05:00.210> there<00:05:00.449> is<00:05:00.539> a<00:05:00.569> stroke

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
speech if there is a stroke

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.040 
speech if there is a stroke

thinking playing you know being talented

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.839 
thinking playing you know being talented
for<00:06:13.439> something<00:06:13.860> whether<00:06:14.039> it's<00:06:14.250> math<00:06:14.460> or<00:06:14.759> I

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
for something whether it's math or I

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.360 
for something whether it's math or I
don't<00:06:14.909> know<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.389> these<00:06:16.199> areas<00:06:16.620> are<00:06:16.860> hard<00:06:17.189> to

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
don't know and these areas are hard to

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.850 
don't know and these areas are hard to
differentiate<00:06:18.020> because<00:06:19.020> they<00:06:19.319> really<00:06:19.710> depend

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
differentiate because they really depend

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.610 
differentiate because they really depend
on<00:06:20.310> infant<00:06:20.849> individuality<00:06:21.539> of<00:06:21.839> each<00:06:22.020> person

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
on infant individuality of each person

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.429 
on infant individuality of each person
so<00:06:22.879> some<00:06:23.879> person<00:06:24.270> might<00:06:24.449> have<00:06:24.479> parts<00:06:25.050> really

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:25.439 
so some person might have parts really

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.309 
so some person might have parts really
really<00:06:25.949> developed<00:06:26.399> so<00:06:27.120> for<00:06:27.360> for<00:06:27.930> example

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
really developed so for for example

really developed so for for example
someone<00:06:28.560> is<00:06:28.589> talented<00:06:29.129> for<00:06:29.430> math<00:06:29.610> or<00:06:29.969> playing

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
someone is talented for math or playing

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:39.149 
really hard to find these areas because

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.600 
really hard to find these areas because
some<00:06:39.599> persons<00:06:40.080> don't
