00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.180
 I have this television magnavoz me 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.880
 presenting a problem has false 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.800
 contact in the audio in the sound since 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.550
 he used it a lot connecting and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.880
 disconnecting dividÃ­s I will have to 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.570
 open it and weld it to see if it 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.570
 fix the problem 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.550
 Here you can see who is working on 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.550
 disk I will move the cables 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.500
 and much more 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.220
 I will give you this fan 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.220
 why 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.880
 and began to fail years ago since the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.140
 I bought but already with the fan 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.510
 failed again 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.900
 right now the problem you have is a 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.900
 false contact in the audio outputs 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.880
 again here you hear a horn 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.939
 what I do is this shovel and re 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.479
 weld these parts to see if it 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.479
 solve the problem 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.390
 i 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.390
 Y 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.410
 i 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.410
 good 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.619
 it is cut 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.780
 to disconnect the cables before 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.080
 disconnect the ones that have to be marked there 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.540
 mark them to connect them like never 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.790
 you have to pull the cables 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.790
 because it may or may not damage the cables 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.740
 to grab a pair of tweezers 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.490
 and with tweezers very carefully 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.490
 for Carlos 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.190
 to be here is to apply a little to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.390
 welding to the sound outputs because 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.390
 is where I am have the problem 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.860
 apply some welding 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.860
 we give a clean 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.960
 well, it seems that the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.260
 sound problem that the fake 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.260
 contact audio outputs 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.660
 what if 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.660
 I keep a cure 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.530
 and is that until the problem is solved 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.969
 audio output sound outputs 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:41.810
 of this television 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:44.210
 this television is from 2004 and it's already 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.900
 three surgeries the first was the most 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:51.380
 delicate that is this I had to removed 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:56.300
 a metal arm that went here to 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.340
 to be able to permanently leave a fan already 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.220
 that there is a very special part there that 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.220
 only the computer can put it 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.900
 and they warmed up let's go I lasted 10 15 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.680
 minutes and they went off since I put the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.000
 fan was no longer turned off 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.300
 then after this problem to the 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.880
 5 or 6 years a capacitor was damaged 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.270
 I just put it also 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.050
 lately, what failed was the 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.190
 output of the sound but it has already been fixed 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.840
 adding a little more solder 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.840
 in each leg the problem was fixed 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.259
 let's see how the sound works 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.460
 Well, there is working well 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.319
 television 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.319
 the audio is no longer cut 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.949
 in the little 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.949
 and they are called 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.440
 I call when was the last time you 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.440
 do not you still do not bathe me
