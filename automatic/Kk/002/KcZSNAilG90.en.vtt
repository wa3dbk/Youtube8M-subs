 at the presentation of the company dell and I will 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.200

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.610
 1 new is called do and drink 10 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.219
 here it is before you

 the tablet is pretty enough I 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.179
 looked closer get acquainted but 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.189
 first thing worth noting material and to 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:28.400
 accordingly it is plastic it weighs 649 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.329
 grams so relatively light black 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.660
 boy 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.489
 behind this soft-touch plastic here you are 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.910
 see that it's nice enough for 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.559
 yours is here dl camera logo 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.120
 here is a removable battery community 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.800
 the presentation had a lot of words said 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.710
 There are options from removable 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.899
 the battery has non-removable options 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.760
 battery let him in general for 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.440
 user a lot of interesting things 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.780
 accordingly sell by button 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.390
 front camera here is a button 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.190
 mechanical such special below 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.220
 connector micro usb how was 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.239
 microusb and special for charge 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.310
 battery not to connect 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.590
 peripherals for example top and side this 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.850
 yusbi cord hdmi 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.490
 respectively for headphones connect 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.360
 on this side that we have it there 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.119
 us castle that is, he, too, was given 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.220
 a little time and lock it in 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.350
 dell companies use devices and do not 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.990
 must necessarily be locked up 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 there is tied to the regulatory table 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.890
 loudness 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.009
 I'm sorry to have such conditions 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.020
 Unfortunately, the presentation was slightly delayed. 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.229
 didn't have to all devices will be here on 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.549
 surface so let's say the button is very 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.819
 it's hard to see dark here 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.670
 video lock connection in study 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.369
 And right now, I was blocked by a hole that is very 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.399
 tied yes no normally previous 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.970
 blocked and horror there is a slot under sd 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.830
 card if short hill technical 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.350
 there is a sign that I will be with her to 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.000
 Unfortunately, the most important thing is to remember 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.690
 weight 149 grams thickness south ten s 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.980
 half millimeters normal thickness 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.030
 further that we have a dual core 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.610
 processor ding intel atom z2760 8 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.890
 gigahertz with intel boost technology 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.090
 one and a half gigahertz but generally we went 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:32.700
 further Windows is Windows 8 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:37.420
 32 or about 32 2GB of RAM and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:43.140
 32 gigabytes or 64 will be built 10 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.030
 inches it and without matrix 10 1306 at 768 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.010
 Gorilla voice accordingly that us 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.360
 wide viewing angle strong taro 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.700
 trailing 10 touches 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.080
 2 megapixel camera main for 8 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.390
 megapixels here there is wi-fi here 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.400
 how much did you go there kind of like 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.930
 said that here in all 10 3g 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.740
 younger models it will not battery 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:12.209
 so means 2 elements or teony 32 hours 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.220
 optional 4 element or theons 60 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.510
 have you can take 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.640
 disconnect the battery put more 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.280
 a little bit thicker with another 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.650
 hand everything is fine this as for here 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.630
 this device I will not you 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.660
 show windu in india everything and so 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.570
 very clear usually windows 8 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.150
 Well, the second novelty can probably be 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.350
 someone will be more interested in this 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.600
 keyboard novelty 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.880
 that is, you can unfasten this one here 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.239
 dude face I will not often do this 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:47.220
 here the keyboard is not Russian 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:50.549
 convex quite comfortable you can do 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.170
 various multitouch gestures on the touchpad 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.150
 buttons box distance 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.209
 there is not much memory here considering 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.739
 put some videos on here 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.150
 Respectively, as now I poddinu 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.760
 mean here 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.330
 as I understand it 32 gigabytes free 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.910
 23 in general there is generally a lot but it 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.030
 its not so important to us now so 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:17.370
 here we need to tell mean from above 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:20.950
 and here the lot is so huge 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.320
 curtain with gum but there usually and everywhere and 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.450
 micro sd is something strange apparently there 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.360

 behind back behind back usually soft touch 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.910
 plastic design is enough 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.060

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.900
 as we were told that they say a tablet of 10 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.650
 hours of operation is with this stand 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.870
 let's say it will be 20 hours and it weighs 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.520
 600 grams for some reason we wrote 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.250
 basic parameters written 9 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.860
 millimeters thickness and accordingly without 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.520
 mistakes 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:18.050

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:40.250
 slightly here is one mark second speaker 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.710
 The tablet itself is generally pretty if 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:48.740
 talking on materials is probably all 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:51.860

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.329
 older model younger model like 

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:34.349
