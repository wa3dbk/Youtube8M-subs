00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 Hmm 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.220
 Hello, my loves, all right 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.860
 so today I came with this video for me 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.540
 I had never done any video of how 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.599
 I would make my eyebrow so 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.370
 I enjoyed writing the tutorial 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.940
 this makeup and before we start I need 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.149
 Clean guy, I made this video for you guys. 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.390
 How do I make my eyebrows? 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.620
 I already have the definitive makeup on 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.680
 my eyebrows because mine 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.540
 eyebrow she was very thin it is 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.530
 horrible horrible 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.970
 Then I would pass the pencil and then I would go to the beach. 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.320
 horrible thing horrible horrible 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.500
 horrible 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.130
 six years ago I took the course of 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.680
 delma pigmentation and wanted to do a lot 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.150
 in my but I did not dare to 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.340
 that one day I got there in front of 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.360
 mirror made pratto 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.970
 and it's been four years since I made the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.280
 my eyebrow she's already exhausted 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.040
 because despite the name of makeup 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:31.270
 definitive is not definitive makeup is 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:34.240
 one should experience action and so it is for 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.729
 but I always like to touch her 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.659
 with shadow because I think it stays that way. 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.440
 thing so more marked but I like 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.659
 very 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.500
 so I always pissed her off with the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.430
 shadow 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.250
 okay I hope you enjoy it video 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.110
 Any question just tell me that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.560
 I'll have a presence answer 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.979
 It's good, let's go to the video, girls. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.369
 start I always use 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.250
 basically it is the shade caprara 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.799
 eyebrow this fall congratulate me already 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.819
 I told you it's a prior video 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:15.519
 and so I really like and I use 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:21.170
 Always the one that, oh my God, the river molds 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:25.700
 and if it's clearer here, but that's how it is 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.550
 you can use any shadow to opaque 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.150
 right brown can call no clearer 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:36.620
 The darker it is for a while I used it a lot 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:42.020
 that of mary kay nÃ© that she also fixes 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:49.610
 Good, then it's good, it 's good. 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:53.540
 do nothing eyebrow I always use one 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.610
 brush so he is bevelled he has 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.890
 cuts in action frado he is p 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.830
 I thin then I knew the brush I 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.590
 achieve greater accuracy to make the 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.989
 eyebrow dna 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:18.130
 so I took a little bit of the shade and 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.130
 I take a risk here 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:33.260
 You see how it makes the difference? 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:37.040
 well then apply here and that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:42.170
 here is where the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:47.330
 eyebrow picks up a little better 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.980
 bit that makes the risk up 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.840
 note that I do not start here from the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:58.030
 At first I always trade in the environment. 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.030
 that I blame her 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:25.460
 in a way a little more here that is to 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.460
 she gets a little thicker 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:39.570
 to iacc at the beginning with the brush so I 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.570
 only giant step do not have much access 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.600
 I 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:58.620
 I mean, wahoo here knows that 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:05:02.050
 here only grandma just fill it there already 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.419
 Of course, so when you do 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.570
 is very evident because in fact 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.760
 I'm without makeup with nothing so. 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:16.860
 if you do not like it very much 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.860
 so just get a toothbrush like that 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:30.070
 I tried to tell her right away that 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:36.580
 shade excess 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:39.070
 then with a concealer or pencil 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.240
 so move it, I really like this one. 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:50.850
 natura 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:50.850
 I only take the risk down here. 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.260
 good to give a light and here in 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.260
 also up 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.709
 Oh, look at the difference. 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:22.529
 a good difference, then I'll do it 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.529
 that quickly 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:47.950
 so this is not very simple as well 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.950
 It's practical and I hope you like it.
