to<00:00:15.839> start<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> team<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> think

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
to start with you this is a team I think

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.609 
to start with you this is a team I think
that<00:00:17.580> at<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.789> point<00:00:18.119> expects<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.020> play<00:00:19.260> four

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
that at this point expects to play four

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.099 
that at this point expects to play four
championships<00:00:20.340> last<00:00:21.119> year<00:00:21.330> they<00:00:21.630> didn't<00:00:21.960> do

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
championships last year they didn't do

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.660 
championships last year they didn't do
that<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:23.010> they<00:00:23.039> return<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that can they return to that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.609 
that can they return to that
championship<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:25.199> can't<00:00:25.470> you

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
championship for I think they can't you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.140 
championship for I think they can't you
know<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.740> really<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.400> defense<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.939> think

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
know I really like this defense I think

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.670 
know I really like this defense I think
when<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> start<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.720> talk<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:28.050> being<00:00:28.470> able

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
when you start to talk about being able

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320 
when you start to talk about being able
to<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:28.890> into<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> championship<00:00:29.730> honey<00:00:30.060> you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
to get into the championship honey you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.759 
to get into the championship honey you
have<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> defense<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.710> done

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
have to have a defense can get that done

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.740 
have to have a defense can get that done
I<00:00:32.219> believe<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.600> have

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
I believe they have that do they have

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.940 
I believe they have that do they have
some<00:00:33.989> issues<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> get

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
some issues that they have to get

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
some issues that they have to get
corrected<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.610> offense<00:00:36.180> no<00:00:36.420> question<00:00:36.809> about

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
corrected on offense no question about

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
corrected on offense no question about
it<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.260> know<00:00:37.410> how<00:00:37.559> poorly<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.100> played<00:00:38.370> there

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it we know how poorly they played there

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.430 
it we know how poorly they played there
but<00:00:39.120> from<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.420> defensive<00:00:39.570> standpoint<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
but from a defensive standpoint and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.630 
but from a defensive standpoint and
special<00:00:40.800> teams<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.190> think<00:00:41.219> they're<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
special teams I think they're going to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.920 
special teams I think they're going to
have<00:00:41.760> an<00:00:41.850> opportunity<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> mix

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
have an opportunity to be in the mix

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.110 
have an opportunity to be in the mix
defense<00:00:43.649> puts<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.219> position<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.940> me

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
defense puts them in that position to me

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.119 
defense puts them in that position to me
the<00:00:45.300> answer<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.719> yes<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> look<00:00:47.010> at

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the answer is yes because if you look at

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.500 
the answer is yes because if you look at
the<00:00:47.250> progress<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.820> made<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.239> wide<00:00:48.480> receiver

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the progress they made at wide receiver

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840 
the progress they made at wide receiver
and<00:00:49.260> running<00:00:49.590> back<00:00:49.739> from<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.129> spring<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and running back from the spring to the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.389 
and running back from the spring to the
fall<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.329> impressive<00:00:51.949> they<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.190> look<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
fall it's impressive they just look so

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.189 
fall it's impressive they just look so
much<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:53.969> equipped<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.809> those<00:00:54.989> two

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
much more equipped at those two

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.389 
much more equipped at those two
positions<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.829> they've<00:00:56.010> got<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
positions now they've got to make a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
positions now they've got to make a
decision<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.910> quarterback<00:00:57.390> that's<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:58.170> every

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
decision a quarterback that's like every

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.709 
decision a quarterback that's like every
other<00:00:58.530> program<00:00:59.059> that<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> most

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
other program that that's the most

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.709 
other program that that's the most
important<00:01:01.170> decision<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:02.280> into<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
important decision so can you go into a

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
important decision so can you go into a
manageable<00:01:03.719> schedule<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> great<00:01:05.040> defense

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
manageable schedule with a great defense

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
manageable schedule with a great defense
and<00:01:05.729> better<00:01:06.030> production<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.689> tailback<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and better production of tailback and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.350 
and better production of tailback and
wide<00:01:08.040> receiving<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.670> had<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> year<00:01:09.240> ago

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
wide receiving you had a year ago

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
wide receiving you had a year ago
although<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.900> had<00:01:10.049> lady<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.380> bail<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> year

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
although they had lady on bail a year

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.870 
although they had lady on bail a year
ago<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.310> didn't<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
ago but they didn't have them in the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330 
ago but they didn't have them in the
spring<00:01:12.180> obviously<00:01:12.689> III<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.950> can

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
spring obviously III think they can

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.219 
spring obviously III think they can
compete<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.600> goes<00:01:15.840> right<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
compete and I know this goes right to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.510 
compete and I know this goes right to
the<00:01:16.259> offense<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:17.070> mentioned<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the offense and we mentioned the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.370 
the offense and we mentioned the
receivers<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.630> should<00:01:18.659> talk<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:18.990> them

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
receivers so we should talk about them

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.499 
receivers so we should talk about them
for<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> moment<00:01:19.920> during<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> offseason<00:01:21.090> they

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
for a moment during the offseason they

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.850 
for a moment during the offseason they
tried<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> catch<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.170> hundred<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.560> fifty

and<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.659> kind<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> see<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.200> they've

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and you can kind of see that they've

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.410 
and you can kind of see that they've
gotten<00:01:28.740> better<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.220> mean<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.939> about<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
gotten better I mean it's about the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.520 
gotten better I mean it's about the
repetitions<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.170> about<00:01:31.350> getting

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
repetitions it's about getting

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.649 
repetitions it's about getting
comfortable<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:33.030> them<00:01:33.450> as

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
comfortable and really is about them as

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.380 
comfortable and really is about them as
a<00:01:33.720> group<00:01:34.460> regaining<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.700> confidence<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
a group regaining the confidence that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.690 
a group regaining the confidence that
they<00:01:36.570> had<00:01:36.810> before<00:01:37.049> last<00:01:37.470> year<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.400> think

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
they had before last year and I think

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.580 
they had before last year and I think
going<00:01:39.299> through<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.689> practice<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> going

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
going through that practice and going

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.530 
going through that practice and going
through<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> prepare<00:01:42.090> yeah<00:01:42.509> I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
through that will get to prepare yeah I

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
through that will get to prepare yeah I
couldn't<00:01:43.290> agree<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.549> off<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
couldn't agree more you they get off to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.219 
couldn't agree more you they get off to
a<00:01:44.790> fast<00:01:45.119> start<00:01:45.240> meaning<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> receivers

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
a fast start meaning the receivers

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.060 
a fast start meaning the receivers

have some confidence in early games and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.090 
have some confidence in early games and
they<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.259> take<00:01:58.409> off<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> season
