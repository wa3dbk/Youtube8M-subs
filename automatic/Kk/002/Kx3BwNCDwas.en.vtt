seven<00:01:56.729> sections<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:57.539> not<00:01:57.750> only<00:01:57.899> moves

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
seven sections that not only moves

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.410 
seven sections that not only moves
vertically<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.580> also<00:01:59.640> moves<00:02:00.179> horizontally

vertically but also moves horizontally
as<00:02:00.989> well<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.709> is<00:02:01.739> a<00:02:01.860> very<00:02:02.099> unique<00:02:02.280> feature

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
as well which is a very unique feature

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.320 
as well which is a very unique feature
not<00:02:03.479> seen<00:02:03.750> too<00:02:03.899> often<00:02:04.080> in<00:02:04.910> video<00:02:05.910> computer

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
not seen too often in video computer

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.949 
not seen too often in video computer
games<00:02:06.539> it's<00:02:07.140> also<00:02:07.349> done<00:02:07.679> very<00:02:08.280> well<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.959> Sonic

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
games it's also done very well in Sonic

games it's also done very well in Sonic
Spinball<00:02:10.400> the<00:02:11.400> same<00:02:11.610> kind<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.910> effect<00:02:12.260> and

Spinball the same kind of effect and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.790 
Spinball the same kind of effect and
it's<00:02:14.640> pulled<00:02:15.000> off<00:02:15.180> very<00:02:15.569> well<00:02:15.660> well<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
it's pulled off very well well here the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800 
it's pulled off very well well here the
only<00:02:16.920> problem<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.090> little<00:02:18.269> jerky

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
only problem is it's a little jerky

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.410 
only problem is it's a little jerky
sometimes<00:02:19.230> especially<00:02:19.530> moving<00:02:20.340> from<00:02:21.060> play

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
sometimes especially moving from play

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.660 
sometimes especially moving from play
field<00:02:21.659> to<00:02:21.780> play<00:02:21.959> field<00:02:22.409> horizontally<00:02:23.370> so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
field to play field horizontally so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.729 
field to play field horizontally so
that's<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:23.879> bad<00:02:24.030> vertically<00:02:24.450> up<00:02:24.659> and<00:02:24.750> down<00:02:24.840> but

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
that's so bad vertically up and down but

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.490 
that's so bad vertically up and down but
horizontally<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.430> gets<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.790> jerky<00:02:27.500> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
horizontally it gets a little jerky that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.960 
horizontally it gets a little jerky that
seems<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.280> problem<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> game

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
seems to be just a problem with the game

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.390 
seems to be just a problem with the game
itself<00:02:30.349> but<00:02:31.349> there<00:02:31.530> are<00:02:31.620> all<00:02:31.709> kinds<00:02:32.099> of<00:02:32.190> drop

sound<00:07:04.890> effects<00:07:05.280> are<00:07:05.400> good<00:07:05.580> the<00:07:06.090> music<00:07:06.480> is<00:07:06.600> good

very<00:07:07.110> entertaining<00:07:07.590> I<00:07:07.860> have<00:07:08.400> no<00:07:08.520> problem<00:07:08.850> with

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
very entertaining I have no problem with

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.500 
very entertaining I have no problem with
it<00:07:09.000> at<00:07:09.240> all

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
it at all

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.260 
it at all
the<00:07:10.350> other<00:07:10.530> downside<00:07:10.830> to<00:07:11.340> it<00:07:11.370> is<00:07:11.610> that<00:07:11.850> it<00:07:12.000> is<00:07:12.240> a

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
the other downside to it is that it is a

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.320 
the other downside to it is that it is a
little<00:07:12.690> bit<00:07:12.960> easy<00:07:13.260> I<00:07:13.500> could<00:07:14.250> when<00:07:14.940> I<00:07:14.970> first

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
little bit easy I could when I first

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.300 
little bit easy I could when I first
started<00:07:15.570> playing<00:07:15.630> this<00:07:15.990> game<00:07:16.260> I<00:07:16.590> found<00:07:17.100> that<00:07:17.250> I

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
started playing this game I found that I

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.040 
started playing this game I found that I
could<00:07:17.400> play<00:07:17.730> for<00:07:17.850> an<00:07:18.120> hour<00:07:18.240> on<00:07:18.540> one<00:07:18.870> ball

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
could play for an hour on one ball

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.490 
could play for an hour on one ball
sometimes<00:07:20.630> there's<00:07:21.630> not<00:07:21.780> a<00:07:21.840> high<00:07:22.080> level<00:07:22.350> of

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
sometimes there's not a high level of

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.080 
sometimes there's not a high level of
difficulty<00:07:23.040> because<00:07:23.130> you<00:07:23.400> won't<00:07:23.580> really<00:07:23.760> lose

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
difficulty because you won't really lose

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.880 
difficulty because you won't really lose
a<00:07:24.120> ball<00:07:24.420> unless<00:07:24.840> you're<00:07:25.020> in<00:07:25.170> one<00:07:25.200> of<00:07:25.590> the<00:07:25.680> seven

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:25.890 
a ball unless you're in one of the seven

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.000 
a ball unless you're in one of the seven
areas<00:07:27.140> otherwise<00:07:28.140> the<00:07:28.380> ball<00:07:28.500> just<00:07:28.680> moves<00:07:28.890> from

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
areas otherwise the ball just moves from

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.560 
areas otherwise the ball just moves from
one<00:07:29.160> play<00:07:29.400> field<00:07:29.640> to<00:07:29.790> the<00:07:29.880> next<00:07:30.150> so<00:07:30.390> there's

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
one play field to the next so there's

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.120 
one play field to the next so there's
not<00:07:30.660> a<00:07:30.720> high<00:07:30.930> level<00:07:31.170> of<00:07:31.350> difficulty<00:07:31.740> and<00:07:31.950> it's

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.130 
not a high level of difficulty and it's

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.040 
not a high level of difficulty and it's
fairly<00:07:32.490> easy<00:07:32.610> to<00:07:32.910> get<00:07:33.120> a<00:07:33.150> decent<00:07:33.600> high<00:07:33.750> score

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
fairly easy to get a decent high score

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.270 
fairly easy to get a decent high score
in<00:07:34.140> this<00:07:34.290> game<00:07:36.050> but<00:07:37.050> with<00:07:37.350> all<00:07:37.560> its<00:07:37.740> flaws<00:07:37.950> it

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
in this game but with all its flaws it

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.360 
in this game but with all its flaws it
is<00:07:38.400> still<00:07:38.670> a<00:07:38.700> very<00:07:38.910> good<00:07:39.120> pinball<00:07:39.450> game<00:07:39.630> and<00:07:40.370> I

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.370 
is still a very good pinball game and I
