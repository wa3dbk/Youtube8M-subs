santos customs with any car and hover

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.119 
santos customs with any car and hover
over<00:01:00.449> an<00:01:00.539> upgrade<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.199> can't<00:01:01.500> afford<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
over an upgrade that we can't afford and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.319 
over an upgrade that we can't afford and
make<00:01:02.250> sure<00:01:02.280> you're<00:01:02.520> paying<00:01:02.609> close<00:01:02.879> attention

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
make sure you're paying close attention

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.700 
make sure you're paying close attention
because<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.750> next<00:01:03.930> far<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.589> bit

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
because this next far is a little bit

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.620 
because this next far is a little bit
tricky<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.580> basically<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> idea<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.540> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
tricky so basically the idea of this

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390 
tricky so basically the idea of this
glitch<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.350> quickly<00:01:07.590> press<00:01:07.920> Start<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
glitch is to quickly press Start and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
glitch is to quickly press Start and
then<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.820> millisecond<00:01:09.390> afterwards<00:01:09.990> confirm<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
then a millisecond afterwards confirm to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.200 
then a millisecond afterwards confirm to
put<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> upgrade<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> can't<00:01:11.760> afford<00:01:12.090> on

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
put the upgrade that you can't afford on

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
put the upgrade that you can't afford on
which<00:01:12.570> will<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:12.810> bring<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> pause<00:01:13.650> menu

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and as far as I know other players can

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.139 
and as far as I know other players can
actually<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> game<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.000> that

actually see you in the game so that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.520 
actually see you in the game so that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
means you could potentially mod in a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.350 
means you could potentially mod in a
shark<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.920> attack<00:01:47.220> players<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.790> beach<00:01:48.090> or
