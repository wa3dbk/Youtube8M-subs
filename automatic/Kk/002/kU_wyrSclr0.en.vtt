 The beautiful box here I'll start doing 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 more recordings here is with the webcam and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.029
 This is cool, this is cool and actually 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.099
 I had to own a video today 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.390
 That kid play but I just got me 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.429
 say they do a lot and do not 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.080
 can do nothing 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.430
 I just gotta make the video and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.079
 playing this video so you have a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.460
 expression in English that always reminds 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.540
 One more Portuguese I do not remember. 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 To compensate for this, to compensate, there is no 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.320
 no gas no video here even 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.360
 see my room here is there allos students 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 there I use to record airton one 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.760
 punching bag I wore when 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.520
 asking for a note 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:04.080
 but he has my old bed and I 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.880
 I wanted to make a sofa but I left it to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.049
 there I still want to play again in the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.549
 bed on a sofa 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.320
 I need to buy some pillows and 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.350
 put a student to put a cloth 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.659
 fabric for hurricane right not seem like it is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.540
 a bed but a couch but the two 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.030
 channels the kid play house play is 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.920
 so it's hard to keep the content in the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.829
 two mainly because now I 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.020
 I decided to post more new games in 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.450
 players then got a good share 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.610
 of the time there researching the game doing the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.619
 download playing testing to see if 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 game to stay this cool game and 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.340
 Learning is a little bit to speak. 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 promise to have anything to say 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.899
 It's okay, got it pulled on to me. 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.329

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.990
 prefecture miss video here on this channel 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:02.759
 one day or another you already have mine 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.740
 excuse me forever and monaco is going 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.300
 to continue for sure i just need 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.039

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.939
 1800 and mail 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.439

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:21.480
 note 2 rolling 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:23.849

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:32.189

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.049

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.120
 time to see if it works, right? 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.760
 I hope so, but that's what I wanted 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.400
 to thank the world once again there 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.549

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.439

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.730
 Tell her she's faster, huh? 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.730
 the dota 2 is the person who said he really wants 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.799
 the whole game then an entire game but 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.169
 I honestly would not have the patience 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.819
 there is an entire set of back two ne 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.189
 But the gang wants who I am to judge. 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.120
 It's good, there it is. 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.650
 be careful in the match play that people 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.569
 come back with more things 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.500

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:17.870
