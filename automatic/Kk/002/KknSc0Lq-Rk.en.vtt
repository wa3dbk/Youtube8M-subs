San<00:01:21.750> Diego's<00:01:22.140> calm<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.009> your

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
San Diego's calm so it's not just your

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.859 
San Diego's calm so it's not just your
regular<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.240> start<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.630> your

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
regular you don't start with your

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
regular you don't start with your
typical<00:01:25.530> box<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.159> pancake<00:01:26.520> maker<00:01:26.729> no

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
typical box of pancake maker no

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
typical box of pancake maker no
basically<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> base<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.350> flour<00:01:28.560> will

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
basically it's a the base of flour will

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.080 
basically it's a the base of flour will
use<00:01:28.890> oat<00:01:29.070> flour<00:01:29.280> instead<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.700> regular<00:01:29.880> flour

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
use oat flour instead of regular flour

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.240 
use oat flour instead of regular flour
so<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.720> wheat<00:01:30.869> free<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> use

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
so it's wheat free and then you use

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.710 
so it's wheat free and then you use
apple<00:01:32.670> juice<00:01:32.850> instead<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.329> milk<00:01:33.509> which

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
apple juice instead of milk which

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.080 
apple juice instead of milk which
moistens<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.350> without<00:01:34.500> using<00:01:34.680> fat<00:01:35.009> okay<00:01:35.579> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
moistens that without using fat okay and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.370 
moistens that without using fat okay and
then<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> wave<00:01:36.750> regime<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.229> gives

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
then you have the wave regime and gives

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
then you have the wave regime and gives
a<00:01:37.470> protein<00:01:37.860> powder<00:01:38.130> mm-hmm<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> do

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
a protein powder mm-hmm and then you do

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.760 
a protein powder mm-hmm and then you do
basically<00:01:39.720> sea<00:01:40.020> salt<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.409> give<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> little

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
basically sea salt to give it a little

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.469 
basically sea salt to give it a little
bit<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> flavor<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.119> making<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
bit of flavor and then are you making a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.719 
bit of flavor and then are you making a
gobby<00:01:42.689> nectar<00:01:43.170> /<00:01:43.860> lemon<00:01:44.310> juice<00:01:44.490> cinnamon

this is basically emphasizing on the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.289 
this is basically emphasizing on the
glycemic<00:02:46.500> index<00:02:46.889> what<00:02:47.579> i'm<00:02:47.670> doing<00:02:47.970> here<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.180> we

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
glycemic index what i'm doing here is we

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.420 
glycemic index what i'm doing here is we
got<00:02:48.420> two<00:02:48.629> types<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.079> fruits<00:02:49.379> they<00:02:50.040> appear<00:02:50.340> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
got two types of fruits they appear to

got two types of fruits they appear to
be<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.609> same<00:02:50.639> in<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.000> sense<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.569> this<00:02:51.780> is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
be the same in the sense of that this is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
be the same in the sense of that this is
fruit<00:02:52.280> differences<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.489> between

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
fruit differences is that between

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.240 
fruit differences is that between
cherries<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.389> watermelon<00:02:54.930> watermelon<00:02:55.439> has<00:02:56.220> a

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
cherries and watermelon watermelon has a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.690 
cherries and watermelon watermelon has a
lot<00:02:56.489> more<00:02:56.700> sugar<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.420> less<00:02:57.959> fructose<00:02:58.799> really

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
lot more sugar and less fructose really

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.830 
lot more sugar and less fructose really
two<00:02:59.879> types<00:02:59.909> of<00:03:00.209> sugars<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:00.599> carbohydrates

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
two types of sugars and carbohydrates

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.780 
two types of sugars and carbohydrates
and<00:03:01.709> fruit<00:03:01.889> right<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.280> fructose<00:03:02.609> is<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and fruit right and if fructose is a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.849 
and fruit right and if fructose is a
natural<00:03:03.120> sugar<00:03:03.329> from<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.720> fruit<00:03:04.019> which<00:03:04.650> is

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
natural sugar from the fruit which is

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.349 
natural sugar from the fruit which is
which<00:03:05.159> is<00:03:05.189> easier<00:03:05.519> on<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.700> human<00:03:05.909> body<00:03:05.970> which

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
which is easier on the human body which

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:07.789 
which is easier on the human body which
doesn't<00:03:06.629> require<00:03:06.689> insulin<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.349> digest<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
doesn't require insulin to be digest and

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.740 
doesn't require insulin to be digest and
then<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.010> got<00:03:08.129> cherries<00:03:08.549> which<00:03:09.030> are<00:03:09.269> more

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
then you got cherries which are more

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.289 
then you got cherries which are more
fructose<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.379> less<00:03:10.560> glucose<00:03:11.010> okay<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.060> let's

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
fructose and less glucose okay so let's

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.539 
fructose and less glucose okay so let's
stop<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.900> pause<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.620> digest<00:03:14.220> that

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
stop the pause and digest that

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.270 
stop the pause and digest that
information<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.500> told<00:03:16.680> us<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.069> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
information you just told us that the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.800 
information you just told us that the
cherries<00:03:17.669> are<00:03:17.819> better<00:03:18.030> because<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.510> has<00:03:18.660> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
cherries are better because it has the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.170 
cherries are better because it has the
natural<00:03:19.019> sugar<00:03:19.590> which<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:19.829> fruit<00:03:20.160> oh<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.910> then

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
natural sugar which is fruit oh and then

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.240 
natural sugar which is fruit oh and then
the<00:03:21.359> watermelon<00:03:22.109> even<00:03:22.349> though<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.440> love<00:03:23.069> it

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
the watermelon even though I love it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.970 
the watermelon even though I love it
it's<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.910> little<00:03:24.540> more<00:03:25.290> hard<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.769> digest

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
it's a little more hard to digest

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.649 
it's a little more hard to digest
because<00:03:26.220> there's<00:03:26.489> more<00:03:26.699> actual<00:03:27.030> sugar<00:03:27.419> or

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
because there's more actual sugar or

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.180 
because there's more actual sugar or
glucose<00:03:27.989> actually<00:03:28.349> those<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.680> eat<00:03:28.829> like<00:03:28.980> say

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
glucose actually those you eat like say

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.530 
glucose actually those you eat like say

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
chemical reaction that happens so that's

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.059 
chemical reaction that happens so that's
why<00:03:36.780> people<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.019> have<00:03:37.109> diabetes<00:03:37.530> would<00:03:37.859> want
