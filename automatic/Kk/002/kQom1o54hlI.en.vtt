 with the girls so nothing, I'm in a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 very simple tutorial to do but 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.030
 which as you see is very natural in the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.860
 I know what skin to use in the afternoon 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.599
 night as you want, the only thing is a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.070
 little bit warm eye tones 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.199
 with a slightly cooler tone in the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.359
 lips and nothing thank you very much for watching 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.759
 the video so far then we're going to 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.380
 start as always by our preco 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.769
 I am wearing the dark circles under my eyes 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.839
 applied I'm going to put bis that with the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.620
 skewer concealer blending of bobby 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.240
 braun 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.660
 let's put a part of darkness in 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 the ojera 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.620
 also if you have spots on the skin 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.539
 you can put it in the spots 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.120
 well on top of the for the proofreader I'm going to 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.680
 use the work meis corrector that is 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.030
 this one of bobby here the most 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.370
 clarita these are some projects for 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.399
 fix it ok we're going to apply it with the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.800
 same brush once cleaned over 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.149
 of the pre-corrector and already in the rest of the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.239
 and also we are going to download a 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.130
 little bit like now I will show you vale 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.770
 up to this point 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.540
 so that feeling that the skin 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.540
 the look is more rested 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.620
 and around here we also mark a little 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.620
 line 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.280
 well let's apply the basis of 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.880
 makeup I will use the brochita 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.650
 number 45 of sephora of synthetic hair 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.260
 the kabuki type and leaves a very finished 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.600
 natural and I will also use the base 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.790
 from mcl to prolong the tone in the cde 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.530
 35 you will see that at the beginning I have one 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.450
 darker skin of my skin tone but 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.770
 then it becomes clear to me 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.350
 we take a little circle and apply 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.649
 makeup to circles also in the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.649
 face 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.470
 with this brush the truth is that it 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.610
 apply makeup very quickly 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.610
 also leaves a very natural finish 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.430
 Now let's fix everything with the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.900
 I'm going to use the light tone 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.400
 plus of the demand cables and the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.400
 brochita payment from boy brown 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.500
 to seal all the makeup that we 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.500
 last all day 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.540
 do not 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.760
 I'm going to apply a little powder of 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.530
 sun in golden light tone with the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.840
 Browning bag bobby 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.980
 at 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.980
 in the center of the forehead 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.340
 in the temples 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.430
 nose center 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.380
 to the center of the cheeks 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.060
 Never forget 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.069
 then we will apply the color 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.430
 esdehor gas de nash with the beech brush 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.560
 He screeched also other 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.890
 only the center area of the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890
 cheeks 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.550
 in the eyes we are going to use these 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.840
 serene proofs the masses professed you see 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.770
 that is going to make us stand up 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.770
 all day in the shadows 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.620
 and extend the fingertip I 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.720
 apply now with the brush 217 a 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.510
 little bit of the shade also expressed that 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.310
 it's broken 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.310
 only on the mobile eyelid 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.440
 As I tell you, you will see that her makeup 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.449
 super easy to do but it looks great and 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.280
 now with the same brush 217 we are going to 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.990
 catch this shadow that the shade rule is 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.009
 an orange tone that does not look good 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.889
 but it's like an orange peach 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:33.240
 clarito and we're going to put it right by 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.240
 on top of espresso 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.490
 in the area of â€‹â€‹the eye socket 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:52.909
 I'm going to put the maximizing serum now 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.199
 of tabs god dior show and what 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.849
 I will use as evidence and before 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.379
 the eyelash mask that I also 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.379
 love because curve by itself 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.610
 the tab we only have to 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.020
 apply then if it was a mask 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.330
 It can also be done even by the 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.680
 night 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.810
 and besides that we are going to take the 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.939
 tab when putting the mask on 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.289
 It is putting tabs then there 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.289
 much longer and bulky 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.510
 I'm going to put on the mascara now 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.479
 The extreme glamor then vibrates a fair 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.479
 above the floor of dior which is a 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:34.100
 combination that I love the most is more 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.100
 that of eyelashes does not do anything of the group 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:42.800
 elongated volume that great 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.800
 I like it more than with the Goddess of God 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.100
 also down 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.020
 and we work well, I'm going to put 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.020
 several layers both up and down 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.970
 I'm going to fill in the line 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.250
 the water was going the water line 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:18.120
 inside the eye in black tone with the 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.789
 pencil long war pencil in jet tone that is 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.539
 deep black that of bobby braun 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.539
 only on the water line 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.850
 and for the lips I will use the tone 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.620
 of the colored rivers that are long 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.240
 duration in tone see pink which is a rose 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.430
 super nice very simple that goes to 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.080
 accompany the eye as in warm tones 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.200
 in and I put it a little more in shades 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.200
 cold 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.920
 and nothing else would be the look I hope that 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.750
 you liked it and thank you very much for
