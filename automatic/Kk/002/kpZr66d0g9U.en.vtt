00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
I'm going to talk to you about is RPF

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.960 
I'm going to talk to you about is RPF
sequences<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.350> if<00:00:19.650> you're<00:00:20.400> anything<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.910> me

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
sequences so if you're anything like me

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.519 
sequences so if you're anything like me
you've<00:00:21.330> probably<00:00:21.359> rendered<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.350> few

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you've probably rendered in a few

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.359 
you've probably rendered in a few
different<00:00:22.619> formats

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
different formats

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.880 
different formats
sometimes<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.910> render<00:00:24.210> out<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> QuickTime<00:00:24.750> movie

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
sometimes I render out a QuickTime movie

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.130 
sometimes I render out a QuickTime movie
most<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> time<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> PSD<00:00:27.480> layered

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
most of the time I do like a PSD layered

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.640 
most of the time I do like a PSD layered
render<00:00:29.390> there's<00:00:30.390> actually<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.869> format<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.470> here

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
render there's actually a format in here

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.400 
render there's actually a format in here
called<00:00:31.920> RPF<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.750> play<00:00:33.989> around<00:00:34.230> with

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
called RPF and if you play around with

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.900 
called RPF and if you play around with
this<00:00:34.620> there's<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.070> good<00:00:35.280> chance<00:00:35.550> you'll<00:00:35.730> never

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
this there's a good chance you'll never

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.670 
this there's a good chance you'll never
go<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.420> using<00:00:36.660> anything<00:00:36.870> else<00:00:37.050> there's<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
go back to using anything else there's a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.280 
go back to using anything else there's a
lot<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.129> cool<00:00:38.370> things<00:00:38.610> about<00:00:38.730> RPF<00:00:39.290> one

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
lot of really cool things about RPF one

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260 
lot of really cool things about RPF one
of<00:00:40.410> those<00:00:40.559> things<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.520> contains<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
of those things is that it contains a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.410 
of those things is that it contains a
lot<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> data<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.739> file<00:00:44.129> format<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.270> let's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
lot of data in this file format so let's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.180 
lot of data in this file format so let's
go<00:00:45.510> ahead<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.750> click<00:00:45.870> RPF<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.649> if<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.010> click

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
go ahead and click RPF and if you click

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
go ahead and click RPF and if you click
on<00:00:47.340> options<00:00:47.820> there's<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.870> lot<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.289> different

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
on options there's a lot of different

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.529 
on options there's a lot of different
data<00:00:49.860> types<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.610> bake<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.300> your

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
data types that you can bake into your

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.069 
data types that you can bake into your
render<00:00:51.870> by<00:00:52.770> default<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.250> Z<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.149> object

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
render by default I think Z and object

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.840 
render by default I think Z and object
ID<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.649> checked<00:00:56.010> which<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.460> good<00:00:56.699> because

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
ID are checked which is good because

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.799 
ID are checked which is good because
those<00:00:57.059> are<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> ones<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.719> be

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
those are the ones I'm going to be

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.709 
those are the ones I'm going to be
talking<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.199> z<00:00:59.129> depth<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.730> object<00:01:00.210> ID<00:01:00.420> will

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
talking about z depth and object ID will

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
talking about z depth and object ID will
be<00:01:00.750> baked<00:01:01.109> into<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.530> render<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.039> let's<00:01:02.280> talk

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
be baked into your render so let's talk

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
be baked into your render so let's talk
about<00:01:02.520> what<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.910> means<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:04.589> I've<00:01:04.830> got<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
about what that means so I've got a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.550 
about what that means so I've got a
bunch<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.369> us<00:01:05.640> spheres<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:07.020> each<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
bunch of us spheres here and on each of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
bunch of us spheres here and on each of
these<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.890> put<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.610> right<00:01:09.090> clicked<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.600> did

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
these I put a I right clicked and did

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.160 
these I put a I right clicked and did
cinema<00:01:10.140> 40<00:01:10.439> tags<00:01:10.760> compositing<00:01:11.760> tag<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.360> on

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
cinema 40 tags compositing tag and on

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.990 
cinema 40 tags compositing tag and on
that<00:01:13.380> compositing<00:01:13.950> tag<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.460> went<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that compositing tag I went to the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630 
that compositing tag I went to the
object<00:01:15.450> buffer<00:01:15.900> tab<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.340> clicked

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
object buffer tab and then I clicked

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.450 
object buffer tab and then I clicked
enable<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.040> toggle

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
enable and then you can kind of toggle

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
enable and then you can kind of toggle
through<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:21.049> what<00:01:22.049> number<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> want<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
through these what number you want to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.060 
through these what number you want to
kind<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.909> attach<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.689> object<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.860> this

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
kind of attach to that object so this

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.429 
kind of attach to that object so this
sphere<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.640> object<00:01:27.210> buffer<00:01:27.540> number<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
sphere is object buffer number one this

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.740 
sphere is object buffer number one this
one's<00:01:28.680> object<00:01:29.130> buffer<00:01:29.400> 3<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.820> one's<00:01:30.299> object

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
one's object buffer 3 this one's object

one's object buffer 3 this one's object
buffer<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.259> each<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.890> them<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.130> basically

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
buffer for each of them is basically

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.090 
buffer for each of them is basically
specified<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> number<00:01:34.470> which<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
specified a number which is going to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
specified a number which is going to
come<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.369> handy<00:01:35.610> later<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.420> rendered

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
come in handy later now if you rendered

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.810 
come in handy later now if you rendered
before<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.619> rendered<00:01:37.950> object<00:01:38.430> buffers

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
before and you rendered object buffers

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910 
before and you rendered object buffers
what<00:01:39.420> you'd<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> multipass

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
what you'd have to do is go to multipass

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.850 
what you'd have to do is go to multipass
and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.579> click<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.210> object<00:01:42.540> buffer<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and then click on object buffer and you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.730 
and then click on object buffer and you
load<00:01:44.159> an<00:01:44.310> object<00:01:44.759> buffer<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:45.450> you'd

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
load an object buffer and then you'd

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.590 
load an object buffer and then you'd
select<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> ID<00:01:47.130> number<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.820> correspond<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
select the ID number to correspond to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.200 
select the ID number to correspond to
what<00:01:48.930> object<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.790> 1<00:01:51.000> we'd

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
what object you want right so for 1 we'd

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.920 
what object you want right so for 1 we'd
have<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.540> 1<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.729> multipass

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
have this 1 then we go to multipass

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.539 
have this 1 then we go to multipass
object<00:01:54.930> buffer<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.159> one<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
object buffer we go to this one and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670 
object buffer we go to this one and
change<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> 2<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.140> do<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.619> every

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
change it to 2 and we do that for every

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.219 
change it to 2 and we do that for every
single<00:01:59.280> item<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.630> after-effects

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
single item and then in after-effects

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.959 
single item and then in after-effects
you'd<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.950> bring<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:02.399> object

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
you'd have to bring in these object

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.660 
you'd have to bring in these object
buffers<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.630> I'll<00:02:03.930> separate<00:02:04.590> multipass<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
buffers as I'll separate multipass and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.429 
buffers as I'll separate multipass and
then<00:02:06.090> you'd<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> use<00:02:06.780> them<00:02:06.960> as<00:02:07.079> track

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
then you'd have to use them as track

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.820 
then you'd have to use them as track
mats<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.509> manages<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.869> stack<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.530> top<00:02:10.709> of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
mats and manages they stack up on top of

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440 
mats and manages they stack up on top of
each<00:02:10.890> other<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.340> really<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:12.030> busy

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
each other and get really really busy

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.190 
each other and get really really busy
your

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
your

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.370 
your
gets<00:02:13.470> very<00:02:13.830> confusing<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:15.330> way<00:02:15.599> using<00:02:15.870> RPF

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
gets very confusing this way using RPF

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.750 
gets very confusing this way using RPF
you<00:02:16.560> don't<00:02:16.709> actually<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.400> all<00:02:17.640> those

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
you don't actually have to do all those

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.660 
you don't actually have to do all those
extra<00:02:18.120> steps<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.720> really<00:02:19.080> really<00:02:19.319> nice

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
extra steps and it's really really nice

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.360 
extra steps and it's really really nice
so<00:02:20.670> we'll<00:02:20.790> go<00:02:20.880> ahead<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.060> render<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.900> out

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
so we'll go ahead and render this out

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.500 
so we'll go ahead and render this out
all<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:23.580> now<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.819> done<00:02:23.970> rendering<00:02:24.150> so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
all right now it's done rendering so

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.180 
all right now it's done rendering so
let's<00:02:24.660> go<00:02:24.810> ahead<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.080> head<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.349> over<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.770> After

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
let's go ahead and head on over to After

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.970 
let's go ahead and head on over to After
Effects<00:02:26.569> go<00:02:27.569> ahead<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.840> import<00:02:28.230> our<00:02:28.440> file<00:02:28.739> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
Effects go ahead and import our file and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.780 
Effects go ahead and import our file and
the<00:02:29.700> nice<00:02:29.850> thing<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.690> RPF<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.640> just

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the nice thing is this RPF is you just

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.070 
the nice thing is this RPF is you just
have<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.060> import<00:02:33.300> one<00:02:33.390> thing

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
have to import one thing

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.809 
have to import one thing
do<00:02:34.319> not<00:02:34.470> say<00:02:34.620> import<00:02:34.950> all<00:02:35.040> these<00:02:35.190> separate

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
do not say import all these separate

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.400 
do not say import all these separate
multi<00:02:36.239> passes<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.840> everything<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.319> we'll

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
multi passes and everything so we'll

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.410 
multi passes and everything so we'll
take<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.770> RPF<00:02:38.250> make<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> new<00:02:38.850> comp<00:02:39.120> with<00:02:39.300> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
take this RPF make a new comp with it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.860 
take this RPF make a new comp with it
and<00:02:39.800> here<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:40.950> go<00:02:41.160> let's<00:02:41.700> get<00:02:41.910> rolling<00:02:42.390> so

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and here we go let's get rolling so

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.590 
and here we go let's get rolling so
we're<00:02:43.260> gonna<00:02:43.349> go<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.709> effect<00:02:44.220> 3d<00:02:44.880> Channel<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
we're gonna go to effect 3d Channel and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.820 
we're gonna go to effect 3d Channel and
there's<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> bunch<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.140> different<00:02:46.470> things<00:02:46.500> in

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
there's a bunch of different things in

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.229 
there's a bunch of different things in
here<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.310> use<00:02:47.519> when<00:02:47.760> you're<00:02:47.880> going<00:02:48.120> with

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
here you can use when you're going with

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.750 
here you can use when you're going with
an<00:02:48.360> RPF<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.130> one<00:02:50.250> we're<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.550> talk

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
an RPF so the one we're going to talk

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.660 
an RPF so the one we're going to talk
about<00:02:50.940> right<00:02:51.299> now<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.660> called<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.200> ID<00:02:52.470> mat<00:02:53.040> so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
about right now is called the ID mat so

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.000 
about right now is called the ID mat so
we'll<00:02:53.790> go<00:02:53.850> ahead<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.030> put<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.360> here<00:02:55.010> and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
we'll go ahead and put that on here and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.460 
we'll go ahead and put that on here and
under<00:02:56.370> ID<00:02:56.610> selection<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:57.959> see<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.319> set

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
under ID selection you can see it's set

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.199 
under ID selection you can see it's set
to<00:02:58.530> zero<00:02:58.680> right<00:02:59.130> now<00:02:59.280> go<00:02:59.700> ahead<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.000> change

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
to zero right now go ahead and change

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.180 
to zero right now go ahead and change
that<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.420> say<00:03:00.780> 5<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.410> see<00:03:01.560> what<00:03:01.680> happens

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
that to say 5 and see what happens

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.940 
that to say 5 and see what happens
so<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.180> can<00:03:03.420> see<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.260> highlighting

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
so I can see that it is highlighting

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.490 
so I can see that it is highlighting
just<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.489> one<00:03:05.790> sphere<00:03:06.239> which<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.319> really

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
just this one sphere which is really

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.780 
just this one sphere which is really
cool<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:07.799> it's<00:03:08.010> basically<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:08.519> an

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
cool because it's basically like an

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580 
cool because it's basically like an
object<00:03:08.970> buffer<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.959> don't<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.410> do

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
object buffer but you don't have to do

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.009 
object buffer but you don't have to do
two<00:03:10.920> different<00:03:11.130> layers<00:03:11.489> with<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.060> track<00:03:12.780> mat

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
two different layers with a track mat

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.960 
two different layers with a track mat
and<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.440> garbage<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.400> takes<00:03:14.670> forever

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
and all that garbage that takes forever

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.240 
and all that garbage that takes forever
so<00:03:15.269> let's<00:03:15.959> go<00:03:16.110> ahead<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.350> duplicate<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:17.040> guy

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
so let's go ahead and duplicate this guy

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.520 
so let's go ahead and duplicate this guy
and<00:03:17.519> on<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.060> bottom<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:18.630> we'll<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.079> delete

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
and on the bottom one we'll just delete

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.460 
and on the bottom one we'll just delete
this<00:03:19.799> ID<00:03:20.040> mat<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.060> then<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.359> top<00:03:21.600> one<00:03:21.840> if<00:03:22.350> we

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
this ID mat so then this top one if we

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.800 
this ID mat so then this top one if we
solo<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:22.980> we<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.519> have<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.269> sphere<00:03:24.540> so

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
solo it we just have that one sphere so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.170 
solo it we just have that one sphere so
if<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:24.989> wanted<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.400> say<00:03:26.400> add<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.609> little<00:03:26.910> bit<00:03:27.090> of

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
if we wanted to say add a little bit of

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.870 
if we wanted to say add a little bit of
a<00:03:27.239> different<00:03:27.570> color<00:03:27.780> correction<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.560> guy

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
a different color correction to this guy

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.460 
a different color correction to this guy
we<00:03:29.880> could<00:03:30.150> go<00:03:30.299> ahead<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.600> add<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> curves<00:03:31.109> and

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
we could go ahead and add a curves and

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.770 
we could go ahead and add a curves and
do<00:03:32.010> something<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.670> alright<00:03:32.940> I'm<00:03:33.540> going

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
do something like that alright I'm going

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.050 
do something like that alright I'm going
to<00:03:33.859> turn<00:03:34.859> off<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.220> solo<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:35.880> see

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
to turn off the solo and you can see

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.000 
to turn off the solo and you can see
that<00:03:36.239> we<00:03:36.390> were<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.810> highlighting<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.739> one

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that we were just highlighting this one

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.180 
that we were just highlighting this one
sphere<00:03:38.880> right<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.989> even<00:03:40.200> go<00:03:40.380> make<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.100> a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
sphere right can even go make it a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.670 
sphere right can even go make it a
little<00:03:41.280> bit<00:03:41.430> more<00:03:41.549> obvious<00:03:41.670> for<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.560> then

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
little bit more obvious for you so then

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.349 
little bit more obvious for you so then
all<00:03:43.829> we<00:03:43.859> have<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.100> do<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.370> duplicate<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:45.060> guy

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
all we have to do is duplicate this guy

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.710 
all we have to do is duplicate this guy
we<00:03:45.930> could<00:03:46.200> say<00:03:46.530> changes<00:03:47.040> 1<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.519> 7<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.600> then

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
we could say changes 1 to 7 and then

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.060 
we could say changes 1 to 7 and then
we're<00:03:48.810> going<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.049> be<00:03:49.230> able<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.440> control<00:03:49.920> the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
we're going to be able to control the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.400 
we're going to be able to control the
object<00:03:50.459> buffer<00:03:50.790> number<00:03:50.970> 7<00:03:51.600> your<00:03:52.019> object

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
object buffer number 7 your object

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.819 
object buffer number 7 your object
buffers<00:03:52.709> built-in<00:03:53.609> because<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.720> RPF<00:03:55.109> so

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
buffers built-in because of the RPF so

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:56.870 
buffers built-in because of the RPF so
there's<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.010> couple<00:03:56.160> other<00:03:56.400> things<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.819> you

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
there's a couple other things that you

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.400 
there's a couple other things that you
can<00:03:57.000> do<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.299> 3d<00:03:57.600> channel<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.109> I'm<00:03:58.200> going<00:03:58.350> to
