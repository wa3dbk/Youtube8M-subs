 perfect motorcycle takeshima working temperature client broker then my 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.740
 motor 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.840
 one of the main concerns today is one of the main main reason 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 of father reproof you can not bear 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.430
 and the other wave in general was high 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.639
 if the high 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:52.810
 and dilution factors 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.080
 the opel is not right 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.120
 so if you're not careful you can be out 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.970
 ignition system ignition system 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.380
 to fail her name 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.760
 and I'll be able to embrace why 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.740
 formed in the fuel ignition of the bike to burn to the lane for this 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.110
 she brings how it's going to be 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.659
 cooling system to generate pay 6 5 to 1 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.520
 is to get them to have contact with heating 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.100
 I usually work in Tupi, he used the perfect situation yesterday and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.070
 report on board icy goats 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.840
 fuel for the ice cream that comes out behind or sites etc. 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.490
 then this lack of temperature would draw poleo up by 1 to 1 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.210
 the clogged cooling system 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.549
 You'll want to take a risk. See also that taking care you have twitter before 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.570
 arrive at work 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.859
 we sometimes get a little out of work 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.200

 the cia 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.730
 last Wednesday 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.939

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.380
 would pay the bill because the notorious personal cell of the lack of decision 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.210
 yesterday that will stir the 3 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.550
 if you have a catalyst it is part of the non-efficient exhaust system 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.300
 I do not have the conversions he remembers the one he converts to co2 and h2oh 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.440

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.139
 so how do I get to see it in the Senate itself? 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.509

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.429
 the items should be working perfectly 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:30.019
