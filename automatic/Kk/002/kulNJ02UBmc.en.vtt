00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 and so this citizen we have today 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.950
 we do not pig 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.480
 dropped a flower pot yes here he is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.960
 what is left of him is recognized 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.100
 here's the hero of today i don't know how 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.300
 no one gave him 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.300
 We'll see, then handle to render 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.450
 in principle, most of it was immediately removed 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.990
 there was a trifle which slightly even 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.990
 scattered 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.890
 just that he scattered around with fanta 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.890
 to kidnap 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.060
 this revenge card. 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.060
 left work 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.370
 bring most of it already cleaned 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.370
 left alone. 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.490
 I think he will soon be with her 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.260
 the cat does not trust him yet 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.520
 this is you you 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.180
 not even a distance 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.920
 came the brazen face 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.550
 you ask for forgiveness 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.620
 do not you ask forgiveness set 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.370
 well here we are approaching crying 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.370
 does not bring 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.760
 it is you again . 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.230
 and here will not turn off 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.639
 and will carry out charging in such a way 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.080
 without a function with existence just 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.550
 dashing hopes of finding a voucher base 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.970
 open the door and see how fast he is 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.970
 or bottom 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.400
 principle, so far the manifestation is moving 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.940
 it seems to me here on the principle behind him as 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.930
 always these house the right wall of the tunnel 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.930
 come you come 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.949
 so particular 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.550
 By the way, the camera shows how these blink 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.090
 LEDs 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.090
 eyes and 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.639
 no, no where are you going to lose 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.639
 well done 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.300
 all base works 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:59.250
 now we catch a ray of light from it and no no 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:59.250
 I will not give and will begin to dock with it 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:09.390
 all the robot is charging
