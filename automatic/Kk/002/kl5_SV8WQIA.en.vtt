00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.140
 here I am making a video for 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.149
 ask for mechanical help 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.330
 a mechanical engineer to a mechanic 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.240
 that can help me this is a car 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.680
 we are in France this is a car that 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.160
 in France they do not call it time world 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.340
 Charles 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.279
 in other parts of europe elsewhere 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.940
 is this America they call it chevrolet 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.430
 kalos 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.990
 or daewoo nubira this investment gpl 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.120
 original 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.260
 then it is a car that has been bought 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.039
 to a mechanic 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.930
 the mechanic has not been able to find 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:44.150
 defect for the mechanic is a mechanic 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.000
 young not 22 25 years old 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.650
 and to see the car turn on and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.650
 it works very well 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.170
 look how you learn 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.170
 first 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.280
 then the paper car ne without any 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.780
 problem 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.210
 the minimum at the beginning was a bit 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.040
 high but then the great low 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.470
 problem from auto is that it turns off 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.490
 every so often 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.530
 most of all , the stoppages are extinguished 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.560
 then the mechanic 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.110
 and will be changed in this car is a car 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.620
 for the first time cases with money are 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.870
 this piece has changed 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.870
 the piece of glass 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.430
 the track seems to enter the gas no 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.470
 the minimum is there is a minimum 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.979
 electronic or you can not you can not 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.650
 you can manually modify it has been 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.110
 changed the air filter that he saw 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.830
 all the spark plug that has changed the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.520
 belt has been changed is a coil in 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.170
 Vienna the alternator has been changed 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.330
 has changed to another sensor because it is 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.380
 out there and the injectors will be changed 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.080
 they have been cleaned that has changed them 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.540
 author follows this problem now it is a 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.150
 half-curious problem because you can 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.670
 spend two or three days if they do not go out 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.120
 You can spend a day and it goes off 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.129
 so 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.360
 we think it is the minimum good 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.360
 whoever is here 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.040
 while I inherit it I foolishly like 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.510
 I'm not a mechanic I thought of putting a stop 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.510
 to accelerate it manually 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.090
 and so it does not go out 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.630
 and there are several theories the first theory 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.260
 is that the minimum 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.910
 the sensor is bad but they have changed it 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.050
 everything has changed then the minimum 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.080
 for me it does not respect the minimum not after 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.570
 another theory is that there is another sensor 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.980
 what is below says is something on the internet 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.830
 in a sensor that worked 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.409
 it may be that also after another 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.930
 theory may be that there is a little tube and 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.459
 from gasoline 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.459
 a strap is here 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.610
 Marines can be adjusted very much 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.540
 Marines and gasoline do not chase 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.190
 the spark plug has also been changed 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.980
 start 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.690
 and as you can see there is no problem I will 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.690
 accelerate for like that to prove it 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.599
 the minimum 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.090
 the minimum of the car problem 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.920
 the car has already warmed up a bit and for 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.290
 to see how it is at least 1 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.139
 I'm not a mechanic again I say I repeat 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.280
 but I think the minimum is correct 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.260
 but there comes a certain 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.440
 the moment the car is paid 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.440
 and stop at the red light the traffic lights 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.040
 after there is there it went out 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.210
 there was paid then to learn it not 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.110
 I know why it was paid to learn it 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.110
 learn bad 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.510
 but the person in the month has told me 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.360
 that sometimes does not turn on and you have to put 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.310
 this liquid that is a as it says in 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.260
 Spanish what is not marked in 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.040
 Spanish I have the other 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.630
 it's a motor starter you put it 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.980
 this in the air filter 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.310
 and to the touch it takes 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.220
 that problem they have seen happens in 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.960
 moments that I can tell you about 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.960
 one day they can pass twice 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.550
 but normal 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.550
 home 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.930
 even inclusive 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:57.960
 has changed is here that is the 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:03.000
 starter that you have seen before with 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.680
 what the sensor that is under the car 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.960
 has not changed not even all this has 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.360
 changed because he has gone to the cemetery 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:15.990
 of cars good eye has changed parts 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:18.380
 that are used of cars has not changed 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.380
 this 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.449
 to finish the video I need a 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.750
 urgent help from people who 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.550
 know the Korean cars you know 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.880
 of electronics that they know of 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.250
 injectors really do not know what to do 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.740
 a mechanic as I said has changed 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.490
 the injectors the sensors the valve 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.470
 Starter air filter less less 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.190
 the tube that leads from the tank 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.639
 gasoline up the projectors I've also 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.639
 changed the gas pump 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:56.699
 in exchange for everything and has been the summary has 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.960
 been that not being tested persists 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.470
 once or twice a week 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.870
 I would like to see your opinion what do you think if 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.180
 you know this car if you know in the 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.130
 mechanical manual or what can I do 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.320
 thank you very much for your information 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.060
 I will thank you very much and can you contact me 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.590
 my mail that is below the 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.590
 screen thank you
