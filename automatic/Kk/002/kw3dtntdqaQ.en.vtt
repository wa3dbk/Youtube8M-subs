it's a very snug fit which is what I
hoped<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.759> after<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.509> head<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
hoped for and after you go and head and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.100 
hoped for and after you go and head and
put<00:01:37.470> those<00:01:37.619> buttons<00:01:38.100> together<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.049> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
put those buttons together you get a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
put those buttons together you get a
real<00:01:40.409> tight<00:01:40.799> snug<00:01:41.009> fit<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.820> either
