00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
or train today I'm gonna go over some

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.049 
or train today I'm gonna go over some
technique<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.170> how<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.530> benchpress<00:00:14.059> properly

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
technique on how to benchpress properly

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.550 
technique on how to benchpress properly
now<00:00:15.719> there's<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> lot<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.080> articles<00:00:16.439> and<00:00:16.500> videos

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
now there's a lot of articles and videos

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.830 
now there's a lot of articles and videos
out<00:00:17.010> there<00:00:17.220> about<00:00:17.400> how<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> increase<00:00:18.540> your

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
out there about how to increase your

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.390 
out there about how to increase your
bench<00:00:18.960> press<00:00:19.110> weight<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.680> that's<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.920> people

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
bench press weight and that's a people

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.370 
bench press weight and that's a people
seem<00:00:20.550> most<00:00:20.700> concerned<00:00:21.150> about<00:00:21.290> you<00:00:22.290> know

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
seem most concerned about you know

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.749 
seem most concerned about you know
different<00:00:22.560> weight<00:00:22.919> voting<00:00:23.310> patterns<00:00:23.610> with

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
different weight voting patterns with

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.999 
different weight voting patterns with
the<00:00:23.849> way<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.450> you<00:00:25.020> know<00:00:25.110> are<00:00:25.410> chewing<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.830> lot

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
the way and you know are chewing a lot

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.429 
the way and you know are chewing a lot
but<00:00:26.640> I'm<00:00:26.820> gonna<00:00:26.910> show<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.990> technique

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
but I'm gonna show you what technique

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.990 
but I'm gonna show you what technique
you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.740> increase<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.130> weight<00:00:29.430> as<00:00:29.580> well<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
you can increase your weight as well and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.220 
you can increase your weight as well and
I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.060> setting<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.109> good

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
I think setting up with a good

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860 
I think setting up with a good
foundation<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:32.400> key<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.269> moving<00:00:33.629> up<00:00:33.720> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
foundation is key and moving up and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630 
foundation is key and moving up and
weight<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.350> also<00:00:34.559> keeping<00:00:35.010> everything<00:00:35.250> safe

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
weight and also keeping everything safe

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.979 
weight and also keeping everything safe
finished<00:00:35.970> off<00:00:36.120> specially<00:00:36.510> your<00:00:36.570> shoulder

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
finished off specially your shoulder

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
finished off specially your shoulder
joints<00:00:37.350> now<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.120> strength

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
joints now this is for you know strength

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.579 
joints now this is for you know strength
and<00:00:39.540> conditioning<00:00:39.870> purposes<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.440> not

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
and conditioning purposes is not

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.010 
and conditioning purposes is not
necessarily<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.250> huge<00:00:41.970> power<00:00:42.300> lifters<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
necessarily for huge power lifters that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
necessarily for huge power lifters that
need<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> compete<00:00:44.219> their<00:00:44.460> techniques<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.969> be

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
need to compete their techniques and be

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
need to compete their techniques and be
a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.570> bit<00:00:45.660> different<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> first

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
a little bit different so the first

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.180 
a little bit different so the first
thing<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> set<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:49.010> when<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> set<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:52.190> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
thing is the set up when you set up you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.440 
thing is the set up when you set up you
definitely<00:00:53.640> want<00:00:53.760> your<00:00:53.820> feet<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> ground

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
definitely want your feet on the ground

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.850 
definitely want your feet on the ground
there'll<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> people<00:00:55.410> you'll<00:00:55.680> see

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
there'll be a lot of people you'll see

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
there'll be a lot of people you'll see
when<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.129> feet<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> bench<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.300> they

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
when the feet on the bench because they

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.020 
when the feet on the bench because they
think<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.809> need<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> keep<00:00:58.199> their<00:00:58.410> back<00:00:58.590> flat

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
think they need to keep their back flat

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.189 
think they need to keep their back flat
this<00:01:00.030> may<00:01:00.180> work<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.480> little<00:01:00.570> bit<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> way

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
this may work a little bit by the way

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.689 
this may work a little bit by the way
but<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.469> happens<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.949> hips<00:01:02.190> aren't<00:01:02.430> stable

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and they're things that move around and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you're not going to have the support

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.779 
you're not going to have the support

back here depends on your bench where
your<00:01:27.840> bet<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> could<00:01:28.560> hit<00:01:29.099> the<00:01:29.130> pin<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.789> I<00:01:30.149> must

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
your bet you could hit the pin so I must

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
your bet you could hit the pin so I must
be<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.660> little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.679> bar<00:01:31.830> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
be a little bit more from the bar and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.230 
be a little bit more from the bar and
have<00:01:32.550> my<00:01:32.729> eyes<00:01:32.940> lined<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.520> next<00:01:35.880> thing<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
have my eyes lined up the next thing is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.020 
have my eyes lined up the next thing is
the<00:01:36.420> hand<00:01:36.660> grip<00:01:36.990> now<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.459> a<00:01:38.640> matter<00:01:38.910> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the hand grip now that's a matter of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.749 
the hand grip now that's a matter of
personal<00:01:39.330> preference<00:01:40.459> something<00:01:41.459> like<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
personal preference something like the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.540 
personal preference something like the
white<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.179> grip<00:01:43.190> because<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.310> bar

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
white of the grip because the bar

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.910 
white of the grip because the bar
happens<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.179> lot<00:01:45.360> shorter<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:46.380> will<00:01:46.590> push<00:01:46.770> up

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
happens a lot shorter they will push up

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.540

the<00:05:10.580> last<00:05:10.789> thing<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.180> want<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.360> think<00:05:11.419> about

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
the last thing you want to think about

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.690 
the last thing you want to think about
is<00:05:11.750> pressing<00:05:12.200> in<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.410> straight<00:05:12.680> line<00:05:12.950> I<00:05:13.400> used

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
is pressing in the straight line I used

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.120 
is pressing in the straight line I used
to<00:05:13.789> press<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.030> little<00:05:14.240> bit<00:05:14.450> backwards<00:05:15.130> towards

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
to press a little bit backwards towards

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.950 
to press a little bit backwards towards
the<00:05:16.250> rack<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.970> I<00:05:17.330> learned<00:05:17.510> that<00:05:17.630> this<00:05:17.780> isn't

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
the rack and I learned that this isn't

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.249 
the rack and I learned that this isn't
the<00:05:18.139> best

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
the best

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.929 
the best
for<00:05:19.770> strength<00:05:20.039> you<00:05:20.129> want<00:05:20.249> to<00:05:20.369> push<00:05:20.520> more<00:05:20.789> in<00:05:20.909> a

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:20.939 
for strength you want to push more in a

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.299 
for strength you want to push more in a
straight<00:05:21.210> line<00:05:21.349> it<00:05:22.349> is<00:05:22.559> common<00:05:22.949> when<00:05:23.039> I<00:05:23.099> have<00:05:23.279> a

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:23.309 
straight line it is common when I have a

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:24.769 
straight line it is common when I have a
spotter<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.789> kind<00:05:23.969> of<00:05:23.999> go<00:05:24.089> back<00:05:24.119> a<00:05:24.360> little<00:05:24.599> bit

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 
spotter to kind of go back a little bit

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.230 
spotter to kind of go back a little bit
some<00:05:25.169> people<00:05:25.379> like<00:05:25.499> powers<00:05:25.919> tend<00:05:26.399> to<00:05:26.550> driving

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
some people like powers tend to driving

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.449 
some people like powers tend to driving
a<00:05:27.509> little<00:05:27.809> bit<00:05:27.929> backwards<00:05:28.499> but<00:05:29.249> they<00:05:29.339> have

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:29.459 
a little bit backwards but they have

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.179 
a little bit backwards but they have
these<00:05:29.580> high<00:05:29.879> arches<00:05:30.360> but<00:05:31.199> what<00:05:31.349> I<00:05:31.379> do<00:05:31.469> is<00:05:31.740> now

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
these high arches but what I do is now

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:33.739 
these high arches but what I do is now
is<00:05:32.399> that<00:05:32.550> pick<00:05:32.729> a<00:05:32.759> line<00:05:32.999> kind<00:05:33.479> of<00:05:33.599> on<00:05:33.689> the

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:33.749 
is that pick a line kind of on the

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.079 
is that pick a line kind of on the
ceiling<00:05:34.080> above<00:05:34.169> me<00:05:34.529> focus<00:05:35.369> on<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.639> line<00:05:35.879> and

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089 
ceiling above me focus on that line and

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.790 
ceiling above me focus on that line and
then<00:05:36.209> try<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.449> keep<00:05:36.599> my<00:05:36.719> bar<00:05:36.959> path<00:05:37.229> as<00:05:37.469> straight

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
then try to keep my bar path as straight

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.859 
then try to keep my bar path as straight
as<00:05:37.919> possible<00:05:37.949> so<00:05:38.580> there's<00:05:38.759> no<00:05:38.969> excessive

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:39.869 
as possible so there's no excessive

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:42.469 
as possible so there's no excessive
movement<00:05:39.990> or<00:05:40.349> of<00:05:40.499> that<00:05:40.679> that<00:05:41.520> keeps<00:05:41.789> my<00:05:41.999> elbows

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
movement or of that that keeps my elbows

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.480 
movement or of that that keeps my elbows
