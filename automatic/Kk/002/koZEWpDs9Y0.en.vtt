00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.830
 and what are we going to do the characteristic 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.770
 main of this as it is the neighborhood and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.390
 we must coordinate the thumb very well 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.689
 let's do it with a the least you put the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.689
 less 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.580
 and then what you have to do is 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 principal bass fifth string 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.740
 after that same fifth string you're going to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.740
 use your little finger 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:43.250
 to make this ornament ok we go for 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.160
 steps then lowers a string and passes to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.530
 tear up the third second and 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.579
 first string but at the same time it is 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.579
 say more do this 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.370
 I'm playing the third second and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.039
 first rope 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.039
 at the same time up 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.359
 it would be low 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.090
 the ones above I remind you that that 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:17.270
 I strum that index the third string 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.469
 medium on the second annular cord in the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.979
 first rope all three at the same time 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.979
 then low 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.530
 we repeated lowered up 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.850
 okay 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.440
 right after that you're going to do is 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.590
 say with the little finger you're going to 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.830
 press here fifth string third 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 fret fifth string of being fret 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.149
 and then you're going to play the fourth string 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.570
 keeping all the time keeping 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:07.040
 the least 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:07.040
 then it is the least up 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:15.200

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.330
 and we will be slow if you need 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.250
 repeat the video to use it 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.220
 do it as many times as necessary because 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.420

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.310
