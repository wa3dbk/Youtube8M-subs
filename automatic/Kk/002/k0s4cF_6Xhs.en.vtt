fuel<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.700> they<00:03:05.790> now<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:06.090> more<00:03:06.330> money<00:03:06.600> for

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
fuel so they now have more money for

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.170 
fuel so they now have more money for

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.820

emissions<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.790> bring<00:03:15.300> health<00:03:15.510> benefits<00:03:16.050> to

create a growing local industry which in

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.800 
create a growing local industry which in
