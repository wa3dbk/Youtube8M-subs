pack into each individual level I'm not
surprised<00:04:41.960> there's<00:04:42.199> so<00:04:42.350> much<00:04:42.500> lag<00:04:42.770> but<00:04:43.580> what<00:04:43.760> I

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
surprised there's so much lag but what I

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.490 
surprised there's so much lag but what I
am<00:04:44.000> surprised<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.660> are<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.080> incredible
