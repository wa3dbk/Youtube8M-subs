00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.850
 Getúlio de Oliveira de Mines Para 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.540
 Wondering Why Acai Seeds 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.640
 who planted did not germinate his 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.920
 here in this aviary of the Amazonian embrapa 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.770
 we find the seedlings that the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.210
 Sir, you've been trying to do without success. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.770
 Look how good they are already. 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.570
 crescidas and the tree in full production 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.340
 your brother who will respond to your 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.280
 The letter is the researcher. 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.039
 uranium because the seeds of 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.069
 açaí are not germinating is the problem 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.440
 of açaí seed is that unlike the 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:43.989
 most of the species we know 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.010
 they do not end when they are submitted 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.769
 in drying 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.649
 then you have to have seeds 9 in the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.049
 This is true with about 75% 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.530
 of the species because the entire Amazon 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:58.780
 but then there is coasur and many others 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.760
 now will your getulio go 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.069
 able to receive seeds in conditions 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.440
 from planting side of acre to mines is 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:08.260
 as long as he maintains the excellent 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.910
 together for so much must blend the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:16.600
 mix after being stripped mix with 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:21.090
 the cerrado can still be ragen or with 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.680
 sand the lita covenant mixtures also 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.420
 complete the package you meet with 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.090
 this material that we are mixing 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.940
 it 's slightly 1 if we press 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.730
 the hand will not get wet right 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.590
 closes the packing and sends it to the place 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.470
 where he will have to arrive this 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.420
 procedure guarantees and 25 30 days 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.340
 the seeds in good condition what he 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.430
 It can not be too long. 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.290
 for example from 30 to 40 days 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.820
 because the seed not germinated within the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.280
 own packaging here she's in. 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.800
 of the hardware is the one already with 45 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.150
 Days already come to me to hit many. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.860
 thinner times 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.560
 some of these seeds you can still 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.120
 you take to form the molt so 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.350
 getulio receive it already has to 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.390
 planting it has to serve the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.229
 and immediately a little bag of 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.939
 plastic 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.110
 now how do you get here? 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.150
 from fruit to seed 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.220
 already without guilt he has three procedures 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.320
 for large amounts of 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.300
 seed he has to make the videos of the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.180
 machines. 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.030
 used to excuse acai another 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.010
 procedure is he use a sieve he 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.320
 will whistle the fruits with the sieve 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.690
 in this process he has that before is 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.940
 keep the fruits immersed in water during 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.800
 two to three hours so that there is an 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.230
 softening of little for quantity 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.670
 much smaller if only he can make the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.290
 removal of the pulp with the knife 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.540
 manually, right? 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.330
 in such a way that this little is 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.190
 completely removed after it removes the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.650
 he should wash the seeds and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.080
 immediately mix with the substrate 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.170
 one should use a mixture of three 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.980
 parts of sunshine and two bed parts of the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.989
 trip 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.940
 this mixture with this source of 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.700
 organic matter is sufficient to 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.860
 a few years without any need or 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.200
 type of fertilization was not until the fashion is 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.810
 complete form of minimum size 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.390
 bag to form açaí seedlings is 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.970
 15 centimeters wide and 35 centimeters wide 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.700
 cm tall should the sower 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.000
 to be done superficially makes a 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.530
 small cup in the center of the bag 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.959
 places the seed and covers it with soil 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.480
 It's just a semi access to it because 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.390
 usually the germination of açaí since 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.860
 that he adopt the procedures 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.260
 recommended for the transport of 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.739
 seeds it presents the germination is 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.709
 exceeded 80% in some Member States. 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.640
 cases until the daily irrigation section 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:52.640
 and wait four to six months for the muse 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.950
 is completely formed here already 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.470
 is four months exactly one 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.910
 in this condition can already be planted 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.640
 Definitive location 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.950
 And how long will your getúlio have? 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.380
 that wait until you have the fruit of the acai berry 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.269
 his property here in the Amazon where 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.130
 it counts good conditions for the 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.820
 three and a half years from the 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.820
 four years
