00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.270
 for me the multimedia are very 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.060
 important because they are the ones we 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.779
 lead to analyze the information of a 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.580
 different way now we have 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.550
 millions of data to just a click of 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.699
 distance and I consider that it is the way 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.390
 the main one in which you could perform 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.610
 a truly educational revolution 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.310
 with a view to the new century of 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.060
 information 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.060
 the 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:51.079
 for me the knowledge in the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.030
 cyberspace is the most special thing inside 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.430
 of any investigation even if it 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.680
 is watching a movie or if you are 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.379
 enjoying a series there is information 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.320
 through multimedia today too 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.470
 they are very important because 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.020
 allows to have information of many 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.450
 sources allows us to share it 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.990
 allows you to find trends with other 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.990
 people 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.920
 one online is an application that we create 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.550
 to facilitate the construction of 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.290
 Knowledge works with an interface 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.020
 geographical map and a timeline 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.170
 combined inviting the user to 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.180
 develop their abilities to create and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 to analyze the information we 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.260
 we create or also with the goal of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.690
 help the kids to have a 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.060
 knowledge construction and create 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:53.610
 the information that does not simply copy 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:55.620
 and paste space for us 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.020
 time and the event allows you to 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.760
 the person perform better what is being 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.740
 researching and thinking more 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.750
 this can be located as in any 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.100
 Matter without for math to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.070
 social not only for 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.320
 historiography so then not only 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.660
 multimedia information is included 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.120
 can grab images from the internet 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.920
 texts videos but also associates 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.440
 with the place where things happened 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.440
 and also the moment they happened 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.950
 the greatest satisfaction of these lines has 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.629
 been that the students liked it 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.879
 teachers who expect to see a 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.980
 OthÃ³n line growth do not expect that 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.870
 stay there we have achieved a 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.969
 considerable amount of users and 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.739
 we know there are people after a 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.450
 year already having thrown it that still 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.599
 continue to use to perform their 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.599
 chores 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.460
 ah 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.440
 to
