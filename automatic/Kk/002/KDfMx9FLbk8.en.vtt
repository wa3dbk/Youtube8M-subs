potatoes all cooked it took me about 45
minutes<00:00:31.289> exactly<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.160> them<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.550> soft<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
minutes exactly to get them as soft as I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.870 
minutes exactly to get them as soft as I
want<00:00:33.120> them<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.540> sometimes<00:00:34.290> let<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> go<00:00:34.880> when

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
want them to I sometimes let it go when

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.729 
want them to I sometimes let it go when
and<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.120> forget<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.590> not<00:00:37.710> that

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and I forget because it's just not that

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.830 
and I forget because it's just not that
important<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.280> long<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.730> soft<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.180> hard

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
important as long as it's soft it's hard

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450 
important as long as it's soft it's hard
to<00:00:39.930> overcook<00:00:40.290> unless<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.800> run<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.129> stock

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to overcook unless you run out of stock

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.750 
to overcook unless you run out of stock
so<00:00:41.670> um<00:00:42.170> here's<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.290> immersion<00:00:43.860> blender<00:00:44.190> can

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it'll be loud when I start I start

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
it'll be loud when I start I start
blending<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.400> then<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.549> kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.820> tilt<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> pot

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
blending and then I kind of tilt the pot

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.450 
blending and then I kind of tilt the pot
to<00:01:18.479> make<00:01:18.600> sure<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.960> everything<00:01:19.710> gets<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.100> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
to make sure that everything gets in you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.910 
to make sure that everything gets in you
can<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.060> has<00:01:21.090> those<00:01:21.619> openings<00:01:22.619> there

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
can see that it has those openings there

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
can see that it has those openings there
and<00:01:23.369> make<00:01:23.549> sure<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.180> below<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and make sure that that is below the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.289 
and make sure that that is below the
water<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> soup<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
water or the soup or it's going to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.100 
water or the soup or it's going to
splash<00:01:27.689> everywhere

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
splash everywhere

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:47.099 
splash everywhere
so<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:28.860> is

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.330 

just<00:01:48.109> a<00:01:48.200> note<00:01:48.380> before<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:48.679> start<00:01:48.920> tilting<00:01:49.130> it

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
just a note before I start tilting it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.950 
just a note before I start tilting it
you<00:01:49.460> can<00:01:49.609> tell<00:01:49.759> my<00:01:49.880> suits<00:01:50.119> still<00:01:50.359> really<00:01:50.780> hot

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
you can tell my suits still really hot

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.719 
you can tell my suits still really hot
you<00:01:51.140> can<00:01:51.319> do<00:01:51.439> this<00:01:51.560> with<00:01:51.770> any<00:01:52.009> temperature<00:01:52.520> of

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
you can do this with any temperature of

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:16.190 
you can do this with any temperature of
anything<00:01:53.329> it<00:01:53.749> doesn't<00:01:53.929> make<00:01:54.140> any<00:01:54.289> difference

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.230 

you<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.310> my<00:02:17.460> pots<00:02:17.730> pretty<00:02:17.970> shallow

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
I'm not not using much of the pot so I
