is expected he keeps trying to use the W
distortion<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.990> then<00:01:53.289> they<00:01:53.409> ultimate

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
distortion and then they ultimate

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.219 
distortion and then they ultimate
distortion<00:01:54.579> keep<00:01:55.030> trying<00:01:55.359> to<00:01:55.509> poke<00:01:55.780> see<00:01:55.990> lying

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
distortion keep trying to poke see lying

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.160 
distortion keep trying to poke see lying
down<00:01:56.409> keep<00:01:57.039> trying<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.460> maybe<00:01:57.609> W<00:01:58.329> forward<00:01:58.780> use

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
down keep trying to maybe W forward use

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.380

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
his cue and ultimate cue so he doesn't

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.919 
his cue and ultimate cue so he doesn't
have<00:02:01.539> any<00:02:02.069> way<00:02:03.069> to<00:02:03.130> actually<00:02:03.490> escape<00:02:03.999> so<00:02:04.659> here
