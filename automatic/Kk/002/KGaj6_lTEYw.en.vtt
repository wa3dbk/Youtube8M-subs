00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.020
 hello to everyone as promised we continue 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.820
 doing reviews on games resonance which 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.550
 left in the group and and the next game is 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.470
 gives effect 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.260
 Today we will consider its unity engine 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.980
 something like 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:39.530
 q space that is essentially it is on 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.890
 his parody account here is not to choose 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:49.370
 I will actually 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.560
 scary shot to enough 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.650
 high-quality graphics are quite low 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.520
 resource requirements opportunity 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:03.820
 conservation that undoubtedly pleases that is 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.820
 You can go here any bonuses 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.439
 let's continue now literally 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.659
 a moment we run see how it all 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.140
 looks and will finish what 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.520
 like the sound in the game 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.340
 when playing headphones really 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.929
 scary 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.090
 interesting graphics all at the level of such 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.090
 quake or doom do not even know 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.750
 here shows us that we come to life 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.509
 Simplify this toy played at all 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:44.680
 a little bit that is to say that's started so 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:50.290
 here we go somewhere here you can 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.430
 set 2 and here look for 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.430
 shotgun recovered 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.990
 all recovered already scary so 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.990
 as people are nowhere to be found 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.260
 let's go down well not really 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.260
 liked even more than grandfather space 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:27.970
 here we select 1 already we select money 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.970
 as they will be useful to us 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.530
 not general then let's go ahead meet 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.560
 any enemy and see what of 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.730
 this will come out 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:45.230
 that is, there you already somewhere someone yelling 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:50.900
 again support here we go nowhere 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:55.900
 we can there a lot of blood from below go to the elevator 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.900
 and feel now we will meet someone 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.480
 these are the flying cameras 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:12.720

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.409
 pick up such a gun 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.519
 I will say at once the cartridges are very fast 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.519
 run out and unfortunately it is unpleasant 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.989
 wreck these zombies right not some 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.989
 not killed 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.730

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.690

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.240
 half health posobirali the tournament 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.750

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.580
 that is, here's how you see you need to walk 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:13.390
 collect all sorts of things I just like that 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.290
 become nervous eat and began to sweat 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:21.070
 really a very atmospheric game 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.070
 see how the light goes out everything shakes 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:29.950

 understand what will happen next and in fact 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:21.190
