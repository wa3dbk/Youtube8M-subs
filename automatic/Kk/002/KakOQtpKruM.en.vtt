these options right here we're gonna

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.840 
these options right here we're gonna
configure<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.799> make<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> white<00:01:11.250> background

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
white and then to the point where you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.640 
white and then to the point where you
should<00:01:33.180> still<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.600> body<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.380> face

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.760 
to go into shadows and highlights and
from<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.479> first<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:45.960> called<00:01:46.290> darks

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
from here the first one is called darks

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
from here the first one is called darks
you<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> bring<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> darks<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.420> try

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
to make the darks as dark as you can try

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it is the better the galaxies would look

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.460 
it is the better the galaxies would look
on<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.079> got<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.259> these

you want but I prefer the hair so for

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.770 
you want but I prefer the hair so for
this<00:02:49.160> one<00:02:49.340> I'm<00:02:49.430> actually<00:02:49.550> gonna<00:02:49.820> just<00:02:50.090> turn<00:02:50.540> it

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
this one I'm actually gonna just turn it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.620 
this one I'm actually gonna just turn it
this<00:02:50.900> way<00:02:52.480> zoom<00:02:53.480> back<00:02:53.750> in<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.320> put<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:56.390> top

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
this way zoom back in and put it on top

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.870 
this way zoom back in and put it on top
like<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.280> looks<00:02:58.460> better

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880

now if you see that it gives you that
fading<00:03:04.190> effect<00:03:04.580> kind<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.210> like<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.330> smoky

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
fading effect kind of like a smoky

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.680 
fading effect kind of like a smoky
galaxy<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.800> make<00:03:07.430> sure<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.820> highlight

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
galaxy and make sure the highlight

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.870 
galaxy and make sure the highlight
starts<00:03:09.140> at<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.770> tip<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> your<00:03:10.370> hair<00:03:10.580> if<00:03:10.760> you're

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
starts at the tip of your hair if you're

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.360 
starts at the tip of your hair if you're
turning<00:03:11.180> sideways<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:12.260> you're<00:03:12.500> pointing

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
turning sideways if you're pointing

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.449 
turning sideways if you're pointing
front<00:03:14.330> words<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:14.840> can<00:03:15.050> put<00:03:15.290> two<00:03:15.709> galaxies<00:03:16.250> one

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
front words you can put two galaxies one

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.790 
front words you can put two galaxies one
from<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.790> side<00:03:17.030> one<00:03:17.270> from<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.600> side<00:03:17.870> or<00:03:18.320> you

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
from the side one from that side or you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.650 
from the side one from that side or you
can<00:03:18.920> just<00:03:19.040> get<00:03:19.190> creative<00:03:19.459> with<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.180> now

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
can just get creative with it and now

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.080 
can just get creative with it and now
you're<00:03:20.930> basically<00:03:21.410> done<00:03:21.739> but<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.489> wanna<00:03:22.730> keep

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
you're basically done but you wanna keep

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.760 
you're basically done but you wanna keep
going<00:03:23.330> with<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.660> galaxies<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.290> adding<00:03:24.560> more

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
going with the galaxies and adding more

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.770 
going with the galaxies and adding more
on<00:03:24.980> your<00:03:25.100> body<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.820> can<00:03:25.970> still<00:03:26.390> do<00:03:26.600> that

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
on your body but you can still do that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.330
