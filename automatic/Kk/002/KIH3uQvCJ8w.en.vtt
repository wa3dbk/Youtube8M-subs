00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.560
 hello everyone i want to talk about 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.529
 how to deceive the brain begin with 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960
 illusions that such and people and people from 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.539
 latin word illusion delusion 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.930
 deception distorted perception is real 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.060
 existing object or phenomenon 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.130
 ambiguous 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.520
 interpretation of illusions are the most 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.649
 different physical connected with acting 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.140
 in the world by the objective laws of physics 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.629
 for example, optical illusion 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.500
 a teaspoon immersed in a glass with 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.239
 water is perceived as cracked 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 optical people mistakes in the visual 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.530
 perceptions caused by inaccuracies or 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.360
 inadequate processes are not 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.210
 conscious collection of visual 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.609
 image for example if you want to say what 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.440
 either object through crops yes skok then 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.290
 due to device generated 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.299
 negative free people 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.000
 gets the opportunity to observe the effect and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.960
 reverse perspective 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 sound illusions like thinner about eda 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.820
 physiologically 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.430
 associated with features then not 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.100
 physical or central links 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 analyzers of human sense organs 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.140
 for example, if you raise several times 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.000
 at the same time with both hands a pair 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.579
 various items and then 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.640
 another pair of items of the same mass 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.890
 then the thing turned out to be in the hand in which 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.530
 before it was easier to seem 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.070
 heavier than the subject being 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.649
 triangle affective arise under 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.049
 the influence of pronounced mood swings 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.409
 or due to its emerging 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.600
 anxiety anxiety verbally 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.689
 arise as a result of the distorted 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.820
 perception of real conversations 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.610
 surrounding people 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.290
 organic metamorpho psy and distorted 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.689
 visual perception flagship 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.850
 enhanced spatial colors 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.899
 location resting state or 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.009
 movements 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.280
 real-life subject 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.440
 distinguished by the morning metamorphs obs 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.319
 the feeling of changing the shape of the parts 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.900
 own body and their metamorph 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.030
 pussy 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.830
 violation of perceptions of others 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.350
 items this kind of disorders 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.340
 perception can be observed not only in 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.530
 mentally ill 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.290
 but also mentally healthy people with 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.330
 eye organ pathology 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.150
 illusion of perceived sti embodied 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.510
 perceived sti feeling next 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.690
 supposedly someone is this kind of illusion 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.739
 highlighted by jasper himself according to the author 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.480
 this kind of illusions 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.970
 is a sign of formation 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.370
 hallucinations and delusions 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.040
 sometimes doric functional illusions 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.560
 special kind and people ready from the complex 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.989
 patterns on the carpet and ground glass 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.980
 arise and develop gradually 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.319
 complex fantastic pictures here you 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.500
 several illusions optical illusion 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.959
 created by kris in the table on the table is worth 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.310
 cup next to which stands the course 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.400
 little cup 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.500
 however, on closer examination 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.290
 we can see what is actually a cube 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.140
 cups are painted exactly the same 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.829
 the size of a similar answer is only noticed 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.019
 at a certain angle if you show this 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.269
 picture of the children they will see the graph 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.030
 dolphins but its meaning sees something 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.280
 the other is because memory 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.739
 children have no images of your 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.930
 your life picture you wrote 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.650
 sandra delta this is so called 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.200
 a dolphin love message which one 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.959
 orange circles more seems that 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.329
 right and in fact they are the same 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.329
 usually the brain does a good job 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.590
 comparing the size of the subject and the definition 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:03.380
 distances to them but it can be fooled 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.030
 Well , you probably rested and now 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.489
 i will try to fool your brain 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.820
 try to answer without thinking 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:16.959
 so what is the first color paper white 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.859
 what color is the cloud white 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:26.530
 what color doctor's robe is also white what 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:28.599
 drinks no one whom you drink water 99 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.539
 percent of people watching this video 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.819
 the answer is not milk however whom you drink 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.340
 water further 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.410
 calculation is always difficult but now 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.240
 try to answer quickly you do not 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.000
 need no pen no paper no 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:54.070
 calculator just answer and 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:05:00.880
 61 plus 5 78 plus 985 plus 13 126 plus 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:04.030
 15 137 plus 21 now quickly guess 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.520
 tools color is a red hammer 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.590
 if i'm wrong then you come in two 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.740
 percent of people with substandard thinking 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:19.120
 and another which is equal to 2 in the square which 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.590
 equals 3 squared and now equals 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.039
 square angle 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.620
 did not understand this is not a review your brain already 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.020
 accustomed to computing and the last question 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.680
 connected to geometry is an angle in a square 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.610
 equal to 90 degrees this phenomenon is possible 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.789
 conditionally call 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.440
 brain inertia on this all i hope you 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.599
 liked this new heading 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.599
 thank you all for watching bye
