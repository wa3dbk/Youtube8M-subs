00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
ranked in top 0.5% so rather than the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.290 
ranked in top 0.5% so rather than the
top<00:01:51.300> 1000<00:01:52.290> they<00:01:52.380> increase<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.300> the

that could achieve cable when point five

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
that could achieve cable when point five
percent<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.300> actually<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.630> pretty<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:03.990> number

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
percent is actually a pretty good number

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.190 
percent is actually a pretty good number
and<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:06.120> it's<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.420> than<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.690> thousand

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and I think it's more than a thousand

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
and I think it's more than a thousand
who<00:02:07.920> knows<00:02:08.130> nowadays<00:02:08.580> what<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:08.820> number<00:02:09.060> is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
who knows nowadays what the number is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.860 
who knows nowadays what the number is
but<00:02:09.420> yeah<00:02:09.990> so<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.500> top<00:02:11.150> 0.5<00:02:12.150> could<00:02:12.480> get<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
but yeah so the top 0.5 could get it and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.630 
but yeah so the top 0.5 could get it and
I<00:02:12.900> was<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.110> 1400<00:02:13.860> last<00:02:14.010> time<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.430> it'd
