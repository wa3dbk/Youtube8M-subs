00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.550
 Pulkovo highway originates from the square 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.679
 wins and ends at the intersection with 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.599
 Volkonsky highway along the highway there and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.799
 long- built residential areas and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.700
 territory of new housing 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.560
 construction 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.060
 besides developers have big plans 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.710
 on land development adjacent 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.300
 Pulkovo Observatory we decided 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.410
 look comfortable lies along 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.939
 Pulkovo Highway 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.350
 and the manager helped us in this 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.180
 regional branch of the organization 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.180
 green cross Yuri Shevchuk 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.340
 historical this territory has always been 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.739
 and remains borderline between Petersburg 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.510
 and suburbs today Pulkovskoye SCO is 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.830
 major highway which leads to 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.239
 the airport and the neighboring region 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.550
 Leningrad region 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.920
 This is the old border of the city and often here 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.670
 swept up the trash from Petersburg so from 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.949
 surroundings 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.110
 today spontaneous dumps are not here 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.090
 left so microdistrict between Pulkovo 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.309
 highway and fifth pride port thoroughfare 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.470
 long built and landscaped here 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.790
 and kindergartens and schools and the boulevard which 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.680
 is a green buffer between 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.380
 highway and residential neighborhoods 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.880
 so what is quite comfortable here 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.920
 on the other side of the Pulkovo highway on 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.660
 the intersection with the Danube Avenue is 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.610
 active residential construction here 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.650
 the main enemies of the environment 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.600
 are car exhaust and 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.250
 Pulkovo and Danube one of the most 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.050
 busiest highways in the city 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.630
 we have repeatedly told in our and to 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.440
 negative impact reports 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.240
 motor transport to the air here 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.400
 the park of hero-cities is located 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.870
 and green areas reduce in part 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.870
 harmful effects of cars 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.530
 Territory development prospects along 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.420
 Pulkovo highway associated with large-scale 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.250
 projects at the intersection the mainline of 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.840
 Volkhonskoe highway here next to 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.390
 Pulkovo Observatory in the territory 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.770
 240 hectares are going to build two with 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.930
 half a million square meters 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.090
 housing as well as social and commercial 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.100
 infrastructure true neighborhood next 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.380
 Quarterly doubtful so on Volkhonsky 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.240
 the highway is a landfill landfill solid 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.160
 domestic waste is now closed or 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.380
 potential hazard is cultivated 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.180
 for the environment he is still 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.310
 represents according to environmentalists 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.740
 bastard masses are formed 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.390
 methane which can ignite burning 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.640
 gas enhances critical state 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.050
 air over the landfill and this despite 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.850
 reclamation work 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.520
 subject to the creation of gas tap 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.500
 it will take 50 60 years to 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.750
 solid waste landfill on 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.270
 the volkhonka became absolutely safe for 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.280
 environment location is also near 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.260
 the southern cemetery is located one of the most 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.580
 major in petersburg but on ecology she 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.580
 no effect 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.810
 territory along the Pulkovo Highway 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.550
 quite comfortable for living here is good 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.810
 infrastructure developed a lot of shopping 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.970
 complexes not bad transport 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.190
 availability in newly constructed residential 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.440
 Real estate developers are planning to create 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.970
 and kindergartens and schools but ecological 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.570
 the situation still leaves much to be 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.550
 the best 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.560
 as stressed Yuri Shevchuk Clean 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.360
 there is no air here it is not nature 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.740
 Catherine Semchenko romance horns and 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.740
