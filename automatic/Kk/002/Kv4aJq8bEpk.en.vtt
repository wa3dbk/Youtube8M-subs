00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
called the Petzl elight and the reason

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630 
called the Petzl elight and the reason
for<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.260> well<00:00:25.470> first<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.099> comes<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
for this well first of all it comes in a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.939 
for this well first of all it comes in a
waterproof<00:00:27.180> case<00:00:27.449> that's<00:00:28.050> waterproof<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.920> to

waterproof case that's waterproof up to
one<00:00:29.369> meters<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.119> has<00:00:30.240> an<00:00:30.390> attachment<00:00:30.689> loop

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
one meters and it has an attachment loop

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.410 
one meters and it has an attachment loop
here<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.669> importance<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> having<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
here now the importance of having a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.180 
here now the importance of having a
backup<00:00:33.780> light<00:00:33.989> obviously<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.920> main

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
backup light obviously if your main

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
backup light obviously if your main
light<00:00:35.460> fails<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> backup<00:00:36.660> but

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
light fails on you you have a backup but

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
light fails on you you have a backup but
let's<00:00:37.380> say<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.860> out<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> hike<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.579> lasts

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
let's say you go out for a hike it lasts

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
flying yourself in the dark you have a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.410 
flying yourself in the dark you have a
light<00:00:42.930> source<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.770> weighs<00:00:44.040> 28<00:00:44.670> grams<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
light source this weighs 28 grams and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.220 
light source this weighs 28 grams and
operates<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.960> two<00:00:46.879> 2032<00:00:47.879> CR<00:00:48.329> batteries<00:00:48.840> always

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you have different modes over here so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
you have different modes over here so
you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.460> five<00:01:17.880> modes<00:01:18.210> depending<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.350> which

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
you have five modes depending on which

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
you have five modes depending on which
mode<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.280> anywhere<00:01:20.549> between<00:01:20.700> 45<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
mode you can go anywhere between 45 to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.050 
mode you can go anywhere between 45 to
35<00:01:21.840> hours<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> first<00:01:22.740> mode<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.549> economy

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
35 hours so the first mode the economy

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.109 
35 hours so the first mode the economy
it's<00:01:24.210> 45<00:01:24.720> hours<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.340> shines<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> 11

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
it's 45 hours and it shines up to 11

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.490 
it's 45 hours and it shines up to 11
meters<00:01:27.240> second<00:01:28.200> max<00:01:28.610> 35<00:01:29.610> hours<00:01:29.970> 19<00:01:30.479> meters<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
meters second max 35 hours 19 meters you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.789 
meters second max 35 hours 19 meters you
have<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> signal<00:01:32.159> mode<00:01:34.070> like<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:36.350> red<00:01:37.350> single

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
have the signal mode like so red single

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.580 
have the signal mode like so red single
mode<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:39.500> red<00:01:40.500> max<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.840> now<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.140> head

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
mode and red max like so now this head

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
mode and red max like so now this head
torch<00:01:43.920> will<00:01:44.100> operate<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.820> minus<00:01:45.210> 30

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
torch will operate up to minus 30

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.690 
torch will operate up to minus 30
degrees<00:01:45.840> C<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.409> really<00:01:46.649> practical<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
degrees C so that's really practical and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.810 
degrees C so that's really practical and
another<00:01:48.000> great<00:01:48.600> feature<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.729> you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
another great feature on it is that you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.060
