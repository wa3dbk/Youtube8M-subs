00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:20.939
 And there you go, everything beauty here is the locus and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.150
 very basic autoproducer today because I 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.720
 I have a pc for a long time and that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 I happen to want to show you how 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 is that it takes some of the led from the computer 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.590
 For example, I have an accountant. 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.590
 four years then and when you open the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.680
 file you create another file that 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.489
 stored in a part of your 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.890
 computer 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.450
 I ask will taking will have on defense 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.960
 it will weigh a lot 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.969
 so I've done it once and it worked out 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.910
