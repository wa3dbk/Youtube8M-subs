00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.350
 This video shows the training of healthy prisoners 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.350
 It has been prepared for the purpose of promotion of contribution activities 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.500
 It's a short video but it's slow 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.380
 So blade Letts contribution 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.410
 I am a volunteer for citizenship in the desert 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.410
 It is a guy called enemy ground invasion 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 I have detected the response of the pear garden 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.050
 Please secure the peers and transport them early 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.200

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.400

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.290
 We give access to HA access to resources 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.290

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.530
 I wonder if Billy flew 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.570
 It looks okay 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:33.310
 It is unreasonable to aim at all the citizens because it is late 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.420
 Kill from the 3 o'clock direction enemy 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.770

 Believe that your companions will protect you 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:57.060
 Shizuka- san's hard work, I'm aiming straight forward from here onwards 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.060

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.760

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:31.830
 We were able to convey well Let's wait for the next citizen while watching the war situation 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.450
 Pom 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:45.920
 We move on to citizen's transportation in place where we got over our mind 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:50.350
 You can not move without using a kite in high places day 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.350
 How did citizens move? 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:01.030
 This cutting-off Tekikage in the 9 o'clock direction 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.030
 Just a thin road so you won't run into it 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.269
 I 'm alone and I'm already behind you 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.540

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.540
