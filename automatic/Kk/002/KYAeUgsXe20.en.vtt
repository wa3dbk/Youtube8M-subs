it seems as though some researchers have

it seems as though some researchers have

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
talked to you today about the school

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.160 
talked to you today about the school
uniform<00:04:02.950> why<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.010> became<00:04:04.520> popular<00:04:05.110> why<00:04:06.110> is

uniform why it became popular why is

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.930 
uniform why it became popular why is
school<00:04:06.680> uniform<00:04:07.280> should<00:04:07.670> not<00:04:08.180> be<00:04:08.510> worn<00:04:08.810> and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
school uniform should not be worn and

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.610 
school uniform should not be worn and

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
what research statistics show in my

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.789 
what research statistics show in my
personal<00:04:16.190> opinion<00:04:16.729> I<00:04:17.000> think<00:04:17.510> school<00:04:18.169> uniform

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
personal opinion I think school uniform

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.719 
personal opinion I think school uniform
should<00:04:19.190> be<00:04:19.520> banished<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:21.530> seems<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:22.190> hold<00:04:22.430> our

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
should be banished it seems to hold our

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.740 
should be banished it seems to hold our
children<00:04:23.419> back<00:04:23.690> on<00:04:23.960> their<00:04:24.200> individuality<00:04:24.890> I

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
children back on their individuality I

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.950 
children back on their individuality I
don't<00:04:26.750> have<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.050> child<00:04:27.320> but<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.729> did<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.390> would

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
don't have a child but if I did I would

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.500 
don't have a child but if I did I would
want<00:04:30.169> him<00:04:30.440> or<00:04:30.590> her<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:31.130> express<00:04:31.610> his<00:04:32.090> or<00:04:32.390> her

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
want him or her to express his or her

want him or her to express his or her
self<00:04:33.229> I<00:04:33.849> do<00:04:34.849> however<00:04:35.330> think<00:04:35.660> there<00:04:36.169> should<00:04:36.410> be

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
self I do however think there should be

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.409 
self I do however think there should be
a<00:04:36.560> dress<00:04:36.919> code<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.669> know<00:04:38.599> how<00:04:38.840> kids<00:04:39.110> are<00:04:39.380> today

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
a dress code you know how kids are today

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.100 
a dress code you know how kids are today
low-cut<00:04:41.419> shirt<00:04:42.190> short<00:04:43.190> shorts<00:04:44.030> maybe<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.810> belly

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
low-cut shirt short shorts maybe a belly

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.620 
button turn there shall we the back side
I<00:04:49.840> think<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.169> dress<00:04:51.470> code<00:04:51.890> but<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:52.849> don't

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630

I think the dress code but I don't
really<00:04:54.169> think<00:04:54.320> that's<00:04:56.800> my<00:04:57.800> opinion

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520
