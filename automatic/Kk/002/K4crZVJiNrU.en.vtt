00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.359
 that's best that's hard because you will be releasing very quickly 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.659
 the queen in one year 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:17.689
 Dutch 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.630
 and the cpb another child 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.220
 I was left in a year 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.699
 when I broke through 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.029
 surfers paradise extremely young 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.400
 but I have to say there is a characteristic a few years later 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.100
 the style is not that it is at the start to look at what we have options 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.230
 see it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.290
 as long as you make a report at the start 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.740
 and as a win 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.910
 it is reminiscent of the past 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.590
 I was more naive and took time to actually get there all later 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.180
 what these starters for example the first to change 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 so that also has that cooler cool nature 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.540
 from his friend 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.760
 in addition, it all came later 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.620
 but again that the most important language 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.430
 I think you think you are often the one with talent but we can 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 to have 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.709
 a large package of actors 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:05.150
 strength and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.450
 A chip's character and personality soon touched like the school boys 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.020
 killed 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.420
 the old generation 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.160
 he knows what it's all about he knows what to do for it 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.440
 and if you don't 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.010
 the she trains looking up and hard I think he is the youngest of him 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.240
 everyone he thinks is the hardest terrain of everyone 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.520
 And there are many people who have the member council who think real go-getter if you do it 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.490
 a super talent might win that automatically 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.240
 but this says unizo that's real 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.720
 that give way and take precedence 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.840
 and I have to say we used to do that too 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.250
 but why pay 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.640
 so offense pd against each other temporarily 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.810
 wherever you run together and Kurdish training and salt the met 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.900
 Jeffrey only the now there is a bit harder 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.430
 March a good team to keep the sun going 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.960
 I think that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.880
 yes that the really the spectacle 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.240
 say yes to those achievements 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.910
 I think the males studied 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.090
 and the character of van jeffrey 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.860
 and the talent of him 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.500
 age plays that real role there 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.680
 he quickly scored something for you, he is fit 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.599
 sounds good gives nothing to walk 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.599
 so that age is not without ever 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.029
 have to say 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.799
 it is not decisive our friends will be driving on one at the age of six 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:20.759
 forest needed 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:25.099
 everything goes international all equal so you think it's just as much 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.999
 experience as the average mx2 campaign leader 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.489
 so in terms of you they also no problem 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.449
 so it's a nice thing that the boys 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.579
 I only hope that we have the future 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.969
 is therefore trying to get better 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.019
 smoking technically 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.819
 and also more constant it's just really absolute top 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.499
 the first grand prix 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.499
 then I could qualify to I immediately had a few points 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.090
 So that is quite clearly different Jeffrey driving with part 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.999
 for anp 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.110
 then we had league in the netherlands 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.640
 there was immediately a month ago 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.679
 stevensbeek 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.499
 rd won but different 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:04.649
 then welcome I am on an equal and equal and is like you as the serbian 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.789
 valkenswaard and 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.339
 the voices on the steroids are too short 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.709
 of course there anyway 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.279
 a minimum of years in all connections to the other lanes 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.559
 and Jeffrey Thys on the older men already pretty shot 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.729
 I was a little short 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.749
 mark those differences are small 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.649
 and that's really big advantage of serbia 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.659
 so I think that has the e3 rolling 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.719
 from my plan of this 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.739
 mr there is really one and and now the new regime again statistics 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.329
 he speaks delivered 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.189
 from the colts at school mentality the student is the ideal in all com 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.540
 Yes definitely 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.629
 Both of them came to thank Kate thereby doing his forwarded percent 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.759
 van der starre tnt have to pay 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:51.849
 and a good one above the rest and that is what older borrowing is a difficult one 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.529
 to lay 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.279
 try if your competitors are 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.079
 he uttered 2 to 3 seconds of driving 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.200
 and this one between hard to explain rest to make it april in it 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.689
 you can just that little bit more 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.290
 the commercials is perfect to know that 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.750
 the opening will next year it was a year longer 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.959
 from psv 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.730
 but perfect for a change 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.730
 immediately drive up the future 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.159
 the title 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.499
 True it used to be different where makes us all match 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.259
 but a runner throughout the home 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.629
 full has the first and pull was 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.900
 which was then the alternative that I have 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.870
 and on the motorbike preud'homme every Wednesday 19 years too low 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.319
 earlier Wednesday twice 45 minutes 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.330
 eighty percent of the time on the same job spocks each other and also in full 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.050
 maximum so yes but looked up affordable 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.490
 search but you're left with 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.040
 he am learning language natale hard reason 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.380
 and mrs and those men who are one here 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.729
 play a role together 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.370
 also p must always train and yet syria eventually also in the world cup 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.339
 you should not be afraid of losing I think he lived in the house and there 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:56.710
 comes the tarzan must always go in all areas 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.090
 to finally reach the real top 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.279
 yes he just 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.659
 I have to try to improve myself 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.990
 there are just as many that many different weaknesses 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.249
 and then you really have to improve an end 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:11.499
 if you do that 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:12.909
 then then 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:13.839
 anp will be fine
