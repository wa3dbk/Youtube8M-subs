00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
rid of one of the simpler headaches when

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.960 
rid of one of the simpler headaches when
you're<00:00:14.519> putting<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> tower<00:00:16.670> it's<00:00:17.670> hard<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
you're putting in the tower it's hard to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.510 
you're putting in the tower it's hard to
keep<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.390> place<00:00:18.619> first<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.770> all<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.160> once

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
keep it in place first of all but once

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
keep it in place first of all but once
the<00:00:20.789> plants<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.210> growing<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.170> green

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the plants are growing this this green

the plants are growing this this green
is<00:00:22.830> gonna<00:00:22.980> move<00:00:23.250> around<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.880> you

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
is gonna move around on you

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.200 
is gonna move around on you
what<00:00:25.620> I<00:00:25.650> do<00:00:26.270> is<00:00:27.270> I<00:00:27.420> cut<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.870> dose<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.820> column

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
what I do is I cut the dose the column

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.450 
what I do is I cut the dose the column
down<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.750> good<00:00:30.930> inch<00:00:31.200> and<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.740> inner<00:00:31.920> column

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
down a good inch and the inner column

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.460 
down a good inch and the inner column
and<00:00:33.030> when<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.720> set<00:00:34.140> it'll

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
and when this thing is set it'll

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.710 
and when this thing is set it'll
actually<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:35.040> below<00:00:35.490> the<00:00:35.790> rim<00:00:37.130> this<00:00:38.130> a

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
actually be below the rim this a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.210 
actually be below the rim this a
conserves<00:00:39.720> water<00:00:39.840> believe<00:00:40.560> it<00:00:40.650> or<00:00:40.740> not<00:00:40.830> a<00:00:40.950> lot

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
conserves water believe it or not a lot

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.120 
conserves water believe it or not a lot
of<00:00:41.280> splash<00:00:41.880> and<00:00:42.360> evaporation<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.680> fool<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
of splash and evaporation will fool you

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.979 
of splash and evaporation will fool you
into<00:00:44.370> thinking<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.850> your<00:00:45.120> girl<00:00:45.330> is<00:00:45.510> drinking

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
into thinking that your girl is drinking

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.350 
into thinking that your girl is drinking
and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.860> you'll<00:00:47.010> over<00:00:47.309> water<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.730> over<00:00:48.090> feet

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and then you'll over water and over feet

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.570 
and then you'll over water and over feet
keep<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.290> thing<00:00:49.590> below<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.129> rim<00:00:50.340> by

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
keep this thing below the rim by

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.119 
keep this thing below the rim by
trimming<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.180> down<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.200> do<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.650> is<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
trimming this down what I do then is the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.250 
trimming this down what I do then is the
piece<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.550> I've<00:00:53.670> taken<00:00:53.910> off<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.540> don't<00:00:55.110> know

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
piece that I've taken off I don't know

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.460 
piece that I've taken off I don't know
if<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.700> didn't<00:00:57.630> cut<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> small

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
if you can see but I didn't cut a small

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.530 
if you can see but I didn't cut a small
little<00:00:58.890> radius<00:00:59.310> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.610> side<00:00:59.880> of<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.240> it'll

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
little radius in the side of it so it'll

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.560 
little radius in the side of it so it'll
set<00:01:00.810> against<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.260> column<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.130> then<00:01:02.700> I<00:01:03.060> tie

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
set against the column and then I tie

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140 
set against the column and then I tie
strap<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.080> straight<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.309> now<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.520> rain<00:01:05.910> will

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
strap it straight so now the rain will

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.990 
strap it straight so now the rain will
sit<00:01:06.540> directly<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.060> center<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:11.000> pot

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
sit directly in the center of the pot

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.749 
sit directly in the center of the pot
the<00:01:12.180> 10-inch<00:01:12.509> prop<00:01:12.800> otherwise<00:01:13.800> slowly<00:01:14.460> what

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
the 10-inch prop otherwise slowly what

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.280 
the 10-inch prop otherwise slowly what
happens<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> roof<00:01:15.540> wall<00:01:15.750> grows<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
happens is the roof wall grows to the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.770 
happens is the roof wall grows to the
bottom<00:01:16.740> shoving<00:01:17.220> those<00:01:17.340> uh<00:01:17.520> clay<00:01:18.180> pellets<00:01:18.420> out

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
bottom shoving those uh clay pellets out

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.520 
bottom shoving those uh clay pellets out
which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.290> medium<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.130> it'll<00:01:20.399> Bend<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
which is my medium and it'll Bend the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
which is my medium and it'll Bend the
column<00:01:22.530> inward<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.520> you'll<00:01:24.149> have<00:01:24.360> you'll<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
column inward so you'll have you'll be

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.590 
column inward so you'll have you'll be
watering<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.950> outer<00:01:26.130> ring<00:01:26.390> wasting<00:01:27.390> water

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
watering an outer ring wasting water

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.200 
watering an outer ring wasting water
again

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
again

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.100 
again
and<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:30.020> makes<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.320> mess<00:01:31.280> Motz<00:01:32.210> mold<00:01:32.480> so<00:01:32.840> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
and it makes a mess Motz mold so the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.590 
and it makes a mess Motz mold so the
best<00:01:33.290> thing<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.560> do<00:01:33.770> is<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:35.060> go<00:01:35.180> ahead<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.420> cut

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
best thing to do is to go ahead and cut

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.770 
best thing to do is to go ahead and cut
off<00:01:35.750> about<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:36.410> much<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:38.150> inner<00:01:38.330> column

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
off about this much and the inner column

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.150 
off about this much and the inner column
this<00:01:38.870> is<00:01:39.050> real<00:01:39.230> easy<00:01:39.260> just<00:01:39.650> turn<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:39.950> over<00:01:40.040> and

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
this is real easy just turn it over and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.910 
this is real easy just turn it over and
cut<00:01:40.370> off<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.610> excess<00:01:40.910> on<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.180> other<00:01:41.330> side<00:01:41.920> and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
cut off the excess on the other side and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.240 
cut off the excess on the other side and
when<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.310> all<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.550> way<00:01:43.640> down<00:01:43.820> you'll<00:01:44.030> see

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
when this is all the way down you'll see

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.410 
when this is all the way down you'll see
see<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.280> it's<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.000> nice<00:01:47.260> clean<00:01:48.260> fit<00:01:49.420> course

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
see that it's a nice clean fit course

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.170 
see that it's a nice clean fit course
bending<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:50.869> down<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.290> where<00:01:51.410> we<00:01:51.440> want<00:01:52.180> and

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
bending this down to where we want and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.910 
bending this down to where we want and
then<00:01:53.360> once<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.170> like<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.500> it's<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.800> lot

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
then once this is like this it's a lot

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.450 
then once this is like this it's a lot
easier<00:01:55.070> for<00:01:55.310> me<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.610> take<00:01:57.100> one<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.130> these<00:02:00.460> three

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
easier for me to take one of these three

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.910 
easier for me to take one of these three
my<00:02:01.700> large<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.240> get<00:02:02.390> it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.620 

it<00:02:23.930> keeps<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:25.000> voltage<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.210> deadliest

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
it keeps all the voltage the deadliest

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.070 
it keeps all the voltage the deadliest

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
of falling and keeping their way down

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.940

and a lack of evaporation this really

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.940 
and a lack of evaporation this really
really<00:02:37.670> keeps<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.870> bottom<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.350> Sabine<00:02:39.680> is

really keeps the bottom of the Sabine is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.480 
really keeps the bottom of the Sabine is
soaked<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:41.600> really<00:02:41.990> really<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:43.310> get<00:02:43.430> a

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
the drain I'm waiting for another one to

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.240 
the drain I'm waiting for another one to
replace<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:34.110> there<00:04:34.290> will<00:04:34.350> be<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.530> thousand

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250

replace this there will be a thousand
water

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.409 

it'll<00:04:38.380> go<00:04:38.650> up<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.250> then<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.460> 600<00:04:40.000> water<00:04:40.210> will

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
it'll go up and then the 600 water will

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.650 
it'll go up and then the 600 water will
slide<00:04:40.720> in<00:04:40.900> under<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.970> that's<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.090> plan<00:04:43.210> anyway

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
slide in under it that's the plan anyway

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.370 
slide in under it that's the plan anyway
we'll<00:04:44.050> see<00:04:46.260> close<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.410> cage<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:48.479> can<00:04:49.479> see<00:04:49.720> I'm

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
we'll see close the cage you can see I'm

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.230 
we'll see close the cage you can see I'm
using<00:04:50.440> these<00:04:50.830> little<00:04:51.040> shields<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:51.910> mylar

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
using these little shields and mylar

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.770 
using these little shields and mylar
shields<00:04:52.690> to<00:04:52.810> try<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.139> direct<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.680> light<00:04:53.710> I

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
shields to try and direct the light I

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.700 
shields to try and direct the light I
don't<00:04:55.780> want<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:55.990> want<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.320> plant<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.680> be

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
don't want I want the plant to be

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.439 
don't want I want the plant to be
starved<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.520> light<00:04:57.760> on<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.060> outside

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
starved of the light on the outside

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.560 
starved of the light on the outside
which<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.139> you<00:04:59.260> can<00:04:59.380> actually<00:04:59.530> see<00:04:59.889> shadows

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
which it is you can actually see shadows

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.930 
which it is you can actually see shadows
up<00:05:01.570> there<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.260> up<00:05:02.380> there<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:03.340> these<00:05:03.490> screams

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
up there and up there so these screams

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.230 
up there and up there so these screams
are<00:05:04.150> actually<00:05:05.070> meant<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.220> promote<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.940> plant

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
are actually meant to promote the plant

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.330 
are actually meant to promote the plant
to<00:05:07.479> curl<00:05:07.720> directly<00:05:08.350> towards<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.800> large<00:05:09.100> space

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
to curl directly towards a large space

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.909 
to curl directly towards a large space
to<00:05:09.490> be<00:05:09.639> doing<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.810> ones<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.139> place<00:05:11.410> down<00:05:11.650> here

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
to be doing the ones I place down here

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.479 
to be doing the ones I place down here
will<00:05:12.160> be<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.729> lot
