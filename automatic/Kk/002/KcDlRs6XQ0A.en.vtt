00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
guys you want to do it until we get a

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.010 
guys you want to do it until we get a
zero<00:02:03.280> above<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.760> so<00:02:04.000> let's<00:02:04.180> try<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.450> again

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
okay so it's still a god zero so I'm

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
then this is where the glitch points in

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.890 
then this is where the glitch points in
okay<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:48.730> we're<00:02:48.970> going<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.150> put<00:02:49.269> our<00:02:49.390> diamonds

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
gonna spot start to give us unlimited

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.090 
gonna spot start to give us unlimited
diamond<00:02:55.989> center<00:02:56.260> as<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.350> can<00:02:56.590> see<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:56.920> can

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
diamond center as you can see you can

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.660 
diamond center as you can see you can
see<00:02:57.280> how<00:02:57.580> much<00:02:57.760> diamonds<00:02:58.239> you've<00:02:58.480> got<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.170> -<00:02:59.680> 39

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
see how much diamonds you've got so - 39

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.460 
see how much diamonds you've got so - 39
so<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.239> means<00:03:01.420> area<00:03:01.630> side<00:03:01.930> first<00:03:02.230> nine

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
so that means area side first nine

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.400 
so that means area side first nine
diamonds<00:03:02.830> there<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.420> most<00:03:04.690> easiest<00:03:05.140> and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
diamonds there so it is most easiest and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.800 
diamonds there so it is most easiest and
efficient<00:03:05.920> diamond<00:03:06.640> glitch<00:03:07.000> or<00:03:07.209> whatever<00:03:07.630> you

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
efficient diamond glitch or whatever you

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.870 
efficient diamond glitch or whatever you
want<00:03:08.019> village<00:03:08.290> in<00:03:08.650> minecraft<00:03:09.489> is<00:03:09.700> the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
movement and the housing did patch for

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.590 
movement and the housing did patch for
at<00:03:11.620> least<00:03:11.769> four<00:03:12.040> beats<00:03:12.430> outside<00:03:13.060> I've<00:03:13.329> known

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
at least four beats outside I've known

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.569 
at least four beats outside I've known
em<00:03:14.430> 7.9<00:03:15.430> 8.0<00:03:15.970> an<00:03:16.120> equal<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.660> an<00:03:16.750> equal<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:17.049> fruit

em 7.9 8.0 an equal to an equal in fruit

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.870 
em 7.9 8.0 an equal to an equal in fruit
that's<00:03:18.579> when<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.880> hasn't<00:03:19.000> been<00:03:19.150> patched<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.549> as

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
that's when it hasn't been patched so as

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.870 
that's when it hasn't been patched so as
we<00:03:22.450> now<00:03:22.660> go<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:22.900> pick<00:03:23.140> them<00:03:23.290> up<00:03:23.489> first<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.760> pick

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
we now go and pick them up first we pick

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.400 
we now go and pick them up first we pick
all<00:03:25.060> our<00:03:25.209> diamond<00:03:25.570> so<00:03:25.690> people<00:03:25.930> still<00:03:26.110> start<00:03:26.350> to
