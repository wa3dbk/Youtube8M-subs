00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.939 

I'm<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.300> inspired<00:00:15.450> by<00:00:15.630> nature<00:00:16.199> animals

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
I'm really inspired by nature animals

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.850 
I'm really inspired by nature animals
and<00:00:17.250> plant<00:00:18.119> evolution<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.410> first<00:00:19.650> thing<00:00:19.800> I

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
and plant evolution the first thing I

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.790 
and plant evolution the first thing I
really<00:00:20.070> remember<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.520> drawing<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:20.970> cat<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> lot

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
really remember is drawing my cat a lot

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.970 
really remember is drawing my cat a lot
which<00:00:22.800> obviously<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:24.240> led<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.980> myself

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
which obviously is led on to myself

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.450 
which obviously is led on to myself
drawing<00:00:26.880> animals<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> also<00:00:28.400> sort<00:00:29.400> of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
drawing animals now but I also sort of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.849 
drawing animals now but I also sort of
try<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.670> take<00:00:30.630> inspiration<00:00:30.869> from<00:00:31.199> areas

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
try to take inspiration from areas

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.889 
try to take inspiration from areas
outside<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.699> traditional<00:00:32.940> textiles<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
outside of traditional textiles and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.599 
outside of traditional textiles and
design<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.949> things<00:00:35.249> like<00:00:35.370> mathematics

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609 
design so things like mathematics

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:42.529 
design so things like mathematics
science<00:00:36.620> books<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.859> films<00:00:40.999> mirror<00:00:41.999> spotted

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
science books and films mirror spotted

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.200 
science books and films mirror spotted
my<00:00:42.629> work<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:43.019> the<00:00:43.199> RCA<00:00:43.679> graduate<00:00:44.069> show<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
my work at the RCA graduate show and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.729 
my work at the RCA graduate show and
then<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:45.449> contacted<00:00:45.959> me<00:00:46.139> afterwards<00:00:46.620> about

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
then they contacted me afterwards about

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.549 
then they contacted me afterwards about
possibly<00:00:47.309> working<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.729> project<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.209> them

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
possibly working on a project with them

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.049 
possibly working on a project with them
so<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.679> first<00:00:49.889> design<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.519> I've<00:00:50.609> worked<00:00:50.819> on

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
so the first design that I've worked on

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.949 
so the first design that I've worked on
is<00:00:51.929> called<00:00:52.319> Titus<00:00:52.979> and<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.329> silverback

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:54.959 
is called Titus and it's my silverback

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:57.020 
is called Titus and it's my silverback
gorilla<00:00:55.499> design<00:00:55.889> which<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.729> really<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
gorilla design which is really a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.569 
gorilla design which is really a
statement<00:00:57.749> piece<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.979> second<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.399> which

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
statement piece and the second one which

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.119 
statement piece and the second one which
is<00:00:59.609> called<00:00:59.969> tangled<00:01:00.479> is<00:01:01.409> taking<00:01:01.799> elements

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
is called tangled is taking elements

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.430 
is called tangled is taking elements
from<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> gorilla<00:01:03.420> design<00:01:03.749> things<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
from the gorilla design things like the

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.149 
from the gorilla design things like the
branches<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.270> natural<00:01:06.270> patterns<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
branches and the natural patterns and

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.649 
branches and the natural patterns and
using<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.880> coordinate<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
using that as a coordinate to the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.069 
using that as a coordinate to the
gorilla<00:01:09.899> I<00:01:11.119> was<00:01:12.119> really<00:01:12.299> surprised<00:01:12.659> working

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
gorilla I was really surprised working

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.389 
gorilla I was really surprised working
with<00:01:13.200> chimæra<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:13.950> they<00:01:14.100> actually

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
with chimæra because they actually

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.459 
with chimæra because they actually
didn't<00:01:14.880> give<00:01:15.030> me<00:01:15.270> many<00:01:15.630> restrictions<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.259> all

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
didn't give me many restrictions at all

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.139 
didn't give me many restrictions at all
and<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:17.219> really<00:01:17.490> didn't<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.909> water

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
and they really didn't want to water

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.630 
and they really didn't want to water
down<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.630> ideas<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> designs<00:01:19.770> they've

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
down my ideas or the designs they've

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.749 
down my ideas or the designs they've
been<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.030> willing<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:22.039> kind<00:01:23.039> of<00:01:23.189> push<00:01:23.609> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
been so willing to kind of push the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
been so willing to kind of push the
boundaries<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:25.079> interior

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
boundaries really of what interior

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.919 
boundaries really of what interior
fabric<00:01:26.009> design<00:01:26.219> can<00:01:26.429> be<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.780> most

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
fabric design can be the most

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.230 
fabric design can be the most
challenging<00:01:28.380> part<00:01:28.590> has<00:01:29.130> been<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.850> technical

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
challenging part has been the technical

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
challenging part has been the technical
side<00:01:30.390> probably<00:01:30.929> so<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.439> printing<00:01:31.920> techniques

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
side probably so the printing techniques

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
side probably so the printing techniques
they've<00:01:32.490> been<00:01:32.640> working<00:01:32.999> on<00:01:33.149> for<00:01:33.890> printing<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
they've been working on for printing the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.889 
they've been working on for printing the
design<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.549> wall<00:01:35.789> blazer<00:01:36.030> fabric<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
design on this wall blazer fabric and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.020 
design on this wall blazer fabric and
also<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> repeat<00:01:38.070> done<00:01:38.219> mentions<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.789> kind

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
also the repeat done mentions that kind

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.109 
also the repeat done mentions that kind
of<00:01:39.090> thing<00:01:40.340> my<00:01:41.340> favorite<00:01:41.640> part<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> process

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
of thing my favorite part of the process

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
of thing my favorite part of the process
is<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:43.049> probably<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> drawing<00:01:44.100> but

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
is is probably the drawing but

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.459 
is is probably the drawing but
particularly<00:01:44.880> when<00:01:45.210> drawing<00:01:45.719> is<00:01:45.990> finished

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
particularly when drawing is finished

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.010 
particularly when drawing is finished
and<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.729> step<00:01:48.119> back<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:48.569> feel<00:01:48.780> proud<00:01:48.990> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and I can step back and feel proud of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:59.580 
and I can step back and feel proud of
what<00:01:49.229> I've<00:01:49.289> done

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.649
