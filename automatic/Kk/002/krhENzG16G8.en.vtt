very<00:01:00.809> easy<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.410> craft<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.480> like<00:01:03.619> how

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
very easy to craft not really like how

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.380 
very easy to craft not really like how
how<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> materials<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's actually a lot easier to craft than

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
it's actually a lot easier to craft than
like<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.600> diamond<00:01:13.229> sword<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.740> less

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
like a diamond sword which is less

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
like a diamond sword which is less
damaged<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.060> that's<00:01:15.900> something<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> keep<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439

guess it gives you more food that's
pretty<00:02:00.000> good<00:02:00.649> let's<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:01.969> sharpness<00:02:02.969> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
pretty good let's see sharpness it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.499 
pretty good let's see sharpness it's
five<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.740> doesn't<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.100> matter

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
five and that doesn't really matter

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.339 
five and that doesn't really matter
because<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:07.099> already<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.610> sharp<00:02:08.910> sword

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
because I already have very sharp sword

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.600 
because I already have very sharp sword
because<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.440> will<00:02:10.560> hit<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.069> kill<00:02:11.430> him<00:02:11.520> one

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
because it will hit and one kill him one

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.680 
because it will hit and one kill him one
hit<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.330> does<00:02:12.540> give<00:02:12.810> me<00:02:12.989> three

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
hit so it does give me three

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.300 
hit so it does give me three
so<00:02:14.020> yes<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.380> intangible<00:02:14.710> for<00:02:15.070> all<00:02:15.190> you
