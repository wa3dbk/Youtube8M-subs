00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.010 

the<00:00:03.870> reason<00:00:04.319> they're<00:00:04.560> advanced<00:00:05.870> in<00:00:06.870> this

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
the reason they're advanced in this

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.980 
the reason they're advanced in this
field<00:00:07.380> is<00:00:07.559> really<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.430> go<00:00:08.550> psycho<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.570> can

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
field is really you go psycho you can

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.759 
field is really you go psycho you can
say<00:00:10.849> evolutionary<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.379> that<00:00:13.379> is<00:00:13.559> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
say evolutionary and that is the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.820 
say evolutionary and that is the
technology<00:00:14.249> called<00:00:14.669> IPS<00:00:15.360> cells<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
technology called IPS cells or the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.670 
technology called IPS cells or the
induced<00:00:17.250> pluripotent<00:00:17.640> stem<00:00:18.360> cell<00:00:18.840> basically

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
induced pluripotent stem cell basically

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.240 
induced pluripotent stem cell basically
is<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:21.200> evolutionary<00:00:22.200> technique<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:23.040> we

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
is the evolutionary technique that we

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.400 
is the evolutionary technique that we
can<00:00:23.700> convert<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> adult<00:00:26.960> cells<00:00:27.960> such<00:00:28.200> as<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
can convert the adult cells such as a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
can convert the adult cells such as a
skin<00:00:28.800> such<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.310> an<00:00:29.490> other<00:00:30.210> cell<00:00:30.870> type<00:00:31.110> from<00:00:31.530> to

state<00:00:36.019> the<00:00:37.019> state<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.859> would<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.100> very

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.249 
contribution were made into the field is
that<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.519> can<00:01:03.019> generate<00:01:04.019> IPS<00:01:04.800> else<00:01:06.049> safer<00:01:07.049> in

that we can generate IPS else safer in

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.260 
that we can generate IPS else safer in

the clean the IPS cells from the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.899 
the clean the IPS cells from the
periphery<00:01:09.570> blood<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.680> from<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.579> typical

that<00:01:12.390> blood<00:01:12.840> rule<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that blood rule so that we don't have to

that blood rule so that we don't have to
use<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.399> skin<00:01:17.759> biopsy<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:19.259> only<00:01:19.829> it<00:01:20.460> takes

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
use the skin biopsy not only it takes

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.080 
use the skin biopsy not only it takes
short<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> time<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.960> example<00:01:22.530> 10<00:01:23.219> days<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.729> vs

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
short a time for example 10 days of vs

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
of four to six weeks but also we found

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.760 
of four to six weeks but also we found
out<00:01:28.079> that<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:29.310> more<00:01:29.610> efficient<00:01:30.619> after<00:01:31.619> we

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
out that is more efficient after we

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.240 
out that is more efficient after we
overcome<00:01:32.310> some<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.969> technical<00:01:33.299> hurdles

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
overcome some of the technical hurdles

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.389 
overcome some of the technical hurdles
since<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.780> derived<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.020> psl<00:01:37.680> from<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
since we can derived I psl from the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.450 
since we can derived I psl from the
patient<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.829> particular<00:01:40.829> type<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> the

disease a particular type of the

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
mutation so this probably for the first

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.569 
mutation so this probably for the first
time<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.109> we<00:01:49.109> can<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.530> link<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.189> human

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
time that we can really link the human

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.109 
time that we can really link the human
