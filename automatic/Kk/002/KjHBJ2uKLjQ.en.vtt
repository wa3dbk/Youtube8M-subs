00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.260 
around a cape and stuff like that like
it's<00:05:20.560> gonna<00:05:20.680> be<00:05:20.860> another<00:05:21.070> like<00:05:21.310> feelings

doesn't hurt his feelings

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.020 
doesn't hurt his feelings
I<00:05:26.350> think<00:05:26.770> it's<00:05:26.890> pretty<00:05:27.190> clear<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.640> you<00:05:27.940> know

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
I think it's pretty clear that you know

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.670 
I think it's pretty clear that you know
maybe<00:05:28.240> as<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.480> kid<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:28.930> can<00:05:29.080> hurt<00:05:29.169> his<00:05:29.320> feelings

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
maybe as a kid you can hurt his feelings

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.500 
maybe as a kid you can hurt his feelings
but<00:05:29.950> but<00:05:30.130> there's<00:05:30.310> something<00:05:30.669> more<00:05:30.850> stoic

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
but but there's something more stoic

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.990 
but but there's something more stoic
about<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.960> adult<00:05:32.350> Superman<00:05:32.830> after<00:05:33.280> he<00:05:33.790> gets

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
about the adult Superman after he gets

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.150 
about the adult Superman after he gets
off<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.360> fishing<00:05:34.720> boat<00:05:34.750> also<00:05:35.560> animate

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160

for Man of Steel I really think the fact
is<00:06:25.150> that<00:06:25.180> shoe<00:06:25.600> man<00:06:25.750> can<00:06:25.960> come<00:06:26.140> back<00:06:26.290> in<00:06:26.440> a<00:06:26.500> big
