00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 welcome everyone to a new video 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.120
 of mister fox 15 in this song in this 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.370
 occasion is I'm going to teach how 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.019
 solve two serious errors or good 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.450
 very common of minecraft for 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.059
 people who still have not found 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.340
 a coherent solution I mean 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.100
 these two errors is worth the first error 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.140
 of minecraft refers to the old 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.400
 versions of created from the start of the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.550
 1.0 I believe up to 1.5 point 2 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.199
 the error that we are seeing in this 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.650
 moment I'm collecting some images in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.230
 the screen and with that with the title of 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.850
 video card drivers in I'm going to teach 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.370
 how to select this problem and the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.230
 second mistake would be with 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.589
 more advanced versions from 1.6 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.350
 point 4 to 1 point 7.1 on day that 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.300
 would be the error of rooney in section no 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 Freeze with destruction said build 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.260
 english the mother video you come to me I 'm going to 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.970
 teach how to solve these errors 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.030
 in a very simple and very fast way 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.309
 to solve the first good error 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.909
 the two errors the first method would be 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.290
 go to home team I suggest you go 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.479
 stay until the end of the video because 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.120
 I will teach two methods in the case of 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.130
 that one does not work as it was my case 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.810
 we will appear in team and right 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.600
 properties and we will appear all 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.400
 this here in windows 7 as I have it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.540
 and windows 8 and windows vista 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.670
 we go to administrator 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.050
 devices here on the left you 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.690
 we give a single click and it will open 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.640
 this window administrator 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.880
 devices now what are we going to do 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.380
 here we see several options where 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.510
 only one that will interest us is going to be 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.090
 screen doctors we are going to click on 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.910
 in the more it comes out to the left and we 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.900
 is going to appear this little thing obviously not 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.479
 they will look just like me 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.180
 depending on I think it 's the kind of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.210
 graphic card that I will give 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.520
 click here and then update software 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.680
 of the controller one click and here we go 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.950
 to look for automatic menso of controller 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.280
 updated we're not going to give there and it's going to 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.290
 put to look for an insurance adapter to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.050
 those who have the first mistake you good 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.150
 Some error may come out that 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.130
 they need to update this they give to 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.690
 accept to apply I do not know about you anymore or 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.970
 least I know well and wait for them to update 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.470
 the insurance when you finish updating the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.320
 put screen 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.570
 more like I tell you, it 's more cool more 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.550
 girl is going to look perfect after 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.100
 you configure the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.050
 the size of the windows are these but 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.460
 good to me in this case is not saying 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.490
 that the best software is already installed 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.900
 controller by the device and it looks to 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.690
 the people who have this error will 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.330
 salts this means that this method does not 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.740
 it's going to work good for 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.260
 people who could update the 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.069
 device 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.599
 test in the minecraft and if it's already a 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.459
 mistake the error I would like 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.170
 they will comment and they said well it worked 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.269
 thank you that we for the others 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.599
 people see that if they work for me 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:02.540
 it works for me the two errors came out 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.629
 so we're going to give it close to the x 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.150
 and the x the next method is going to be 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.890
 even simpler than the previous one 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.079
 let's start all the 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.530
 programs and we will search for windows 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:19.129
 update as it is here and if not search 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.290
 programs we are going to look for the beats the 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.459
 sure this will be leaving notes 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.440
 around the screen so that 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.840
 you copy it and we are going to click 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.300
 to windows to windows update 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.670
 all right 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.030
 Once here we will see what is going to 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.740
 appear this to you maybe you 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.540
 appear more important update already 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.000
 do not show any depending but 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.060
 yes you will see many optional 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.100
 in important updates the only thing 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.980
 what we are going to do is going to do is give 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.630
 click uncheck all the boxes to 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.860
 that there is no problem and you do not 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.370
 put update everything avoid a 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.720
 heap and we're going to accept him he's not going to 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.220
 have no problem because after 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.840
 that we update what we are going to 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.610
 update this will be redialing 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.200
 and if we want we are going to 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.400
 update but I do not want to do that 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.550
 at this precise moment then we go 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.160
 to the optional updates and here 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.650
 we are going to appear too many of you 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.970
 they will look in windows 7 or good they will 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.940
 search in any of the boxes 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.010
 the update that includes the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.210
 name of the graphics card that you 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.780
 let's have the video card 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:30.560
 in my case I have intel I do not remember 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.620
 well if to intel a script and things like that 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.569
 rare, only one will appear 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.039
 update that has the name of the 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.750
 video card so there will be no 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.849
 no problem, let's imagine that 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.039
 mentally video appears here truth has 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.360
 searched a lot and appeared I give a click 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.389
 I give him to accept 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.759
 and we are going to give you update and 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.529
 install updates wait a while 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.929
 Update the update 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.489
 to install the update and 

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:59.229
 is now and once you are finished 

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:01.749
 I'm sure they're going to ask you to restart your 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.329
 computer they do will there be in the 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:06.789
 minecraft they try it and it will already be 

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:08.480
 solved the error to me it seemed the 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.390
 error 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.620
 rum is the exception of open gl and the 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.590
 truth is that we are very worried 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.230
 when the way my computer 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.330
 windows vista windows 7 is very 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.840
 worried the error is not solved with 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.950
 nothing and running and I found browsing 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.120
 by Internet 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.760
 that solution but I appeared this 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.310
 first when entering an old version 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.860
 from minecraft 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.760
 this first version of 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.980
 video card drivers and the factual solution 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.860
 is my solution was not to update the 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.440
 screen adapter but update 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.610
 the drivers of my good video card 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.130
 that was all I hope you liked 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.660
 anything that any any 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.850
 doubt or any problem that has 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.620
 emerged do not hesitate to comment on this 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.350
 video and I with all the taste 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.910
 I will answer and with all the luck what 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.400
 we are going to solve so well that was 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.950
 everything I hope you subscribe like 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.110
