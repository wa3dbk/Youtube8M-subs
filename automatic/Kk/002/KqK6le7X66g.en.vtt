00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 good afternoon my dear I will today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.819
 cook fish with vegetables in 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.639
 based on modern Italian dishes 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.510
 cuisine in italy it is prepared with fresh 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.730
 anchovies 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.490
 but since Moscow with anchovies is just 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.080
 trouble and they are very expensive 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.750
 so I propose to cook the same 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.449
 the most with more affordable small fish 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.109
 can you take a sprat fresh can take 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.930
 hamsu 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.670
 sprat in general any small fish that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.279
 nephels are easily torn off 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.160
 or First we need to cut the fish at 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.950
 fillet and it did so i 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.180
 first cutting off the head cutting off the buckle 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.079
 remove the insides 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.090
 be sure to remove the black film fish 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:51.239
 wash my hands well ridge from 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.520
 pulp and then seperate 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.219
 and remove the ridge along with the turnip bones 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.379
 the result is two clean 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.399
 the filler of the united months is the fish we 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.760
 open like a book cut off 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.439
 fin upper tail we have a fish 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.530
 ready for every breeder us 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.200
 will need six to eight movie this 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.310
 depends on the size of the fish on the size 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 nodules prepared fish yet 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.150
 we lay on the right plate it 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880
 fish caviar in this recipe by her 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.710
 I will not use it and let's do it 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.960
 preparing the filling for us 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.079
 need vegetables these are two tomatoes 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.040
 medium one big bell pepper 1 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.700
 medium bulb 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.110
 a bunch of parsley for so many 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.170
 I needed vegetables 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.200
 cooking 4 large knots and for 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.250
 start we will need to chop vegetables 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.020
 Bulgarian pepper cut into small cubes 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.649
 then also small, rarely tomatoes 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.509
 Here is such a small cat tomatoes I 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.590
 I'll take only the walls in order to 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.380
 the filling was overland cut 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.939
 Tomatoes we remove seeds we remove 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.229
 liquid about seeds 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.229
 from the wall finely chop 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:16.230
 Finely chop the onion I have 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.299
 the bulb is red but you can take the usual 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:25.519
 onions and chop the greens I'll take 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:28.170
 such a good generous bunch of parsley 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.819
 then we will need to fry all the vegetables 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.860
 bring to full readiness I will 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.739
 fry in olive oil can 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.989
 take any other oil we pour on 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.530
 pan two three tablespoons of oil 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.659
 heat up lay onions and first 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.659
 fry the onions for a couple of minutes until transparent 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.109
 records even a griddle yes steam chopped 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.879
 Bulgarian pepper and we will fry all 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:59.190
 together another 3-4 minutes the very last 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.010
 turn add sliced ​​tomatoes and 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.409
 will fry one more two minutes to 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.750
 full cooked vegetables and dry stuffing 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.519
 and it is very desirable that with this vegetable 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.440
 retain their shape so they in 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.389
 the frying process collapsed and 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.389
 turned into a vegetable puree 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:25.139
 fry for one or two minutes then fry pan 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:34.290
 can be removed from heat add to vegetables 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:36.750
 chopped herbs salt spices as 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.879
 spices I added half a spoon of dry 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.879
 herbs of Italian cuisine is a ready-made set 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.049
 add salt can add a little 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.430
 black pepper 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.400
 for emptiness add one two canteens 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.069
 spoons of grated crackers it can either be 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.079
 breadcrumbs for you can dry 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.760
 white bread and then scroll it on 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.690
 grinder or grate 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.459
 the result is bread crumb and 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.260
 This is the bread crumb we add 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.030
 roasted vegetables so that the filling was not 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.299
 liquid she was such a beast and 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.269
 consistency well kept the form give 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.190
 cool down to warm and then at 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.900
 You can add a clove to the filling 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.080
 minced garlic 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.419
 grated cheese to taste I added two 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.930
 cards are about 3-4 tablespoons 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.080
 cheese can take absolutely any on your 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.120
 the choice 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.220
 if you add cheese hot stuffing then he 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.520
 will melt so before you add 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.400
 let the cheese fillings cool 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.720
 salted fish and pepper then us 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.770
 there is nothing left 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.820
 to collect the knots let's make this two 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.070
 sides not on every fish knot 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.030
 it took seven film but it depends 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.949
 very much on sizes and fish and shape for 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.120
 we will need knot formation 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.130
 any bowl 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.229
 I can bake ceramic in it 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.210
 so I will in these bowls and 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.130
 to form knots and in it I will 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.560
 there is no baking in you 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.630
 you can take any dish not 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.550
 to form a knot and for those his 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.740
 gently transfer either to a baking sheet 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.770
 either in some other ceramic 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.870
 form and for starters I smeared the form 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.460
 butter simple rubbed floors 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.830
 rusks to process 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.960
 baking knot is not stuck not 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.849
 burned form 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.159
 laid out fish fillets with an asterisk 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.080
 the middle seemed empty since 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.090
 me small fish fillet if 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.800
 you take a bigger fish then 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.690
 lay out and in such a way that 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.110
 the middle was filled that is 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.270
 lay fish fillet overlap from 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.969
 center of the asterisks we lay out 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.870
 fried vegetables note as stuffing 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.620
 keep their shape well make them look like this 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.870
 hemispheres 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.870
 and then neatly close the jump 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.360
 fillet a small amount of filling 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.009
 put it aside in order to 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.009
 decorate the already finished knot 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:21.230
 seals fish fillets with 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:23.180
 toothpicks very neatly such 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.980
 Vinci movements to 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.960
 the knot we did not fall apart then 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.830
 can I jump olive oil for 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.750
 so that the fish in the oven does not dry up 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.670
 in the middle you have a little grated 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.760
 cheese it squeaks our knot 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.370
 and then put the tins with fish 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.040
 warmed to 180 200 degrees Celsius 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.040
 oven until fish is ready 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.570
 somewhere for 10-15 minutes 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.450
 when serving from ready baked 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.260
 nodules I removed the toothpicks and on the center 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.670
 you already have a little delayed stuffing 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.860
 if you used for baking 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.510
 procyon ceramic mold 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.120
 serve straight in ceramic form 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.140
 Aleppo neatly shift 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.720
 baked ready knot on 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.610
 serving plate and so is our dish 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.410
 ready and will not remain traditional 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.960
