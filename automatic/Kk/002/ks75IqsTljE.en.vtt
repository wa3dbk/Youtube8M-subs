00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.829
 hello girls wait they are very 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.200
 well today I want to show you how it is that 

00:00:04.829 --> 00:00:08.969
 I made the very famous general man who 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.799
 we all want and good the truth is that 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.499
 I was very afraid to do it 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.059
 but now I'm going to tell you all the 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.230
 story so do not move from there 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.230
 because we are going to start 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 two 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.460
 now yes girls the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.710
 well the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.180
 Show them my hair so they can see how 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.239
 you see and keep watching the video and good 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.829
 see here that it is like reddish but I 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.809
 I'm going to stop to see that the tips 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.809
 they are clearer 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.790
 you saw 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.040
 because this technique is supposed to be 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.960
 it's a color gradient and I do not 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.920
 I wanted it very clear because my hair is 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.710
 dark then I did not like the idea 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.200
 that it would look very very clear in the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 points apart from that I was inspired by 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.450
 a picture that I'm going to leave here 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.450
 why 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.890
 and well I'm going to tell you that this 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.619
 we were talking with my friend with 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.110
 nabih del Ã¡vila channel jm I will leave you 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.090
 the link down here this good you know 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.159
 you who are super friends we are 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.259
 talking and I said ay friend and I 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.149
 I want to do something in the hair there 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.700
 I have a black tint maybe a what 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.890
 black painter because I like how he 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.130
 moves the black hair but just like 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.619
 that suddenly I get the concern of 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.180
 do something different 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.680
 I have always wanted man hair but 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.210
 once I did it and the truth is not me 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.760
 liked it for nothing like I left it 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.250
 Then she told me good and why not 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.950
 you go to this same friend and I do not what 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.159
 if it does not fit or I can not but I said 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.140
 Total good if I do not like how I have left 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.220
 I painted it black and I have the dye and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.569
 nothing happens anymore and it tells me exactly 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.180
 paint telo with l'orÃ©al that's 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.890
 good and blah blah blah said ok friend no 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.640
 let's do not do it she'll also 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.400
 will do and this kind of dye here 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.069
 is this girls with this product 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.830
 because I did it and the truth is that 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.390
 I was not incredulous of what it is and what 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.010
 I served but I kept my eye open 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:41.730
 because if it serves girls it 's very good 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.769
 I loved this product cost around 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.400
 from 11 dollars 1099 something like that more 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.770
 taxes and the tone that I bought is the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.560
 0 50 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.110
 there is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.100
 this 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.460
 and good brings the coloring brings the 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.630
 peroxide and brings the color and makes me 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.020
 apart a shampoo and a conditioner 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.210
 for later when you wash it and it's 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.840
 wonder that is what made all the 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.870
 I love this brush because 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.450
 because it was he who gave them this 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.330
 good result since they have the mixture 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.120
 they are going to shake it like they saw right now 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.819
 the video and what they're going to start doing 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.220
 is to divide your hair into two parts like this 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.819
 as right now I have it in two parts 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.400
 they are going to brush it very very well and 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.049
 that is fine this one 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.019
 that is not tangled that is well 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.079
 Brushing the hair are going to put the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.220
 mix here in the brush they will put it 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.620
 here and they will start combing to comb 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.250
 to comb to comb and comb and they will 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.140
 make the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.390
 it depends on where you want it to be 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.970
 start to see the color as I started 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.770
 put it from here to the tips but there 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.470
 people who do it higher up as in 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.780
 the photo or there are people who do it more 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.250
 down I know how to do it from here 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.050
 towards the tips ok then what are they going 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.060
 to do as I told you is to comb 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.519
 comb hair comb hair comb hair 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.170
 comb with the product here in the 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.299
 brush will not go straight to the 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.840
 hair they will put it here and they will 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.800
 comb 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.169
 but for the tips they will put more 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.280
 product plus product and they will leave it 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.280
 more time 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.659
 and leave as a total of about 40 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.659
 minutes so I had it 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.190
 at 15 minutes I checked my hair and saw 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.260
 that everything was fine did not break 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.150
 saw well held more then what 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.700
 I did was in this part in the meetings 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.280
 put more product combing it comb it 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.560
 put more product and I wrapped it in 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.150
 aluminum foil as you will see here in the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.150
 video and chic 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.479
 Please excuse me for not being not 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.270
 see the whole procedure but I 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.280
 I was recording 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.710
 I left the camera recording and I was 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.680
 doing my hair and when I finish 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.780
 to see it turns out that he stopped recording 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.550
 recorded everything complete but it is very easy 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.100
 I am explaining to you so that 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.770
 can do because it is very easy already 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.980
 after they see that their hair is 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.660
 well hold that it does not break if you 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.630
 they want more clear because they are going to put 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.330
 more decolorizing at the tips and they will 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.790
 leave another 15 minutes and if you liked it 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.350
 that tonality that they have like me that 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.470
 I already liked it and I wanted to leave it like that 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.860
 then they go on to rinse their hair with 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:52.400
 the shampoo that comes here in the box brings 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.790
 a conditioner shampoo and I what 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.340
 I did the next day and I washed it at the same time 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.080
 this does not wash my whole head anything else 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.039
 wash what 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.590
 and what I did was make myself a mask 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:09.680
 of coconut oil so that my hair gets 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.569
 go recovering from the change you suffered 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.440
 that I was not mistreated 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.260
 very much almost nothing 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.390
 but if I recommend that they be done 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.830
 masks that put oil aside 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.020
 that I do not do it in my hair all 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.990
 the days because that's not good girls 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.820
 for many it's like dirty but for me 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.830
 no I do not do all my hair 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.020
 days I do not like other than that my 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.240
 hair does not loose fat then my 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.520
 hair does not look dirty there are people who 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.290
 of your hair loose a lot of oil that 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.080
 with a day that they do not know they are seen 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.180
 super dirty hair but to me it is not 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.940
 my case that's why I also do not 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.590
 I wash every day and because also 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.300
 little I like to have it ironed all 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.670
 the days then I ironed it one day and 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.560
 it lasts me like for two more days and now 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.870
 after the union to take care of your hair 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.930
 As I told you, make a mask 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.910
 coconut oil I do it once for 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.060
 week and I will not show you which 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.160
 I use it because I have it emptied in a 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.560
 tupper in a 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.750

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.370
