00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 from Germany mariella easily 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.060
 dressed and self-confident, marie enters 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.730
 long on the scales 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.290
 the 27-year-old Munich-based designer 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.000
 as a future martial arts queen 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.019
 and we now have an important one 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.400
 make a step 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.410
 the goal is a wm fight me me 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.939
 think it's great that I'm the last year 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 already the possibility has on the dock 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.980
 fight night that was already 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.830
 the first experience is the fighting time 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 to sniff and I'm happy now 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.369
 mad that I have the opportunity 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.860
 to fight the professional title 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.360
 marie is undefeated in 15 fights so far 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.879
 for the first major international 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
 title beats them against very soon the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.059
 Master from Bosnia herzegovina as 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.489
 first, of course, I am pleased 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.190
 we're crazy now 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.899
 long prepared and my excitement 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.809
 usually comes when I am 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.730
 slowly true and when I turn in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.500
 climb the ring then it is gone immediately 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.949
 The gladiator is in top form 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.840
 david mobile the 23 year old wants his 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.370
 fight names make all honor and his 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.960
 title of world kickboxing and karate 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.850
 june and defend 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.530
 for the first time as a main fighter one 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.390
 Great gala for me is every fight 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.799
 whether I defend the title or not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.080
 I do not care if it's a super freedom 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.850
 Of course, always a bit more depends 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.549
 if it's the main fight if it's one 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.110
 why the future is going again 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.619
 and that's why everything should fit 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.479
 and of course the printer is a lot 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.100
 higher that is quite normal if you 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.229
 is set up as a main fighter 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.250
 but that I think I pack that whole 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.200
 well so I can quite well 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.630
 stick and feel good too 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.390
 opponent is the Portuguese wkr 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.490
 world champion jose paradise is six 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.829
 years older and has almost 80 years fighting 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.619
 three times as many as david morina it 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.990
 just know very well that I know and has 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.140
 of course a good career behind 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.399
 up to now and will too 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 of course his performance 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.060
 bring off but that is not me about it 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.189
 discourage 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.409
 as a gladiator again weeks to the ring 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.869
 do not get fat on the body with a gram 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.659
 and exactly 80 pounds will be pietro 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.130
 wikio compete for the title defense 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.380
 his challenger is that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.420
 world ranking second michael hoyer out 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.800
 of course, slovakia is the hunted one 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.050
 because people want to have my title 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.280
 but basically protection for me always 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.620
 I just go forward 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.569
 go and just have to go full throttle 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.700
 So I'm the one who plays the game 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.680
 leads two world champions two 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.390
 european champion and an international 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.549
 German championship in Munich 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.540
 Postpalast is on Fridays from 18 clock 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.540
 for many titles
