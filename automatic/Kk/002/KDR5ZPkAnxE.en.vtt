and you want to aim in between that lan

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.310 
and you want to aim in between that lan
well<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.910> the<00:01:15.090> middle<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.690> land<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> then

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
well in the middle of that land and then

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.040 
well in the middle of that land and then
put<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.590> trample<00:01:17.070> steam<00:01:17.160> down<00:01:17.550> and<00:01:17.930> all<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
right-hand corner with trample steam and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.910 
right-hand corner with trample steam and
then<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.340> simply<00:01:23.700> end<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> glitch<00:01:25.619> or

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
then you simply end up in the glitch or

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.580 
then you simply end up in the glitch or
in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.399> wall<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:27.420> glitch<00:01:27.660> can<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.080> used<00:01:28.290> as

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
in the wall this glitch can be used as

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.050 
in the wall this glitch can be used as
it<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.790> our<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.570> could<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.290> used<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.060> sky

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it is now our it could be used as a sky

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.960 
it is now our it could be used as a sky
barrier<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.660> in<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.229> roof<00:01:34.410> but<00:01:35.399> I<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.670> where

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.779 
barrier or in the roof but I have where
a<00:01:36.390> before<00:01:36.899> packed<00:01:37.229> glitch<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.580> and

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
a before packed glitch of that and

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.540 
a before packed glitch of that and
they're<00:01:39.600> made<00:01:39.960> doing<00:01:40.110> after<00:01:40.440> patch<00:01:40.619> legend<00:01:41.310> as

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
they're made doing after patch legend as

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.180 
they're made doing after patch legend as
well<00:01:41.960> these<00:01:42.960> glitches<00:01:43.170> merely<00:01:43.679> for<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.860> ps3

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
well these glitches merely for the ps3

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.430 
well these glitches merely for the ps3
users<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.660> they're<00:01:46.020> gonna<00:01:46.140> want

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
users just because they're gonna want

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.040 
users just because they're gonna want
easy<00:01:46.679> glitches<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.429> well<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.240> xbox<00:01:48.660> users

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
easy glitches as well as the xbox users

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.440 
easy glitches as well as the xbox users
and<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.709> fits<00:01:50.009> both<00:01:50.280> categories<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.149> easy

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and this fits both categories it's easy

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.990 
and this fits both categories it's easy
and<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.709> onto<00:01:52.979> fairly<00:01:53.310> high<00:01:53.490> realms

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and it can get onto fairly high realms

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.919 
and it can get onto fairly high realms
and<00:01:55.220> but<00:01:56.220> it's<00:01:56.399> better<00:01:56.580> if<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.660> have<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
and but it's better if you do have the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.260 
and but it's better if you do have the
paralyzer<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.369> after<00:01:59.459> kicking<00:01:59.910> in<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
paralyzer see that after kicking in and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.930 
paralyzer see that after kicking in and
out<00:02:00.390> liquid<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.440> get<00:02:01.590> Alma<00:02:01.920> allows<00:02:02.459> you<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
out liquid to get Alma allows you to

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.699 
out liquid to get Alma allows you to
save<00:02:03.149> me<00:02:03.330> then<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.229> other<00:02:04.470> goods

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
save me then you can get out other goods

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.760 
save me then you can get out other goods
it's<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.959> really<00:02:06.959> good<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.560> best

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's really really good one of the best

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.919 
it's really really good one of the best
glitches<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.970> high<00:02:09.270> rounds<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
glitches to do for high rounds and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.800 
glitches to do for high rounds and
either<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:11.100> we're<00:02:11.360> sitting<00:02:12.360> clicks<00:02:12.540> forever

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
either do we're sitting clicks forever

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.080 
either do we're sitting clicks forever
so<00:02:13.650> once<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.099> get<00:02:14.160> paralyzed<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.910> well

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so once you get paralyzed as well

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.260 
so once you get paralyzed as well

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
unlimited and we run around and then at

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.520 
unlimited and we run around and then at
the<00:02:18.330> end<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:18.660> video<00:02:18.810> show<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.290> how<00:02:19.470> to

the end of this video show you how to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.470 
the end of this video show you how to
