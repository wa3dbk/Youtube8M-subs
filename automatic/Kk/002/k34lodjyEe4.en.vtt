be stood above the bomb to do so once
you<00:00:24.869> know<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.230> defusing<00:00:25.800> either<00:00:25.980> they've

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you know that defusing either they've

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.560 
you know that defusing either they've
been<00:00:26.279> told<00:00:26.460> by<00:00:26.609> teammate<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.359> just

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
generally have a feeling that they might

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
generally have a feeling that they might
be<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.119> throw<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.420> combat<00:00:30.779> axe

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
be then you can throw that combat axe

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.200 
be then you can throw that combat axe
and<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.650> gonna<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> very<00:00:32.250> nice<00:00:32.369> aerial

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and it's gonna get a very nice aerial

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.910 
and it's gonna get a very nice aerial
final<00:00:33.600> killcam<00:00:33.809> actually<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
final killcam actually really like the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.100 
final killcam actually really like the
kill<00:00:35.280> comes<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.790> map<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.870> should<00:00:37.020> get

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
kill comes on this map you should get

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.600 
kill comes on this map you should get
that<00:00:37.140> aerial<00:00:37.559> view<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.890> homes<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
that aerial view then it homes in and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.670 
that aerial view then it homes in and
that's<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.420> thinking<00:00:39.989> where<00:00:40.530> did<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
that's up there thinking where did it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.530 
that's up there thinking where did it
all<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.860> wrong<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.730> did<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.390> not

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
all go wrong how did this and not

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540 
all go wrong how did this and not
happening<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.079> me<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:44.190> we're<00:00:44.280> gonna<00:00:44.370> move

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
to the opposite spawn this time so yeah

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.189 
to the opposite spawn this time so yeah
either<00:00:53.219> spawn<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.879> good<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> go<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.079> know

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
either spawn is good to go so you know

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.660 
either spawn is good to go so you know
if<00:00:55.320> there's<00:00:55.500> enemies<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.129> spawn<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.550> can

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
if there's enemies in one spawn you can

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.090 
if there's enemies in one spawn you can
head<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> other<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.890> work
