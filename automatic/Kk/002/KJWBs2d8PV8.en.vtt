not<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.689> much<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.170> Paul<00:01:10.439> McGann<00:01:10.650> miniseries<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
not so much a Paul McGann miniseries it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.340 
not so much a Paul McGann miniseries it
will<00:01:11.610> usher<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.270> idea<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.020> when

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
will usher in the idea that when we when

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.230 
will usher in the idea that when we when
our<00:01:13.740> little<00:01:13.920> menace<00:01:14.430> orders<00:01:14.760> would<00:01:14.880> call<00:01:15.060> them

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
our little menace orders would call them

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
our little menace orders would call them
hideous<00:01:15.630> name<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.110> call<00:01:16.260> them<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
hideous name but we call them that I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.990 
hideous name but we call them that I
think<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.520> should<00:01:17.549> take<00:01:17.729> them<00:01:17.880> more<00:01:17.939> seriously

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:49.690 
well I think I think Peters doctor will
make<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:35.690> even<00:02:35.960> clearer<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:48.460> didn't<00:02:49.460> mind<00:02:49.610> it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700
