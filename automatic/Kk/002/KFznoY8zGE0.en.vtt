introduce you to a new line of stencils
I<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.599> coming<00:00:15.929> out<00:00:16.080> with<00:00:16.230> stencil<00:00:16.650> rural

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I have coming out with stencil rural

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.550 
I have coming out with stencil rural
products<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:18.180> stencils<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.930> part<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.500> my

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
products the stencils are part of my

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.609 
products the stencils are part of my
gross<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> enemy<00:00:20.699> line<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.619> they

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
gross and the enemy line and they

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.000 
gross and the enemy line and they
reflect<00:00:23.279> things<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.019> inside<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
reflect things going on on the inside of

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.450 
reflect things going on on the inside of
you<00:00:26.599> one<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:28.019> called<00:00:28.470> inside<00:00:29.070> my<00:00:29.250> head

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.840 

it<00:00:34.910> actually<00:00:35.090> shows<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.899> brain<00:00:36.680> inside<00:00:37.309> of<00:00:37.760> a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
it actually shows a brain inside of a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.319 
it actually shows a brain inside of a
head<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:38.930> think<00:00:39.199> it's<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:40.190> can<00:00:40.520> be<00:00:40.670> used<00:00:40.969> in

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
head and I think it's it can be used in

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.660 
head and I think it's it can be used in
a<00:00:41.480> variety<00:00:41.629> of<00:00:42.020> ways<00:00:42.110> for<00:00:42.350> visual<00:00:43.129> journaling

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
a variety of ways for visual journaling

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.330 
a variety of ways for visual journaling
to<00:00:44.329> reflect<00:00:44.870> what's<00:00:45.199> going<00:00:45.530> on<00:00:45.680> inside<00:00:46.100> your

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
to reflect what's going on inside your

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.790 
to reflect what's going on inside your
mind<00:00:46.550> things<00:00:47.540> that<00:00:47.809> are<00:00:47.840> going<00:00:48.170> on<00:00:48.410> inside

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
mind things that are going on inside

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.920 
mind things that are going on inside
your<00:00:49.010> life<00:00:49.250> memories<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:50.149> may<00:00:50.300> have<00:00:50.600> just

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
your life memories you may have just

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.410 
your life memories you may have just
different<00:00:51.829> things<00:00:51.860> that<00:00:52.280> correlate<00:00:53.239> with<00:00:53.360> the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
different things that correlate with the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.740 
different things that correlate with the
brain<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:53.989> brain<00:00:54.620> process<00:00:55.159> and<00:00:55.460> i<00:00:55.699> think<00:00:55.940> it's

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
brain and brain process and i think it's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.490 
brain and brain process and i think it's
a<00:00:56.989> it's<00:00:57.019> a<00:00:57.500> strong<00:00:57.829> visual<00:00:58.430> element<00:00:58.970> for<00:00:59.180> that

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
a it's a strong visual element for that

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.170 
a it's a strong visual element for that
another<00:01:00.500> one<00:01:00.829> is<00:01:00.860> call<00:01:01.850> listen<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.780> your<00:01:02.960> heart

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.600 

develop<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.140> stencil<00:01:08.590> off<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:09.010> a<00:01:09.100> sketch<00:01:09.280> I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
develop the stencil off of a sketch I

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.610 
develop the stencil off of a sketch I
did<00:01:09.850> an<00:01:10.480> anatomical<00:01:11.350> sketch<00:01:11.800> of<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.160> heart

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.080 

and<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.280> thought<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:18.000> an

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and I thought that would be an

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.830 
and I thought that would be an
interesting<00:01:18.330> subject<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.600> tape

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
interesting subject it's a little tape

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390 
interesting subject it's a little tape
different<00:01:22.350> than<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> traditional<00:01:22.830> just

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
different than the traditional just

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.440 
different than the traditional just
making<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.540> heart<00:01:24.810> symbol<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:26.700> using<00:01:27.300> your

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
making the heart symbol to using your

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.110 
making the heart symbol to using your
work<00:01:27.660> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.440> it's<00:01:28.620> a<00:01:28.770> very<00:01:29.190> strong<00:01:29.640> visual

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
work I think it's a very strong visual

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.280 
work I think it's a very strong visual
element<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.780> well<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.910> third<00:01:33.480> stencil<00:01:34.110> in

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
element as well and the third stencil in

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.110 
element as well and the third stencil in
this<00:01:34.530> line<00:01:34.800> is<00:01:36.290> it's<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.710> lungs<00:01:38.010> so<00:01:38.820> it's

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
this line is it's the lungs so it's

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.270 
this line is it's the lungs so it's
called<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.660> breathe<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.500> shows<00:01:41.010> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
called just breathe and it shows the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.880 
called just breathe and it shows the
actual<00:01:41.430> lungs

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.910 

just<00:01:47.890> in<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.610> nice<00:01:48.820> simplified<00:01:49.540> form<00:01:49.960> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
just in a nice simplified form the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.170 
just in a nice simplified form the
branches<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:54.009> that<00:01:54.369> are<00:01:54.490> inside<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
branches of the is that are inside the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.170 
branches of the is that are inside the
lungs<00:01:55.500> actually<00:01:56.500> look<00:01:56.729> similar<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.759> tree

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
lungs actually look similar to tree

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.960 
lungs actually look similar to tree
branches<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.440> think<00:01:59.680> that<00:01:59.950> visually<00:02:00.940> you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
branches and I think that visually you

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.999 
branches and I think that visually you
could<00:02:01.299> use<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.750> stencil<00:02:02.049> in<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.439> variety<00:02:02.619> of

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
could use the stencil in a variety of

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.109 
could use the stencil in a variety of
ways<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.229> heart<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.310> anatomical

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
ways with the heart and the anatomical

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.410 
ways with the heart and the anatomical
heart<00:02:07.500> stencil<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:09.220> would<00:02:09.640> be<00:02:09.759> interesting

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
heart stencil it would be interesting

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.449 
heart stencil it would be interesting
like<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.899> used<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.350> with<00:02:11.530> some<00:02:11.739> branches<00:02:12.220> coming

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
like I used it with some branches coming

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.130 
like I used it with some branches coming
out<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.060> heart<00:02:13.300> valves<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.130> be<00:02:15.280> used

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
out of the heart valves it can be used

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.160 
out of the heart valves it can be used
visually<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:18.060> made<00:02:19.060> really<00:02:19.569> beautiful

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
visually just in made really beautiful

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.320 
visually just in made really beautiful
it's<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.980> beautiful<00:02:21.459> image<00:02:21.640> on<00:02:22.150> its

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
it's just it's a beautiful image on its

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.729 
it's just it's a beautiful image on its
own<00:02:22.650> both<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.860> lumps<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.640> heart<00:02:24.880> and

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
own both the lumps and the heart and

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.860 
own both the lumps and the heart and
using<00:02:26.739> them<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.190> your<00:02:27.519> visual<00:02:28.239> journaling<00:02:28.690> I

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
using them in your visual journaling I

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.360 
using them in your visual journaling I
think<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.650> know<00:02:29.800> it's<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.160> a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
think is just you know it's it's a

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.110 
think is just you know it's it's a
really<00:02:30.730> neat<00:02:31.830> take<00:02:32.830> on<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.550> visual<00:02:34.680> element<00:02:35.680> of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
really neat take on a visual element of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.430 
really neat take on a visual element of
breathing<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.510> getting<00:02:38.140> through<00:02:38.440> things<00:02:38.769> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
breathing and getting through things and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.280 
breathing and getting through things and
to<00:02:41.440> me<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:42.040> meant<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.640> lot<00:02:42.670> because<00:02:42.989> I've<00:02:43.989> been

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
to me it meant a lot because I've been

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.250 
to me it meant a lot because I've been
going<00:02:44.590> through<00:02:44.650> some<00:02:44.950> family<00:02:45.250> things<00:02:45.730> and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
going through some family things and
