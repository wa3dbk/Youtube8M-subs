you can call it a success rate it was so

other day oh my god it's so entertaining
I<00:02:35.610> thought<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.320> course<00:02:37.370> zombies

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I thought and then of course zombies

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.250 
I thought and then of course zombies
zombies<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.120> course<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.510> gonna<00:02:39.660> come<00:02:39.870> back<00:02:40.050> in

zombies of course is gonna come back in
whatever<00:02:40.530> form<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.459> call<00:02:41.670> duty<00:02:41.880> takes<00:02:42.239> but

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
whatever form the call duty takes but

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.810 
whatever form the call duty takes but
but<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:45.090> still<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.660> very<00:02:46.350> very<00:02:46.670> just<00:02:47.670> it's

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
but it's still like very very just it's

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.449 
but it's still like very very just it's
just<00:02:47.910> zombies<00:02:48.239> but<00:02:48.780> basically<00:02:49.290> guys<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:50.160> big

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
just zombies but basically guys one big

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.750 
just zombies but basically guys one big
thing<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.760> people<00:02:51.360> say<00:02:51.739> about<00:02:52.739> black<00:02:53.040> ops<00:02:53.100> 3

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
thing that people say about black ops 3

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.580 
thing that people say about black ops 3
is<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.090> there<00:02:54.269> can't<00:02:54.810> be<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.959> black<00:02:55.170> ops<00:02:55.380> 3

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
is that there can't be a black ops 3

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.930 
is that there can't be a black ops 3
because<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.010> are<00:02:56.100> multiple<00:02:56.370> endings<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
because there are multiple endings to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.300 
because there are multiple endings to
black<00:02:57.120> ops<00:02:57.360> 2<00:02:57.690> now<00:02:57.989> yes<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.440> understand<00:02:59.040> that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
black ops 2 now yes I understand that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.100 
black ops 2 now yes I understand that
but<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.820> don't<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.209> that's<00:03:00.420> necessarily

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
but I don't think that's necessarily

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.009 
but I don't think that's necessarily
restricting<00:03:01.980> treyarch<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.730> think<00:03:03.420> they<00:03:03.600> can

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
restricting treyarch I think they can

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.830 
restricting treyarch I think they can
easily<00:03:04.830> just<00:03:05.010> pick<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.760> ending<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.390> go<00:03:06.600> with

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
easily just pick one ending and go with

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.500 
easily just pick one ending and go with
it<00:03:07.080> there<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.739> endings<00:03:08.130> where<00:03:08.400> cordes<00:03:08.820> da<00:03:09.150> or

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
it there are endings where cordes da or

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.590 
it there are endings where cordes da or
whatever<00:03:10.100> rises<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.850> kill<00:03:12.180> raul

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
whatever rises that you kill raul

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.690 
whatever rises that you kill raul
menendez<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.800> i'm<00:03:13.890> gonna<00:03:14.010> get<00:03:14.190> more<00:03:14.430> into

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
menendez and i'm gonna get more into

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.130 
menendez and i'm gonna get more into
this<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:14.970> another<00:03:15.060> video<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:15.600> there's

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
this in another video but there's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.050 
this in another video but there's
there's<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.650> possibility<00:03:17.160> for<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.610> storyline

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
there's a possibility for a storyline

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.650 
there's a possibility for a storyline
continuing<00:03:19.049> after<00:03:19.470> black<00:03:20.190> ops<00:03:20.489> 2<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.480> can

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
continuing after black ops 2 but you can

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.229 
continuing after black ops 2 but you can
also<00:03:21.870> go<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.530> between<00:03:22.980> periods<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:24.060> can

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
also go in between periods you can

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.530 
also go in between periods you can
traverse<00:03:24.840> time<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.950> space<00:03:26.489> with<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.299> black

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
traverse time and space with the black

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.350 
traverse time and space with the black
ops<00:03:27.840> series<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.459> that's<00:03:29.730> always<00:03:30.090> a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
ops series so that's always a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.870 
ops series so that's always a
possibility<00:03:30.799> now<00:03:31.799> I'm<00:03:31.980> certainly<00:03:32.340> hoping<00:03:32.700> for

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
possibility now I'm certainly hoping for

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.250 
possibility now I'm certainly hoping for
a<00:03:32.910> black<00:03:33.150> ops<00:03:33.420> 3<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.720> think<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.140> would<00:03:34.200> be

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
a black ops 3 I think that would be

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.280 
a black ops 3 I think that would be
freaking<00:03:34.829> awesome<00:03:35.390> frickin<00:03:36.390> awesome<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:37.110> say

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
freaking awesome frickin awesome to say

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.100 
freaking awesome frickin awesome to say
the<00:03:37.440> least<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:38.310> just<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.730> sort<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.180> recap<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:40.049> do

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
the least so just a sort of recap I do

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.990 
the least so just a sort of recap I do
not<00:03:40.320> think<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.739> black<00:03:40.950> ops<00:03:41.220> series<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.730> dead<00:03:41.970> i

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
not think the black ops series is dead i

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.030 
not think the black ops series is dead i
think<00:03:42.269> it's<00:03:42.420> very<00:03:42.630> much<00:03:42.930> alive<00:03:43.290> if<00:03:43.590> treyarch

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
think it's very much alive if treyarch

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.620 
think it's very much alive if treyarch
wanted<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.610> they<00:03:44.820> certainly<00:03:45.180> had<00:03:45.600> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
wanted to they certainly had the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.770 
wanted to they certainly had the
possibility<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.730> running<00:03:47.730> up<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.660> know

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
possibility of running up and you know

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.590 
possibility of running up and you know
throwing<00:03:49.320> out<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.709> black<00:03:49.920> ops<00:03:49.950> 3<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:51.299> they

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
throwing out of black ops 3 but they

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.050 
throwing out of black ops 3 but they
think<00:03:51.900> another<00:03:52.500> possibility<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.340> definitely

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
think another possibility is definitely

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.920 
think another possibility is definitely
a<00:03:54.090> new<00:03:54.329> series<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:55.370> mean<00:03:56.370> like<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:57.030> we'll<00:03:57.780> talk

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
a new series I mean like that we'll talk

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.390 
a new series I mean like that we'll talk
about<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.440> another<00:03:58.620> video<00:03:58.950> as<00:03:59.130> well<00:03:59.190> but

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
about that in another video as well but

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.970 
about that in another video as well but
new<00:03:59.610> series<00:04:00.150> they've<00:04:00.690> had<00:04:00.870> three<00:04:01.079> years<00:04:01.410> they

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
new series they've had three years they

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.220 
new series they've had three years they
could<00:04:02.280> easily<00:04:02.640> concoct<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.450> new<00:04:03.570> storyline<00:04:04.200> i

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
could easily concoct a new storyline i

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.199 
could easily concoct a new storyline i
just<00:04:04.650> feel<00:04:04.920> like<00:04:04.950> if<00:04:05.160> they<00:04:05.459> want<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.790> play<00:04:06.060> it

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
just feel like if they want to play it

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.930 
just feel like if they want to play it
safe<00:04:06.510> their<00:04:06.810> first<00:04:07.049> game<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:07.350> next-gen<00:04:08.040> go

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
safe their first game on next-gen go

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.130 
safe their first game on next-gen go
with<00:04:09.150> black<00:04:09.420> ops<00:04:09.750> 3<00:04:10.430> people<00:04:11.430> will<00:04:11.640> buy<00:04:11.850> it

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
with black ops 3 people will buy it

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.720 
with black ops 3 people will buy it
that's<00:04:13.140> just<00:04:13.410> my<00:04:13.620> theory<00:04:13.950> people<00:04:14.340> will<00:04:14.519> go<00:04:14.700> for

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
that's just my theory people will go for

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.150 
that's just my theory people will go for
a<00:04:15.030> because<00:04:15.390> it's<00:04:15.570> treyarch<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.200> because<00:04:16.919> it's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
a because it's treyarch and because it's

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.430 
a because it's treyarch and because it's
the<00:04:17.310> black<00:04:17.549> ops<00:04:17.820> series<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.870> series<00:04:19.109> that

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
the black ops series the series that

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.370 
the black ops series the series that
arguably<00:04:20.209> changed<00:04:21.209> call<00:04:21.479> duty<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.870> little<00:04:22.229> bit

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
arguably changed call duty a little bit

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.860 
arguably changed call duty a little bit
so<00:04:23.340> that's<00:04:23.460> just<00:04:23.760> my<00:04:23.910> thoughts<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.510> certainly

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
so that's just my thoughts I certainly

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.620 
so that's just my thoughts I certainly
think<00:04:25.200> it's<00:04:25.440> going<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.800> black<00:04:26.039> ops<00:04:26.280> 3

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
think it's going to be a black ops 3

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.100 
think it's going to be a black ops 3
that's<00:04:27.630> when<00:04:27.780> I'm

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
that's when I'm

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.629 
that's when I'm
leaning<00:04:28.289> towards<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:28.979> you<00:04:29.159> know<00:04:29.280> it's<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:29.610> a

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
leaning towards but you know it's like a

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.580 
leaning towards but you know it's like a
51<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:31.110> 49<00:04:32.389> percent<00:04:33.389> chance<00:04:33.659> in<00:04:34.020> my<00:04:34.169> head<00:04:34.439> in

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
51 to 49 percent chance in my head in

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.469 
51 to 49 percent chance in my head in
between<00:04:34.740> black<00:04:35.189> ops<00:04:35.430> 3<00:04:35.669> in<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.789> new<00:04:35.909> series<00:04:36.150> I

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
between black ops 3 in a new series I

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.179 
between black ops 3 in a new series I
