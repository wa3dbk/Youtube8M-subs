steering so I'm going to start out with

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.190 
steering so I'm going to start out with
this<00:03:32.900> as<00:03:33.109> a<00:03:33.139> steering<00:03:33.620> servo<00:03:33.980> for<00:03:34.819> this<00:03:35.200> this

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
this as a steering servo for this this

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.080 
this as a steering servo for this this
book<00:03:36.440> now<00:03:36.829> people<00:03:37.160> may<00:03:37.250> laugh<00:03:37.519> because<00:03:37.970> this

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
book now people may laugh because this

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.490 
book now people may laugh because this
is<00:03:38.269> what's<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.720> know<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.840> gets<00:03:39.019> considered<00:03:39.440> a

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
is what's you know I gets considered a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.250 
is what's you know I gets considered a
low<00:03:39.739> budget<00:03:40.310> or<00:03:40.609> low<00:03:40.760> end<00:03:41.000> servo<00:03:41.450> but<00:03:41.660> here's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
low budget or low end servo but here's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.300 
low budget or low end servo but here's
what<00:03:42.440> I've<00:03:42.530> learned<00:03:42.579> is<00:03:43.579> that<00:03:44.169> man<00:03:45.169> servos<00:03:46.130> are

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
what I've learned is that man servos are

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.699 
what I've learned is that man servos are
really<00:03:46.970> really<00:03:47.239> odd<00:03:47.510> with<00:03:47.930> respect<00:03:48.109> to<00:03:48.560> how

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
really really odd with respect to how

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.979 
really really odd with respect to how
they<00:03:48.829> behave<00:03:49.099> on<00:03:49.280> certain<00:03:49.609> vehicles<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.299> soon

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
they behave on certain vehicles and soon

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.449 
they behave on certain vehicles and soon
i'm<00:03:51.139> going<00:03:51.169> to<00:03:51.319> be<00:03:51.380> posting<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.919> video<00:03:52.069> that<00:03:52.250> i

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
i'm going to be posting a video that i

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.539 
i'm going to be posting a video that i
think<00:03:52.669> is<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.150> mother<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:53.690> all<00:03:54.549> surface

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
think is the mother of all surface

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.659 
think is the mother of all surface

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
vehicle servo videos in that I test out

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.659 
vehicle servo videos in that I test out
every<00:04:02.450> vehicle<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.959> i<00:04:03.169> own<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.769> every
