00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.090
 kevin lai canadian girl but they speak 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.280
 Portuguese but incredibly good at 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.850
 moment it is the first place of the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.840
 world then they want to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.939
 raina is the world champion of the mega staple 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.789
 and 2014 2014 2014 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:33.480
 I'm here competing here at mega bing 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.780
 space for the grand prix and I am the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.620
 This year's champion was cool this year. 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.800
 year for me is because the step that mega 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.200
 space the penultimate stage of the 2014 World Cup 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.350
 another edition will take place in africa 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.850
 the south but it's how it happened 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.329
 how many steps 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.930
 I think 10 is nine championships we have 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.600
 nine in the year and has several countries 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.899
 that have is canada united states france 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.619
 had Czech public fault has several 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.320
 that's when I went to everyone and it was good in the match 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.390
 there is also this year it lu sum 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.990
 You are already the champion of this 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.110
 year 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.049
 Anyway, it's going to compete today. 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.570
 You will not dispute because although more 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.970
 You earn better points, right? 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.810
 I want to stay in the county. 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.420
 and I can improve the points yet your 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.450
 Because I want a circuit type. 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.530
 perfect that is all the world won 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.040
 cs5 you add the points 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.350
 From there I have already won 14 and can 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.329
 to get to 5 sr 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.159
 kevin m account because you speak 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.979
 Portuguese and why do you speak Portuguese? 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.020
 so well I do not really know how leprosy 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.030
 learned so fast but I've already been to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.540
 Brazil was liking it several times 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.399
 much of the ifif I stayed for a while and even 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.060
 learned from a friend and only 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.860
 but I like to speak Portuguese, it's good 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.350
 Fortunately, Brazil and Minas Gerais are beautiful. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.599
 horizon has many representatives neither 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.420
 on the river there is a lot of athlete here in beautiful 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 Horizon I think because of terrain 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.450
 there are several mountains in several good streets 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.550
 to practice hence the Belo Horizonte I 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.920
 I think it 's the best place to walk 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.520
 skate here in brazil from rio 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.050
 and what is your opinion about 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.209
 specifically the mega space lane in the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.520
 mega space is very different because it is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.330
 made for a totally stretches thing 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.060
 skate is not is not the hill to truck 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.450
 it's nothing at all so the curves are 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.480
 very difficult slope is very high and 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.459
 It's very different there, it's very difficult but 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.010
 what the other place has nowhere 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.680
 in the world with one with the colors so good 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.959
 kevin with taste of victory you're done 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.549
 since, by anticipation, it is the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.709
 champion in this year's World Cup 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.350
 But how is the climate of being in the 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.910
 brazil practicing your portuguese wish 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.799
 on the track where the public has a 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.500
 visibility so good you can 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.420
 accompany cheer all the way 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.640
 How does it feel? 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.790
 enjoying this month in brazil 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.940
 field the championship here is very great and 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.859
 it's too good where else to stay here 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.829
 practicing Portuguese with a 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.390
 friend has several friends and the 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.269
 championship is good too 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.989
 I'm really liking Brazil. 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.450
 lack 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.950
 even with this heat with that sun is 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.320
 even hard to open the eye is everything 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.910
 right all right here in the mega space in 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.200
 Belo Horizonte, I'm enjoying it 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.799
