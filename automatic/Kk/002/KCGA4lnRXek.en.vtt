00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.399
 twister fakku video library let's find out how memories are installed 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.300
 ddr3 on a motherboard the insertion on the mainboard of the modules 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.880
 ram - it's a very simple operation 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.200
 but also licata in that it is made erroneous minutes and can cause breakage 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.790
 of the motherboard in the example we do in this guide we will use 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.880
 file the mac slots summer cars p45 we cut 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.700
 but we recommend that you consult the manual of your mother bora 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 to verify the exact positioning of the slots 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.260
 the first step will be to decide between which slots to insert ram memories 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.979
 usually the matherboards have 4 connector banks 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:12.979
 for the ram 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.240
 divided into two colors 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.270
 I remind you that for the new intel core i7 india systems the desks will sound who you are 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.970
 however, since the patrickchannel controller and no longer two donut the concept 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.590
 remains the same 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.050
 dual channel mode 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.300
 it is a feature of modern motherboards that allows a couple 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.020
 of ram to work in fact in pairs two ram modules work together 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.830
 splitting up tasks allows an increase in overall performance 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.240
 of the system 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.760
 to take advantage of the 2x20 arrahman mode 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.939
 besides of course having a mainboard that supports them 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.340
 yes I have to insert two ram modules 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.179
 removals alternating same principle for the 3 ch configuration that only work 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.399
 in bursts 3 once decided in which slots to insert our climbing 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.389
 let's move on to practical assembly 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:20.530
 first we have to lower the two white locking levers 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.850
 Posed Italian ends of the slots done what we support the form from 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.390
 mount on the slot 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.580
 assuring us that he did it on purpose 55 of the form 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.259
 but a little staggered 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:41.139
 coincide with the position of the inlay placed inside the slot of the 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.589
 mainboard 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:48.659
 these details guarantee the impossibility to insert incorrectly 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.359
 ip our ram modules 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.770
 at this point we push the module with the thumbs 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.220
 both hands from the left and right edges of the form. 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.369
 until the complete form is inserted. 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:07.509
 when this will be completed the white locking levers 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:11.919
 they will trust to beware by blocking ram attention though 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:16.689
 ah do not force the pd necessary to avoid breaking the mainboard 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.639
 we repeat this operation for all the ram modules to be installed lara - 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:28.889
 needs some software driver of any kind so just turn on the 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.799
 computer because the system to recognize immediately even for today is everything 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.899
 See you at the next video library 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.899
 where we will explain how to install a hard drive 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.259
 it 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.259
 it's 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.289
 it's 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:56.209
 it's
