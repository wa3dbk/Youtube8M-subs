00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
him because I don't think he and me can

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.850 
him because I don't think he and me can
be<00:02:36.430> together<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.240> set<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.990> have<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.620> very

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
be together on set and have a very

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.230 
be together on set and have a very
professional<00:02:39.220> relationship<00:02:39.459> that's<00:02:40.090> not

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
professional relationship that's not

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.699 
professional relationship that's not
possible<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.810> think<00:02:41.020> we<00:02:41.080> take<00:02:41.260> each<00:02:41.440> other<00:02:41.620> for

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
possible I think we take each other for

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.010 
possible I think we take each other for
granted<00:02:41.890> too<00:02:42.370> much<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.880> when<00:02:43.510> you're<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:43.780> set

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
granted too much and when you're on set

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.490 
granted too much and when you're on set
an<00:02:44.830> actor<00:02:45.580> has<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:46.030> respect<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.510> director<00:02:46.959> has

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
an actor has to respect the director has

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.140 
an actor has to respect the director has
to<00:02:47.739> take<00:02:47.920> orders<00:02:48.250> from<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.550> director<00:02:48.670> you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
to take orders from the director you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.430 
to take orders from the director you
know<00:02:49.270> what<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:50.160> liked<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.640> be<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.910> other<00:02:51.940> way

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
know what I liked it to be the other way

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
know what I liked it to be the other way
so<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.489> think<00:02:54.640> I'll<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.000> avoid<00:02:55.360> that
