the<00:00:03.139> MacBook<00:00:03.350> Pro<00:00:03.709> family<00:00:03.979> really<00:00:04.820> is<00:00:05.030> a<00:00:05.540> quite

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:06.320 
the MacBook Pro family really is a quite

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.129 
the MacBook Pro family really is a quite
remarkable<00:00:06.530> engineering<00:00:07.370> achievement<00:00:08.149> it's

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
remarkable engineering achievement it's

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.140 
remarkable engineering achievement it's
truly<00:00:09.830> the<00:00:09.860> result<00:00:10.429> of<00:00:11.019> years<00:00:12.019> of<00:00:12.969> hard<00:00:13.969> work

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
truly the result of years of hard work

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.800 
truly the result of years of hard work
of<00:00:15.100> innovation<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:16.309> in<00:00:17.090> driven<00:00:17.599> by<00:00:17.750> this

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
of innovation and in driven by this

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.279 
of innovation and in driven by this
obsessive<00:00:18.590> attention<00:00:19.189> to<00:00:20.000> to<00:00:20.420> every<00:00:20.869> detail

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
obsessive attention to to every detail

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.820 
obsessive attention to to every detail
and<00:00:22.029> this<00:00:23.029> is<00:00:23.210> particularly<00:00:23.779> evident<00:00:24.109> in<00:00:24.619> the

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
and this is particularly evident in the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.839 
and this is particularly evident in the
enclosure<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:27.339> traditionally<00:00:28.339> notebooks

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
enclosure and traditionally notebooks

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.920 
enclosure and traditionally notebooks
are<00:00:29.029> made<00:00:29.269> from<00:00:30.039> multiple<00:00:31.039> parts<00:00:31.809> but<00:00:32.809> the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
are made from multiple parts but the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.380 
are made from multiple parts but the
problem<00:00:33.260> is<00:00:33.379> when<00:00:33.890> you<00:00:34.039> have<00:00:34.280> multiple<00:00:35.000> parts

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
problem is when you have multiple parts

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.560 
problem is when you have multiple parts
you<00:00:35.570> you<00:00:35.780> add<00:00:35.930> size<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.770> weight<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.570> you

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
you you add size and weight and you

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.720 
you you add size and weight and you
increase<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.350> opportunity<00:00:39.920> for<00:00:40.070> failure<00:00:40.250> and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
increase the opportunity for failure and

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.049 
increase the opportunity for failure and
that<00:00:41.539> the<00:00:41.719> huge<00:00:42.410> breakthrough<00:00:42.980> that<00:00:43.550> we<00:00:43.760> heard

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
that the huge breakthrough that we heard

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.959 
that the huge breakthrough that we heard
was<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.809> replace<00:00:45.079> all<00:00:45.440> of<00:00:45.770> those<00:00:45.920> parts<00:00:46.399> with

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
was to replace all of those parts with

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.900 
was to replace all of those parts with
just<00:00:47.210> one<00:00:47.570> part<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.199> at<00:00:49.070> one<00:00:49.250> part<00:00:49.489> we<00:00:49.670> called

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
just one part and at one part we called

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.310 
just one part and at one part we called
the<00:00:50.000> unibody<00:00:51.309> we<00:00:52.309> figured<00:00:52.789> out<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.940> way<00:00:53.320> of

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
the unibody we figured out a way of

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.170 
the unibody we figured out a way of
being<00:00:54.710> able<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:55.039> make<00:00:55.250> make<00:00:55.730> make<00:00:56.030> the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
only way to make that one part was to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.550 
only way to make that one part was to
machine<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.450> from<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.900> single<00:01:12.290> piece<00:01:12.530> of

machine it from a single piece of
aluminium<00:01:17.079> aluminium<00:01:18.079> was<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.650> ideal<00:01:18.979> choice

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
aluminium aluminium was the ideal choice

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.100 
aluminium aluminium was the ideal choice
for<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:19.579> product<00:01:19.970> because<00:01:20.299> it<00:01:20.570> provides<00:01:20.960> us

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
for this product because it provides us

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.109 
for this product because it provides us
thinness<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:21.740> lightness<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.369> we<00:01:22.610> want<00:01:22.850> in

really nice options from a finishing
perspective

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.490 

beginning<00:01:35.329> of<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.539> unibody<00:01:35.899> starts<00:01:36.320> with<00:01:36.469> a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
beginning of the unibody starts with a

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.859 
beginning of the unibody starts with a
solid<00:01:36.920> block<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.250> aluminum<00:01:37.600> then<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:38.719> go

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
solid block of aluminum then we go

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.749 
solid block of aluminum then we go
through<00:01:39.079> an<00:01:39.200> extrusion<00:01:39.590> process<00:01:39.920> which<00:01:40.640> is

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
through an extrusion process which is

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.700 
through an extrusion process which is
kind<00:01:40.969> of<00:01:41.030> like<00:01:41.149> how<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:41.359> make<00:01:41.630> like<00:01:41.990> pasta<00:01:42.439> and

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
kind of like how you make like pasta and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.370 
kind of like how you make like pasta and
the<00:01:43.610> output<00:01:43.969> of<00:01:44.000> that<00:01:44.090> goes<00:01:44.780> through<00:01:45.079> nine

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
the output of that goes through nine

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.100 
the output of that goes through nine
separate<00:01:46.100> milling<00:01:46.640> operations<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.960> take

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
separate milling operations and take

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.590 
separate milling operations and take
apart<00:01:48.469> from<00:01:48.770> solid<00:01:49.460> block<00:01:49.670> down<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.450> the
