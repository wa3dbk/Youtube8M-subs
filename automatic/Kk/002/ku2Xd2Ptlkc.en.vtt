00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.170 

I<00:01:39.770> do<00:01:40.770> quite<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> lot<00:01:41.310> 50<00:01:41.700> stuff<00:01:41.940> in<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
electrical box just said I think it's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.660 
electrical box just said I think it's
probably<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.450> best<00:01:48.479> style<00:01:49.260> of<00:01:49.410> music<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.100> show

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
probably the best style of music to show

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.040 
probably the best style of music to show
off<00:01:55.460> can<00:01:56.460> Tom<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> show<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.210> course<00:01:57.720> not

off can Tom be a show of course not

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.969 
off can Tom be a show of course not
thanks<00:01:58.470> never<00:01:58.680> feel<00:01:59.300> very<00:02:00.300> modest<00:02:00.690> little<00:02:01.140> bit

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.230 

if<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:05.190> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> rehearsal<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.150> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
if I was going to a rehearsal and I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.359 
if I was going to a rehearsal and I
could<00:02:06.360> only<00:02:06.479> take<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.869> guitar<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
could only take one guitar this is the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.469 
could only take one guitar this is the
one<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:08.550> would<00:02:08.640> take<00:02:08.880> because<00:02:09.240> it's<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
one that would take because it's the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.780 
one that would take because it's the
most<00:02:09.660> versatile<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.739> has<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> kind<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.370> sand<00:02:11.610> so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
most versatile it has a kind of sand so

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.080 
most versatile it has a kind of sand so
we<00:02:11.910> might<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.209> something<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.730> might<00:02:17.940> use

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
we might do something like so might use

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.699 
we might do something like so might use
that<00:02:18.120> kind<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.540> sound<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:18.989> but<00:02:19.380> at<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.530> same

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
that kind of sound on it but at the same

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.680 
that kind of sound on it but at the same
time<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> guitar<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.610> also<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> used

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
time this is a guitar that also I used

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.420 
time this is a guitar that also I used
for<00:02:21.840> doing<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.020> solo<00:02:22.170> for<00:02:22.500> comfortably<00:02:23.250> numb

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
for doing the solo for comfortably numb

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.699 
for doing the solo for comfortably numb
so<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.060> put<00:02:24.209> on<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.360> different<00:02:24.480> pick<00:02:24.810> up<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.590> i'll

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
so I put on a different pick up and i'll

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.110 
so I put on a different pick up and i'll
change<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> settings<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.610> pedals<00:02:26.940> which

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
change the settings on the pedals which

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.520 
change the settings on the pedals which
changes<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.570> settings<00:02:27.989> on<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> amp<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.440> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
changes the settings on the amp and you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:49.570 
changes the settings on the amp and you
get<00:02:28.650> this

press<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:46.890> a<00:04:46.980> button<00:04:47.010> so<00:04:47.790> because<00:04:48.030> we're<00:04:48.180> in

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
press of a button so because we're in

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.310 
press of a button so because we're in
the<00:04:48.300> electric<00:04:48.540> silver<00:04:48.750> film<00:04:48.960> orchestra<00:04:49.290> I

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
the electric silver film orchestra I

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.420 
the electric silver film orchestra I
have<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.530> use<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.680> lot<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:49.919> different<00:04:50.280> sounds

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
have to use a lot of different sounds

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.370 
have to use a lot of different sounds
because<00:04:50.880> one<00:04:51.060> moment<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.930> might<00:04:51.990> have<00:04:52.169> to<00:04:52.260> do

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
because one moment it might have to do

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.050 
because one moment it might have to do
something<00:04:52.590> very<00:04:52.620> soft<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.760> next<00:04:53.910> moment

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
something very soft and the next moment

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.720 
something very soft and the next moment
of<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.419> do<00:04:54.510> big<00:04:54.720> guitar<00:04:54.810> solo<00:04:55.290> so<00:04:55.590> on<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.340> am<00:04:56.460> we

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
of to do big guitar solo so on the am we

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.830 
of to do big guitar solo so on the am we
have<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.880> four<00:04:57.060> different<00:04:57.360> ones<00:04:57.480> i've<00:04:57.690> got<00:04:57.810> a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
have a four different ones i've got a

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.119 
have a four different ones i've got a
basic

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
basic

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.879 
basic
got<00:04:59.789> basic<00:05:00.179> clean<00:05:00.419> Sanders<00:05:01.319> there<00:05:01.529> which<00:05:01.739> I

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
got basic clean Sanders there which I

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.450 
got basic clean Sanders there which I
can<00:05:02.039> just<00:05:02.159> use

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.560 

and<00:05:06.460> then<00:05:06.730> assign<00:05:07.390> with<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.570> bit<00:05:07.690> more<00:05:07.720> edge<00:05:07.960> and

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.640 

if<00:05:13.570> you<00:05:13.630> plug<00:05:13.810> that<00:05:13.840> into<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.170> guitar<00:05:14.470> it's<00:05:14.620> a

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
if you plug that into a guitar it's a

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.900 
if you plug that into a guitar it's a
bit<00:05:14.770> loud<00:05:14.890> like<00:05:15.160> that<00:05:15.190> one<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.490> would<00:05:15.580> distort

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
bit loud like that one it would distort

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.670 
bit loud like that one it would distort
slightly<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.720> then<00:05:16.750> we<00:05:16.930> have<00:05:17.050> this<00:05:17.200> and<00:05:17.500> this

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
slightly and then we have this and this

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.440 
slightly and then we have this and this
is<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.890> slightly<00:05:18.580> British<00:05:18.970> San<00:05:19.150> what<00:05:19.360> it

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
is a slightly British San what it

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.640 
is a slightly British San what it
actually<00:05:19.540> does<00:05:19.690> it<00:05:19.900> switches<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.350> speaker

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
actually does it switches the speaker

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.380 
actually does it switches the speaker
cabinets<00:05:21.040> in<00:05:21.160> there<00:05:21.310> from<00:05:21.730> Oh<00:05:21.850> from<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:22.210> close

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
cabinets in there from Oh from to close

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.970 
cabinets in there from Oh from to close
back<00:05:22.660> it<00:05:23.050> creates<00:05:23.320> more<00:05:23.440> of<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.590> compressed

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
back it creates more of a compressed

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:35.490 
back it creates more of a compressed
sound<00:05:33.360> that's<00:05:34.360> what's<00:05:34.780> described<00:05:35.170> as<00:05:35.290> a<00:05:35.320> kind

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
sound that's what's described as a kind

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.170 
sound that's what's described as a kind
of<00:05:35.530> British<00:05:35.860> distortion<00:05:36.400> and<00:05:36.550> then<00:05:36.970> there's<00:05:37.120> a

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
of British distortion and then there's a

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.730 
of British distortion and then there's a
full<00:05:37.390> American<00:05:37.840> distortion<00:05:38.320> which<00:05:38.470> is<00:05:38.620> this

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
full American distortion which is this

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.779 
full American distortion which is this
one<00:05:38.950> here

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.420 

and<00:05:44.789> then<00:05:45.539> we<00:05:45.629> use<00:05:45.780> them<00:05:46.020> this<00:05:46.770> affects<00:05:47.160> box

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
and then we use them this affects box

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.650 
and then we use them this affects box
here<00:05:47.669> which<00:05:47.699> allows<00:05:48.030> me<00:05:48.210> to<00:05:48.300> do<00:05:48.389> all<00:05:48.419> the

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
here which allows me to do all the

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.129 
here which allows me to do all the
different<00:05:48.900> things<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.319> I<00:05:49.379> can<00:05:49.560> have<00:05:49.710> it<00:05:49.830> set<00:05:50.099> up

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
different things so I can have it set up

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.510 
different things so I can have it set up
grab<00:05:52.139> it<00:05:52.229> with<00:05:52.319> no<00:05:52.440> effects<00:05:52.740> on<00:05:52.889> it<00:05:52.979> at<00:05:53.069> all<00:05:53.250> and

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
grab it with no effects on it at all and

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.610 
grab it with no effects on it at all and
then<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.150> can<00:05:54.180> fit<00:05:54.449> it<00:05:54.569> in<00:05:54.720> and<00:05:55.020> i<00:05:55.319> could<00:05:55.470> say

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
then I can fit it in and i could say

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.290 
then I can fit it in and i could say
right<00:05:55.650> can<00:05:56.069> be<00:05:56.099> loads<00:05:56.310> of<00:05:56.400> delay<00:05:56.909> which<00:05:57.120> might

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
right can be loads of delay which might

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.920 
right can be loads of delay which might
use<00:05:57.449> on<00:05:57.509> the<00:05:57.599> comfortably<00:05:57.960> numb<00:05:58.080> solo<00:06:02.930> and

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
use on the comfortably numb solo and

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.939 
use on the comfortably numb solo and
then<00:06:04.050> we<00:06:04.139> also<00:06:04.289> might<00:06:04.470> use<00:06:04.710> something<00:06:06.830> this<00:06:07.830> is

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
then we also might use something this is

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.460 
then we also might use something this is
a<00:06:07.979> tremolo<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.490> it<00:06:08.669> also<00:06:08.900> we've<00:06:09.900> built<00:06:10.169> a<00:06:10.259> box

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
a tremolo and it also we've built a box

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.710 
a tremolo and it also we've built a box
which<00:06:11.129> has<00:06:11.159> got<00:06:12.000> loads<00:06:12.180> of<00:06:12.240> switches<00:06:12.539> in<00:06:12.629> it

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
which has got loads of switches in it

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.879 
which has got loads of switches in it
and<00:06:12.840> some<00:06:12.930> other<00:06:13.080> gadgets<00:06:13.440> in<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:13.620> into<00:06:13.800> the

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
and some other gadgets in it into the

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.260 
and some other gadgets in it into the
treble<00:06:14.250> booster<00:06:14.610> and<00:06:14.699> some<00:06:14.819> other<00:06:14.940> stuff<00:06:15.000> in

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
treble booster and some other stuff in

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.059 
treble booster and some other stuff in
it<00:06:15.360> I<00:06:15.479> mean<00:06:15.629> this<00:06:15.990> unit<00:06:16.349> allows<00:06:16.470> us<00:06:16.710> to<00:06:16.830> switch

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
it I mean this unit allows us to switch

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:19.730 
it I mean this unit allows us to switch
them<00:06:17.280> all<00:06:17.400> in<00:06:17.580> so<00:06:18.030> basically<00:06:18.840> with<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.470> few

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
them all in so basically with a few

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.640 
them all in so basically with a few
switches<00:06:20.099> and<00:06:20.550> a<00:06:21.030> few<00:06:21.270> touches<00:06:21.659> of<00:06:21.900> my<00:06:22.080> feet<00:06:22.380> I

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
switches and a few touches of my feet I

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.300 
switches and a few touches of my feet I
can<00:06:23.069> completely<00:06:23.490> change<00:06:23.610> this<00:06:24.000> guitar<00:06:24.360> sound

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
can completely change this guitar sound

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.270 
can completely change this guitar sound
it<00:06:26.310> is<00:06:26.669> quite<00:06:26.970> complicated<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:28.190> there's<00:06:29.190> a

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
it is quite complicated and there's a

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.860 
it is quite complicated and there's a
lot<00:06:29.520> of<00:06:29.550> expensive<00:06:30.210> stuff<00:06:30.419> that<00:06:30.690> could

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
lot of expensive stuff that could

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.129 
lot of expensive stuff that could
potentially<00:06:31.490> get<00:06:32.490> damaged<00:06:33.030> if<00:06:33.270> you<00:06:33.449> connect

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
potentially get damaged if you connect

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.100 
potentially get damaged if you connect
up<00:06:34.349> wrong<00:06:35.039> way<00:06:35.250> but<00:06:35.669> it<00:06:36.599> makes<00:06:36.900> it<00:06:37.020> more

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
up wrong way but it makes it more

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.499 
up wrong way but it makes it more
interesting<00:06:37.409> it<00:06:38.250> used<00:06:38.400> to<00:06:38.490> be<00:06:38.610> just<00:06:38.759> you<00:06:39.360> know

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
interesting it used to be just you know

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:41.120 
interesting it used to be just you know
a<00:06:39.539> couple<00:06:39.780> of<00:06:39.900> guitars<00:06:39.990> and<00:06:40.349> an<00:06:40.409> amp<00:06:40.560> and<00:06:40.740> then

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
a couple of guitars and an amp and then

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.320 
a couple of guitars and an amp and then
in<00:06:41.250> the<00:06:41.310> film<00:06:41.490> orchestra<00:06:41.879> we<00:06:41.969> kept<00:06:42.180> adding

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
in the film orchestra we kept adding

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.790
