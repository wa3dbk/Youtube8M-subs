00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
really close play also what I have

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.270 
really close play also what I have
installed<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> trigger<00:01:58.680> stops<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.189> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
installed are the trigger stops as you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.910 
installed are the trigger stops as you
can<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.610> right<00:01:59.640> here<00:02:00.030> did<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.020> require<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> hex

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
can see right here did you require a hex

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.940 
can see right here did you require a hex
key<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.229> raise<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
key and what you can do is raise and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.459 
key and what you can do is raise and
lower<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.310> actual<00:02:06.270> height<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.110> triggers

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
lower the actual height of the triggers

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.979 
lower the actual height of the triggers
so<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.220> reaction<00:02:08.580> time<00:02:08.970> from<00:02:09.509> when<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.750> press

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
so the reaction time from when you press

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.690 
so the reaction time from when you press
it<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.349> when<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> trigger<00:02:11.009> goes<00:02:11.250> off<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.489> your

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it and when the trigger goes off on your

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.840 
it and when the trigger goes off on your
screen<00:02:12.060> is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
screen is

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.730 
screen is
much<00:02:12.940> quicker<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.840> definitely<00:02:14.320> allows<00:02:14.440> you

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
much quicker it definitely allows you

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.160 
much quicker it definitely allows you
for<00:02:14.950> not<00:02:15.400> only<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:15.910> faster<00:02:16.510> gunfire<00:02:16.930> if

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
for not only that but faster gunfire if

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.930 
for not only that but faster gunfire if
you're<00:02:17.320> using<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.680> semi-automatic<00:02:18.250> weapon<00:02:18.430> and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
a faster em down scope just so you can

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.490 
a faster em down scope just so you can
get<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.550> slight<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.880> bit<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.390> an<00:02:22.510> advantage<00:02:22.840> when

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
get a slight a bit of an advantage when

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.230 
get a slight a bit of an advantage when
you're<00:02:23.620> going<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.890> kill<00:02:24.070> someone<00:02:24.310> another
