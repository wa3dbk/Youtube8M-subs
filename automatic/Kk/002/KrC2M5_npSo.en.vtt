 sea ​​night landscape thing so 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.190
 simple as a novice here is where 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.290
 turn around you see I took the format 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:54.739
 horizontally to the most delicious places 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:58.620
 here it is the sea and the light of the moon moon glare 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.580
 so that the most delicious though 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.860
 I didn't occupy any place on the map 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:09.540
 took in horizontal that these strings of waves 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.740
 delicious pee and pieces of this void me 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.119
 there was too much orange there. 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.360
 and finally a yellowish stain 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:26.180
 the moon itself that is the distant water 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.770
 fingers are not shaken and all vibrations 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:36.120
 accumulated in the foreground area 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.900
 these are the front manifestations of the reel 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.070
 water already looks like dinner which means 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:50.610
 that they behave, but such 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:53.880
 trajectory flies inadvertently well 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.890
 sound night lets it all 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:03.140
 flicker and not be discharged but at the same time 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.770
 beautiful can be light 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.069
 Zelentsov slip show heat 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.069
 water 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.280
 little color has become therefore gives 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.480
 opportunity to lay like this 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.730
 cheesy like dryish color well 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.820
 particular if you failed it 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.830
 put then you just take the palette knife and 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.020
 put again on this place 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.200
 as yellow if 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:41.370
 shuffle with blue will turn green 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:47.260
 what we don't need here is this warmth 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:51.220

 not and paints calm show teme in 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:08.400
 this gap between the wave and the rolling water 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.030
 not to draw him 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 facial difficulties 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.840
 give him a light unshaven such a 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:24.730
 homely unshaven and our couple 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.070
 somewhat reflected in this glass well 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:55.979
