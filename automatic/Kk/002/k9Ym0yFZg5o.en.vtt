00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.420

 this device was launched early 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:35.850
 this week because of his 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:39.120
 The battery of 5,300 has a larger 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 than the others they have on the market doing 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.469
 with which the device is a little more 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.340
 southern grosso 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.410
 it is 11mm thick 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.960
 Good nothing nothing is so good, huh? 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.050
 So let's say this North Phone has a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.870
 good battery life that lasts almost two 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.379
 months in standby by certain only against 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.659
 from their settings are little 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.659
 They are less basic than we have in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.619
 market today the settings of the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.000
 unit is 5 inches screen 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.790
 android operational 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.630
 dlm it has capacity for up to two 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.880

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.009
 storage with support for micro sd 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 Well we can see that there is a configuration 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.829
 simple this smartphone has 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.930
 sure it's these philips gadgets 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.079
 usually only available 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.780
 but some models come to the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.219
 European market and do not know if the company 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.219
 have plans to take this model w 6618 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.229
 to other places like Brazil then 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.250
 I do not know if it's a robot 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.500
 to brazil 7 going back a little in the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.679
 battery issue 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.319
 we see nowadays there that when the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.930
 technology is still for example 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.299
 we are at a stage where 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.079
 companies are discovering new methods 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:26.219
 new processors and such companies 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:29.519
 smartphone technology 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:32.519
 they have to take other means then the 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.889
 battery point is being very 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.650
 my opinion is being a focus of the 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.840
 most of the companies because we can see 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.689
 this philips release that this 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.919
 Moorish smartphone around two months 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:50.430
 there are 106 days and both can see 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:51.840

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.150
