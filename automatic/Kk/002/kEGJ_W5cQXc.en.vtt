00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
you probably noticed that my hair is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.180 
you probably noticed that my hair is
pretty<00:00:11.400> long<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.210> because<00:00:12.920> I've<00:00:13.920> never

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
pretty long that is because I've never

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.160 
pretty long that is because I've never
gotten<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.700> cut<00:00:14.969> except<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.420> when<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:15.839> three

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
gotten a cut except for when I was three

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.800 
gotten a cut except for when I was three
that<00:00:16.619> wasn't<00:00:16.859> very<00:00:16.890> much<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:18.029> course<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.720> do

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
that wasn't very much but of course I do

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.080 
that wasn't very much but of course I do
get<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> trimmed<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> very<00:00:20.880> bottom

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
get it trimmed like at the very bottom

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.910 
get it trimmed like at the very bottom
so<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.689> my<00:00:22.050> ear<00:00:22.170> doesn't<00:00:22.350> get<00:00:22.560> split<00:00:22.800> up

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
so that my ear doesn't get split up

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.380 
so that my ear doesn't get split up
because<00:00:23.070> split<00:00:23.430> ends<00:00:23.670> every<00:00:23.880> bad<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.330> your

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
because split ends every bad for your

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.330 
because split ends every bad for your
hair<00:00:24.600> then<00:00:24.869> they<00:00:25.019> come<00:00:25.289> up<00:00:25.410> they<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:25.859> break

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
hair then they come up they like break

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.759 
hair then they come up they like break
cuz<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.359> split<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.779> way<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.529> break

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
cuz I split all the way up they break

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.650 
cuz I split all the way up they break
then<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.550> hair<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.970> very<00:00:30.150> healthy<00:00:30.570> or

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
then your hair is it very healthy or

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.780 
then your hair is it very healthy or
street<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.920> probably<00:00:32.160> thinking<00:00:32.430> though

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
street you're probably thinking though

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.959 
street you're probably thinking though
Anna<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.809> you've<00:00:34.050> never<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:34.680> hair<00:00:34.969> then

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
Anna if you've never got your hair then

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.240 
Anna if you've never got your hair then
why<00:00:36.149> isn't<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> floor<00:00:37.649> shouldn't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
why isn't it like to the floor shouldn't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.490 
why isn't it like to the floor shouldn't
it<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.579> dragging<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> ground<00:00:39.500> nope

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it be like dragging on the ground nope

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.389 
it be like dragging on the ground nope
why<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.910> my<00:00:41.940> hair<00:00:42.300> grows<00:00:42.570> really<00:00:43.500> really

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
why because my hair grows really really

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.110 
why because my hair grows really really
really<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.680> slowly<00:00:46.680> probably<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
really really slowly probably like a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
ninja air maybe maybe just maybe but

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.439
