easier yeah actually we have we've kind
of<00:00:18.750> improved<00:00:19.140> our<00:00:19.350> dovetail<00:00:20.250> err<00:00:20.430> into<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
of improved our dovetail err into the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.300 
of improved our dovetail err into the
the<00:00:21.720> next<00:00:21.900> regeneration<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:22.830> dug<00:00:23.039> Taylor

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the next regeneration really dug Taylor

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.240 
the next regeneration really dug Taylor
-<00:00:23.519> we've<00:00:24.150> added<00:00:24.359> control<00:00:25.260> knobs<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.039> can

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
- we've added control knobs so you can

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.370 
- we've added control knobs so you can
actually<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.210> lot<00:00:27.630> easier<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.199> router

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
actually use it a lot easier on a router

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.419 
actually use it a lot easier on a router
table<00:00:28.650> yeah

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
table yeah

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.840 
table yeah
you<00:00:29.789> also<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.390> these<00:00:30.840> clamp<00:00:31.140> bars<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.850> kind

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
you also have these clamp bars that kind

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.610 
you also have these clamp bars that kind
of<00:00:32.910> secure<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> wood<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.469> more

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of secure the wood a little little more

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.310 
of secure the wood a little little more
firmly<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.120> also<00:00:36.320> basically

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
firmly and now you can also basically

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
firmly and now you can also basically
use<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.100> two<00:00:38.700> positions<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.329> router

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
use this in two positions your router

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.479 
use this in two positions your router
table<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.590> also<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> bench<00:00:41.280> top

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
table right and also on a bench top

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.270 
table right and also on a bench top
model<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.000> would<00:00:42.149> clamp<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.570> wood<00:00:43.280> basically

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
model you would clamp the wood basically

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.220 
model you would clamp the wood basically
to<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.550> bench<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> could<00:00:46.110> also

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
to your bench and then you could also

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.529 
to your bench and then you could also
use<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> freehand<00:00:46.829> router<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.030> cut<00:00:48.420> your

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
use a freehand router to just cut your

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.479 
use a freehand router to just cut your
your<00:00:48.899> pins<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.260> tails<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.710> way<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.219> show<00:00:50.460> me

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
your pins and tails that way so show me

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.049 
your pins and tails that way so show me
how<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.760> works

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
how it works

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
sure yeah we take an actual piece of

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.900 
sure yeah we take an actual piece of
stock<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.530> deemed<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.579> gonna<00:00:56.699> be

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
okay should you have the pins but then

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.720 
okay should you have the pins but then
how<00:01:35.840> do<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:35.960> make<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.200> tails<00:01:36.440> well<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.580> would

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
and the nice thing about the jig is that

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.870 
and the nice thing about the jig is that
you're<00:01:48.110> able<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.500> take<00:01:48.710> your<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.220> piece<00:01:49.730> that

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
you're able to take your the piece that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.540 
you're able to take your the piece that
you<00:01:49.970> just<00:01:50.150> cut<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.770> align<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:51.800> with<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.370> top

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
you just cut and align it with the top

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.360 
you just cut and align it with the top
of<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.390> adjuster<00:01:53.810> plate<00:01:54.050> here<00:01:54.370> once

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
of the of the adjuster plate here once

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.430 
of the of the adjuster plate here once
you<00:01:55.570> align<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:59.020> secure<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.230> piece

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
you align it you then secure the piece

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.690 
you align it you then secure the piece
that's<00:02:00.590> going<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.860> be<00:02:00.980> in<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.190> back<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.550> it<00:02:01.670> so

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
that's going to be in the back of it so

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.850 
that's going to be in the back of it so
that<00:02:01.970> you're<00:02:02.120> actually<00:02:02.300> always<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.740> know

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
that you're actually always you know

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.000 
that you're actually always you know
end-to-end<00:02:04.869> on<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.020> same<00:02:06.260> on<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.590> same<00:02:06.770> plane

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
end-to-end on the same on the same plane

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.320 
end-to-end on the same on the same plane
and<00:02:07.310> what<00:02:07.460> if<00:02:07.550> we<00:02:07.610> have<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.729> bigger<00:02:07.940> piece<00:02:08.149> of

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
and what if we have a bigger piece of

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.060 
and what if we have a bigger piece of
wood<00:02:08.450> then<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.959> would<00:02:09.110> just<00:02:09.260> use<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.470> this

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
wood then you would just use a this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.340 
wood then you would just use a this
alignment<00:02:10.670> tool<00:02:10.880> okay<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.840> would<00:02:12.230> basically

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
alignment tool okay that would basically

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.199 
alignment tool okay that would basically
give<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.040> same<00:02:13.220> spacing<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.120> do

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
give you the same spacing and you can do

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.610 
give you the same spacing and you can do
infinite<00:02:14.600> adjustment<00:02:15.050> along<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.410> entire

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
infinite adjustment along the entire
