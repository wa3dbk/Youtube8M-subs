really for the heart rate strap to go in

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.830 
really for the heart rate strap to go in
as<00:00:34.629> well

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
as well

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.439 
as well
and<00:00:35.400> essentially<00:00:36.400> week<00:00:36.729> we<00:00:36.909> can<00:00:37.089> our<00:00:37.210> track

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
and essentially week we can our track

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.149 
and essentially week we can our track
exactly<00:00:37.629> what<00:00:38.019> they<00:00:38.140> do<00:00:38.199> during<00:00:38.559> a<00:00:38.650> session<00:00:38.860> in

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.159 
exactly what they do during a session in

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.979 
exactly what they do during a session in
terms<00:00:39.400> of<00:00:39.489> speed<00:00:39.760> distance<00:00:40.269> their<00:00:40.540> heart<00:00:40.720> rate

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
terms of speed distance their heart rate

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.140 
terms of speed distance their heart rate
body<00:00:41.409> loads<00:00:41.710> impacts<00:00:42.430> you<00:00:42.670> know<00:00:42.760> pretty<00:00:42.970> much

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
body loads impacts you know pretty much

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.880 
body loads impacts you know pretty much
the<00:00:43.330> works<00:00:43.540> gives<00:00:43.839> you<00:00:43.900> acceleration<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:44.830> the

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
the works gives you acceleration and the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.310 
the works gives you acceleration and the
sorts<00:00:45.129> of<00:00:45.190> things<00:00:45.809> they're<00:00:46.809> really<00:00:46.839> really

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
sorts of things they're really really

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.880 
sorts of things they're really really
useful<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:49.210> took<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:49.420> while<00:00:49.659> for<00:00:50.229> people<00:00:50.769> to

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
useful it took a while for people to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.609 
useful it took a while for people to
kind<00:00:51.010> of<00:00:51.129> get<00:00:51.489> used<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.940> concept<00:00:52.470> and<00:00:53.470> I

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
kind of get used to the concept and I

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.680 
kind of get used to the concept and I
think<00:00:53.650> what<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:54.190> has<00:00:54.400> done<00:00:54.699> for<00:00:54.970> us<00:00:55.059> is<00:00:55.299> there's

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
think what it has done for us is there's

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.930 
think what it has done for us is there's
no<00:00:55.869> hiding<00:00:56.320> anymore<00:00:56.530> people<00:00:57.430> will<00:00:57.670> come<00:00:57.820> off

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
no hiding anymore people will come off

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.009 
no hiding anymore people will come off
the<00:00:57.970> field<00:00:58.269> and<00:00:58.540> before<00:00:58.839> you've<00:00:58.960> even

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
the field and before you've even

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.899 
the field and before you've even
downloaded<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.799> data<00:00:59.949> they'll<00:01:00.280> just<00:01:00.460> say<00:01:00.640> I

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
downloaded the data they'll just say I

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.759 
downloaded the data they'll just say I
had<00:01:01.299> a<00:01:01.330> bad<00:01:01.540> session<00:01:01.839> I<00:01:02.170> think<00:01:02.409> what's<00:01:02.530> really

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
had a bad session I think what's really

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.320 
had a bad session I think what's really
good<00:01:02.920> about<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.159> is<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.460> very<00:01:03.699> able<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.119> self

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
good about that is a very able to self

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.730 
good about that is a very able to self
monitor<00:01:04.720> themselves<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:05.170> bit<00:01:05.320> better<00:01:05.470> and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
monitor themselves a bit better and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.800 
monitor themselves a bit better and
they're<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.490> bit<00:01:06.640> more<00:01:06.670> aware<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.330> their<00:01:07.540> bodies

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
they're a bit more aware of their bodies

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.020 
they're a bit more aware of their bodies
when<00:01:08.740> they've<00:01:08.860> run<00:01:09.040> good<00:01:09.250> scores<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.790> lot<00:01:09.970> of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
when they've run good scores a lot of

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.490 
when they've run good scores a lot of
them<00:01:10.180> will<00:01:10.270> run<00:01:10.390> over<00:01:10.600> straightaway<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.260> so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
them will run over straightaway and so

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.890 
them will run over straightaway and so
who's<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.830> top<00:01:12.010> scorer<00:01:12.310> for<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.580> day<00:01:12.760> so<00:01:13.420> in

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
who's the top scorer for the day so in

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.360 
who's the top scorer for the day so in
terms<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:14.380> there's<00:01:14.620> a<00:01:14.680> lot<00:01:14.830> of<00:01:14.950> good

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
terms of that there's a lot of good

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.820 
terms of that there's a lot of good
competition<00:01:16.240> going<00:01:16.480> on<00:01:16.630> now<00:01:16.870> we<00:01:17.710> know

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
competition going on now we know

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.470 
competition going on now we know
downhill<00:01:18.310> skiing<00:01:18.640> has<00:01:18.790> been<00:01:18.940> using<00:01:19.120> it<00:01:19.300> for<00:01:19.450> a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
downhill skiing has been using it for a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.600 
downhill skiing has been using it for a
while<00:01:19.630> we<00:01:20.380> know<00:01:20.500> for<00:01:20.710> me<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.920> won<00:01:21.070> have<00:01:21.340> used

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
while we know for me the won have used

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.100 
while we know for me the won have used
it<00:01:21.820> I<00:01:21.940> think<00:01:22.150> from<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.360> sevens<00:01:22.660> point<00:01:22.900> of<00:01:22.960> view

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
it I think from a sevens point of view

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.630 
it I think from a sevens point of view
undoubtedly<00:01:23.680> we<00:01:23.860> were<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.040> first<00:01:24.370> we

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
undoubtedly we were the first we

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.160 
undoubtedly we were the first we
basically<00:01:25.060> just<00:01:25.210> spent<00:01:25.300> a<00:01:25.450> year<00:01:25.480> getting<00:01:25.780> data

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
basically just spent a year getting data

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.640 
basically just spent a year getting data
and<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:28.150> that<00:01:28.300> we<00:01:28.690> slowly<00:01:28.960> started<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.470> see

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
and out of that we slowly started to see

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.770 
and out of that we slowly started to see
that<00:01:29.830> what<00:01:30.370> we're<00:01:30.520> doing<00:01:30.700> in<00:01:30.820> game<00:01:31.090> time<00:01:31.510> is

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
that what we're doing in game time is

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.330 
that what we're doing in game time is
not<00:01:31.990> actually<00:01:32.440> what<00:01:32.740> we<00:01:32.830> doing<00:01:33.010> in<00:01:33.130> training

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
not actually what we doing in training

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.190 
not actually what we doing in training
and<00:01:33.610> vice-versa<00:01:34.150> so<00:01:34.450> we<00:01:34.570> were<00:01:34.630> able<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:34.900> start

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
and vice-versa so we were able to start

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.470 
and vice-versa so we were able to start
closely<00:01:35.770> matching<00:01:36.310> training<00:01:37.000> intensity

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
closely matching training intensity

good feedback for the players because

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.250 
good feedback for the players because

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
I think the biggest thing for us is

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.590 
I think the biggest thing for us is
we've<00:02:17.490> been<00:02:17.610> able<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.880> develop<00:02:18.030> minimum

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
know which is a three minute or

kilometer marathon face that's that's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.740 
kilometer marathon face that's that's
decent<00:02:35.100> running<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.640> when<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.850> be<00:02:36.390> combining

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
decent running and when you be combining

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.880 
decent running and when you be combining
there<00:02:36.960> with<00:02:37.080> getting<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.590> off<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.740> ground

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
there with getting up and off the ground

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.740 
there with getting up and off the ground
catching<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.670> passing<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.090> ball<00:02:39.240> scanning

the<00:02:39.810> opposition<00:02:40.260> there's<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.680> lot<00:02:40.800> for<00:02:40.920> them<00:02:41.040> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the opposition there's a lot for them to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.210 
the opposition there's a lot for them to
compute<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.990> think<00:02:43.230> what<00:02:43.650> we've<00:02:43.830> got<00:02:44.040> nine

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
compute but I think what we've got nine

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.760 
compute but I think what we've got nine
sevens<00:02:44.760> probably<00:02:45.060> with<00:02:45.150> GPS<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.870> really

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
sevens probably with GPS is really

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.200 
sevens probably with GPS is really
really<00:02:47.010> good<00:02:47.220> athletes<00:02:47.580> who<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.850> play<00:02:48.030> rugby

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
really good athletes who can play rugby

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.180 
really good athletes who can play rugby
but<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.690> think<00:02:48.870> GPS<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:49.590> actually<00:02:49.980> making

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
but I think GPS is now actually making

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.490 
but I think GPS is now actually making
us<00:02:50.400> better<00:02:50.580> athletes<00:02:51.120> across<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.840> board<00:02:52.080> so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
us better athletes across the board so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.260 
us better athletes across the board so
we<00:02:53.070> should<00:02:53.280> see<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.550> game<00:02:53.700> develop<00:02:54.120> from

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
we should see the game develop from

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.780 
we should see the game develop from
