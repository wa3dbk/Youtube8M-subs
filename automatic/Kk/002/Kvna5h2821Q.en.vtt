00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.730 
just take a look at the differences
between<00:02:06.149> these<00:02:06.509> two

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.990 

I<00:02:15.680> guess<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.770> should<00:02:16.920> put<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.190> AL<00:02:17.430> striped<00:02:17.790> pack

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
I guess I should put the AL striped pack

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.170 
I guess I should put the AL striped pack
on<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:19.880> comparison<00:02:20.880> but<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.790> packed

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
on for this comparison but it's packed

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.460 
on for this comparison but it's packed
up<00:02:25.610> at<00:02:26.610> least<00:02:26.760> my<00:02:26.850> robot<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> machine<00:02:27.240> is

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.170 

so<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.160> definitely<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.490> get<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.670> letter<00:02:31.850> color

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
so you definitely do get a letter color

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.920 
so you definitely do get a letter color
of<00:02:32.480> pink<00:02:33.020> with<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.950> real<00:02:34.430> grade<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:35.570> do<00:02:35.720> get

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
of pink with the real grade you do get

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.330 
of pink with the real grade you do get
three<00:02:36.290> different<00:02:36.380> variations<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.160> pink

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
three different variations of the pink

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.710 
three different variations of the pink
color<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:37.700> one<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.060> course<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.390> almost<00:02:38.540> kind

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
color this one of course is almost kind

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.550 
color this one of course is almost kind
of<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.810> purpley<00:02:39.260> pink<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:42.140> there<00:02:42.320> are<00:02:42.410> some

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
of a purpley pink but there are some

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.320 
of a purpley pink but there are some
really<00:02:42.800> interesting<00:02:43.040> aesthetic<00:02:43.730> design

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
really interesting aesthetic design

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.350 
really interesting aesthetic design
choices<00:02:44.660> too<00:02:45.460> like<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.580> shoulder<00:02:46.850> pads<00:02:47.090> are<00:02:47.330> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
choices too like the shoulder pads are a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.990 
choices too like the shoulder pads are a
lot<00:02:47.480> smaller<00:02:47.720> here<00:02:48.140> they're<00:02:48.380> bigger<00:02:48.560> here

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
lot smaller here they're bigger here

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.760 
lot smaller here they're bigger here
just<00:02:50.000> all<00:02:50.240> in<00:02:50.390> all<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:51.110> robot<00:02:51.350> down<00:02:51.470> machine

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
just all in all the robot down machine

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.500 
just all in all the robot down machine
is<00:02:51.830> very<00:02:51.860> stylized<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.850> really<00:02:53.240> do<00:02:53.360> like

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
is very stylized but I really do like

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.560 
is very stylized but I really do like
the<00:02:53.780> realistic<00:02:54.200> look<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.860> real<00:02:55.010> grade<00:02:55.570> now

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
the realistic look of the real grade now

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.480 
the realistic look of the real grade now
the<00:02:56.630> only<00:02:56.900> other<00:02:57.140> real<00:02:57.230> grade<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.620> have<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.160> far

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
the only other real grade I have so far

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.980 
the only other real grade I have so far
is<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.990> real<00:03:03.140> great<00:03:03.380> freedom<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.780> think

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
is the real great freedom and I think

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.140 
is the real great freedom and I think
these<00:03:06.140> two<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.530> course<00:03:06.730> especially<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:08.090> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
these two of course especially in the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.190 
these two of course especially in the
seat<00:03:08.360> destiny<00:03:09.490> appear<00:03:10.630> few<00:03:11.630> times<00:03:11.900> together

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
seat destiny appear few times together

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.070 
seat destiny appear few times together
so<00:03:12.740> I<00:03:12.770> thought<00:03:13.150> they'd<00:03:14.150> be<00:03:14.180> two<00:03:14.540> suits<00:03:14.870> which

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
so I thought they'd be two suits which

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.520 
so I thought they'd be two suits which
would<00:03:15.230> be<00:03:15.290> kind<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.470> nice<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.800> have<00:03:15.920> i<00:03:17.530> think

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
would be kind of nice to have i think

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.630 
would be kind of nice to have i think
they<00:03:18.590> complement<00:03:18.950> each<00:03:19.070> other<00:03:19.250> fairly<00:03:19.550> well

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
they complement each other fairly well

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.090 
they complement each other fairly well
too<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:21.170> see<00:03:21.350> some<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.530> those<00:03:21.650> reflective

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
too you see some of those reflective

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.730 
too you see some of those reflective
stickers<00:03:22.250> on<00:03:22.580> me<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.810> freedom<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.380> don't<00:03:24.620> think

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
stickers on me the freedom I don't think

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.850 
stickers on me the freedom I don't think
it<00:03:24.800> really<00:03:24.920> overwhelms<00:03:25.490> it

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.410 

of<00:03:32.860> course<00:03:33.069> we<00:03:33.189> have<00:03:33.280> those<00:03:33.430> big<00:03:33.730> beam<00:03:34.000> sabers

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
of course we have those big beam sabers

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.160 
of course we have those big beam sabers
out<00:03:34.930> they<00:03:35.500> do<00:03:35.560> kind<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.750> bump<00:03:37.750> into<00:03:38.019> things

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
out they do kind of bump into things

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.960 
out they do kind of bump into things
from<00:03:38.379> time<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.620> time<00:03:39.209> well<00:03:40.209> anyway<00:03:41.909> thank<00:03:42.909> you

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
from time to time well anyway thank you

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.339 
from time to time well anyway thank you
very<00:03:43.030> much<00:03:43.269> for<00:03:43.480> watching<00:03:43.599> this<00:03:43.900> video<00:03:44.079> if<00:03:44.290> you

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
have any questions about this kit I'd be

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.600 
have any questions about this kit I'd be
happy<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.480> answer<00:03:46.780> them<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.260> have<00:03:48.250> yourself<00:03:48.579> a
