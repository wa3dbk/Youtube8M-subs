defensive<00:03:46.700> both<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.930> know<00:03:48.050> just<00:03:48.770> being

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
defensive both you know just being

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.670 
defensive both you know just being
resilient<00:03:49.520> you<00:03:50.060> know<00:03:50.210> and<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:51.200> know<00:03:51.290> they<00:03:51.470> may

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
resilient you know and you know they may

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.970 
resilient you know and you know they may
be<00:03:52.310> being<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.690> know<00:03:53.810> they<00:03:54.050> they<00:03:54.320> don't<00:03:54.680> beat

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
be being you know they they don't beat

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.280 
be being you know they they don't beat
themselves<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:55.910> think<00:03:55.940> that's<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:57.050> mark

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
themselves and I think that's the mark

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.110 
themselves and I think that's the mark
of<00:03:57.440> Rutgers<00:03:57.680> football<00:03:58.280> team<00:03:58.490> and<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.730> said<00:03:59.000> at

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
of Rutgers football team and I said at

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.110 
of Rutgers football team and I said at
my<00:03:59.150> press<00:03:59.540> conference<00:04:00.080> on<00:04:00.740> Monday<00:04:01.460> is<00:04:01.940> they

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
my press conference on Monday is they

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.970 
my press conference on Monday is they
make<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.480> earn<00:04:02.690> everything<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.770> get

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
make you earn everything that you get

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.430 
make you earn everything that you get
and<00:04:04.310> that's<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.240> byproduct<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.930> playing<00:04:06.200> great

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
and that's a byproduct to playing great

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.070 
and that's a byproduct to playing great
defense<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.760> honestly<00:04:08.210> again<00:04:08.960> it<00:04:09.050> just

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
defense and and honestly again it just

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.050 
defense and and honestly again it just
comes<00:04:09.500> down<00:04:09.740> with<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:10.070> critical<00:04:10.490> place<00:04:10.760> we

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
comes down with a critical place we

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.700 
comes down with a critical place we
didn't<00:04:11.330> make<00:04:11.420> critical<00:04:11.720> plays<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.500> third

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
didn't make critical plays and third

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.160 
didn't make critical plays and third
down<00:04:13.010> there<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.880> were<00:04:14.000> behind<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.510> chains<00:04:14.870> all

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
down there we were behind the chains all

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.050 
down there we were behind the chains all
day<00:04:15.410> long<00:04:15.650> when<00:04:15.950> you're<00:04:16.070> playing<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.520> talented

day long when you're playing a talented

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.420 
day long when you're playing a talented
defense<00:04:17.450> like<00:04:17.750> Rutgers<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.890> can't<00:04:19.220> have

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
defense like Rutgers you can't have

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.300 
defense like Rutgers you can't have
third<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.790> long<00:04:20.120> situations<00:04:20.450> you<00:04:21.140> mean<00:04:21.410> 31<00:04:22.130> or

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
third and long situations you mean 31 or

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.970 
third and long situations you mean 31 or
32<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:23.420> you<00:04:23.600> need<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.840> generate<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.950> know

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
32 and you need to generate you know

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:42.380 
32 and you need to generate you know
your<00:04:25.610> first<00:04:25.910> down

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.970 

absolutely<00:04:43.420> you<00:04:43.510> know<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:43.630> said<00:04:43.810> it<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.860> know

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
absolutely you know I said it you know

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.740 
absolutely you know I said it you know
again<00:04:45.250> at<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.520> beginning<00:04:45.640> of<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.120> week<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.600> it

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
again at the beginning of the week is it

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.330 
again at the beginning of the week is it
be<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:46.960> line<00:04:47.230> of<00:04:47.350> scrimmage<00:04:47.590> game<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.190> that's

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
be a line of scrimmage game and that's

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.610 
be a line of scrimmage game and that's
really<00:04:48.490> what<00:04:48.790> football<00:04:49.060> comes<00:04:49.480> down<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:50.050> is

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
really what football comes down to is

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.140 
really what football comes down to is
you<00:04:51.190> know<00:04:51.280> winning<00:04:51.760> your<00:04:51.940> one-on-one

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
you know winning your one-on-one

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.910 
you know winning your one-on-one
matchups<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.200> line<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.530> scrimmage<00:04:53.620> game

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
matchups in the line of scrimmage game

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.910 
matchups in the line of scrimmage game
and<00:04:54.340> getting<00:04:54.550> off<00:04:54.670> of<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.970> same<00:04:55.180> goal<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:55.920> you

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
and getting off of the same goal and you

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.200 
and getting off of the same goal and you
know<00:04:57.040> again<00:04:57.280> but<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.580> thought<00:04:57.820> our<00:04:57.880> defense

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
know again but I thought our defense

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.990 
know again but I thought our defense
shield<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.840> great<00:04:59.080> grip<00:04:59.610> again<00:05:00.610> that's<00:05:00.850> the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
shield a great grip again that's the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.790 
shield a great grip again that's the
lowest<00:05:01.180> output<00:05:01.540> they've<00:05:01.930> had<00:05:02.170> offensively

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
lowest output they've had offensively

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.880 
lowest output they've had offensively
and<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:04.390> know<00:05:04.510> our<00:05:04.600> kids<00:05:04.930> didn't<00:05:05.290> quit<00:05:05.530> but<00:05:05.770> at

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
and you know our kids didn't quit but at

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.370 
and you know our kids didn't quit but at
the<00:05:06.010> end<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.370> day<00:05:06.630> it's<00:05:07.630> making<00:05:08.050> in<00:05:08.140> place

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
the end of the day it's making in place

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.070 
the end of the day it's making in place

post is supposed to be double covered
and<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:20.740> know<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:20.950> comes<00:05:21.160> down<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.700> discipline

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
and you know it comes down I discipline

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.990 
and you know it comes down I discipline
we<00:05:22.870> didn't<00:05:23.110> execute<00:05:23.380> and<00:05:23.860> that's<00:05:24.490> on<00:05:24.670> us<00:05:24.820> as

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
we didn't execute and that's on us as

coaches that's not me and you know and

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.510 
coaches that's not me and you know and
they<00:05:28.360> made<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.600> great<00:05:28.870> play<00:05:29.020> but<00:05:29.470> again<00:05:30.220> we

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
they made a great play but again we

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.280 
they made a great play but again we
didn't<00:05:30.790> make<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.120> big<00:05:31.270> plays<00:05:31.660> we<00:05:31.960> didn't<00:05:32.140> even

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
didn't make the big plays we didn't even

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.710 
didn't make the big plays we didn't even
make<00:05:32.470> a<00:05:32.530> really<00:05:32.920> good<00:05:33.700> team<00:05:33.970> play<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:34.330> we

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
make a really good team play so we

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:43.980 
make a really good team play so we
needed<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.110> win<00:05:35.290> today

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.170 

you<00:05:44.590> know<00:05:44.710> Huggins<00:05:45.070> is<00:05:45.190> a<00:05:45.250> great<00:05:45.550> player<00:05:45.850> and<00:05:46.060> I

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
you know Huggins is a great player and I

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.240 
you know Huggins is a great player and I
think<00:05:46.450> you<00:05:47.020> know<00:05:47.140> there's<00:05:47.350> a<00:05:47.440> reason<00:05:47.650> why<00:05:47.980> he

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
think you know there's a reason why he

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.010 
think you know there's a reason why he
had<00:05:48.460> all<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:48.940> offers<00:05:49.330> he<00:05:49.480> had<00:05:49.630> on<00:05:49.780> a<00:05:49.810> high

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
had all the offers he had on a high

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.830 
had all the offers he had on a high
school<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:51.760> you<00:05:51.820> know<00:05:52.030> we<00:05:52.180> expected<00:05:52.780> that

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
school and so you know we expected that

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.780
