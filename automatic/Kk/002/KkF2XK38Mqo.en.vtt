00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 let's put it in our heads that I believe 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.389
 who is one of the best players of the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.250
 world to first see the play ea 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.219
 send your companions to the goal 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.170
 so if also totti will come and that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.279
 we must do will be priced will come 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.560
 attacked they will have to be good young people 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.960
 the players who are not better at sa 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 on totti 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.099
 rather than what will go to 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 degrees to the top because the part of the totti 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.809
 puts at any time of the goal 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 even if under pressure tomorrow it seems 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.790
 those who work far away give you 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.370
 Absorb absolutely to take everyone 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.350
 the insertions of the midfielders of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 Rome strikers who make those 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.399
 right timing for the right speed that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.250
 make with more players then top is 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.430
 certainly a point of reference 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 important to attack by not doing 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.570
 play with simplicity but totti is 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.770
 very good to send others to us 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.530
 we must be good at taking the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.619
 others who go without the ball though 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.060
 it's just a repeated situation 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.360
 in the games you play or just one 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.250
 situation and we want this belief 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.180
 that my school has it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.400
 clear text 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 we want to do this non-phase well 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.570
 possession ball but absolutely if 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.189
 we want to be able to make use of it 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.250
 the roma we do well to 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.070
 ball management phase 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 phase of occupation of the field the phase of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.560
 insertion in turn in the spaces 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.540
 that we do not want rome china scenarios 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.720
 we don't want is not our attitude 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.299
 in our mentality, make a phase 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.140
 make a passive game do one 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.520
 defensive game makes a match where 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.259
 where you go to the field with the hope of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.869
 don't take goals you don't go into the field with 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.159
 the absolute willingness to try to 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.290
 embarrass our opponents 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.490
 I like the reasons interviews of my parents 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.079
 players I read carefully 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.549
 I always do it very carefully 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.600
 the interview made my players 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.310
 in this stop I like how they think in 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.689
 I like what I think of a cycle 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.790
 like what they say to caprese 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.410
 the attitude I see in the field is me 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.800
 really liked the garden interview 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.170
 where he says it's not so important that 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.390
 my goals come it's important that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.660
 a team works and I saw a 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.739
 group that rows everything on the same side 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.250
 and these are attitudes that 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.120
 absolutely we must put 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.590
 on the field 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.750
 we are not in a position to be able to 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.450
 having that thought I told you 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.500
 we have zero points after two games 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.019
 so we don't have to have big 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.610
 decision great will great spirit 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.560
 great humility because I repeat we want 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.480
 going to Rome makes our game e 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.299
 try absolutely to move one 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.569
 ranking because the performance for 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.709
 what concerns me I must evaluate 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.090
 absolutely the performances are in 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.080
 growth but we need to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.860
 start making points 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.750
 so I don't think my players 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.430
 they can think right now and they are 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.370
 sure that they will not make Rome a little 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.549
 missing rasu aldo ankara de rossi che 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.500
 we will see a rome less than a strong one 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.049
 game look could play the apple 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.760
 do not play de reds play plans we try 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.680
 many and maybe those players who 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.090
 no one expected tatchidis type e 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.670
 florenzi have been better in the field 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.530
 san siro against inter therefore not 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.650
 we know what difficulties we will encounter 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.450
 we know why we will face each other 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.950
 but we also know which one is ours 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.069
 will which is our speak 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.989
 so we want to try from tomorrow to 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.519
 combine the two things because performance 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.709
 without the performance I left a little 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.329
 field was not positive and try 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.250
 throw us people even the positive that is 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.700
 that was our goal 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.700
 of tomorrow
