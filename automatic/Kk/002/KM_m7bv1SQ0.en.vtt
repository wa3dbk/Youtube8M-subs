00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
what I want to do is just throw it over

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.619 
what I want to do is just throw it over
there<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.590> water<00:03:57.890> on<00:03:58.100> see<00:03:58.310> what<00:03:58.460> happens

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.789 

and<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.200> starts<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.650> expand<00:04:06.290> see<00:04:07.290> here<00:04:07.530> coming

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
and it starts to expand see here coming

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.020 
and it starts to expand see here coming
out<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.099> hose<00:04:08.810> actually<00:04:09.810> very<00:04:10.170> very<00:04:10.379> firm

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
out of the hose actually very very firm

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.920 
out of the hose actually very very firm
its<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.299> winding<00:04:12.450> like<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> snake<00:04:14.569> let<00:04:15.569> me

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
its on the winding like a snake let me

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.029 
its on the winding like a snake let me
stretch<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.530> out<00:04:16.650> here<00:04:17.870> it's<00:04:18.870> pretty<00:04:19.259> solid

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
stretch it out here it's pretty solid

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.390 
stretch it out here it's pretty solid
it's<00:04:20.449> kind<00:04:21.449> of<00:04:21.509> hard<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.780> push<00:04:22.740> with<00:04:23.070> all<00:04:23.220> the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
it's kind of hard to push with all the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.529 
it's kind of hard to push with all the
pressure<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:25.680> know<00:04:25.940> strain<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.090> completely

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
pressure you know strain it completely

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:36.409 
pressure you know strain it completely
out<00:04:31.669> 50<00:04:32.669> feet<00:04:34.190> all<00:04:35.190> right<00:04:35.430> now<00:04:35.729> let's<00:04:36.150> turn

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
out 50 feet all right now let's turn

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:45.380 
out 50 feet all right now let's turn
this

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.570 

I<00:04:45.480> want<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.110> give<00:04:46.230> them<00:04:46.290> a<00:04:46.350> camera<00:04:46.680> with

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.830 

I'm<00:04:50.000> gonna<00:04:50.180> have<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.509> go<00:04:50.629> out<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.870> buy<00:04:51.020> miele

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
I'm gonna have to go out and buy miele

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.499 
I'm gonna have to go out and buy miele
handle<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.530> can<00:04:54.770> like<00:04:55.639> pressure<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.180> squirt

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
handle so I can like pressure to squirt

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.330 
handle so I can like pressure to squirt
it

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.850 

but<00:05:00.940> it's<00:05:01.090> working<00:05:01.900> pretty<00:05:02.080> good<00:05:02.350> compared<00:05:02.830> to

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
but it's working pretty good compared to

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:13.550 
but it's working pretty good compared to
the<00:05:03.010> my<00:05:03.160> old<00:05:03.370> water<00:05:03.639> hose<00:05:03.850> over<00:05:04.150> there

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.520 

neither<00:05:14.560> handle<00:05:15.070> so<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.250> could

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
neither handle so I could

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.010 
neither handle so I could
pistol<00:05:17.190> handles<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.730> squirt<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.500> better

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.750 

so<00:05:22.850> what<00:05:23.850> I<00:05:23.880> want<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.300> see<00:05:24.480> is<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:25.520> want<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.610> see

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
so what I want to see is I want to see

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.540 
so what I want to see is I want to see
if<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:26.940> does<00:05:27.120> what<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.360> says<00:05:27.440> unwinds<00:05:28.440> when<00:05:29.430> you

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
if it does what it says unwinds when you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.200 
if it does what it says unwinds when you
turn<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.850> water<00:05:30.000> off<00:05:34.670> I'm<00:05:35.670> going<00:05:35.850> to<00:05:35.910> turn<00:05:36.090> the

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
turn the water off I'm going to turn the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.240 
turn the water off I'm going to turn the
water<00:05:36.360> off<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:39.230> see<00:05:40.230> if<00:05:40.380> it<00:05:40.500> retracts<00:05:40.830> like<00:05:41.130> it

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
water off and see if it retracts like it

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.159 
water off and see if it retracts like it
says<00:05:41.460> it<00:05:41.580> does

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:52.249 

as<00:05:46.169> you<00:05:46.409> can<00:05:46.560> see<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:46.979> is<00:05:47.159> retracting<00:05:51.110> not<00:05:52.110> as

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
as you can see it is retracting not as

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.649 
as you can see it is retracting not as
fast<00:05:52.590> as<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:53.039> does<00:05:53.550> on<00:05:53.729> television<00:05:54.360> but<00:05:54.479> it's

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
fast as it does on television but it's

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.839 
fast as it does on television but it's
retracting

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:07.780 

shrinking

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.850 

but<00:06:08.360> although<00:06:08.450> shrinks<00:06:09.020> up<00:06:09.170> it<00:06:09.500> doesn't

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
but although shrinks up it doesn't

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:18.850 
but although shrinks up it doesn't
retract<00:06:10.130> all<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.490> way<00:06:10.550> back<00:06:13.000> at<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.120> end<00:06:17.860> give

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
retract all the way back at the end give

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.800 
retract all the way back at the end give
it<00:06:18.980> a<00:06:19.040> little<00:06:19.160> bit<00:06:19.340> help<00:06:22.330> well<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.420> doesn't<00:06:23.600> do

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
it a little bit help well it doesn't do

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.420 
it a little bit help well it doesn't do
like<00:06:23.990> on<00:06:24.140> TV<00:06:24.470> it<00:06:24.590> doesn't<00:06:24.740> retract<00:06:25.100> all<00:06:25.370> the

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
like on TV it doesn't retract all the

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.920 
like on TV it doesn't retract all the
way<00:06:25.490> back<00:06:25.700> to<00:06:25.880> the<00:06:25.970> end<00:06:26.150> although<00:06:26.570> it's<00:06:26.840> still

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
way back to the end although it's still

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.130 
way back to the end although it's still
retracting<00:06:27.650> I<00:06:27.740> can<00:06:27.890> still<00:06:28.220> see<00:06:28.370> it<00:06:28.400> moving

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.820 

it's<00:06:33.140> pretty<00:06:33.350> cool<00:06:33.560> hose<00:06:34.600> for<00:06:35.600> $19.99<00:06:36.440> I<00:06:36.470> don't

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
it's pretty cool hose for $19.99 I don't

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.720 
it's pretty cool hose for $19.99 I don't
know<00:06:36.980> maybe<00:06:37.970> $9.99<00:06:38.900> would<00:06:39.020> be<00:06:39.140> better<00:06:39.730> we'll

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
know maybe $9.99 would be better we'll

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.000 
know maybe $9.99 would be better we'll
see<00:06:40.880> how<00:06:41.030> this<00:06:41.420> lasted<00:06:42.020> in<00:06:42.080> the<00:06:42.140> Arizona<00:06:42.680> Heat

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
see how this lasted in the Arizona Heat

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.910 
see how this lasted in the Arizona Heat
I<00:06:43.160> will<00:06:43.460> wrap<00:06:43.700> it<00:06:43.850> up<00:06:43.940> under<00:06:44.270> this<00:06:44.680> my<00:06:45.680> hose

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920 
I will wrap it up under this my hose

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.090 
I will wrap it up under this my hose
holder<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:46.550> I<00:06:46.700> will<00:06:46.880> recycle<00:06:47.450> this<00:06:47.540> hose<00:06:48.100> so

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
holder and I will recycle this hose so

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
holder and I will recycle this hose so
there<00:06:49.280> you<00:06:49.370> have<00:06:49.400> it<00:06:49.580> the<00:06:49.820> pocket<00:06:50.270> hose<00:06:52.120> it's

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
there you have it the pocket hose it's

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.370 
there you have it the pocket hose it's
extremely<00:06:53.750> flat<00:06:55.510> it's<00:06:56.510> really<00:06:56.960> really<00:06:57.170> hard

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
extremely flat it's really really hard

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.220 
extremely flat it's really really hard
under<00:06:57.590> water<00:06:58.040> pressure<00:06:58.340> I<00:06:58.780> can<00:06:59.780> still<00:06:59.960> see<00:07:00.170> you

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
under water pressure I can still see you

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.420 
under water pressure I can still see you
slowly<00:07:00.500> retracting<00:07:02.350> so<00:07:03.350> we'll<00:07:03.950> see<00:07:04.160> how<00:07:04.310> it

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
slowly retracting so we'll see how it

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.510 
slowly retracting so we'll see how it
goes<00:07:04.460> I'll<00:07:04.820> give<00:07:04.970> it<00:07:05.090> a<00:07:05.530> couple<00:07:06.530> months<00:07:06.800> see<00:07:07.460> if

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
goes I'll give it a couple months see if

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.690 
goes I'll give it a couple months see if
the<00:07:07.640> Sun<00:07:07.850> doesn't<00:07:08.060> tear<00:07:08.360> it<00:07:08.450> up<00:07:09.430> come<00:07:10.430> laughs

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
the Sun doesn't tear it up come laughs

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.960 
the Sun doesn't tear it up come laughs
collapse<00:07:11.210> it<00:07:11.390> like<00:07:11.510> it<00:07:11.600> does<00:07:11.750> these<00:07:12.820> you<00:07:13.820> have

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970 
collapse it like it does these you have

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.190 
collapse it like it does these you have
a<00:07:14.030> pocket<00:07:14.420> hose<00:07:14.600> as<00:07:15.320> seen<00:07:15.950> on<00:07:16.130> TV<00:07:16.960> picked<00:07:17.960> it<00:07:18.080> up

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.200 
a pocket hose as seen on TV picked it up
