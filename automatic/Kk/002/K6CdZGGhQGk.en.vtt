00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
quite over the top of the ball it's

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.000 
quite over the top of the ball it's
going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> little<00:00:22.380> bit<00:00:22.500> more<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.710> front

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
going to be a little bit more in front

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.880 
going to be a little bit more in front
you<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.460> pull<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> back<00:00:24.619> almost<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
you can pull it back almost like a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
you can pull it back almost like a
behind-the-back<00:00:26.340> trip

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
behind-the-back trip

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.240 
behind-the-back trip
planting<00:00:27.480> foot<00:00:27.769> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.830> what's<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
planting foot this is what's going to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.980 
planting foot this is what's going to
move<00:00:29.400> back<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.880> your<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.359> hands<00:00:30.720> bringing

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
move back so your right hands bringing

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.240 
move back so your right hands bringing
the<00:00:31.140> ball<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.320> your<00:00:31.679> right<00:00:31.740> foots<00:00:32.009> got<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the ball back your right foots got to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.319 
the ball back your right foots got to
move<00:00:32.309> back<00:00:33.230> key<00:00:34.230> points<00:00:34.680> setting<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.340> where

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
move back key points setting it up where

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.440 
move back key points setting it up where
I<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.410> either<00:00:37.920> start<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.210> sideways

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
I like it either start kind of sideways

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.850 
I like it either start kind of sideways
like<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.230> defenders<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.710> you're

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
like this if your defenders on you're

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.209 
like this if your defenders on you're
here

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
here

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.160 
here
then<00:00:42.210> you're<00:00:42.360> already<00:00:42.450> halfway<00:00:42.750> into<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
then you're already halfway into the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.540 
then you're already halfway into the
spin<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> defender<00:00:44.010> tries<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> reach

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
spin and if a defender tries to reach

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
spin and if a defender tries to reach
it's<00:00:45.090> super<00:00:45.480> easy<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.960> spin<00:00:46.379> off<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.770> him<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's super easy to spin off of him and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670 
it's super easy to spin off of him and
you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.210> protection<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.410> body<00:00:49.590> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
you have protection because your body is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
you have protection because your body is
between<00:00:50.100> him<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.550> ball<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
between him and the ball so it's a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.180 
between him and the ball so it's a
really<00:00:52.199> great<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.500> before<00:00:52.800> you're<00:00:52.980> really

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
really great one before you're really

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.880 
really great one before you're really
close<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.610> defender<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
close to a defender and you have that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
close to a defender and you have that
protection<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> start<00:00:57.120> kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.480> sideways

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
protection if you start kind of sideways

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.119 
protection if you start kind of sideways
like<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> kind<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> protecting<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.890> ball<00:00:59.039> if

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
like this kind of protecting the ball if

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.590 
like this kind of protecting the ball if
your<00:00:59.250> off<00:00:59.370> arm<00:00:59.609> you're<00:00:59.760> already<00:00:59.879> halfway<00:01:00.180> into

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
your off arm you're already halfway into

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.979 
your off arm you're already halfway into
your<00:01:00.719> spin<00:01:01.520> just<00:01:02.520> comfortable<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.809> for

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
your spin just comfortable and go for

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.479 
your spin just comfortable and go for
the<00:01:04.049> lay<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.320> another<00:01:04.530> play<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the lay out another play I like to do it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.840 
the lay out another play I like to do it
is<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.510> between<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> legs<00:01:07.320> cross<00:01:07.590> whole

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
is off between the legs cross whole

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.429 
is off between the legs cross whole
reason<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.290> between

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
reason for that is if you do it between

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.100 
reason for that is if you do it between
the<00:01:10.680> legs<00:01:10.830> crossover<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.840> you're<00:01:12.840> starting

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the legs crossover and you're starting

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.990 
the legs crossover and you're starting
to<00:01:13.229> go<00:01:13.380> into<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.650> spin<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.850> your

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to go into your spin because your

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
to go into your spin because your
shoulders<00:01:15.270> start<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> turn<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.200> way<00:01:16.439> by

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
shoulders start to turn this way by

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
shoulders start to turn this way by
going<00:01:17.640> into<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> spin<00:01:18.119> move<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:18.689> seems

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
going into the spin move it also seems

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
going into the spin move it also seems
like<00:01:19.290> you're<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.799> turn<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.400> drive<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
like you're about to turn and drive this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.149 
like you're about to turn and drive this
way<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> split<00:01:21.720> second<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.950> kind

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
way for a split second and you can kind

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.399 
way for a split second and you can kind
of<00:01:23.220> start<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.670> slow<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.509> crossover<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of start and slow for this crossover and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.399 
of start and slow for this crossover and
this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.100> fit<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:26.520> into<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.600> pop<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.049> spin

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this is fit right into that pop the spin

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:28.850 
this is fit right into that pop the spin
move

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
move

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
move
and<00:01:28.950> go<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> basket<00:01:29.759> key<00:01:30.240> points<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
and go to the basket key points are that
