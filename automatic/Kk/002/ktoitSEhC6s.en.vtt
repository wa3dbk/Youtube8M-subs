00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
but you know I think it was a very

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.890 
but you know I think it was a very
Maxwell<00:04:08.070> thing<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.490> do<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.940> very<00:04:09.240> early<00:04:09.420> on

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
Maxwell thing to do and very early on

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.140 
Maxwell thing to do and very early on
you<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.710> said<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.130> me<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.520> I<00:04:11.550> think<00:04:11.700> all

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
you and said to me you know I think all

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.360 
you and said to me you know I think all
your<00:04:12.510> women<00:04:12.690> are<00:04:13.050> too<00:04:13.290> obsessed<00:04:13.740> with<00:04:14.010> weight

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
your women are too obsessed with weight

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.870 
your women are too obsessed with weight
and<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.780> think<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.440> all<00:04:16.830> women<00:04:17.130> probably

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
and I think that all women probably

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.550 
and I think that all women probably
should<00:04:18.060> be<00:04:18.209> about<00:04:18.450> 10<00:04:18.750> pounds<00:04:19.140> heavier<00:04:19.470> than

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
should be about 10 pounds heavier than

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.160 
should be about 10 pounds heavier than
they<00:04:19.890> are<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:20.790> moment<00:04:21.299> my<00:04:21.780> heart

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
they are and in that moment my heart

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.650 
they are and in that moment my heart
