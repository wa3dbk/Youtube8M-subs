00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
of the way I mean you jump off that

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.120 
of the way I mean you jump off that
bridge<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.739> for

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
bridge to here and you're going for

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.209 
bridge to here and you're going for
quite<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.399> hike<00:00:35.760> back<00:00:36.140> on<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.440> huge<00:00:37.770> rock

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
quite the hike back on this huge rock

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.040 
quite the hike back on this huge rock
there's<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.640> bunch<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.180> skinny<00:00:39.570> bridges

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
there's a bunch of really skinny bridges

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
there's a bunch of really skinny bridges
you<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.680> across<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:44.090> for<00:00:45.090> some

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you have to go across and for some

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.790 
you have to go across and for some
reason<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.840> did<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.140> earlier<00:00:46.410> he

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
reason when we did this earlier he

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.209 
reason when we did this earlier he
didn't<00:00:47.129> show<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.050> if<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.379> happens<00:00:49.860> just

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
didn't show up so if that happens just

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
didn't show up so if that happens just
quit<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.579> game<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> reloaded<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.199> did

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
quit the game and reloaded what we did

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.209 
quit the game and reloaded what we did
and<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.739> worked<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.129> fine<00:00:54.530> we<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:55.710> did<00:00:56.070> this

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
and I worked out fine we also did this

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.889 
and I worked out fine we also did this
once<00:00:56.460> earlier<00:00:56.730> where<00:00:57.090> he<00:00:57.300> actually<00:00:57.390> dropped

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
once earlier where he actually dropped

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.770 
once earlier where he actually dropped
the<00:00:58.050> assassins<00:00:58.710> alien<00:00:59.430> head<00:00:59.670> but<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.629> some

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the assassins alien head but for some

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.360 
the assassins alien head but for some
reason<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> recording<00:01:01.620> thing<00:01:01.649> works<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.250> have

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
reason the recording thing works we have

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
reason the recording thing works we have
to<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.910> again<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:04.080> time<00:01:04.140> he

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to go and do it again and this time he

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
to go and do it again and this time he
drops<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.920> Gunzerker<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.760> something<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
drops a Gunzerker one something but a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.250 
drops a Gunzerker one something but a
mustache<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.049> you'll<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.040> kill

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
mustache but you'll see that when I kill

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.630 
mustache but you'll see that when I kill
but<00:01:10.260> yeah<00:01:10.439> there's<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> lot<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.369> this

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
but yeah there's a lot more of this

first time so I was just kind of rushing

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.560 
first time so I was just kind of rushing
through<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.579> yeah<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.850> right<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
through it yeah like right up here is a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.690 
through it yeah like right up here is a
laugh<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.960> kind<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> lab<00:01:31.829> arises<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
laugh I kind of like the lab arises and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.660 
laugh I kind of like the lab arises and
then<00:01:32.850> sing<00:01:33.180> enough<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:35.040> rise<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
then sing enough here it will rise and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.960 
then sing enough here it will rise and
cover<00:01:36.000> almost<00:01:36.270> an<00:01:36.600> entire<00:01:36.720> thing<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.820> yeah<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
cover almost an entire thing and yeah it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.550 
cover almost an entire thing and yeah it
covers<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.450> too<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.990> impossible<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
covers there too so it's impossible to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
covers there too so it's impossible to
jump<00:01:40.860> across<00:01:40.950> about<00:01:41.340> hitting<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.540> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
jump across about hitting it but if you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660 
jump across about hitting it but if you
wait<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.170> lava<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.799> down<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.520> run

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
wait the lava will go down they can run

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
wait the lava will go down they can run
