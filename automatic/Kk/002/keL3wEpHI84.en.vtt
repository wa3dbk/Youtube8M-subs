00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 The rust protection is especially in the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.640
 Oldtimer restauration in the foreground and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.179
 this already starts at the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.250
 preparation of the paint work corrosion 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.590
 or education is one 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.360
 electrochemical process for the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.010
 rust on bare metal sheet raich 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.170
 already a light moisture or 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 grease film such as one 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.730
 simple fingerprint of the oxygen 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.340
 from the air interacts with the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.050
 water on the sheet an ion exchange 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.390
 starts and it creates a connection 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.940
 made of hydrogen and iron on the edge of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.590
 micro little drops of water will come out of it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 after the evaporation of the water 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.829
 so-called rust chemically as iron oxide 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 now refers to such 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.420
 to avoid ion exchange is the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.559
 ion connection interrupted 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.260
 in addition to the conventional rust inhibitor 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
 of the box ii base has now too 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.070
 foschini a product in the market 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.949
 brought that especially with the oldtimer 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.940
 Restoration finds its use 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.710
 new branch anti-rust filler before 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.660
 with the repair work by 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.430
 must be started spatula 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.000
 all ask to be spackled 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.110
 should 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.110
 be closed long 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.329
 the blank ground now becomes 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.740
 with silicone remove from grease and 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.740
 other residues freed 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:52.140
 After that, the order should be quite quick 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:54.109
 putty especially done the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.950
 Harder is in contact with the skin 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.420
 harmful and therefore should 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.040
 Be sure to wear a pair of rubber gloves 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.650
 when mixing and apply wear 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.120
 Now the polyester putty on 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.940
 a non-absorbent pad 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.649
 The material can be sucked 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 remove the solvents 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.260
 As a rule, the raw mass is about 2 to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.880
 5 percent harder added since it 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.240
 difficult this mix should be measured 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.070
 you can remember the following mission statement 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.320
 it's about the volume of a chicken's egg 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.030
 with the amount you like as toothpaste 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.670
 would put better on the tooth 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.910
 mixed this corresponds approximately to the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.650
 Mixing ratio 2 percent the mass 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.930
 must be done very well 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.470
 this is done by raising the filler several times 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.850
 and mix it again vigorously 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.900
 There must be no traces of the hertener 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.900
 be recognized more 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.300
 the mass will be mixed with it after mixing 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.790
 a flat spatula in generous 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.790
 trains pulled up over the body 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.850
 thin layers will gradually 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.850
 applied 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.120
 if properly mixed, the mass remains 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.739
 approximately five to ten minutes spreadable bar 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.720
 the apply is not strong 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.610
 carried out on press forces but 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.610
 with generous soft features 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.390
 the trains are always the form of 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.080
 state coach 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.080
 customized 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.430
 light skirts are no problem there 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.730
 Layer sanded after curing 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.670
 becomes 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.239
 The goal is a thin layer of layer 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.239
 receive 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.630
 the putty will shrink after that 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.000
 harden and about five percent 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.260
 therefore it is important in several thin ones 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.420
 layers to work 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.640
 too thickly applied layers can 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.630
 otherwise so much work that is 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.480
 form cracks after drying 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.370
 The anti rust partie adheres very well 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.790
 bare steel and also galvanized 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.790
 areas 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.930
 after curing 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.669
 putty will do this with a 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.889
 excellent grinder and one 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.520
 Sandpaper degradation 40 to 80 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.520
 completed
