 Hello, I am Maria and this is a techno kitchen 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.370
 I will tell you about very interesting 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.980
 laptop supplies from deepcool 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.139
 we have already met a stand in the form 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.210
 speakers and classic stand with 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.740
 fans but to have it all 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.500
 combine this we see for the first time so m 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.170
 6 as you see a huge stand with 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.869
 a large slope of 14 centimeters 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.300
 fan speakers located on the side 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.059
 there is a speaker and centered over 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.149
 fan powered by one yusbi 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.930
 besides there is a 4 port hub 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.940
 bitches transmitted through the audio cable if you have 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 need extra food to 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.739
 connect external drives 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.289
 they are only flash drives and mice 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 can be submitted via micro usb connector 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.780
 the speakers are loud enough you can 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:02.730
 appreciate the difference between built-in and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:05.460
 external sound but bass quality 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.070
 leaves much to be desired speakers sound 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.250
 like the cheapest and easiest desktop 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 copies a pity because the price coasters 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.689
 not little 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.890
 A 1700 rubles model is designed for 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.020
 laptops up to 17 inches 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.950
 14 centimeters fan turns with 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.670
 speed of 700 1000 revolutions per minute 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.900
 there is a regulator 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.520
 which is very lacking volume knobs 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.189
 case material plastic 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.430
 the surface under the laptop is metal 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.900
 mesh is a good idea in our opinion but 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.960
 too many flaws 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.630
 sound mediocre fan small 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.350
 tilt is not adjustable volume 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.229
 You can not change the hub there is no power supply or 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.380
 the cable included was a stand 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.380
 and Mary was with you maybe see you 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 not 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.789
 TV viewers
