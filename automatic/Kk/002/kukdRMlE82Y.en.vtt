00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
hi guys I bet you and there's two ways

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.650 
hi guys I bet you and there's two ways
you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.570> go<00:00:21.720> about<00:00:22.820> making<00:00:23.820> into<00:00:24.300> camping

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
you can go about making into camping

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
you can go about making into camping
food<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> make<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.279> Chile<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
food you can just make up on Chile and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.140 
food you can just make up on Chile and
dehydrate<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.490> rehydrate<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> got<00:00:29.939> chilly

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
dehydrate it and rehydrate it got chilly

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.900 
dehydrate it and rehydrate it got chilly
or<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.900> could<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.859> did<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.460> other

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
or you could do what I did in my other

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.720 
or you could do what I did in my other
Chile<00:00:33.300> video<00:00:33.690> inside<00:00:34.230> put<00:00:34.680> together<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
Chile video inside put together all the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.840 
Chile video inside put together all the
dehydrated<00:00:36.360> parts<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.290> meat<00:00:38.219> Chile<00:00:38.550> from<00:00:38.730> all

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
dehydrated parts and meat Chile from all

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.780 
dehydrated parts and meat Chile from all
different<00:00:39.350> hydrated<00:00:40.350> things<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:41.370> way<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
different hydrated things this way is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.560 
different hydrated things this way is
probably<00:00:42.120> much<00:00:42.329> easier<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.850> made<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> bunch

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
probably much easier so I made a bunch

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.319 
probably much easier so I made a bunch
of<00:00:45.690> Chile<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.050> other<00:00:46.230> night

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
of Chile in the other night

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.709 
of Chile in the other night
and<00:00:47.450> whole<00:00:48.050> bunch<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.469> leftovers<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:50.210> now<00:00:50.570> I'm

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
and whole bunch of leftovers so now I'm

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.470 
and whole bunch of leftovers so now I'm
going<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.899> dehydrate

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.720 

so<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.590> first<00:00:57.800> thing<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.070> want<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.310> do<00:00:58.460> is

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
so the first thing you want to do is

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.120 
so the first thing you want to do is
make<00:00:59.300> sure<00:00:59.330> that<00:00:59.510> it's<00:00:59.810> at<00:00:59.960> temperature<00:01:00.500> as<00:01:00.950> if

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
make sure that it's at temperature as if

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.710 
make sure that it's at temperature as if
it's<00:01:01.280> cold<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:01.970> you're<00:01:02.150> putting<00:01:02.330> it<00:01:02.420> on<00:01:02.570> the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
it's cold and you're putting it on the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.020 
it's cold and you're putting it on the
food<00:01:02.930> dehydrator<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:04.190> amount<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.430> time<00:01:04.730> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
food dehydrator the amount of time the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.970 
food dehydrator the amount of time the
food<00:01:05.210> dehydrator<00:01:05.960> is<00:01:05.990> going<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.260> take<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.740> heat

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
food dehydrator is going to take to heat

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.410 
food dehydrator is going to take to heat
up<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.340> food<00:01:07.550> it's<00:01:07.760> going<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.970> be<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.120> really

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
up the food it's going to be a really

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.690 
up the food it's going to be a really
long<00:01:08.720> time<00:01:08.990> in<00:01:09.680> what<00:01:10.040> is<00:01:10.160> called<00:01:10.400> as<00:01:10.550> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
long time in what is called as the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.020 
long time in what is called as the
danger<00:01:11.120> zone<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.930> danger<00:01:12.350> zone<00:01:12.620> is<00:01:12.979> from<00:01:13.370> 4

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
danger zone the danger zone is from 4

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.310 
danger zone the danger zone is from 4
degrees<00:01:14.390> Celsius<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:15.530> 60<00:01:15.950> degrees<00:01:16.250> Celsius

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.990 
degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius
where<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.470> growth<00:01:18.620> effect<00:01:18.800> bacteria<00:01:19.670> is

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
where the growth effect bacteria is

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.590 
where the growth effect bacteria is
accelerated<00:01:21.160> so<00:01:22.160> starting<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.970> off<00:01:23.120> with<00:01:23.150> hot

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
accelerated so starting it off with hot

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.870 
accelerated so starting it off with hot
food<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.140> dehydrator<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> way<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:25.220> avoid

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
food in the dehydrator is a way to avoid

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.170 
food in the dehydrator is a way to avoid
that<00:01:26.860> I'm<00:01:27.860> just<00:01:28.070> going<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.280> put<00:01:28.430> in<00:01:28.520> some<00:01:31.180> corn

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
that I'm just going to put in some corn

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.270 
that I'm just going to put in some corn
chips<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:38.380> just<00:01:39.380> crushed<00:01:39.590> them<00:01:39.770> up<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.070> what

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
chips I just crushed them up and what

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.710 
chips I just crushed them up and what
I'm<00:01:40.400> doing<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.270> for<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:43.150> help<00:01:44.150> soak<00:01:44.509> up

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
I'm doing this for is to help soak up

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.480 
I'm doing this for is to help soak up
some<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.229> moisture<00:01:45.380> that's<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.220> chili

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
some of the moisture that's in the chili

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.450 
some of the moisture that's in the chili
and<00:01:47.000> I'm<00:01:47.930> hoping<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.950> when<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.100> make<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
and I'm hoping that when I make the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.580 
and I'm hoping that when I make the
chili<00:01:49.700> it'll<00:01:49.970> help<00:01:50.149> to<00:01:50.509> thicken<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.050> sauce<00:01:51.290> of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
chili it'll help to thicken the sauce of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.499 
chili it'll help to thicken the sauce of
it<00:01:52.390> but<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.600> know<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:54.080> is<00:01:54.259> an<00:01:54.350> experiment

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
it but you know this is an experiment

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.469 
it but you know this is an experiment
I'm<00:01:56.509> more<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.350> learn<00:01:57.830> as<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.250> go<00:01:58.430> but<00:01:59.300> I'll

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
I'm more of a learn as you go but I'll

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.080 
I'm more of a learn as you go but I'll
let<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.020> guys<00:02:00.200> know<00:02:00.490> what<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.640> outcome<00:02:02.060> is

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
let you guys know what the outcome is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.309 
let you guys know what the outcome is
like<00:02:02.649> so<00:02:03.649> I'm<00:02:03.950> gonna<00:02:04.220> mix<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.910> in<00:02:05.149> I'm<00:02:06.110> gonna

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
like so I'm gonna mix that in I'm gonna

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.940 
like so I'm gonna mix that in I'm gonna
let<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.590> sit<00:02:07.009> for<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.280> couple<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.670> minutes<00:02:08.950> for

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
let that sit for a couple of minutes for

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.650 
let that sit for a couple of minutes for
the<00:02:10.009> chips<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.460> soften<00:02:10.700> up<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.120> soak<00:02:11.360> up<00:02:11.480> all

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
the chips to soften up and soak up all

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.790 
the chips to soften up and soak up all
the<00:02:12.910> juice<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.420> then<00:02:14.660> I'm<00:02:14.780> gonna<00:02:14.900> put<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.740> in

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
the juice and then I'm gonna put it in

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.880 
the juice and then I'm gonna put it in
the<00:02:15.950> dehydrator<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.209> don't<00:02:17.390> have

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
the dehydrator and if you don't have

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.960 
the dehydrator and if you don't have
tortilla<00:02:18.890> chips<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.280> crush<00:02:19.490> either<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.850> can

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
tortilla chips to crush either you can

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.730 
tortilla chips to crush either you can
use<00:02:20.090> potato<00:02:20.480> chips<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.050> can<00:02:21.230> use<00:02:21.380> bread

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
use potato chips you can use bread

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.300 
use potato chips you can use bread
crumbs

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
crumbs

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.059 
crumbs
you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.150> probably<00:02:23.270> even<00:02:23.480> use<00:02:23.770> instant<00:02:24.770> potato

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
you can probably even use instant potato

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.010 
you can probably even use instant potato
flakes<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:26.090> anything<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.630> suck<00:02:26.840> up<00:02:26.990> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
flakes just anything to suck up the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.759 
flakes just anything to suck up the
juice<00:02:27.310> shredded<00:02:28.310> brand<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:29.630> all<00:02:29.780> would<00:02:29.959> work

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
juice shredded brand it all would work

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.739 
juice shredded brand it all would work

okay so you're gonna want to use your

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.500 
okay so you're gonna want to use your
leather<00:02:37.749> making<00:02:38.499> machines<00:02:38.889> if<00:02:39.849> you<00:02:40.329> don't

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
leather making machines if you don't

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.470 
leather making machines if you don't
have<00:02:40.719> any<00:02:40.930> like<00:02:41.499> my<00:02:42.489> dehydrator<00:02:42.790> come<00:02:43.359> with

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
have any like my dehydrator come with

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.589 
have any like my dehydrator come with
them<00:02:43.659> so<00:02:43.900> uh<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.530> managed<00:02:45.249> to<00:02:45.310> find<00:02:45.579> but<00:02:45.999> I<00:02:46.239> think

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
them so uh I managed to find but I think

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.530 
them so uh I managed to find but I think
a<00:02:46.659> dollar<00:02:46.870> store<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.499> was<00:02:47.680> these<00:02:47.920> reusable<00:02:48.849> on

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
a dollar store it was these reusable on

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.580 
a dollar store it was these reusable on
a<00:02:49.569> baking<00:02:49.840> sheet<00:02:50.310> liners<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:52.389> just<00:02:52.719> cut<00:02:53.469> them

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
a baking sheet liners so I just cut them

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.940 
a baking sheet liners so I just cut them
out<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:54.370> want<00:02:54.519> if<00:02:55.269> you're<00:02:55.389> doing<00:02:55.689> that<00:02:55.950> you're

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
out you want if you're doing that you're

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.159 
out you want if you're doing that you're
going<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.189> need<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.430> leave<00:02:57.639> you<00:02:58.000> know<00:02:58.120> space<00:02:58.540> on

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.169 
going to need to leave you know space on

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.899 
going to need to leave you know space on
the<00:02:59.409> outside<00:02:59.859> for<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.370> air<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.730> get<00:03:00.849> through

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
the outside for the air to get through

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:12.000 
the outside for the air to get through
in<00:03:01.239> space<00:03:06.719> so<00:03:07.919> you<00:03:08.919> just<00:03:09.040> spread<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.430> out<00:03:11.010> and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
in space so you just spread it out and

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.670 
in space so you just spread it out and
stay<00:03:12.310> lean<00:03:12.549> as<00:03:12.879> evenly<00:03:13.419> as<00:03:13.569> possible

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
stay lean as evenly as possible

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.330 
stay lean as evenly as possible
and<00:03:15.129> if<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.430> notice<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.879> you've<00:03:16.000> got

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.949 

now<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.420> can<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:25.160> know<00:03:25.250> using<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.450> method

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
now you can you know using this method

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.460 
now you can you know using this method
you<00:03:26.989> can<00:03:28.000> pretty<00:03:29.000> much<00:03:29.120> do<00:03:29.690> anything<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:30.290> can

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
you can pretty much do anything you can

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.420 
you can pretty much do anything you can
do<00:03:31.150> careers<00:03:32.150> do<00:03:33.670> so<00:03:34.670> long<00:03:34.910> as<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:37.010> know<00:03:37.160> the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
do careers do so long as you know the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.100 
do careers do so long as you know the
the<00:03:37.730> pieces<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:40.489> have<00:03:40.580> like<00:03:40.760> big<00:03:41.420> chunks<00:03:41.450> of

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
the pieces you have like big chunks of

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.540 
the pieces you have like big chunks of
meat<00:03:42.290> like<00:03:42.530> but<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:43.790> not<00:03:44.000> going<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.330> work<00:03:48.550> I'm

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
meat like but it's not going to work I'm

00:03:49.550 --> 00:04:04.040 
meat like but it's not going to work I'm
gonna<00:03:49.670> try<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:49.970> encourage

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.670 

you<00:04:05.050> can<00:04:05.200> even<00:04:05.580> do<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:06.790> with<00:04:06.849> like<00:04:07.680> chili

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
you can even do this with like chili

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:23.740 
you can even do this with like chili
from<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.040> can<00:04:14.099> dehydrate

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.630 

so<00:04:23.930> they<00:04:24.110> call<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.500> little<00:04:24.980> tortilla<00:04:25.310> chips

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
so they call the little tortilla chips

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.549 
so they call the little tortilla chips
they<00:04:25.850> put<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.210> they're<00:04:26.450> all<00:04:26.600> soft<00:04:28.420> juice

00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:31.559 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.119 

and<00:04:32.309> one<00:04:32.489> thing<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.729> forgot<00:04:32.879> to<00:04:33.119> mention<00:04:33.209> before

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129 
and one thing I forgot to mention before

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:40.939 
and one thing I forgot to mention before
while<00:04:35.129> I<00:04:36.439> was<00:04:37.439> letting<00:04:37.889> it<00:04:37.949> sit<00:04:39.379> let<00:04:40.379> me<00:04:40.619> be<00:04:40.919> a

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
while I was letting it sit let me be a

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.629 
while I was letting it sit let me be a
tortilla<00:04:41.549> chips<00:04:41.879> absorb<00:04:42.329> all<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.659> liquid<00:04:42.809> I

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
tortilla chips absorb all the liquid I

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.309 
tortilla chips absorb all the liquid I
started<00:04:44.639> the<00:04:44.819> dehydrator<00:04:45.689> it's<00:04:45.929> always<00:04:46.109> good

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
started the dehydrator it's always good

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:52.580 
started the dehydrator it's always good
to<00:04:46.349> preheat<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:47.069> first

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:01.610 

once<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:53.710> get<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:53.950> all

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.660 

okay<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:02.520> put<00:05:03.150> all<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.540> trays<00:05:04.380> on<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:04.950> wine

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
okay so I put all the trays on and wine

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.750 
okay so I put all the trays on and wine
you<00:05:05.700> couldn't<00:05:06.150> have<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.620> turn<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.830> little

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
you couldn't have to turn it a little

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.460 
you couldn't have to turn it a little
walk<00:05:08.910> into<00:05:09.240> place<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:11.960> mine<00:05:12.960> didn't<00:05:13.260> come

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
walk into place and mine didn't come

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.430 
walk into place and mine didn't come
with<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:14.210> temperature<00:05:15.210> control<00:05:15.240> although<00:05:16.170> I

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
with the temperature control although I

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.790 
with the temperature control although I
had<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.770> friend<00:05:17.870> fixed<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:18.960> up<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.470> rather<00:05:19.590> my

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
had a friend fixed it up and rather my

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.640 
had a friend fixed it up and rather my
boyfriend<00:05:20.310> fixed<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:21.350> I'm<00:05:22.350> giving<00:05:22.620> you

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
boyfriend fixed it and I'm giving you

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.240 
boyfriend fixed it and I'm giving you
the<00:05:22.710> test<00:05:23.040> but<00:05:23.280> there's<00:05:23.570> holes<00:05:24.570> in<00:05:25.130> here<00:05:26.130> it's

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
the test but there's holes in here it's

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.440 
the test but there's holes in here it's
a<00:05:26.370> convent<00:05:26.760> and<00:05:26.970> that's<00:05:27.150> how<00:05:27.270> you're<00:05:27.420> supposed

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
a convent and that's how you're supposed

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.080 
a convent and that's how you're supposed
to<00:05:28.020> control<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.500> temperature<00:05:28.770> but<00:05:29.670> I<00:05:29.700> find<00:05:29.970> me

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
to control the temperature but I find me

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.650 
to control the temperature but I find me
my<00:05:30.510> machine<00:05:30.960> scorches<00:05:31.620> things<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:33.000> I'm<00:05:33.450> going

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
my machine scorches things so I'm going

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.350 
my machine scorches things so I'm going
to<00:05:33.720> start<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.020> up<00:05:34.140> on<00:05:34.440> high<00:05:35.060> for<00:05:36.060> maybe<00:05:36.330> a

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
to start it up on high for maybe a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.180 
to start it up on high for maybe a
couple<00:05:36.420> hours<00:05:36.780> and<00:05:37.260> then<00:05:37.440> I'm<00:05:37.560> gonna<00:05:37.710> turn<00:05:38.010> it

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
couple hours and then I'm gonna turn it

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.810 
couple hours and then I'm gonna turn it
down<00:05:38.340> onto<00:05:38.580> half<00:05:38.850> speed<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:41.040> dryer<00:05:41.370> things

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
down onto half speed the dryer things

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.630 
down onto half speed the dryer things
get<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.630> less<00:05:42.810> likely<00:05:43.230> bacteria<00:05:43.830> can<00:05:44.160> can

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
get the less likely bacteria can can

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.640 
get the less likely bacteria can can
grow<00:05:44.850> in<00:05:45.030> there<00:05:45.210> so<00:05:45.510> I'm<00:05:45.990> gonna<00:05:46.080> start<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.500> off

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
grow in there so I'm gonna start it off

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.730 
grow in there so I'm gonna start it off
on<00:05:46.830> high<00:05:47.040> which<00:05:47.430> I<00:05:47.640> read<00:05:47.880> it<00:05:48.030> about<00:05:48.320> between<00:05:49.320> 60

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
on high which I read it about between 60

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.630 
on high which I read it about between 60
and<00:05:49.770> 70<00:05:50.220> degrees<00:05:50.280> Celsius<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:52.250> once<00:05:53.250> it<00:05:53.400> dries

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
and 70 degrees Celsius and once it dries

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.340 
and 70 degrees Celsius and once it dries
out<00:05:53.850> I'll<00:05:54.090> turn<00:05:54.330> it<00:05:54.450> down<00:05:54.600> so<00:05:54.840> it<00:05:55.140> doesn't

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
out I'll turn it down so it doesn't

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.790 
out I'll turn it down so it doesn't
scorch<00:05:56.100> the<00:05:56.760> food<00:05:56.970> but<00:05:57.540> it'll<00:05:58.230> still<00:05:58.380> be<00:05:58.560> safe

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
scorch the food but it'll still be safe

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.750 
scorch the food but it'll still be safe
so<00:06:00.290> I'll<00:06:01.290> come<00:06:01.530> back<00:06:01.680> in<00:06:01.860> a<00:06:01.920> couple<00:06:02.040> hours<00:06:02.340> I'll

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
so I'll come back in a couple hours I'll

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.150 
so I'll come back in a couple hours I'll
probably<00:06:03.000> break<00:06:03.510> everything<00:06:03.810> apart<00:06:04.290> scatter

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
probably break everything apart scatter

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.850 
probably break everything apart scatter
it<00:06:05.570> you<00:06:06.570> know<00:06:06.690> we<00:06:06.870> distributed<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:07.470> on<00:06:07.680> the

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
it you know we distributed it on the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.910 
it you know we distributed it on the
night<00:06:08.040> and<00:06:08.900> see<00:06:09.900> if<00:06:10.020> it's<00:06:10.170> ready<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.590> turn<00:06:10.770> it

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
night and see if it's ready to turn it

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.739 
night and see if it's ready to turn it
down

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:13.749 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:20.350 

it's<00:06:14.749> been<00:06:15.080> about<00:06:15.499> four<00:06:15.860> hours<00:06:16.009> later<00:06:16.219> and<00:06:19.360> not

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
it's been about four hours later and not

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.300 
it's been about four hours later and not
as<00:06:20.509> much<00:06:20.659> progress<00:06:20.960> as<00:06:21.169> I<00:06:21.439> was<00:06:21.620> thinking<00:06:22.069> the

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
as much progress as I was thinking the

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.420 
as much progress as I was thinking the
top<00:06:22.520> is<00:06:22.729> a<00:06:22.759> bit<00:06:22.969> dry<00:06:23.499> the<00:06:24.499> water<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:25.009> bottom<00:06:25.310> is

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
top is a bit dry the water the bottom is

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.149 
top is a bit dry the water the bottom is
still<00:06:25.639> really<00:06:26.060> moist<00:06:26.210> so<00:06:26.629> it's<00:06:27.529> gonna<00:06:27.680> break

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
still really moist so it's gonna break

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.339 
still really moist so it's gonna break
it<00:06:28.370> all<00:06:28.490> up<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:29.060> give<00:06:29.569> it<00:06:29.659> a<00:06:29.719> bit<00:06:29.870> of<00:06:29.900> a<00:06:30.020> mix

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.779 

and<00:06:33.469> put<00:06:33.800> it<00:06:33.889> back<00:06:33.979> to<00:06:34.159> dry<00:06:34.369> I<00:06:34.669> also<00:06:35.449> put<00:06:36.020> I<00:06:36.789> have

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
and put it back to dry I also put I have

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:39.609 
and put it back to dry I also put I have
five<00:06:38.059> tracer<00:06:38.509> let's<00:06:38.659> I<00:06:38.749> put<00:06:38.930> the<00:06:39.020> extra<00:06:39.259> trays

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:39.619 
five tracer let's I put the extra trays

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.320 
five tracer let's I put the extra trays
in<00:06:39.830> between<00:06:40.159> each<00:06:40.369> layers<00:06:40.639> to<00:06:41.029> give<00:06:41.180> it<00:06:41.300> a

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
in between each layers to give it a

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.709 
in between each layers to give it a
little<00:06:41.449> bit<00:06:41.659> more<00:06:41.979> air<00:06:42.979> circulation<00:06:43.669> I<00:06:44.089> don't

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:44.719 
little bit more air circulation I don't

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:46.389 
little bit more air circulation I don't
know<00:06:44.779> if<00:06:44.869> it's<00:06:44.990> going<00:06:45.110> to<00:06:45.199> help<00:06:45.409> but<00:06:45.889> it's

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:46.399 
know if it's going to help but it's

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.929 
know if it's going to help but it's
