here<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.630> believe<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:08.340> should<00:01:08.400> find<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.330> flight

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
here I believe we should find a flight

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
here I believe we should find a flight
wash<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.860> technically<00:01:11.310> fly<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:12.030> an

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
wash not technically fly it's an

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.499 
wash not technically fly it's an
overhanging<00:01:12.810> tiger<00:01:13.350> mountain<00:01:14.210> thing<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
overhanging tiger mountain thing and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
overhanging tiger mountain thing and
underneath<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.619> water<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.130> melted

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
underneath it all water is melted

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.219 
underneath it all water is melted
because<00:01:17.580> obviously<00:01:17.880> ice<00:01:18.299> doesn't<00:01:18.630> refreeze

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
because obviously ice doesn't refreeze

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.350 
because obviously ice doesn't refreeze
under<00:01:19.770> surfaces<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.909> sucks<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> be

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
honest as you expect the temperature to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.070 
honest as you expect the temperature to
get<00:01:23.280> under<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.299> anyways<00:01:24.689> yeah<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:24.960> you
