what<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.760> end<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:36.979> transmitter

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
what you end up with is a transmitter

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.499 
what you end up with is a transmitter
that<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:41.390> looks<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.560> two

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
that is looks like that with the two

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.280 
that is looks like that with the two
buttons<00:01:45.509> power<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.840> channel<00:01:48.840> select

buttons power on and channel select
button<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.979> very<00:01:53.280> basic<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.909> doesn't<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
button it's very basic it doesn't have a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.240

will<00:02:38.540> slot

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:56.300 

right<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:46.110> goes<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> front<00:02:55.310> that

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
right so that goes on the front that

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.090 
right so that goes on the front that
screws<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.930> capsule<00:02:58.560> at<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.770> top<00:02:59.010> is

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
screws on the capsule at the top is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.520 
screws on the capsule at the top is
unscrew<00:03:02.100> ball<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.780> uses<00:03:03.780> an<00:03:04.020> industry

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
unscrew ball and uses an industry

per all the other major brands the
capsule<00:03:17.850> on<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.290> 35<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.680> slightly<00:03:20.460> different

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
capsule on the 35 is slightly different

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.510 
capsule on the 35 is slightly different
I<00:03:21.630> don't<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.620> technically<00:03:23.190> what<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
I don't know technically what the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.310 
I don't know technically what the
difference<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:27.000> has<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.720> black<00:03:27.990> grille

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
difference is but it has a black grille

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.630 
difference is but it has a black grille
whereas<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.160> 75<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.180> 55<00:03:30.900> has<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.650> silver

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
whereas the 75 and 55 has a silver

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.660 
whereas the 75 and 55 has a silver
grille<00:03:33.620> which<00:03:34.620> looks<00:03:34.950> slightly<00:03:35.310> more

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
grille which looks slightly more

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.540 
grille which looks slightly more
expensive<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.570> as<00:03:37.410> you'd<00:03:37.650> imagine<00:03:37.770> with<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
expensive and as you'd imagine with the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:47.229 
expensive and as you'd imagine with the
budget<00:03:38.880> price<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.260> unit<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:41.670> receiver<00:03:44.750> is

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
budget price of the unit the receiver is

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.160 
budget price of the unit the receiver is
like<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.989> plastic<00:03:52.040> construction<00:03:53.040> and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
like so it's a plastic construction and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.340 
like so it's a plastic construction and
has<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:57.800> six<00:03:58.800> available<00:03:59.459> channels<00:04:00.350> clickable

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
has the six available channels clickable

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.630 
has the six available channels clickable
to<00:04:02.720> receive<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:06.600> also<00:04:06.840> has<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> back<00:04:07.980> your

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
to receive it also has on the back your

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.280 
to receive it also has on the back your
power<00:04:09.510> input<00:04:10.050> jack<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:11.610> has<00:04:11.850> an<00:04:12.290> unbalanced

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
power input jack it has an unbalanced

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.320 
power input jack it has an unbalanced
jet<00:04:14.040> input<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.910> an<00:04:15.450> XLR<00:04:16.020> balanced<00:04:16.950> output<00:04:17.760> and

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
jet input and an XLR balanced output and

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.610 
jet input and an XLR balanced output and
little<00:04:18.870> both<00:04:19.049> outputs<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.070> knew<00:04:20.220> that

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
little both outputs but you knew that

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.900 
little both outputs but you knew that
when<00:04:22.620> power<00:04:22.919> did<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:24.000> get<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:25.669> green<00:04:26.669> light

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
when power did you get the green light

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.880 
when power did you get the green light
and<00:04:27.630> blue<00:04:28.440> light
