 the whole country 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.980
 without reaching an agreement, the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.050
 meeting in tunja between the minister of 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.600
 interior fernando carrillo the minister 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.500

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.820
 Governor of Boyacá now comes to a 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.480
 a stage of generating co of generating 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.630
 confidence in approaches and with 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.330

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.430
 defender of the people as we can move forward 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.630
 the interior minister said that the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.240
 government is willing to continue 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.660
 negotiating if protesters raise 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.220
 the locks and it would be of course 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.140
 returning to that dialogue table in the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.869
 extent that violence is renounced 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.460
 normality is restored and 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.380
 completely restore the order 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.930
 public and I think there has been a 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.790
 widespread feeling of that rejection 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.920
 to violence and rejection of the ways 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.780
 In fact however leaders 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.150
 farmers pointed out that unemployment 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.040
 continue indefinitely we have already 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.020
 made two stops on both occasions 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.570
 we believe in government we raise the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.940
 blockages and we were mocked then this 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.709
 time the concept of all of us the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.510
 peasant is that not until we do not 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.110
 give solution or let's start a kind of 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.510
 denial as we proposed it 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.400
 we do not raise the blocks on the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.410
 protests also pronounced the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.330

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.010
