I<00:00:00.089> also<00:00:00.599> just<00:00:01.140> want<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.530> touch<00:00:01.709> base<00:00:01.770> on

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
I also just want to touch base on

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.889 
I also just want to touch base on
something<00:00:02.909> that<00:00:03.060> most<00:00:03.300> people<00:00:03.600> wouldn't<00:00:03.780> even

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
something that most people wouldn't even

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.829 
something that most people wouldn't even
think<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.500> as<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> probiotic<00:00:05.330> but<00:00:06.330> guess<00:00:06.569> what

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
think of as a probiotic but guess what

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.549 
think of as a probiotic but guess what
fecal<00:00:07.770> transplant<00:00:08.370> meets<00:00:08.730> every<00:00:09.599> single<00:00:10.170> word

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
fecal transplant meets every single word

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.919 
fecal transplant meets every single word
in<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.010> definition<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:13.139> probiotic<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.929> as

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
in the definition of a probiotic and as

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.040 
in the definition of a probiotic and as
we<00:00:16.139> all<00:00:16.289> know<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.890> an<00:00:17.100> innovative<00:00:17.760> approach

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
we all know it's an innovative approach

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.990 
we all know it's an innovative approach
for<00:00:19.050> recurrent<00:00:19.619> seed<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.189> there<00:00:20.580> haven't<00:00:20.910> been

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
for recurrent seed if there haven't been

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.990 
for recurrent seed if there haven't been
a<00:00:21.119> huge<00:00:21.449> number<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.869> trials<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
a huge number of trials and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.640 
a huge number of trials and
unfortunately<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.439> everything<00:00:25.439> in

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
unfortunately like everything in

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.370 
unfortunately like everything in
probiotics<00:00:26.340> there's<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.359> lot<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.900> variability

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
probiotics there's a lot of variability

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.650 
probiotics there's a lot of variability
a<00:00:28.800> lot<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.160> variability<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> preparation

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
a lot of variability of the preparation

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.380 
a lot of variability of the preparation
a<00:00:30.869> lot<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.830> variability<00:00:32.550> as<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.850> how<00:00:33.149> these

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
a lot of variability as to how these

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.729 
a lot of variability as to how these
fecal<00:00:33.809> transplants<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:35.420> occurring<00:00:36.420> in

fecal transplants are occurring in

fecal transplants are occurring in
general<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.219> published<00:00:38.820> results<00:00:39.290> show<00:00:40.290> that

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
general the published results show that

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.290 
general the published results show that
the<00:00:41.910> results<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.750> positive<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the results are positive and that the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.690 
the results are positive and that the
microbiome<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> person<00:00:46.950> who<00:00:47.100> gets<00:00:47.460> the

microbiome of the person who gets the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.139 
microbiome of the person who gets the
transplant<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.559> donor

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
transplant is much more like the donor

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.660 
transplant is much more like the donor
these<00:00:51.149> are<00:00:51.360> some<00:00:51.570> data<00:00:51.780> from<00:00:52.340> January<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.579> the

just<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.879> infusion<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.050> donor<00:00:58.469> feces<00:00:59.690> there

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
just one infusion of donor feces there

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.750 
just one infusion of donor feces there
was<00:01:00.840> already<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:02.489> huge<00:01:03.270> percentage<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> cure

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
was already a huge percentage of cure

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.080 
was already a huge percentage of cure
versus<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.689> routine<00:01:07.200> vancomycin<00:01:08.010> therapy<00:01:08.909> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
versus the routine vancomycin therapy in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.149 
versus the routine vancomycin therapy in
fact<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.540> trial<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.140> stopped<00:01:10.530> early

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.590 

probably<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.880> heard<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
probably some of you have heard of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
probably some of you have heard of
alternative<00:01:16.320> approaches<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.250> people

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
alternative approaches because people

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.570 
alternative approaches because people
are<00:01:17.700> concerned<00:01:18.060> well<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.020> earth<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
are concerned well how on earth you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.390 
are concerned well how on earth you
safely<00:01:20.580> give<00:01:20.939> people<00:01:21.420> other<00:01:22.380> people's<00:01:22.860> poop

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
safely give people other people's poop

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.859 
safely give people other people's poop
so<00:01:24.680> what<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.130> Canadian<00:01:26.460> group<00:01:27.030> are<00:01:27.240> doing<00:01:27.600> is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so what the Canadian group are doing is

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.179 
so what the Canadian group are doing is
they're<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:29.009> choosing<00:01:30.439> 33<00:01:31.439> organisms

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
they're actually choosing 33 organisms

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.350 
they're actually choosing 33 organisms
that<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.790> think<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.210> probably<00:01:33.720> safe<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
that they think are probably safe and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.749 
that they think are probably safe and
essentially<00:01:36.680> transplanting<00:01:37.680> those<00:01:37.979> 33

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
essentially transplanting those 33

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.929 
essentially transplanting those 33
organisms<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:40.259> are<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.710> being<00:01:41.220> reported

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
organisms these are all being reported

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.749 
organisms these are all being reported
at<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> patient<00:01:42.659> level<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.649> stage<00:01:44.040> but

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
at the patient level at this stage but

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.410 
at the patient level at this stage but
in<00:01:44.970> general<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.869> seems<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:47.000> providing<00:01:48.000> these

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
in general it seems like providing these

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.679 
in general it seems like providing these
organisms<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.530> able<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.579> change<00:01:51.090> the

organisms is able to change the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.190 
organisms is able to change the
microbiome<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.740> these<00:01:53.399> people<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> scary

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
microbiome in these people so the scary

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.999 
microbiome in these people so the scary
thing<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.850> what's<00:01:56.850> next

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
thing is what's next

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.030 
thing is what's next
fecal<00:01:59.009> transplants<00:01:59.909> are<00:02:00.469> already<00:02:01.469> but

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
fecal transplants are already but

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.880 
fecal transplants are already but
they've<00:02:02.250> already<00:02:02.430> been<00:02:02.850> done<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:04.170> people<00:02:04.409> who

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
they've already been done for people who

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.310 
they've already been done for people who
have<00:02:05.070> metabolic<00:02:05.430> syndrome<00:02:06.320> getting

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320

distance and one of the things I'm a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.170 
distance and one of the things I'm a
little<00:02:11.750> scared<00:02:12.290> about<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.640> may<00:02:13.850> have<00:02:13.910> some

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
little scared about is we may have some

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.810 
little scared about is we may have some
very<00:02:14.210> interesting<00:02:15.050> data<00:02:15.470> from<00:02:16.010> Jeff<00:02:16.370> Gordon's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
very interesting data from Jeff Gordon's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.600 
very interesting data from Jeff Gordon's
mice<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.570> doesn't<00:02:18.230> tell<00:02:18.470> us<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:19.400> we're

mice but that doesn't tell us that we're

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.990 
mice but that doesn't tell us that we're

ready to do fecal transplants for

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.600 
ready to do fecal transplants for
obesity<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.350> have<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> ghastly<00:02:25.070> feeling

obesity but I have a ghastly feeling
we're<00:02:25.730> gonna<00:02:25.850> hear<00:02:26.060> about<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.480> really<00:02:26.840> soon<00:02:27.290> so

we're gonna hear about it really soon so

cost-effectively and with valid data so
with<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.900> I'd<00:03:30.140> like<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.500> conclude<00:03:30.710> and<00:03:31.400> say

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
with that I'd like to conclude and say

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.150 
with that I'd like to conclude and say
that<00:03:32.090> since<00:03:32.830> 2001<00:03:34.390> when<00:03:35.390> probiotics<00:03:36.320> was<00:03:36.620> such

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
that since 2001 when probiotics was such

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.560 
that since 2001 when probiotics was such
a<00:03:37.190> simple<00:03:37.640> concept

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
a simple concept

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.270 
a simple concept
I<00:03:38.950> think<00:03:40.300> enthusiasm<00:03:41.300> for<00:03:41.630> probiotics<00:03:42.530> has

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
I think enthusiasm for probiotics has

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.320 
I think enthusiasm for probiotics has
persisted<00:03:44.470> but<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.620> scientific<00:03:46.370> basis<00:03:47.030> and

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
persisted but the scientific basis and

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.250 
persisted but the scientific basis and
mechanism<00:03:48.230> studies<00:03:48.760> still<00:03:49.760> lag<00:03:50.150> were<00:03:51.080> not

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
mechanism studies still lag were not

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.920 
mechanism studies still lag were not
there<00:03:51.530> yet<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:52.420> think<00:03:53.420> omec<00:03:54.230> tools<00:03:54.620> are<00:03:55.930> rapidly

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
there yet I think omec tools are rapidly

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.620 
there yet I think omec tools are rapidly
evolving<00:03:57.340> they're<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.580> their<00:03:58.820> infancy<00:03:59.150> right

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
evolving they're in their infancy right

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.170 
evolving they're in their infancy right
now<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.650> think<00:04:01.010> they<00:04:01.220> will<00:04:01.610> help<00:04:01.940> us

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
now but I think they will help us

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.410 
now but I think they will help us
understand<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.930> microbiome<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:04.120> think<00:04:05.120> there

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
understand the microbiome I think there

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.320 
understand the microbiome I think there
are<00:04:05.450> lots<00:04:05.900> of<00:04:06.320> issues<00:04:06.530> about<00:04:07.130> whether<00:04:07.610> loving

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
are lots of issues about whether loving

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.380 
are lots of issues about whether loving
in<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.810> single<00:04:09.440> organism<00:04:10.070> or<00:04:10.550> multiple

in a single organism or multiple

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.980 
in a single organism or multiple
organisms<00:04:11.870> or<00:04:12.620> whole<00:04:13.610> microbial<00:04:14.390> communities

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
organisms or whole microbial communities

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.070

as<00:04:15.350> in<00:04:15.560> fecal<00:04:15.860> transplants<00:04:16.750> raises<00:04:17.750> an

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
as in fecal transplants raises an

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.979 
as in fecal transplants raises an
interesting<00:04:18.799> question<00:04:19.390> but<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:20.419> think<00:04:20.540> right

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
interesting question but I think right

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.200 
interesting question but I think right
now<00:04:21.020> we're<00:04:21.620> too

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
now we're too

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.960 
now we're too
in<00:04:22.509> the<00:04:22.660> field<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.830> make<00:04:24.069> any<00:04:24.430> real

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
predictions about how to make this go

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.390 
predictions about how to make this go
forward<00:04:28.000> but<00:04:28.660> probably<00:04:29.319> the<00:04:29.770> simple<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.280> the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
forward but probably the simple of the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.839 
forward but probably the simple of the
batter<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:31.530> finally<00:04:32.530> this<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.819> a

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
batter and finally this is a

multidisciplinary approach it needs to

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.010 
multidisciplinary approach it needs to
