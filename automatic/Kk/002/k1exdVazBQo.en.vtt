00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
I've been to Hermosa Beach which is

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.950 
I've been to Hermosa Beach which is
really<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:46.729> a<00:01:46.790> typical<00:01:47.060> LA

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
really just like a typical LA

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.990 
really just like a typical LA
Beach<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:49.220> mean<00:01:49.369> there's<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:49.610> volleyball

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
Beach I mean there's like volleyball

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.700

nets<00:01:50.689> everywhere<00:01:51.320> like<00:01:51.740> surfer<00:01:52.280> people<00:01:52.700> and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
nets everywhere like surfer people and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.249 
nets everywhere like surfer people and
shark<00:01:54.710> attacks<00:01:55.210> happen<00:01:56.210> there<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:56.930> I<00:01:56.960> guess

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
shark attacks happen there so I guess

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.340
