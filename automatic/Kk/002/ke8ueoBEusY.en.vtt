this case what I'll do is I'll just

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.870 
this case what I'll do is I'll just
pause<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.680> video<00:01:56.950> until<00:01:57.310> we're<00:01:57.490> almost<00:01:57.610> at

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the end so you don't have to watch this

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.450 
the end so you don't have to watch this
thing<00:02:00.159> go<00:02:00.340> all<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.610> way<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:03.280> almost

done once it reaches the end that's a

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.070 
done once it reaches the end that's a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
and it'll just restart on its own but

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.130 
and it'll just restart on its own but
since<00:02:27.790> we're<00:02:27.970> here<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.450> can<00:02:28.600> go<00:02:28.720> ahead<00:02:28.959> and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
since we're here we can go ahead and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.699 
since we're here we can go ahead and
click<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.530> restart

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.000 

well<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:38.750> restarting<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:40.680> get<00:02:40.859> this

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
well it's restarting we get this

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.940 
well it's restarting we get this

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.440 

again<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.129> will<00:02:50.310> take<00:02:50.489> some<00:02:50.700> time<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.209> I'll

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
again this will take some time so I'll

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.819 
again this will take some time so I'll
pause<00:02:51.689> the<00:02:51.870> video<00:02:52.109> of<00:02:52.230> recording

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
pause the video of recording

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.300

well<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.730> progress<00:02:54.540> continues<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.349> we'll

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
well the progress continues and we'll

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:08.620 
well the progress continues and we'll
check<00:02:57.090> back<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.569> little<00:02:57.810> later

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.080 

and<00:03:08.720> here<00:03:09.380> we<00:03:09.500> are<00:03:09.530> down<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.550> last<00:03:10.760> 10

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
and here we are down to the last 10

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:20.960 
and here we are down to the last 10
seconds<00:03:12.370> or<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.390> claims

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:37.650 

then<00:03:21.540> begins<00:03:22.140> restarting

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.250 

and<00:03:37.750> because<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.830> is<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.010> system<00:03:39.700> update<00:03:40.260> you

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
and because it is a system update you

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260 
and because it is a system update you
can<00:03:41.290> expect<00:03:41.860> your<00:03:42.130> Mac<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.550> take<00:03:42.730> longer<00:03:43.030> to

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
can expect your Mac to take longer to

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.160 
can expect your Mac to take longer to
boot<00:03:43.450> than<00:03:44.140> normally<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:49.570> next<00:03:49.810> step<00:03:49.990> on

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
boot than normally and the next step on

00:03:50.170 --> 00:04:01.250 
boot than normally and the next step on
restart<00:03:50.740> is<00:03:51.300> completing<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:52.450> installation

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.160
