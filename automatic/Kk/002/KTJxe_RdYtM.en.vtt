 heating for the last day of 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.360
 very recordings 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.429
 bruno gagliasso and roberto leal are 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.400
 received from friends of the singer in 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.070
 behind the hills the region was born 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350

 transmontana 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.910
 however besides already set the scene 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.369
 which will be run aboard that boat 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.769
 the idea is that the two embark with gray 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.950
 fishery at the mercy of the waters of 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.520
 then Walks will come from Brazil complete - 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.040
 but in the UN in Brazil he tried nine o'clock 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.710
 with the 4 that lack Sao Paulo with 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.750
 Cabral staff arrived in Brazil. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 more to do with something like this 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.960
 suspicious of what I think I 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.129
 I think fish will not interest you 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.820
 for a loaf of bread and japan 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.949
 I will not think it 's ours, it's not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.719
 My name is what you want to tell us. 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.420
 use could we cut the part of nokia 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.400
 bruno already what next comes to see if 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.400
 some censorship but there goes 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:32.659
 almost 500 for what is clumsy 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.049
 for fishing and for nautical 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:44.630
 I will explore other potentialities of 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:50.000
 hypertension because they are French 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.689
 It's not that I'm more sensitive 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.209
 I'm feeling very well. 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.429
 It was amazing that scene and they got 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.399
 there rehearsal an application from the 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.170
 intense physically and then see you do not 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.469
 you had to live 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.289
 It is dangerously we will call the engine 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.200
 motor operated in two men as there 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:20.359
 As we always touch, we are the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:23.170
 engine is without motor and without a script 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:25.459
 the scenes of the show are totally 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.410
 spontaneous is completely improvised 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.260
 own production team and wants to 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.480
 more are we going to prostitutes as was the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.790
 case of Iraq by a boat but all that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.130
 happened the turn is very surprising 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.840
 to be alive in the end study things 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.470
 that you will see in the program that we 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.599
 Let's not reveal more cool here. 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.459
 things to go to tears 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.190
 my encounter with honey suddenly in 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.799
 other versions as it was here we went out to 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.169
 the sea without knowing how to pick up the paddle 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.609
 understanding and things have happened that 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.280
 did you see any 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.959
 the legal framework is one of the singers who 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.410
 coming weeks will go through a 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.930
 crystal sound program in this series of seven 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.419
 50 humorous mini-documentaries 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.880
 minutes bruno garcia intends to show the 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.799
 other reality of popular artists 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 there is much visible that the very 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.430
 artists know that it is visible where 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.639
 itself plays with these things but does not 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.230
 this is the first objective of the program 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.299
 move the first one even show the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.109
 backstage of these artists music 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.330
 popular that has one has a project on one 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.030
 fascinating past 11 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.830
 sounds forced to the maximum and often 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.530
 has very complicated conditions for 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.820
 work but always do with one as 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.490
 exemplary dignity 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.880
 bruno enters the world of artists and 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.790
 in the bruno wave is this complexity that 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:54.689
 do Christians are like 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.689
 my love for you
