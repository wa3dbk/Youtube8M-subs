and just lay out our bag onto our plan I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.139 
and just lay out our bag onto our plan I
prefer<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.000> put<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:31.560> handles<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.940> slightly

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
prefer to put the handles just slightly

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.750 
prefer to put the handles just slightly
off<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.719> platen<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.129> either<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.489> this

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
off the platen you can either do it this

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.529 
off the platen you can either do it this
way<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.749> have<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.850> clamshell<00:00:38.850> press<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
way if you have a clamshell press and

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.209 
way if you have a clamshell press and
you<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.749> like<00:00:39.839> to<00:00:39.989> work<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.319> way<00:00:40.499> you<00:00:41.069> can

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you don't like to work that way you can

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.610 
you don't like to work that way you can
also<00:00:41.370> rotate<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.089> bag<00:00:42.300> onto<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.050> side<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.379> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
also rotate the bag onto the side of it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
also rotate the bag onto the side of it
as<00:00:43.769> well<00:00:43.879> just<00:00:44.879> depends<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.329> which<00:00:45.479> way<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
as well just depends on which way you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.530 
inserts because it's made out of
polycarbonate<00:02:10.019> material<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.069> break

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
polycarbonate material will not break

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.020 
polycarbonate material will not break
you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.719> press<00:02:12.900> down<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.319> see<00:02:13.469> that<00:02:13.680> it's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
you can press down and see that it's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.979 
you can press down and see that it's
centered<00:02:15.030> within<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.629> eight<00:02:15.749> and<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.959> half

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
centered within the eight and a half

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:16.540 
centered within the eight and a half
inch

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
inch

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.940 
inch
now<00:02:17.480> wait<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.750> do<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.960> make<00:02:18.110> sure<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.260> horizontal

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
now wait to do is make sure a horizontal

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.460 
now wait to do is make sure a horizontal
so<00:02:19.310> if<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:19.490> won't<00:02:19.670> do<00:02:19.880> let's<00:02:20.690> say<00:02:20.870> two<00:02:20.930> inches

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
so if we won't do let's say two inches

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.290 
so if we won't do let's say two inches
we<00:02:21.890> can<00:02:22.010> come<00:02:22.190> across<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.670> two<00:02:22.820> inches<00:02:23.150> that

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
we can come across the two inches that

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.330 
we can come across the two inches that
way<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.350> other<00:02:24.470> thing<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:25.070> do<00:02:25.220> as

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
way the other thing that you can do as

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.830 
way the other thing that you can do as
well<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.630> can<00:02:26.780> rotate<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:28.250> different

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
well is you can rotate the different

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.750 
well is you can rotate the different
tool<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.110> hit<00:02:30.230> different<00:02:30.380> marks<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.550> if<00:02:31.670> you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
tool to hit different marks and if you

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.470 
tool to hit different marks and if you
want<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.420> two<00:02:32.750> inches<00:02:33.460> we<00:02:34.460> can<00:02:34.730> bring<00:02:35.240> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
want it two inches we can bring the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.810 
want it two inches we can bring the
small<00:02:35.720> insert<00:02:36.110> up<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.130> top<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.580> small

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
small insert up and the top of the small

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.220 
small insert up and the top of the small
insert<00:02:38.150> comes<00:02:38.390> straight<00:02:38.600> across<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.050> two

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
insert comes straight across the two

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.730 
insert comes straight across the two
inch<00:02:39.410> line<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:41.060> by<00:02:41.540> rotating<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.200> one<00:02:42.380> up<00:02:42.530> I

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
inch line so by rotating that one up I

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.380 
inch line so by rotating that one up I
can<00:02:43.010> press<00:02:43.250> down<00:02:43.930> align<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:46.060> transfer<00:02:47.060> paper

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.650 

with<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.490> notice<00:02:52.970> down<00:02:53.150> here<00:02:53.210> comes

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
with that and notice down here comes

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.550 
with that and notice down here comes
down<00:02:53.870> as<00:02:54.020> well<00:02:54.400> onto<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.550> side<00:02:56.320> all<00:02:57.320> I<00:02:57.350> have
