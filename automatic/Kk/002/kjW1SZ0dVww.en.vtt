00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 charlie hunnam refused to star 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.020
 how to organize a book of 50 shades 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.819
 gray 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.379
 the official version is very tight 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.120
 schedule but according to the words he doesn't count 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.880
 Seriously filmed while slow housewives 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.130
 I myself will not read condemnation though 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.460
 if you want for and now the schedule itself 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.930
 business loaded hi i'm elena 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.279
 rasokhina and I want to share with you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.350
 my own about some strange 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.640
 and not so recent google deeds 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.769
 conceived to introduce several innovations 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.810
 with agency and game of 2013 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.029
 further then soon and when you change two of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.809
 which is a and do not give your 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.680
 password to all rogues and reminder 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.290
 about safety when using 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.899
 mobile devices and the third is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.360
 explanation why they are not photos of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.430
 your profile may appear products 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.710
 google including air advertising and 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.200
 other commercial materials and the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.090
 business and why did he appear somewhere ship 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.739
 deduction is that if you are something plus 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.239
 Wish your photo is at risk 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.160
 advertising this very thing there 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.140
 This is your Fred plus and in general 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.609
 recommend than yes of course this could 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.109
 to be useful if of course you can 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.879
 edit than not you are not interested 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.979
 really not because nobody canceled 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.770
 a horde of all-like people and people 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.290
 blacking you poboku google TTP 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.760
 for example, too, will be from the phone I am 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.320
 another application from google or 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 Played me grandmothers are not pleased 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.259
 pop-up physiognomy you are not familiar 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.240
 who approved it 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.490
 all pop up on screen against yours 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.409
 will generally not delight 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.869
 besides, it is likely to eat 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.430
 my finances is probably an innovation in 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.720
 future rocks of years cleaning fragment 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.549
 maybe someday it will become 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.439
 really handy thing but for now 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.030
 somehow doesn't fit in the moment i need 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.770
 I will be for the package from I really 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 I want to share something and in general 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.159
 a lot of people are fans 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.870
 using clyde profit i wouldn't 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.050
 wanted my physiognomy 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.800
 husky flashed wherever 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.810
 great that there is a possibility 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.760
 you just need to disable understand 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.230
 settings and before going google going 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.660
 run your roots everywhere 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.400
 I suspect that already for no one 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.480
 news that about a month ago came out 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.520
 iphone ear 5s 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.320
 unexpectedly on this model has blue 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.000
 death screen that everyone is very familiar 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.530
 as usually the same is only close 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.980
 users since old version 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.990
 windows 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.400
 reboot blue screen sky arises 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.920
 mainly when working with some 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.210
 Apple applications from iwork 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.940
 which by the way is distributed for free 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.070
 apple introduced ios 702 update 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.200
 mainly to correct errors with 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.940
 lock screen security but she doesn't 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.830
 removes the specified problem blue screen 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.450
 and reboots might be worth it 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.400
 concentrate first of all attention 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.110
 by rapist screen and not on something else 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.080
 so as user twitter rush, 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.790
 keep your brows moving 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.830
 hehe hehe hehe on this perhaps all with you 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.270
 It was elena rasokhina and now I have a house 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.130
 what about the day if this release 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.800
 2000 likes will show you 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.120
 the following issues subscribe 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.530
 By the way if the site suddenly stumble on 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.210
 interesting things throw off tito 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.010
 corresponding topic to VK group 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.750

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.980
 grab and by the way yes well you who 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.540
 will get me the most marks 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.540
 like the risk of being released
