it's one of these seasons that it's
going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.550> close<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.570> 40<00:00:30.929> points<00:00:31.260> mark

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
going to be close to the 40 points mark

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.729 
going to be close to the 40 points mark
if<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:32.780> more<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.530> small

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
if not more but it's going to be small

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.049 
if not more but it's going to be small
margins<00:00:35.219> everything<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.030> down

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
margins everything is going to go down

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.330 
margins everything is going to go down
to<00:00:36.270> small<00:00:36.660> details<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.559> even<00:00:38.149> even<00:00:40.160> from<00:00:41.160> now

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
to small details and even even from now

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.389 
to small details and even even from now
on<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.110> particular<00:00:43.649> battles<00:00:44.250> between

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
on the the particular battles between

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.920 
on the the particular battles between
the<00:00:44.550> team<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.000> they<00:00:45.120> around<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.600> area

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the team that they around that area

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
the team that they around that area
they're<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.559> extra<00:00:46.920> significance<00:00:47.100> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
they're gonna have extra significance so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
they're gonna have extra significance so
I<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.480> we're<00:00:48.719> gonna<00:00:48.840> we're<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> see

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I think we're gonna we're going to see

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
I think we're gonna we're going to see
the<00:00:50.010> most<00:00:50.370> exciting<00:00:51.030> ending<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.719> season

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the most exciting ending of this season

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.889 
the most exciting ending of this season
to<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.850> we've<00:00:54.000> seen<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.449> many<00:00:54.570> many<00:00:54.780> years

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
to that we've seen for many many years

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.720 
to that we've seen for many many years
in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> Premier<00:00:56.010> League<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
in the in the Premier League this is

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549 
in the in the Premier League this is
going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.300> crucial<00:00:57.690> period<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.410> now

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
going to be a crucial period for you now

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.860 
going to be a crucial period for you now
coming<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> next<00:01:00.300> six<00:01:00.780> games

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
coming up because in the next six games

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.709 
coming up because in the next six games
or<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:01.530> you've<00:01:01.739> got<00:01:01.859> four<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.430> five

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
or so I think you've got four or five

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.060 
or so I think you've got four or five
occasions<00:01:03.719> where<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.379> play<00:01:04.619> some<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
occasions where you play some of the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.730 
occasions where you play some of the
so-called<00:01:06.030> top<00:01:06.510> four<00:01:06.810> sides<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.590> have

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so-called top four sides but you have

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
so-called top four sides but you have
got<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.040> strange<00:01:08.850> record<00:01:09.240> revenue<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
got this strange record revenue in the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.480 
got this strange record revenue in the
last<00:01:09.840> couple<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> years<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.159> proven

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
last couple of years we you have proven

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
last couple of years we you have proven
that<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.729> take<00:01:12.479> points<00:01:12.869> off<00:01:12.930> those<00:01:13.140> top

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that you can take points off those top

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
that you can take points off those top
sides<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> regular<00:01:13.950> basis<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
sides on a regular basis we do with the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.910 
sides on a regular basis we do with the
but<00:01:15.299> we're<00:01:15.509> looking<00:01:15.720> at<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:16.020> we're<00:01:16.799> going

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
but we're looking at them we're going

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
but we're looking at them we're going
now<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.759> last<00:01:18.030> third<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
now into the last third of the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
now into the last third of the
competition<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> clear<00:01:19.920> idea<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.430> getting

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
competition with a clear idea of getting

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
competition with a clear idea of getting
as<00:01:20.939> many<00:01:21.090> points<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.439> about

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
as many points as we can it's not about

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.410 
as many points as we can it's not about
who<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.070> get<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> points<00:01:23.700> again<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.119> when

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
who we get in the points again so when

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.600 
who we get in the points again so when
we<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> point<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.560> before<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
we get in the point is just before the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.789 
we get in the point is just before the
22nd<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> May<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.930> points<00:01:28.259> tally<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.619> it

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
22nd of May is the points tally that it

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.950 
22nd of May is the points tally that it
counts<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.520> where<00:01:29.700> our<00:01:29.850> focus<00:01:30.329> goes

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
counts and that's where our focus goes

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
counts and that's where our focus goes
but<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.829> quite<00:01:32.040> clear<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.579> is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
but I thing is quite clear that there is

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.560 
but I thing is quite clear that there is
a<00:01:32.700> real<00:01:33.390> understanding<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.610> cam<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.090> we

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
a real understanding in the cam that we
