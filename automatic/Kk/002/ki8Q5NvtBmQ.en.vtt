00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:16.410
 the floor and so we get here 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.650
 such quality and figurative and when you 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.860
 learn to rock so what will happen 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.310
 have a big role in speed that is 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.530
 there is a slow tempo there is music 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.110

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.650

 right 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.409
 to warm up your swing you need 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.409
 develop shoulders 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:04.310
 google and cut further so it was 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:08.090
 very smoothly attacks too need to be pumped 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.610
 every step you have a chest rises 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.840
 your every step as soon as you raised 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.250
 leg immediately rises your chest and 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.989
 accordingly blown away when you 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.989

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.730
 part occupy your shoulders now I tell you 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.160

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.319
 if at home you got it all as 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.069
 looks from the back when just a man 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.959
 shakes without shoulders like that 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.500
 if you add shoulders here 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.370
 then it will be very very cool from the back 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.040

 such a quality namely with shoulders like this 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.410

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.310
