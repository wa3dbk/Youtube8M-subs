 sports playground plain his 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.039
 relationship of platinum lighting is 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.630
 also the renovation of various 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.390
 accommodation facilities and the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.940
 creating our recovery area 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.130
 it was going further through the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.770
 needs that have been expressed by the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.690
 various national coaches for 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.050
 to be able to equip itself at the national center of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.460
 football of an interest strengthen and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.360
 meet the challenges of tomorrow 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.890
 so this is the case with the pibarot stadium 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.510
 which is our field of honor that will 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.120
 allow us to welcome 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.530
 trainings of the team of France 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.239
 male and female and also 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.550
 International friendly matches 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.230
 selections of young people since we get 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.460
 today a lawn a field 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.129
 consolidated 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.200
 that is to say a natural ground we come 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.299
 make synthetic injections for 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.510
 strengthen the terrain and allow it 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.670
 allow us to have a use 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.439
 more regular ground by increasing 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.659
 the use attendance of that 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.790
 this is also increasing its 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.409
 drainage capacity so power 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.290
 to have a better ground 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.840
 throughout the year and that allows 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.650
 more regular use of 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.470
 sports facilities players have this 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.520
 need to be able to work in 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.100
 optimal conditions 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.630
 it's true that this lawn is going 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.790
 bring them a lot of comfort 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.880
 a lot of comfort during 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.719
 training 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.149
 it is obviously very very appreciable 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.460
 that players can benefit from 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.350
 those of this new structure and of 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.700
 this new terrain I believe that for 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.520
 with the fountain it's an evolution 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.229
 important technique and that we are in 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.229
 train to install on the ground of 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.819
 the france team at clairefontaine is 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.429
 actually made up of about 20 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.310
 millions of synthetic fibers we 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.769
 is injecting into the substrate 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.769
 sandy this principle is called desso 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.290
 grassmaster it's a system that has been 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.730
 designed and developed end of the 80s including 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.950
 we are about 25 years old 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.430
 experience about 600 fields in 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.080
 function and it's a grass system 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.599
 reinforced naturalness which means that we 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.739
 will strengthen the substrate including the 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.780
 surface and that's extremely 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.480
 important because it makes the ground 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.290
 very durable is very very very effective 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.400
 smooth also very flat at the level of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400
 the use for the players
