 the most famous Italian desserts 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 revisited thanks to without naming a tyrant 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.620
 raspberry and rose lychee mission 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.330

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.680
 tiramisu mousse then there a little more 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.970
 complicated is to clarify the 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.990
 elementary whites in snow because 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.599
 that they will serve us to do the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 tiramisu mixture well well creamy and I 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.000
 the dishes in the ricard paul you have 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 put young people you 're added a whole 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.079
 little bit of rose water to perfume 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.020
 your mascarpone mix 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.610
 he 'll put them half of the sugar 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.989
 they are received crir of preparation beach 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.829
 mixing until melting sugar 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 exactly there 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.870
 go it's good it's all good there I 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.960
 go up the whites in snow and we'll 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.960
 incorporate the sugar gradually into 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.059
 the better it is for not doing 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.589
 fall back into the foam they 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.130
 will find but gradually we will 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.979
 incorporate them gently into the mixture 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.979
 tiramisu no but everything in green on everything 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.020
 so here now we will prepare the 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
 syrup to soak the pink biscuits 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.620
 reims 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.990
 yes then you go m 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:28.000
 so lychee syrup its currency all 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.440
 goes well scented lychee syrup but 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.040
 I love what will give all the perfume 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.500
 particular to our tiramisu the 72nd and 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.780
 so has the leaves 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.950
 originality is to put a little bit 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.740
 so raspberry syrup 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.450
 she has very very good with the n 1 is the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.700
 color of pink reims cookies 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.520
 and there you go to reject your back 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.750
 rose will sell a fragrant touch to 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.980
 recipe 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.230

 dip your pink cookie whose case 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.590
 simple in two years m half at the bottom 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.910
