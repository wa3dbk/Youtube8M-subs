00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
there are other unboxing that I've seen

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.349 
there are other unboxing that I've seen
for<00:01:50.289> these<00:01:50.649> pieces<00:01:51.009> are<00:01:51.250> like<00:01:51.460> not<00:01:51.819> like<00:01:52.030> very

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
for these pieces are like not like very

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.880 
for these pieces are like not like very
proportional<00:01:53.219> it<00:01:54.219> is<00:01:54.369> sort<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.609> weird<00:01:54.759> but<00:01:55.299> I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
proportional it is sort of weird but I

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.709 
proportional it is sort of weird but I
don't<00:01:56.890> know<00:01:56.950> i<00:01:56.979> will<00:01:57.429> have<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.759> see<00:01:57.939> how<00:01:58.539> that

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
don't know i will have to see how that

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.319 
don't know i will have to see how that
affects<00:01:58.990> me<00:01:59.170> while<00:01:59.319> i'm<00:01:59.439> solving<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.969> so<00:02:01.149> far

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
affects me while i'm solving but so far

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.999 
affects me while i'm solving but so far
i<00:02:01.719> do<00:02:01.840> like<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.789> i'm<00:02:03.789> going<00:02:03.969> to<00:02:04.060> need<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:05.009> i'll

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
i do like it i'm going to need to i'll

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.889 
i do like it i'm going to need to i'll
probably<00:02:06.310> take<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:06.700> apart<00:02:06.969> and<00:02:07.060> do<00:02:07.240> stuff<00:02:07.569> to

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
probably take it apart and do stuff to

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.729 
probably take it apart and do stuff to
it<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.789> little<00:02:10.000> bit<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.690> I'm<00:02:11.530> definitely

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
it like a little bit and I'm definitely

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.039 
it like a little bit and I'm definitely
gonna<00:02:12.099> have<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.340> tension<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:13.989> I'm

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
gonna have to tension this and then I'm

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.420 
gonna have to tension this and then I'm
going<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.230> sticker<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.680> take<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> look<00:02:15.220> at<00:02:15.340> the
