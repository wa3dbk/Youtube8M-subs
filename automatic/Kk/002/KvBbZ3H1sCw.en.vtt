00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
because it's in sleep right now so we'll

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.610 
because it's in sleep right now so we'll
turn<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:47.989> won't<00:00:48.989> comment<00:00:49.170> about<00:00:49.469> that

turn that on I won't comment about that
power<00:00:49.800> button<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.059> sort<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
power button it's actually sort of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.910 
power button it's actually sort of
annoying<00:00:51.570> when<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.870> try<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> turn<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.559> your

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
annoying when you try to turn it on your

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180 
annoying when you try to turn it on your
finger<00:00:53.760> inevitably<00:00:54.600> covers<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.649> LED

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
finger inevitably covers up the LED

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
finger inevitably covers up the LED
letting<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
letting you know that it's on so it

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.889 
letting you know that it's on so it
requires<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.340> good<00:00:59.579> couple<00:01:00.059> second<00:01:00.449> press<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
requires a good couple second press to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.020 
requires a good couple second press to
actually<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.770> anything<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.550> sort<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
actually do anything and it's sort of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
actually do anything and it's sort of
confusing<00:01:03.379> when<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> cover<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.220> whole

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
confusing when you cover your whole

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
confusing when you cover your whole
thing<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> can't<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.780> I've

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
thing of it then you can't see but I've

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.320 
thing of it then you can't see but I've
got<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> turn<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.280> comes<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.090> sleep

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
got a turn on now comes out of sleep

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.170 
got a turn on now comes out of sleep
really<00:01:09.689> quickly<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:11.250> looks<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
really quickly and it looks like the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
really quickly and it looks like the
auto-rotate<00:01:12.900> should<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.619> working<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:14.040> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
auto-rotate should be working at this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
auto-rotate should be working at this
point<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:15.140> don't<00:01:16.140> know<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:17.159> exactly<00:01:17.310> changed

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
point I don't know what exactly changed

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
point I don't know what exactly changed
the<00:01:18.240> orientation<00:01:18.619> because<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.770> not

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the orientation because it's not

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.490 
the orientation because it's not
switching<00:01:20.430> back<00:01:20.869> but<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.020> does<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.409> an

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
switching back but this does have an

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.310 
switching back but this does have an
accelerometer<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> supposed<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
accelerometer and is supposed to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.140 
accelerometer and is supposed to
automatically<00:01:25.320> orient<00:01:25.500> itself<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.340> it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
automatically orient itself but it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
automatically orient itself but it
doesn't<00:01:27.390> look<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.720> once<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.380> now

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
doesn't look like it once to right now

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.640 
doesn't look like it once to right now
so<00:01:29.000> if<00:01:30.000> you're<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.270> doing<00:01:30.650> automatic

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so if you're not doing automatic

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.249 
so if you're not doing automatic
rotation<00:01:32.329> we<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.479> switch<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.810> back<00:01:34.049> from<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
rotation we can switch this back from a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.450 
rotation we can switch this back from a
little<00:01:34.439> utility<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.950> hangs<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
little utility that hangs out in the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.929 
little utility that hangs out in the
taskbar<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:37.560> will<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> better<00:01:37.979> shade

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
taskbar and this will be a better shade

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.120 
taskbar and this will be a better shade
for<00:01:39.150> our<00:01:39.270> video<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.140> being<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:43.130> here

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
for our video for the time being so here

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.300 
for our video for the time being so here
we've<00:01:44.280> got<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.729> Windows<00:01:45.090> 7<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
we've got it Windows 7 this is a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.249 
we've got it Windows 7 this is a
capacitive<00:01:47.880> touch<00:01:48.060> screens<00:01:48.390> multi-touch

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
capacitive touch screens multi-touch

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.060 
capacitive touch screens multi-touch
which<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.549> pretty<00:01:51.509> much<00:01:51.720> when<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.799> comes<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
which is pretty much when it comes to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710 
which is pretty much when it comes to
Windows<00:01:53.369> devices<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.090> bullet<00:01:54.329> point<00:01:54.509> they

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
Windows devices just a bullet point they

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.780 
Windows devices just a bullet point they
can<00:01:54.869> put<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> back<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> box<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.670> they

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
can put on the back of the box so they

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
pull up the on-screen keyboard so over

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.440 
pull up the on-screen keyboard so over
here<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.850> can<00:03:39.970> actually<00:03:40.090> launch<00:03:40.390> the

obviously<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:43.000> leads<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.240> inconsistency

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
obviously just leads to inconsistency

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.810 
obviously just leads to inconsistency
about<00:03:44.560> where<00:03:44.950> you're<00:03:45.070> gonna<00:03:45.130> access<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:45.700> from

about where you're gonna access it from

about where you're gonna access it from
so<00:03:46.240> doesn't<00:03:46.630> pop<00:03:46.840> up<00:03:47.020> anywhere<00:03:47.950> in<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740

browser itself it seems it's only in the
URL<00:03:50.920> bar<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.940> you'll<00:03:52.090> be<00:03:52.209> accessing<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.780> from

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
URL bar so you'll be accessing it from

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
this menu which always takes two clicks

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:06.750 
this menu which always takes two clicks
so<00:03:56.260> now<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.709> can<00:03:56.800> search<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.430> something

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.250 

and<00:04:07.760> when<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.000> first<00:04:08.210> enter<00:04:08.450> there<00:04:08.660> it's<00:04:09.020> not

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
and when I first enter there it's not

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.780 
and when I first enter there it's not

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
actually sending the on-screen keyboard

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.650 
actually sending the on-screen keyboard
away<00:04:11.350> automatically<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.340> have<00:04:14.210> to<00:04:14.330> do<00:04:14.480> that

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
away automatically so I have to do that

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.890 
away automatically so I have to do that
myself<00:04:14.840> which<00:04:15.320> is<00:04:15.500> always<00:04:16.250> annoying<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:17.060> in

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
myself which is always annoying and in

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
me do some inertia scrolling which works

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.330 
me do some inertia scrolling which works
pretty<00:04:23.930> well<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.380> think<00:04:24.740> it's<00:04:24.920> called<00:04:25.070> chrome

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
pretty well I think it's called chrome

pretty well I think it's called chrome
touch<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:27.080> I<00:04:27.200> was<00:04:27.320> actually<00:04:27.590> surprised<00:04:28.010> to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
this in the previous versions so if I

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
the multi-touch which is pretty much the

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.459 
the multi-touch which is pretty much the
only<00:06:25.210> other<00:06:25.360> thing<00:06:25.539> I<00:06:25.629> know<00:06:25.750> how<00:06:26.050> to<00:06:26.080> do<00:06:26.319> with

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
multi-touch on Windows other than

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.719 
multi-touch on Windows other than
messing<00:06:29.050> around<00:06:29.110> of<00:06:29.259> paint<00:06:29.500> is<00:06:29.710> do<00:06:30.279> some

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729 
messing around of paint is do some

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.850 
messing around of paint is do some
impromptu<00:06:31.740> multi-touch<00:06:32.740> zooming<00:06:33.449> which

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
impromptu multi-touch zooming which

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.499 
impromptu multi-touch zooming which
works<00:06:35.860> about<00:06:36.370> as<00:06:36.430> well<00:06:36.639> as<00:06:36.819> it<00:06:37.090> looks<00:06:37.270> to<00:06:37.360> work

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
works about as well as it looks to work

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.369 
works about as well as it looks to work
right<00:06:37.690> here<00:06:37.960> so<00:06:38.860> I<00:06:39.310> guess<00:06:39.729> that's<00:06:40.020> handy<00:06:41.020> but

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:41.379 
right here so I guess that's handy but

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.920 
right here so I guess that's handy but
not<00:06:41.650> necessarily<00:06:42.180> well<00:06:43.180> implemented<00:06:43.810> that's

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
not necessarily well implemented that's

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.019 
not necessarily well implemented that's
what<00:06:44.110> happens<00:06:44.379> when<00:06:44.500> you<00:06:44.560> try<00:06:44.710> to<00:06:44.770> shoehorn<00:06:45.610> a
