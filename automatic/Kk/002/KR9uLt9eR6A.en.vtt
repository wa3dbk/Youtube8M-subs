00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.329
 yes the list of ingredients is relative 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.360
 manageable it starts with something 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.649
 butter 200 grams and the same amount 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.969
 Let's take even more in front of about one 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.629

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.520
 not missing 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.020
 otherwise bad cake in the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.570
 cafe mug 125 grams of flour all-purpose 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.000
 white flour some baking powder one 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.060
 teaspoon of it a pack of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.950
 vanilla sugar and 2 the water can do it 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 then goes me the good mothers in 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.310
 a bowl and stir michael too short 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.259
 here a little bit through then we leave the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.390
 sugar to this is all so long 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.939
 inside is and the super nice with 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.970
 The brother has mixed yes then come 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.110
 We already admit the eggs 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.899
 I give a little bit after each other 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.810
 for and in between very well 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.159
 that works really well so synonymous 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.710
 purely with it 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.810
 and nice cuddle yes then it gets over 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.620
 the dough here and now in berlin even 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.110
 I still take my food 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.910
 real vanilla tastes very much like to 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.380
 in the future like savanna even 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.980
 on top of that slightly funny 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.920
 aftertaste 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.000
 that's really good yes and now ours 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.760
 yes as a file is day thinks what else 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.940
 of course, the flour is missing and that 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.490
 baking powder and that's what I love now 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.200
 martin 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.550
 that ensures that 77 after no 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.280
 have lumps and of course one 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.350
 get students in supple dough 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.750
 and with the quantity you have to say that 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.040
 seven yes also fix well then 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.800
 Let's just hit it again 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.570
 Then it looks and when we have the flour 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.920
 and have met powdered percent 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.920
 then I just give it all this way 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.020
 how much you like to splash 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.420
 yes or take the pouch is that 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.070
 no topic and then I fell here 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.010
 our waffles are looking a bit 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.950
 and while working around two-thirds 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.950
 you can fill that one well 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.630
 not exactly in chats work 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.550
 important is he thinks then detail he goes 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.020
 still in the oven so no case should 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.290
 It does not make it run us in the end 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.060
 really so two title has me up 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.060
 to be worth it then it already works 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.220
 in the oven 160 degrees for 15 minutes 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.200
 and that's what it looks like when they do 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.750
 come out and a little bit of chocolate and 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.940
 Garlands are really delicious 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.440
 Incidentally, the story is not just about history 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.200
 good at the little kids but 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.480
 tastes great here too 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.410
 great is for children worth the hands 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.870
 not so clicked 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.370
 so I'm having fun and it 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.230
 will also switch again next time 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.370
 purely 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.370
 see you soon
