00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello everyone and welcome to rooms 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.120
 currency 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 like today I'm doing a tutorial 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.349
 on recognizing the fake pieces of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.320
 real here we go 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:28.439
 so I film you with the camera sj 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.570
 4000 wifi so I hope the the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.300
 video quality will be good we will see 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.989
 when I will put online 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.470
 so here is a fake 1 euro coin 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 here is a real piece of 1 euro 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:52.199
 and that's the first thing 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.250
 to know is that the weight of the true 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.280
 1 euro coin 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:03.119
 the official pot is 7.5 g I weighed 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.020
 the pit she weighs 6.9 g 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:08.850
 we are close to 7 euros of 17 g 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 so the details on the piece on the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.760
 fake 1 euro coin are a lot 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.590
 ruder than the true color 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.079
 is duller compared to the real the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.979
 patina is not present 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:28.820
 unlike the real good there is a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.399
 good patina ok the estrie of the slice 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.539
 are of poor quality 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.219
 well there I do not know if you will see but 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.420
 it is not serious 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.920
 the mind is on the edge of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.600
 small small scratches that ensures 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.759
 the slice on the real are really 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.780
 done well on the wrong 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.369
 they are a little bit pudgy actually 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:55.020
 here is europe on the true touch the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.939
 system that here and will be the pit 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.499
 europe we see that europe does not touch 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.409
 not the system but in fact passed 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:05.159
 flows through the white of the plane of 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.079
 the piece the metal is in the good 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.670
 quality so that to see that the metal 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.179
 is not so good you have to hit 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.039
 rooms 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.930
 good there I do not know if you can 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.460
 hear the sound but the sound but we will 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.560
 try hockey 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.760
 at 60 years old anyway 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:28.460
 I 'm waiting for you, I 'm doing this to you 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.470
 that's true that's more metal sound that 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.770
 + 1 are good metal and that's a 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.890
 bad its price here is the diameter can 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.340
 to be lower or higher than the currency 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.280
 official 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.890
 so why because in fact the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.140
 fake coins are usually soft 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:51.470
 would lift the coins are struck 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.400
 so sometimes when we mold a 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.210
 counterfeit money 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.460
 the mold and be a little care of 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.420
 a few millimeters lower or 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.880
 superior to the official currency and 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.890
 then we can also see that 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.080
 while the pit was cast gaza 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.390
 she was cast compared to a real 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.460
 coin and sometimes when counterfeiters 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.400
 mold the fake coin 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.070
 he molds it with the defects of the foot 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.150
 of the first official piece 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.430
 so we can see that there are 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.710
 flaws of the first one euro which 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.500
 was molded so she was molded with 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.640
 the defects of fonniÃ¨re so here is 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.940
 like that you can recognize a 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.660
 true of a real piece of a fake 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.000
 now at sight 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.300
 it's still 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.370
 really visible so well look good 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.780
 and then you will see there is there is a 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.100
 differentiation really between the two 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.630
 gear the pit is worse 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.690
 quality this subject much faster 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.420
 and here we go, I hope this video is going 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.070
 help you and I 'll see you soon and 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.040
 do not forget to subscribe on the 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.580
 chain so goodbye at pieces of 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.580
 currency - as
