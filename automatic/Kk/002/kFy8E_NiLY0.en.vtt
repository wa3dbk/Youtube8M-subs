00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.530
 Grevenbroich is the home of the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.950
 twelve hectares largest and most modern 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.820
 driving safety center north rhine 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.820
 Westphalia 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.650
 from beginner to long-distance driver 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.860
 Head coach Thomas Eilers and his team 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.420
 take care of all over 22,000 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.949
 Participants learn here annually 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.519
 road traffic 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.519
 dominate 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:49.320
 catching one on the roster today 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.690
 whizzing vehicle thanks irrigated 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.090
 track and large run-off surfaces 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.090
 no danger for vehicle and driver 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.150
 yes the most important thing when intercepting a 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.989
 flinging cars is actually on 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.430
 Steering wheel to become fully active 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.400
 to stay until the vehicle 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 stable is that means davos tail hinrich 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.920
 you have to steer there too and that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.460
 if possible in a monkey-containing 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.850
 speed with it as early as possible 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.830
 the vehicle stably regain the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.590
 heck not too far from break 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.229
 at profi thomas eilers sees that very much 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.420
 But it's easy 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.500
 countless times from the sling plate 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.500
 been fired 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.670
 if we pay attention to that now 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.619
 moment when we intercepted the car 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.270
 then it is not necessarily happening so it 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.560
 comes in the other direction and then 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.619
 comes again in the other direction 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.470
 and no matter how I may never give up there 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.450
 to look where I want to go there really 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.789
 back to direct where I really 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.500
 I must put down with the steering 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:02.409
 very actively work the exercise 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.510
 Gets plenty of critical views of 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.640
 on the outside it looks anything but easy 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.660
 out 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.520
 today nina 18 from tÃ¶nisvorst 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.500
 She has her license with 17 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.440
 made and shares with her mother 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.569
 an author is looking forward to the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.640
 pending challenge keeps in 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.660
 bordering because I do not know how it feels 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.660
 car behaves the same way and 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.100
 It is a very difficult task 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.130
 which we put here the beginner 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.470
 is going to be harder but ultimately 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.030
 quite a lot of lightning fast steering 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.880
 reactions that is the most important 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.920
 and always know where is the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.020
 rear section of the vehicle that is that 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.790
 the hardest thing when driving a car like that 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.790
 could ultimately find 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.150
 So when the auto level broke out 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.900
 I've thought my god what 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.880
 happens now 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.440
 and I just tried that 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.450
 to do what we have just been told 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.640
 So just clutch and on the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.540
 brake and then give to counter and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.220
 yes that was really adrenaline so has 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.060
 you did not know what was happening right now 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.060
 happened and 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:44.780
 Just think about it 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.780
 the steering to work 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.850
 after two wrong directions at the beginning has 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.390
 still well fingered okay 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.520
 tasks 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.870
 another shot more water and further 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.870
 is the wet ride 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.870
 super there are but next time 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.630
 even more resolute on the steering wheel work 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.510
 do not hesitate 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.830
 China is making progress though , too 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.420
 they still one or the other 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.420
 involuntary pirouette 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.070
 but the car has more and more 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.070
 under control 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.340
 yes the last passage was already 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.050
 Great, yes that was really fast steering 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.479
 that important that the vehicle very much 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.639
 fast with the front wheels the 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.930
 gets proper stabilization and then 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.550
 we have the chance that was good 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.659
 looked far what steered quickly 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.430
 right direction 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.469
 then have a chance 1 a that is 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.060
 Really that's the situation 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:14.430
 which one also in real traffic 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.469
 actually not experienced and that is why 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.750
 that's quite exciting times 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:23.310
 really to make that turn and the 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.259
 control so a bit lose 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.129
 You have to lose it so often 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:31.409
 somehow it just goes with this 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.539
 helplessness just because the car is on 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.849
 Slips a bit or a bit across 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.469
 comes with this helplessness stops 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.719
 that you really still have the overview 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.460
 keeps and still knows where am I 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.659
 actually 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.930
 That's why I think you have to 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.849
 practice over and over and over again 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.250
 for nina the practice was already worth it 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.819
 and even a little fun 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.819
 made 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.419
 to have
