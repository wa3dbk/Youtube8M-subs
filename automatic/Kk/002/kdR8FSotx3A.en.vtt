arms and a little bit on the legs but
then<00:02:59.580> he's<00:02:59.760> just<00:03:00.000> hard<00:03:00.240> plastic<00:03:00.930> all<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> way

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
then he's just hard plastic all the way

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.449 
then he's just hard plastic all the way
rest<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> body

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
rest of the body

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.900 
rest of the body
all<00:03:05.459> right<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:05.970> onto<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.130> main<00:03:08.130> feature<00:03:08.670> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
all right so onto the main feature of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.729 
all right so onto the main feature of
the<00:03:09.330> set<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.500> urban<00:03:11.400> Avenger<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:13.410> has<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
the set the urban Avenger it has the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.420 
the set the urban Avenger it has the
really<00:03:14.400> big<00:03:14.700> wheels<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.750> big<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.590> then

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
really big wheels this big and then

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.770 
really big wheels this big and then
smaller<00:03:18.680> there's<00:03:19.680> little<00:03:19.980> barricade<00:03:20.780> there

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
smaller there's little barricade there

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.620 
smaller there's little barricade there
so<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.860> dinosaur<00:03:23.580> can't<00:03:24.030> get<00:03:24.300> too<00:03:24.600> close

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
so that the dinosaur can't get too close

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:33.620 
so that the dinosaur can't get too close
or<00:03:30.830> there's<00:03:31.830> an<00:03:32.070> antenna<00:03:32.550> on<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.060> very<00:03:33.300> back

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
or there's an antenna on the very back

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.530 
or there's an antenna on the very back
of<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:34.050> I<00:03:34.820> don't<00:03:35.820> know<00:03:35.910> why<00:03:36.120> they<00:03:36.330> put<00:03:36.480> that

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
of it I don't know why they put that

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.920 
of it I don't know why they put that
there<00:03:37.020> but<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:40.850> dropped<00:03:41.850> it

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
there but I dropped it

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.880 
there but I dropped it
and<00:03:43.170> then<00:03:44.129> there's<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.670> big<00:03:45.239> bone<00:03:45.870> rod<00:03:46.379> for<00:03:46.829> the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
and then there's a big bone rod for the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.960 
and then there's a big bone rod for the
steering<00:03:47.220> wheel<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:48.180> cover<00:03:48.420> up<00:03:48.599> that<00:03:48.840> piece

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.500 

there's<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.090> really<00:03:54.510> big<00:03:55.189> endian<00:03:56.360> there<00:03:57.360> are

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
there's a really big endian there are

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.970 
there's a really big endian there are
six<00:03:57.810> exhaust<00:03:58.319> pipes<00:04:02.659> there's<00:04:03.659> a<00:04:03.780> big<00:04:04.079> turret

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
six exhaust pipes there's a big turret

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.080 
six exhaust pipes there's a big turret
on<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.280> top<00:04:06.170> it's<00:04:07.170> just<00:04:07.379> a<00:04:07.739> normal<00:04:08.220> I<00:04:08.459> do

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
on the top it's just a normal I do

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.819 
on the top it's just a normal I do
Star<00:04:09.840> Wars<00:04:09.870> gun<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:11.670> piece<00:04:11.939> on<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.680> then

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
Star Wars gun that piece on it and then

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.440 
Star Wars gun that piece on it and then
if<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.099> look<00:04:14.280> inside<00:04:14.489> there's<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.150> red

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
if you look inside there's a red

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.770 
if you look inside there's a red
lightsaber<00:04:15.810> piece<00:04:16.530> from<00:04:16.889> Star<00:04:17.310> Wars<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:20.780> yeah

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
lightsaber piece from Star Wars and yeah

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.920 
lightsaber piece from Star Wars and yeah
so<00:04:22.380> then<00:04:22.740> there's<00:04:23.010> those<00:04:23.250> pieces<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:24.690> make<00:04:24.810> it

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
so then there's those pieces to make it

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.590 
so then there's those pieces to make it
look<00:04:25.080> like<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.289> turret<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.910> then<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.330> is

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
look like a turret and then this is

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.890 
look like a turret and then this is
rubber<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.770> plastic<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:29.940> there's<00:04:30.720> that

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
rubber not plastic and there's that

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.300 
rubber not plastic and there's that
little<00:04:31.199> clip<00:04:31.410> piece<00:04:31.789> see<00:04:32.789> you<00:04:32.970> can<00:04:33.180> move<00:04:33.930> it

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
little clip piece see you can move it

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.980 
little clip piece see you can move it
wherever<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.729> want<00:04:35.760> like<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.720> can<00:04:36.870> be
