on the lighting as well as the railing

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.990 
on the lighting as well as the railing
is<00:04:40.020> really<00:04:40.470> ease<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.800> installation<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:41.729> so

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
is really ease of installation and so

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.529 
is really ease of installation and so
we've<00:04:42.720> done<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.080> very<00:04:43.139> well<00:04:43.410> with<00:04:43.919> with<00:04:44.910> with

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
we've done that very well with with with

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.680 
we've done that very well with with with
16<00:04:46.349> screws<00:04:47.340> per<00:04:47.580> per<00:04:47.880> section<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.360> railing

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
16 screws per per section of railing

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.909 
16 screws per per section of railing
which<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:48.960> fraction<00:04:49.289> of<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:49.680> the

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
which is a fraction of what the

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.710 
which is a fraction of what the
competition<00:04:50.490> will<00:04:50.639> require<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.270> so

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
competition will require so so

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.350 
competition will require so so
installation<00:04:52.320> is<00:04:52.410> very<00:04:52.440> easy<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:52.949> simple<00:04:53.360> our

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
installation is very easy and simple our

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.760 
installation is very easy and simple our
railing<00:04:54.690> support<00:04:55.139> brackets<00:04:55.500> are<00:04:55.650> all

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
railing support brackets are all

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.409 
railing support brackets are all
internal<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.490> they're<00:04:56.639> all<00:04:56.759> kidney<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.300> the

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
internal so they're all kidney to the

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.360 
internal so they're all kidney to the
eye<00:04:57.449> and<00:04:58.020> when<00:04:58.470> we<00:04:58.590> look<00:04:58.740> at<00:04:58.830> our<00:04:58.949> lighting

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
eye and when we look at our lighting

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.450 
eye and when we look at our lighting
we've<00:05:00.150> done<00:05:00.360> so<00:05:00.570> in<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.409> fashion<00:05:01.680> with<00:05:02.009> LEDs

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
we've done so in the fashion with LEDs

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.520 
we've done so in the fashion with LEDs
to<00:05:02.970> allow<00:05:03.180> students<00:05:03.690> all<00:05:03.810> of<00:05:04.020> our<00:05:04.199> lighting

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
to allow students all of our lighting

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.260 
to allow students all of our lighting

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
with a single one inch Forstner bit so

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.999 
with a single one inch Forstner bit so
it<00:05:06.389> comes<00:05:06.630> very<00:05:06.960> simple<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.500> very<00:05:07.590> easy<00:05:07.770> for

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
it comes very simple and very easy for

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.850 
it comes very simple and very easy for
for<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.580> contractor<00:05:09.210> or<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.419> DIY<00:05:09.720> oh<00:05:09.930> great<00:05:10.650> well
