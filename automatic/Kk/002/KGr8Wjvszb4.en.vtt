00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.580
 last phone call before a meeting in five flower business districts 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.680
 this Norwegian hedda participate in the board of a 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.679
 dietary products company 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.869
 in norway the law requires listed companies to report at least 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.869
 40% of women on their board 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 it's a little it stops 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.660
 there are 50% of women in society so it must participate in all 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.119
 company levels 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.430
 she may be losing not only an intermediate level as it was 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.430
 the case so far but also at the very top of the scale 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.130
 it's super dj who recruited him to sit on his board 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.650
 administration 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.450
 before 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.780
 there were only men around this table 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.890
 a small men's closed club decided to open up to active women 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.929
 the CEO has complied with the Loire without regret 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.730
 the bpa is nil would have had to wait for his time for women to be part 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.370
 from the administration board 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.170
 if there was not this relationship or because men were used 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.450
 recently between colleagues and old acquaintances finally it's very 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.070
 well 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.780
 in my company for example that sells simple dietary products we 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.230
 have to decide the strategy according to the consumers 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.490
 and women know how to listen to us and that we consume men are more 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.760
 aggressive and enterprising it takes both 7 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.400
 a real revolution yet in 2003 the conservatives in power in norway 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.320
 did not want to hear about the cotas 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.210
 she inherits table mess 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.240
 for this former right minister 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.600
 because women are as educated as men 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.960
 he took everyone by surprise by announcing his law without warning 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.160
 nobody 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.210
 nature 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.990
 first I created a shock it was pure calculation if I had asked 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.190
 before that my government to be there that would have never been possible 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.190
 that was the only way and if released 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.920
 and the unique law in the world 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.299
 was voted here in parliament in this lot 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.270
 a harsh law it threatens the recalcitrant companies of 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.890
 disappearance 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.990
 the car I saw no other way than these radical measures 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.990
 faucet companies 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:14.159
 the continent against the law this art critic the tycoon of the press 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.259
 Norwegian 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.599
 in the columns of his daily business he has not stopped 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.579
 denounce the favorites 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.969
 the bushman and I said no to his glory because it is bad higher 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.919
 people who own a business must be able to freely give 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
 because they want it's their money go they do not have to name a woman by 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.129
 obligation but eventually people let themselves be convinced name of the 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.899
 parity no problem for him 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:41.419
 currently only twelve companies in norway have not yet 40% women 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.109
 in their board of directors 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.639
 but they are being treated to respect the quota the fear of being 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.549
 dismantled waiting been effective businesses abide by the law
