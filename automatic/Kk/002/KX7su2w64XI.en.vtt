00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
the prototype games originally came with

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.530 
the prototype games originally came with
a<00:04:11.560> light-up<00:04:11.859> ball<00:04:12.459> caster<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.180> if<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.359> take<00:04:13.480> a

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
a light-up ball caster and if you take a

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.210 
a light-up ball caster and if you take a
look<00:04:13.720> mine<00:04:13.989> actually<00:04:14.379> is<00:04:14.500> lit<00:04:14.799> up<00:04:14.949> there<00:04:15.129> was

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
look mine actually is lit up there was

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.800 
look mine actually is lit up there was
nothing<00:04:15.519> done<00:04:15.669> to<00:04:15.790> this<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.299> an<00:04:16.389> original

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
nothing done to this this is an original

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.839 
nothing done to this this is an original
caster<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:17.380> came<00:04:17.530> with<00:04:17.739> this<00:04:17.919> cabinet<00:04:18.459> it

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
caster that came with this cabinet it

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.120 
caster that came with this cabinet it
does<00:04:19.180> light<00:04:19.419> up<00:04:19.449> in<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.930> center<00:04:20.289> in<00:04:20.470> fact<00:04:20.979> it's

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
does light up in the center in fact it's

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.980 
does light up in the center in fact it's
pretty<00:04:21.250> worn<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:22.000> it's<00:04:22.150> been<00:04:22.360> used<00:04:22.570> for<00:04:22.750> quite

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
pretty worn so it's been used for quite

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.390 
pretty worn so it's been used for quite
a<00:04:23.020> while<00:04:23.229> but<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:23.500> haven't<00:04:23.590> replaced<00:04:24.099> it

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
a while but I haven't replaced it

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.950 
a while but I haven't replaced it
because<00:04:24.760> I'm<00:04:25.210> thinking<00:04:25.389> it<00:04:25.630> might<00:04:25.690> be<00:04:25.810> a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
because I'm thinking it might be a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.710 
because I'm thinking it might be a
prototype<00:04:26.229> caster<00:04:26.919> now<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.669> other<00:04:28.060> thing<00:04:28.570> I

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
prototype caster now the other thing I

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.689 
prototype caster now the other thing I
think<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:29.110> also<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.560> prototype<00:04:30.070> is<00:04:30.280> if<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.520> take

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
think is also a prototype is if you take

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.820 
think is also a prototype is if you take
a<00:04:30.729> look<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.120> has<00:04:31.300> regular<00:04:31.810> flippers<00:04:32.260> now<00:04:32.470> most

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
a look and has regular flippers now most

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.490 
a look and has regular flippers now most
of<00:04:32.919> you<00:04:33.010> would<00:04:33.130> say<00:04:33.159> well<00:04:33.639> duh<00:04:34.060> but<00:04:34.930> fish<00:04:35.260> tails

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
of you would say well duh but fish tails

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.560 
of you would say well duh but fish tails
actually<00:04:35.860> had<00:04:36.010> lightning<00:04:36.490> bolt<00:04:36.729> flippers<00:04:37.150> the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
actually had lightning bolt flippers the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.060 
actually had lightning bolt flippers the
lightning<00:04:37.900> bolt<00:04:38.110> flippers<00:04:38.470> were<00:04:38.590> just<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.830> tiny

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
lightning bolt flippers were just a tiny

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.800 
lightning bolt flippers were just a tiny
tiny<00:04:39.460> tiny<00:04:39.669> bit<00:04:40.150> smaller<00:04:40.479> than<00:04:40.720> the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
tiny tiny bit smaller than the

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.409 
tiny tiny bit smaller than the
regular-sized<00:04:41.349> flippers<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.970> original

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
regular-sized flippers and the original

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.820 
regular-sized flippers and the original
prototype<00:04:43.720> games<00:04:44.110> were<00:04:44.289> said<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.590> have<00:04:44.620> come

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
prototype games were said to have come

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.129 
prototype games were said to have come
with<00:04:45.039> regular<00:04:45.520> flippers<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:45.970> again<00:04:46.389> I'm<00:04:46.930> not

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
with regular flippers so again I'm not

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.930 
with regular flippers so again I'm not
sure<00:04:47.320> if<00:04:47.409> I<00:04:47.500> have<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.650> prototype<00:04:48.010> captain<00:04:48.669> here

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
sure if I have a prototype captain here

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.150 
sure if I have a prototype captain here
but

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
but

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.190 
but
I left<00:04:49.370> everything<00:04:49.670> alone<00:04:50.300> just<00:04:50.630> in<00:04:50.780> case

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.660 

this<00:04:54.200> is<00:04:54.380> actually<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.770> second<00:04:55.220> fishtails

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
this is actually the second fishtails

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.660 
this is actually the second fishtails
that<00:04:55.820> I've<00:04:55.910> ever<00:04:56.030> owned<00:04:57.100> it<00:04:58.100> needed<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.490> lot<00:04:58.610> of

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
that I've ever owned it needed a lot of

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.280 
that I've ever owned it needed a lot of
work<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.120> had<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.270> lot<00:04:59.420> of<00:04:59.450> play<00:04:59.690> field<00:04:59.960> aware<00:05:00.170> but

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
work I had a lot of play field aware but

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.780 
work I had a lot of play field aware but
I<00:05:00.350> really<00:05:00.710> wanted<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.100> Fish<00:05:01.250> Tales<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.700> was

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
I really wanted a Fish Tales and it was

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.990 
I really wanted a Fish Tales and it was
a<00:05:01.820> great<00:05:02.030> price<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.600> true<00:05:03.530> to<00:05:03.620> form

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
a great price and true to form

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.160 
a great price and true to form
eventually<00:05:05.000> after<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.360> while<00:05:05.540> of<00:05:05.720> owning<00:05:06.020> that

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
eventually after a while of owning that

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.620 
eventually after a while of owning that
one<00:05:06.350> I<00:05:06.530> wanted<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:06.980> get<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.310> nicer<00:05:07.760> one<00:05:07.910> someday

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
one I wanted to get a nicer one someday

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.050 
one I wanted to get a nicer one someday
the<00:05:09.440> problem<00:05:09.800> is<00:05:09.950> fish<00:05:10.190> tails<00:05:10.490> are<00:05:10.670> kind<00:05:11.030> of

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
the problem is fish tails are kind of

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.060 
the problem is fish tails are kind of
tough<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.450> find<00:05:11.720> in<00:05:12.020> really<00:05:12.440> nice<00:05:12.620> shape<00:05:12.650> and

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
tough to find in really nice shape and

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.620 
tough to find in really nice shape and
there's<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.250> couple<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.550> problems<00:05:13.790> number<00:05:14.330> one

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
there's a couple of problems number one

there's a couple of problems number one
the<00:05:15.230> cabinets<00:05:15.740> are<00:05:15.860> always<00:05:16.370> almost<00:05:16.910> always

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
the cabinets are always almost always

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.810 
the cabinets are always almost always
really<00:05:17.930> terribly<00:05:18.470> faded<00:05:18.860> because<00:05:19.550> there's<00:05:19.760> a

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
really terribly faded because there's a

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.000 
really terribly faded because there's a
real<00:05:20.030> bright<00:05:20.360> orange<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.020> red<00:05:21.230> going<00:05:21.500> on<00:05:21.710> here

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
real bright orange and red going on here

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.030 
real bright orange and red going on here
those<00:05:22.430> tend<00:05:22.700> to<00:05:22.760> always<00:05:23.060> be<00:05:23.450> faded<00:05:23.900> now<00:05:24.890> I'm

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
those tend to always be faded now I'm

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.350 
those tend to always be faded now I'm
not<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> person<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.610> believes<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:26.000> cabinet

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
not a person that believes the cabinet

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.880 
not a person that believes the cabinet
has<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.630> be<00:05:26.720> perfect<00:05:27.140> but<00:05:27.260> you<00:05:27.380> know<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:27.500> don't

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
has to be perfect but you know I don't

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.590 
has to be perfect but you know I don't
want<00:05:28.130> one<00:05:28.250> washed<00:05:28.520> out<00:05:28.760> to<00:05:28.790> white<00:05:29.210> for

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
want one washed out to white for

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.410 
want one washed out to white for
goodness<00:05:29.900> sakes<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:31.820> other<00:05:31.970> thing<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.270> had<00:05:32.390> a

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
goodness sakes the other thing I had a

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.530 
goodness sakes the other thing I had a
hard<00:05:32.630> time<00:05:32.690> finding<00:05:33.050> were<00:05:33.970> play<00:05:34.970> fields<00:05:35.390> where

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
hard time finding were play fields where

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.820 
hard time finding were play fields where
there<00:05:35.600> wasn't<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.900> lot<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:36.050> we're<00:05:36.290> down<00:05:36.500> here<00:05:36.530> by

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
there wasn't a lot of we're down here by

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.980 
there wasn't a lot of we're down here by
the<00:05:36.890> fish<00:05:37.280> in<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.580> tackle<00:05:37.910> box<00:05:38.030> that<00:05:38.690> seems<00:05:38.900> to

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
the fish in the tackle box that seems to

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.330 
the fish in the tackle box that seems to
be<00:05:39.080> really<00:05:39.290> torn<00:05:39.560> up<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.800> lot<00:05:39.920> and<00:05:40.040> I<00:05:40.070> think<00:05:40.130> it's

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
be really torn up a lot and I think it's

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.180 
be really torn up a lot and I think it's
because<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.700> ball<00:05:40.880> spins<00:05:41.660> around<00:05:41.870> this<00:05:42.800> loop

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
because the ball spins around this loop

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.830 
because the ball spins around this loop
and<00:05:43.370> then<00:05:43.490> ends<00:05:43.700> up<00:05:43.790> in<00:05:43.940> bang<00:05:44.240> and<00:05:44.420> right<00:05:44.630> there

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
and then ends up in bang and right there

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.330 
and then ends up in bang and right there
on<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.050> play<00:05:45.230> field<00:05:45.470> that<00:05:45.650> where's<00:05:45.830> that<00:05:46.040> area

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
on the play field that where's that area

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.700 
on the play field that where's that area
a<00:05:46.370> lot<00:05:46.780> what<00:05:47.780> I<00:05:47.810> ended<00:05:48.140> up<00:05:48.230> doing<00:05:48.560> was

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
a lot what I ended up doing was

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.130 
a lot what I ended up doing was
combining<00:05:49.220> two<00:05:49.790> fish<00:05:50.270> tails<00:05:50.540> together<00:05:50.930> to

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
combining two fish tails together to

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.200 
combining two fish tails together to
make<00:05:51.320> my<00:05:51.560> perfect<00:05:51.890> fish<00:05:52.220> tails<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.640> also<00:05:52.910> bought

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
make my perfect fish tails I also bought

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.110

stuff up and combined the fish tails

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.070 
stuff up and combined the fish tails
together<00:05:58.550> and<00:05:59.000> now<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.390> have<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.750> fish<00:05:59.900> tails

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
the game and it plays perfect the first

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.960 
the game and it plays perfect the first
