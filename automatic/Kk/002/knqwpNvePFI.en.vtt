00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
we've seen in Japan we went to the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.140 
we've seen in Japan we went to the
theater<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.020> izumo<00:02:16.530> which<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.980> newer<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
theater in izumo which is newer and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.140 
theater in izumo which is newer and
bigger<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.490> was<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> first<00:02:20.970> time

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
bigger and so this was the first time

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.640 
bigger and so this was the first time
going<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> matsu<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> theater<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:24.650> yeah

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
going to the matsu a theater and yeah

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.220 
going to the matsu a theater and yeah
it's<00:02:25.950> really<00:02:26.550> small<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.239> mean<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.690> screens<00:02:28.050> are

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
it's really small I mean the screens are

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.290 
it's really small I mean the screens are
very<00:02:28.410> small<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:29.489> little<00:02:30.209> blurry<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
very small and a little blurry so I

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.790 
very small and a little blurry so I
probably<00:02:33.300> would<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.690> rather<00:02:33.900> seen<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
probably would have rather seen it and a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.460 
probably would have rather seen it and a
better<00:02:34.980> theater<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:35.810> costs<00:02:36.810> money<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.140> travel

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
better theater but costs money to travel

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.050 
better theater but costs money to travel
there<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.360> quite<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> few<00:02:39.660> people<00:02:39.989> showed<00:02:40.260> up

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
there so quite a few people showed up

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.430 
there so quite a few people showed up
when<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.180> first<00:02:42.420> got<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> mall<00:02:43.050> there<00:02:43.320> were

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
when we first got to the mall there were

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.160 
when we first got to the mall there were
a<00:02:43.470> ton<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:43.890> bicycles<00:02:44.640> parked<00:02:45.000> outside<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
a ton of bicycles parked outside so I

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.740 
a ton of bicycles parked outside so I
was<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> little<00:02:47.100> afraid<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.700> maybe<00:02:48.180> everyone

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
was a little afraid that maybe everyone

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.750 
was a little afraid that maybe everyone
was<00:02:48.900> going<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.440> try<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.680> see<00:02:49.980> harry<00:02:50.160> potter<00:02:50.489> but

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
was going to try to see harry potter but

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.940 
was going to try to see harry potter but
then<00:02:50.880> when<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.120> got<00:02:51.480> into<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.930> mall<00:02:52.200> we

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
then when we got into the mall we

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
then when we got into the mall we
noticed<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.550> there<00:02:53.970> was<00:02:54.120> kind<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.660> little

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
noticed that there was kind of a little

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.010 
noticed that there was kind of a little
stage<00:02:55.260> setup<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:57.440> large<00:02:58.440> group<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.100> people

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020

area where it's usually just a little
waiting<00:03:02.790> area<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.630> apparently<00:03:04.110> there<00:03:04.320> is

it seemed a little flat and just not as

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.270 
it seemed a little flat and just not as
good<00:03:55.380> as<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:57.360> lot<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.200> other<00:03:58.440> movies<00:03:58.830> in<00:03:59.160> my

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.050 
opinion i am a really big fan of both
the<00:04:03.840> books<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.319> movies<00:04:04.470> i<00:04:04.680> don't<00:04:05.100> compare<00:04:05.640> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
the books and movies i don't compare the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.420 
the books and movies i don't compare the
books<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.600> movies<00:04:06.900> because<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.620> people<00:04:08.160> do

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
books to the movies because if people do

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.380 
books to the movies because if people do
that<00:04:08.610> they're<00:04:08.819> always<00:04:08.940> going<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.360> be

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
that they're always going to be

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.440 
that they're always going to be
disappointed<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:10.859> judge<00:04:11.400> them<00:04:11.670> as<00:04:12.030> separate

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
disappointed so I judge them as separate

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.509 
disappointed so I judge them as separate
entities<00:04:12.570> I<00:04:13.049> judge<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.470> books<00:04:13.680> as<00:04:13.950> books<00:04:14.250> and

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
entities I judge the books as books and

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.529 
entities I judge the books as books and
I<00:04:14.579> judge<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.940> movies<00:04:15.269> as<00:04:15.600> movies<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:17.539> here

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
I judge of movies as movies and here

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.599 
I judge of movies as movies and here
this<00:04:18.690> one<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.229> expected<00:04:19.829> it<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:19.979> be<00:04:20.100> much<00:04:20.370> better

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
this one I expected it to be much better

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.380 
this one I expected it to be much better
than<00:04:21.329> it<00:04:21.539> was<00:04:22.400> which<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.580> sad<00:04:23.789> because<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.180> think

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.430 
than it was which is sad because I think
it<00:04:24.660> had<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> lot<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:25.050> potential<00:04:25.710> but<00:04:27.440> hopefully

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
it had a lot of potential but hopefully

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.240 
it had a lot of potential but hopefully
the<00:04:28.620> next<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:29.250> they're<00:04:29.640> splitting<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.150> last

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
the next to they're splitting the last

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.250 
the next to they're splitting the last
book<00:04:32.250> into<00:04:32.550> two<00:04:32.580> separate<00:04:33.570> parts<00:04:33.780> for<00:04:34.140> the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
book into two separate parts for the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.540 
book into two separate parts for the
movie<00:04:34.590> I

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
movie I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.230 
movie I
believe<00:04:36.830> hopefully<00:04:37.830> they'll<00:04:38.010> be<00:04:38.160> better<00:04:38.400> they

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
believe hopefully they'll be better they

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.510 
believe hopefully they'll be better they
have<00:04:40.020> fun<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:41.390> guess<00:04:42.390> that's<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:42.870> for<00:04:42.930> now

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
have fun and I guess that's it for now
