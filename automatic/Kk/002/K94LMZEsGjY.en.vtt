- we incorporated a lot of windows into

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
- we incorporated a lot of windows into
this<00:00:48.750> design<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.410> designed<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
this design that we designed it so it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.670 
this design that we designed it so it
would<00:00:51.239> let<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> lot<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.750> natural<00:00:52.230> light<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.410> when

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
would let a lot of natural light in when

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040 
would let a lot of natural light in when
the<00:00:52.739> client<00:00:53.129> wouldn't<00:00:53.430> need<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.270> actual

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the client wouldn't need to have actual

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.600 
the client wouldn't need to have actual
lights<00:00:55.289> running<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.070> much<00:00:56.250> should

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
lights running in here so much should

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.299 
lights running in here so much should
only<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.940> lights<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> rainy<00:00:57.660> day

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
only be the lights on a rainy day

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
only be the lights on a rainy day
both<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.550> these<00:00:59.780> these<00:01:00.780> are<00:01:00.989> casement<00:01:01.500> style

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
