 a lot of sport so there we have 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:30.110
 example we still have cordoba real madrid

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.750
 little box that got covered that you 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.640
 clicked on it 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.890
 here we are going to go we will arrive so 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.630
 on a page like these and you go 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.570
 click on top sad font I have to 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.790
 wrong top quality stream and you click 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:02.520
 above 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.910
 there you can increase the size of 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.259
 the screen so good was it I grant you 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.010
 that she is not necessarily super good 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.970
 should we a little bit it will improve 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.730
 for something free I think 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.020
 that it's still 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.680
 something that is good when you have a 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.570
 it's going a little bit without improving the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.880
 quality and the image so there it is not 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.590
 Too much disgust frankly here you are 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.160
 can watch the mozy matches 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.570
 favorites buy it 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.330
 binz is that it's still pretty 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.459
 expensive at 12 euros per month, while 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.650
 there we can have it for free 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.880
 so here's the tutorial coming to an end I 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.040
 Thank you for watching the video
