00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.410
 Is it in February 2015? 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.980
 This is Bob style like this 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.370
 It is a hair set of 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 Loose Bob 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.230
 We will introduce how to make the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.670
 First, when you yourself 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.510
 In the upper and lower half egg curl 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.620
 I will stop 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:32.770
 I'm making it from below, but if I do it myself, I do iron 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.520
 I think that I will put in from you 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.390
 When you put on the iron 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.390
 First to 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.200
 Quite a few years 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.200
 Being 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.400
 If your hair gets warm 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.590
 Because it is loose this time 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.810
 Hit at a slightly higher angle than down stem 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.250
 Hey 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.850
 Aichi Curran 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.010
 Warm up 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.130
 It was rounding like this 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.920
 Round in 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.090
 N behind N next 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.090
 The same goes for the back 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.490
 Because 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.490
 Through 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.540
 When you've used 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.060
 First place 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.270
 I will 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.940
 Neckline something is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.780
 Without passing through the finger it Te horse lock 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.159
 Have iron put in place not hit the neck 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.420
 Hey school 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.640
 About to bend 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.750
 Not 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.110
 I think it's good, but next one 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.340
 It says the movie yuwa type It is around this 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.320
 In about it was just the eyes of Cebu 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.670
 2 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.670
 I want to make it matte 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.610
 While looking at the flower that I mirror 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.010
 Iron it once 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.620
 Hmm 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.650
 Of here 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.650
 Give it a roundness 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.720
 I will paste for a little 5 minutes if it is round 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.760
 I 'm pulling it while my fever doesn't get cold 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.760
 Just like that behind you 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.430
 Top that it in this state guard 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.430
 Because it is a little pechanko 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.640
 Little 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.030

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.670
 Move here 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.620
 Bend a little from here 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.500
 Straight as it is 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.500
 The root will rise a little with heart 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.999
 Put the uc 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.230
