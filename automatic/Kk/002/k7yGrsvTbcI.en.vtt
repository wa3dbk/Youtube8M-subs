00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
out the other thing that I got was this

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.360 
out the other thing that I got was this
rode<00:03:03.190> videomic<00:03:04.000> pro<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:04.980> what<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.010> thought<00:03:06.220> was

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
rode videomic pro and what I thought was

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.509 
rode videomic pro and what I thought was
really<00:03:06.549> cool<00:03:06.819> about<00:03:06.879> this<00:03:07.209> thing<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:08.519> it's

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
really cool about this thing is it's

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.000 
really cool about this thing is it's
actually<00:03:09.810> mounted<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:13.829> vibration<00:03:14.829> mounts

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
actually mounted on a vibration mounts

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.220 
actually mounted on a vibration mounts
so<00:03:15.400> this<00:03:15.879> little<00:03:16.150> rubber<00:03:16.299> band<00:03:16.540> soaks<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.049> any

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
so this little rubber band soaks up any

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.379 
so this little rubber band soaks up any
vibration<00:03:17.859> that<00:03:18.069> you<00:03:18.220> may<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.370> by<00:03:18.849> walking

this<00:04:49.419> isn't<00:04:49.780> an<00:04:49.840> unboxing<00:04:50.199> is<00:04:50.620> because<00:04:51.479> I'm

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
this isn't an unboxing is because I'm

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.370 
this isn't an unboxing is because I'm
not<00:04:52.750> sure<00:04:53.169> about<00:04:53.850> micro<00:04:54.850> four-thirds<00:04:55.090> yet<00:04:55.479> the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
not sure about micro four-thirds yet the

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.219 
not sure about micro four-thirds yet the
system<00:04:56.800> itself<00:04:57.100> seems<00:04:57.850> awesome<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.600> me<00:04:58.720> I<00:04:58.900> mean

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
system itself seems awesome to me I mean

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.270 
system itself seems awesome to me I mean

my kind of overall goals and plans with
this<00:05:37.200> you<00:05:38.200> know<00:05:38.289> photography<00:05:38.889> system<00:05:39.220> that

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
this you know photography system that

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.760 
this you know photography system that
i'm<00:05:39.430> getting<00:05:39.700> into<00:05:39.970> is<00:05:40.380> to<00:05:41.380> be<00:05:41.470> able<00:05:41.530> to<00:05:41.680> do

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
i'm getting into is to be able to do

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.960 
i'm getting into is to be able to do
headshots<00:05:42.039> and<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:45.220> know<00:05:45.340> obviously<00:05:45.550> i'll<00:05:45.880> be

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
headshots and you know obviously i'll be

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.310 
headshots and you know obviously i'll be
able<00:05:46.030> to<00:05:46.150> do<00:05:46.240> headshots<00:05:46.450> with<00:05:46.750> this<00:05:46.900> stuff<00:05:47.080> but

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
able to do headshots with this stuff but

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.360 
able to do headshots with this stuff but
a<00:05:47.560> lot<00:05:48.280> of<00:05:48.310> headshots<00:05:48.720> need<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:50.050> really<00:05:50.979> creamy

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
a lot of headshots need a really creamy

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.740 
a lot of headshots need a really creamy
bokeh<00:05:52.270> effect<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.910> with<00:05:54.910> micro<00:05:55.449> four-thirds

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
bokeh effect and with micro four-thirds

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.200 
bokeh effect and with micro four-thirds
the<00:05:56.289> for<00:05:56.500> third<00:05:56.710> sensor<00:05:57.220> being<00:05:57.580> a<00:05:57.760> little<00:05:58.090> bit

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
the for third sensor being a little bit

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.990 
the for third sensor being a little bit
smaller<00:05:58.479> I<00:05:59.340> don't<00:06:00.340> know<00:06:00.400> I've<00:06:00.550> heard<00:06:00.760> some

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
smaller I don't know I've heard some

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.730 
smaller I don't know I've heard some
conflicting<00:06:01.330> things<00:06:01.900> I<00:06:02.199> still<00:06:02.530> haven't

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
conflicting things I still haven't

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.800 
conflicting things I still haven't
really<00:06:03.099> gotten<00:06:04.000> down<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.660> the<00:06:05.229> exact

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
really gotten down the the exact

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.170 
really gotten down the the exact
definition<00:06:07.810> of<00:06:07.930> all<00:06:08.050> this<00:06:08.229> stuff<00:06:08.289> but<00:06:09.180> what

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
definition of all this stuff but what

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.379 
definition of all this stuff but what
I've<00:06:10.300> heard<00:06:10.510> is<00:06:10.690> not<00:06:10.960> only<00:06:11.229> are<00:06:11.560> you<00:06:12.389> doubling

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
I've heard is not only are you doubling

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.170 
I've heard is not only are you doubling
the<00:06:14.039> focal<00:06:15.039> length<00:06:15.250> so<00:06:15.610> this<00:06:15.760> is<00:06:15.880> going<00:06:16.030> to<00:06:16.090> be

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
the focal length so this is going to be

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.860 
the focal length so this is going to be
actually<00:06:16.389> a<00:06:16.630> 24<00:06:17.139> to<00:06:17.260> 70<00:06:18.060> when<00:06:19.060> compared<00:06:19.419> to<00:06:19.479> 35

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
actually a 24 to 70 when compared to 35

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.070 
actually a 24 to 70 when compared to 35
millimeter<00:06:20.289> full<00:06:21.099> frame<00:06:21.389> but<00:06:22.389> also<00:06:22.599> I've

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
millimeter full frame but also I've

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.279 
millimeter full frame but also I've
heard<00:06:23.320> that<00:06:23.470> you<00:06:23.620> need<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:23.949> double<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:25.289> f-stop

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
heard that you need to double the f-stop

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.250 
heard that you need to double the f-stop
here<00:06:26.530> so<00:06:26.710> f<00:06:26.860> 2.8<00:06:27.099> really<00:06:27.760> becomes<00:06:28.090> an<00:06:28.210> F<00:06:28.360> 5.6

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
here so f 2.8 really becomes an F 5.6

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.560 
here so f 2.8 really becomes an F 5.6
now<00:06:29.889> I've<00:06:30.130> asked<00:06:30.520> a<00:06:30.550> couple<00:06:30.699> people<00:06:31.030> about

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
now I've asked a couple people about

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.439 
now I've asked a couple people about
this<00:06:31.810> online<00:06:32.220> people<00:06:33.220> say<00:06:33.460> that's<00:06:33.639> false<00:06:34.030> some

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
this online people say that's false some

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.080 
this online people say that's false some
people<00:06:34.690> say<00:06:34.810> that's<00:06:34.990> yes<00:06:35.320> that's<00:06:35.590> true<00:06:36.090> at

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
people say that's yes that's true at

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.940 
people say that's yes that's true at
this<00:06:37.450> actual<00:06:37.840> event<00:06:38.110> I<00:06:38.229> talked<00:06:38.469> to<00:06:38.590> one<00:06:38.770> of<00:06:38.800> the
