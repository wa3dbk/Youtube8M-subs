easy to give my baby something a to toy
that<00:01:09.940> was<00:01:10.150> something<00:01:10.930> they<00:01:11.050> could<00:01:11.230> be<00:01:11.380> chewing

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
that was something they could be chewing

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.290 
that was something they could be chewing
on<00:01:11.770> while<00:01:12.280> I'm<00:01:12.460> working<00:01:12.850> with<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.180> other

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
teeth and that way there was not too

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.750 
teeth and that way there was not too
much<00:01:16.300> risk<00:01:16.660> of<00:01:16.900> hurting<00:01:17.230> my<00:01:17.380> own<00:01:17.650> finger<00:01:18.160> and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
much risk of hurting my own finger and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.510
