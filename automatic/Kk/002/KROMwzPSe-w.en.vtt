gameplay you'll see and the gameplay is

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.380 
gameplay you'll see and the gameplay is

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
always interesting and I think it's like

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.969 
always interesting and I think it's like
a<00:05:35.300> comic<00:05:35.659> book<00:05:35.810> right<00:05:36.050> and<00:05:36.409> there's<00:05:36.650> you<00:05:36.770> sold

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
a comic book right and there's you sold

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.080 
a comic book right and there's you sold
more<00:05:37.099> bright<00:05:37.249> there<00:05:37.400> was<00:05:37.520> like<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.669> comic<00:05:37.969> book

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
more bright there was like a comic book

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.129 
more bright there was like a comic book
series<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.509> they<00:05:38.569> turned<00:05:38.810> it<00:05:38.900> into<00:05:39.050> a

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
series and they turned it into a

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.499 
series and they turned it into a
television<00:05:39.590> series<00:05:39.949> I<00:05:40.310> think<00:05:40.999> season<00:05:41.360> three

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
television series I think season three
