00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
technology like the god king isn't out

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.800 
technology like the god king isn't out
making<00:02:19.280> his<00:02:19.430> own<00:02:19.550> castle<00:02:19.790> they<00:02:20.240> need<00:02:20.480> send

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
making his own castle they need send

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.600 
making his own castle they need send
mortals<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:21.470> they<00:02:21.620> keep<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.950> population<00:02:22.370> in

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
mortals but they keep the population in

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.700 
mortals but they keep the population in
check<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.090> they<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.480> they<00:02:23.900> split<00:02:24.440> up<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
check and they and they split up the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.740 
check and they and they split up the
earth<00:02:24.890> among<00:02:25.520> themselves<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:26.090> basically<00:02:26.420> rule

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
earth among themselves to basically rule

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.880 
earth among themselves to basically rule
in<00:02:26.990> these<00:02:27.190> feudal<00:02:28.330> systems<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.570> their<00:02:29.750> own<00:02:29.930> but

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
in these feudal systems on their own but

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.490 
in these feudal systems on their own but
he<00:02:31.370> decided<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.910> he<00:02:32.600> wanted<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.960> method<00:02:33.320> for

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
he decided that he wanted a method for

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.530 
he decided that he wanted a method for
more<00:02:33.650> precise<00:02:34.130> control<00:02:34.670> over<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.060> deathless

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
more precise control over the deathless

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.979 
more precise control over the deathless
and<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.380> he<00:02:36.800> he<00:02:37.340> devised<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:38.090> way<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.240> create<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
and so he he devised a way to create a

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.930 
and so he he devised a way to create a
way<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.170> kill<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.590> deathless<00:02:39.950> bless<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
way to kill the deathless bless the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.490 
way to kill the deathless bless the
Infinity<00:02:41.360> Blade<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:43.130> he<00:02:43.510> he<00:02:44.510> through<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.230> very

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
Infinity Blade so he he through a very

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.740 
Infinity Blade so he he through a very
complicated<00:02:45.890> process<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.970> I'm<00:02:47.420> not<00:02:47.570> gonna

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
complicated process that I'm not gonna

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.930 
complicated process that I'm not gonna
really<00:02:48.230> elaborate<00:02:48.770> on<00:02:48.980> he<00:02:49.459> created<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
really elaborate on he created the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.990 
really elaborate on he created the
Infinity<00:02:50.360> Blade<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.070> doing<00:02:52.280> he<00:02:52.670> needed

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
Infinity Blade and in so doing he needed

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.410 
Infinity Blade and in so doing he needed
needed<00:02:53.810> help<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.670> he<00:02:55.750> he<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.900> SR<00:02:58.180> were<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.390> a

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
needed help and he he and SR were in a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.979 
needed help and he he and SR were in a
very<00:02:59.720> complicated<00:03:00.290> alliance<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.940> gain<00:03:02.420> more

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
very complicated alliance to gain more

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.260 
very complicated alliance to gain more
control<00:03:03.230> over<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.640> deathless

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.140 

but<00:03:08.270> they're<00:03:08.930> still<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.710> know<00:03:10.150> conspiring

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
but they're still you know conspiring

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.350 
but they're still you know conspiring
gods<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.970> something<00:03:13.970> went<00:03:14.150> wrong

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
gods and and something went wrong

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.420 
gods and and something went wrong
something<00:03:15.050> went<00:03:15.200> wrong<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.710> process<00:03:15.830> of

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
something went wrong in the process of

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.870 
something went wrong in the process of
creating<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.940> Infinity<00:03:17.390> Blade<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:19.370> led

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
creating the Infinity Blade and that led

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.230 
creating the Infinity Blade and that led
to<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.890> made<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:21.980> happen<00:03:22.130> anyway<00:03:22.460> but<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:23.030> led

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
to that made it happen anyway but it led

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.280 
to that made it happen anyway but it led
to<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:24.170> worker<00:03:25.270> realizing<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:27.050> order

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
to the worker realizing that in order

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.810 
to the worker realizing that in order
for<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.530> Infinity<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.190> actually<00:03:28.580> work

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
for the Infinity to actually work

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.760 
for the Infinity to actually work
correctly<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:30.410> needed<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:30.910> be<00:03:31.910> attuned<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:33.320> a

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
correctly it needed to be attuned to a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.060 
correctly it needed to be attuned to a
deathless<00:03:34.550> Qi<00:03:35.020> p4<00:03:36.020> could<00:03:36.170> actually<00:03:36.350> work<00:03:36.800> and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
deathless Qi p4 could actually work and

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.790 
deathless Qi p4 could actually work and
that<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.000> only<00:03:38.270> way<00:03:38.390> if<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.660> happened<00:03:39.230> would

that the only way if that happened would

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.480 
that the only way if that happened would
be<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.310> attain<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.150> over<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:42.260> long<00:03:42.920> period<00:03:43.460> of

infinity blade to work but what they

right and that he would that would the

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.039 
right and that he would that would the
worker<00:04:19.760> would<00:04:19.970> essentially<00:04:20.630> be<00:04:20.780> able<00:04:20.900> to

to<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:24.710> process<00:04:25.250> but<00:04:25.520> then<00:04:25.730> in<00:04:26.060> that<00:04:26.330> process

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
to this process but then in that process
