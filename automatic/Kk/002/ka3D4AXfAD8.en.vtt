00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
it in the yeast the next step is to take

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.779

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:44.459 
base sanitized fermenter cover and place
it<00:05:37.059> tightly<00:05:39.839> enough<00:05:40.839> fermenter<00:05:43.319> make<00:05:44.319> sure

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
it tightly enough fermenter make sure

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:55.859 
it tightly enough fermenter make sure
it's<00:05:44.829> totally<00:05:45.610> locked<00:05:54.629> next<00:05:55.629> thing<00:05:55.749> you're

00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:55.869 
it's totally locked next thing you're

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:00.479 
it's totally locked next thing you're
going<00:05:56.019> to<00:05:56.139> do<00:05:56.319> is<00:05:56.589> take<00:05:57.119> the<00:05:58.119> airlock<00:05:59.399> fill<00:06:00.399> it

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:00.489 
going to do is take the airlock fill it

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:06.749 
going to do is take the airlock fill it
up<00:06:00.579> approximately<00:06:02.729> halfway<00:06:03.729> with<00:06:04.149> water<00:06:05.759> you

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
up approximately halfway with water you

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.469 
up approximately halfway with water you
could<00:06:06.969> use<00:06:07.209> vodka<00:06:07.629> or<00:06:08.169> something<00:06:09.479> alcoholic

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
could use vodka or something alcoholic

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.079 
could use vodka or something alcoholic
like<00:06:10.659> that<00:06:10.989> but<00:06:11.519> since<00:06:12.519> this<00:06:12.639> is<00:06:12.789> only<00:06:12.879> going

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089 
like that but since this is only going

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.839 
like that but since this is only going
to<00:06:13.149> be<00:06:13.239> fermenting<00:06:13.659> for<00:06:13.979> two<00:06:14.979> weeks<00:06:15.279> until<00:06:15.639> the

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
to be fermenting for two weeks until the

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.579 
to be fermenting for two weeks until the
next<00:06:15.879> stage<00:06:16.360> water<00:06:17.259> will<00:06:17.439> do<00:06:17.529> fine<00:06:19.349> put<00:06:20.349> in<00:06:20.469> the

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:20.589 
next stage water will do fine put in the

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:29.639 
next stage water will do fine put in the
bunghole<00:06:22.319> and<00:06:23.519> in<00:06:24.519> approximately<00:06:25.919> 12<00:06:26.919> to<00:06:28.649> 36

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:29.649 
bunghole and in approximately 12 to 36

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:35.339 
bunghole and in approximately 12 to 36
hours<00:06:30.129> you're<00:06:30.939> gonna<00:06:30.999> see<00:06:31.360> or<00:06:32.079> hear<00:06:34.349> things

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
hours you're gonna see or hear things

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.339 
hours you're gonna see or hear things
starting<00:06:35.679> to<00:06:35.709> ferment<00:06:36.509> this<00:06:37.509> will<00:06:38.019> start

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
starting to ferment this will start

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.109 
starting to ferment this will start
popping<00:06:38.619> up<00:06:38.949> or<00:06:39.519> if<00:06:39.669> you<00:06:39.729> use<00:06:39.849> a<00:06:39.879> different

00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:40.119 
popping up or if you use a different

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:47.759 
popping up or if you use a different
type<00:06:45.209> or<00:06:46.209> if<00:06:46.929> you<00:06:47.049> use<00:06:47.199> another<00:06:47.499> type<00:06:47.709> of

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:47.769 
type or if you use another type of

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:50.279 
type or if you use another type of
airlock<00:06:48.279> you'll<00:06:48.789> see<00:06:48.999> the<00:06:49.119> fermentation<00:06:49.509> take

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
airlock you'll see the fermentation take

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.669 
airlock you'll see the fermentation take
place<00:06:50.849> so<00:06:51.849> again<00:06:52.149> this<00:06:52.929> will<00:06:53.139> be<00:06:53.259> just<00:06:53.469> like

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:53.679 
place so again this will be just like

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:56.699 
place so again this will be just like
this<00:06:53.860> where<00:06:54.129> the<00:06:54.429> next<00:06:54.669> two<00:06:55.209> weeks<00:06:55.509> and<00:06:55.839> then

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:56.709 
this where the next two weeks and then

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:00.059 
this where the next two weeks and then
we'll<00:06:57.039> go<00:06:57.189> ahead<00:06:57.339> and<00:06:58.259> go<00:06:59.259> through<00:06:59.289> the<00:06:59.769> next

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:00.069 
we'll go ahead and go through the next

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:04.439 
we'll go ahead and go through the next
stage<00:07:01.799> well<00:07:02.799> now<00:07:02.919> at<00:07:03.129> day<00:07:03.309> five<00:07:03.669> you'll<00:07:04.179> notice

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
stage well now at day five you'll notice

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.929 
stage well now at day five you'll notice
a<00:07:04.539> couple<00:07:04.689> of<00:07:04.839> things<00:07:04.929> one<00:07:05.889> the<00:07:06.369> fermentation

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:06.939 
a couple of things one the fermentation

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:08.819 
a couple of things one the fermentation
is<00:07:07.059> slowed<00:07:07.299> down<00:07:07.509> quite<00:07:07.809> a<00:07:07.929> bit<00:07:08.019> it's<00:07:08.739> still

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:08.829 
is slowed down quite a bit it's still

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:10.709 
is slowed down quite a bit it's still
taking<00:07:09.129> place<00:07:09.429> but<00:07:09.999> it's<00:07:10.119> definitely<00:07:10.479> slowed

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:10.719 
taking place but it's definitely slowed

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:14.039 
taking place but it's definitely slowed
down<00:07:10.899> to<00:07:11.079> the<00:07:11.199> eye<00:07:11.519> and<00:07:12.519> number<00:07:12.759> two<00:07:13.049> we've

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:14.049 
down to the eye and number two we've

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:17.789 
down to the eye and number two we've
lifted<00:07:14.279> the<00:07:15.279> primary<00:07:15.729> vessel<00:07:16.599> up<00:07:17.169> on<00:07:17.469> a<00:07:17.499> chair

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:17.799 
lifted the primary vessel up on a chair

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:19.829 
lifted the primary vessel up on a chair
about<00:07:18.039> two<00:07:18.309> and<00:07:18.399> a<00:07:18.489> half<00:07:18.519> three<00:07:18.879> feet<00:07:18.909> above

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:19.839 
about two and a half three feet above

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.929 
about two and a half three feet above
the<00:07:20.019> ground<00:07:20.099> we've<00:07:21.099> done<00:07:21.249> this<00:07:21.369> for<00:07:21.579> a<00:07:21.610> couple

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:21.939 
the ground we've done this for a couple

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:25.260 
the ground we've done this for a couple
of<00:07:21.999> reasons<00:07:22.379> one<00:07:23.379> we<00:07:23.709> don't<00:07:24.189> want<00:07:24.369> to

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
of reasons one we don't want to

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.300 
of reasons one we don't want to
serve<00:07:25.390> the<00:07:25.930> sedimentation<00:07:26.500> process<00:07:26.830> just

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
serve the sedimentation process just

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.580 
serve the sedimentation process just
before<00:07:28.140> we<00:07:29.140> siphon<00:07:29.680> over<00:07:30.010> to<00:07:30.130> the<00:07:30.250> carboy<00:07:30.700> and

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
before we siphon over to the carboy and

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.110 
before we siphon over to the carboy and
number<00:07:32.590> two<00:07:32.740> it<00:07:32.890> will<00:07:33.040> make<00:07:33.220> siphoning<00:07:33.790> into

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
number two it will make siphoning into

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.750 
number two it will make siphoning into
the<00:07:34.600> carboy<00:07:35.020> which<00:07:35.710> is<00:07:35.860> a<00:07:35.890> second<00:07:36.340> part<00:07:36.550> of<00:07:36.670> the

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:36.760 
the carboy which is a second part of the

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.660 
the carboy which is a second part of the
process<00:07:37.680> that<00:07:38.680> much<00:07:38.860> easier<00:07:39.700> and<00:07:39.880> cleaner

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:41.670 
process that much easier and cleaner

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.780 
process that much easier and cleaner
