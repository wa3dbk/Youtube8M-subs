the Gerber kiowa let's get specs out the
way<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> 3<00:00:09.000> inch<00:00:09.240> tanto<00:00:09.690> blade<00:00:10.010> made

way we have a 3 inch tanto blade made
out<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.519> an<00:00:11.610> unknown<00:00:11.969> steel<00:00:12.300> they<00:00:12.450> listed<00:00:12.780> as

out of an unknown steel they listed as
high<00:00:13.889> carbon<00:00:14.309> stainless<00:00:14.660> but<00:00:15.660> judging<00:00:16.289> by<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
high carbon stainless but judging by the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.950 
high carbon stainless but judging by the
price<00:00:16.920> range<00:00:17.279> which<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.730> 60<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.240> 70<00:00:18.690> I'm<00:00:18.779> going

price range which is 60 to 70 I'm going

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.370 
price range which is 60 to 70 I'm going
to<00:00:19.020> say<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.350> either<00:00:19.500> 440<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:20.609> 1095<00:00:21.420> which<00:00:22.170> is

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
to say it's either 440 or 1095 which is

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.859 
to say it's either 440 or 1095 which is

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
distills you can get away with making

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.359 
distills you can get away with making
for<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> price<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.900> handles<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.650> glass

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
for that price the handles are glass

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.269 
for that price the handles are glass
filled<00:00:29.970> nylon<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:31.289> exact<00:00:31.590> same<00:00:31.800> stuff<00:00:32.130> as

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
filled nylon the exact same stuff as

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.850 
filled nylon the exact same stuff as
glass<00:00:32.550> reinforced<00:00:33.480> by<00:00:33.750> most<00:00:34.260> companies<00:00:34.680> say

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
glass reinforced by most companies say

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.819 
glass reinforced by most companies say
rainforest<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.940> sounds<00:00:36.270> better

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
rainforest just because it sounds better

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.549 
rainforest just because it sounds better
and<00:00:37.829> that's<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:40.050> don't<00:00:40.140> sell

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and that's about it so they don't sell

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
and that's about it so they don't sell
this<00:00:40.770> knife<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.489> their<00:00:41.700> website<00:00:42.270> anymore<00:00:42.750> they

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
this knife on their website anymore they

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.200 
this knife on their website anymore they
seem<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.379> taken<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.860> down<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:44.969> I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
seem to have taken it down and I think I

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600 
seem to have taken it down and I think I
know<00:00:45.270> why<00:00:45.570> now<00:00:46.559> there's<00:00:46.739> nothing<00:00:47.100> inherently

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
know why now there's nothing inherently

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.930 
know why now there's nothing inherently
wrong<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.719> knife<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.640> put<00:00:50.910> it

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
wrong with this knife but they put it

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.080 
wrong with this knife but they put it
under<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> tactical<00:00:52.620> category<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.879> knife

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and as a tactical knife I have problems

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
and as a tactical knife I have problems
with<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.510> when<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> first<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.820> well<00:00:59.820> all<00:01:00.120> mine

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
with it when the first one well all mine

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.819 
with it when the first one well all mine
not<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.870> problems<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> blade

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
not all my problems are with the blade

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.340 
not all my problems are with the blade
the<00:01:02.250> first<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.850> being<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.420> size<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.110> said

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the first one being the size like I said

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.130 
the first one being the size like I said
this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> three<00:01:04.979> inch<00:01:05.100> blade<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.780> for<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:06.990> at

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
this is a three inch blade and for me at

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.609 
this is a three inch blade and for me at
least

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
least

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.120 
least
the<00:01:08.510> smallest<00:01:09.510> size<00:01:10.049> knife<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.650> would<00:01:10.710> deal

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the smallest size knife I would deal

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.880 
the smallest size knife I would deal
with<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> tactical<00:01:13.590> environment

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
with with a in a tactical environment

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
with with a in a tactical environment
especially<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> combat<00:01:15.479> environment

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
especially like a combat environment

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.359 
especially like a combat environment
which<00:01:16.170> by<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> looks<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.189> was

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
which by the looks is what this was

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
which by the looks is what this was
designed<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.970> there's<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.840> three

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
designed for there's going to be three

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.780 
designed for there's going to be three
and<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.320> half<00:01:19.470> inches<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.130> minimum

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
and a half inches and that's minimum

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.440 
and a half inches and that's minimum
like<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> end<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.759> last<00:01:23.759> resort<00:01:24.150> back

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
like on the end like a last resort back

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
like on the end like a last resort back
up<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:24.990> pocket<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.009> would<00:01:26.130> actually<00:01:26.250> for

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
up in my pocket and I would actually for

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.340 
up in my pocket and I would actually for
that<00:01:26.670> purpose<00:01:27.540> prefer<00:01:28.380> 3.8<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.490> 4.0<00:01:30.350> any

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that purpose prefer 3.8 to 4.0 any

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.990 
that purpose prefer 3.8 to 4.0 any
larger<00:01:31.740> that's<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> start<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.880> know

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
larger that's going to start you know

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.370 
larger that's going to start you know
getting<00:01:33.030> Jim<00:01:33.509> from<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.810> pocket<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.259> going

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
getting Jim from your pocket it's going

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.929 
getting Jim from your pocket it's going
to<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.530> too<00:01:34.710> long<00:01:35.040> before<00:01:35.250> point<00:01:35.700> o<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> can

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
to be too long before point o you can

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.069 
to be too long before point o you can
get<00:01:36.180> away<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.540> without<00:01:36.720> too<00:01:36.990> much

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
get away with without too much

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.429 
get away with without too much
difficulty<00:01:37.759> anyway<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.900> second<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
difficulty anyway the second is the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
difficulty anyway the second is the
steel<00:01:40.680> once<00:01:41.460> again<00:01:41.759> nothing<00:01:42.270> necessarily

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
steel once again nothing necessarily

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.710 
steel once again nothing necessarily
wrong<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:43.320> 440<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:44.189> 1095<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.180> general<00:01:45.479> use

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
wrong with 440 or 1095 for general use

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.999 
wrong with 440 or 1095 for general use
but<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:47.369> brittle<00:01:48.259> I<00:01:49.259> don't<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.890> if

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
but it is a bit brittle I don't know if

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.670 
but it is a bit brittle I don't know if
you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.250> necessarily<00:01:50.490> make<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.680> but

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
you can necessarily make this out but

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.830 
you can necessarily make this out but
there's<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.820> bit<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.180> chipping<00:01:54.420> right

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
there's a little bit of chipping right

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
there's a little bit of chipping right
on<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> end<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.280> didn't<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.759> do

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
on the end here and I didn't really do

anything to this map that would warrant

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.399 
anything to this map that would warrant
that<00:01:58.710> kind<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.219> chipping<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.590> there<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.829> that

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
that kind of chipping so there is that

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.700 
that kind of chipping so there is that
for<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> tactical<00:02:05.009> knife<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.579> would<00:02:05.759> prefer

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
of course the black oxide I've been

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.380 
of course the black oxide I've been
using<00:02:47.950> this<00:02:48.100> knife<00:02:48.280> quite<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.550> bit<00:02:48.730> as<00:02:48.910> well<00:02:49.150> and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
using this knife quite a bit as well and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.940 
using this knife quite a bit as well and
it<00:02:49.750> hasn't<00:02:49.900> come<00:02:50.020> off<00:02:50.230> at<00:02:50.380> all<00:02:50.470> there's<00:02:50.800> no

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
it hasn't come off at all there's no

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.010 
it hasn't come off at all there's no

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
dispersal now you can see as I move this

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.570 
dispersal now you can see as I move this
through<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.440> light<00:02:56.680> now<00:02:56.950> mine<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:57.520> a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
through the light now mine I do have a

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.160 
through the light now mine I do have a
very<00:02:57.760> powerful<00:02:58.030> light<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.750> see<00:02:58.930> how<00:02:59.020> much

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
very powerful light but you see how much

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.500 
very powerful light but you see how much
that's<00:02:59.380> shining<00:02:59.940> let's<00:03:00.940> take<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.150> look<00:03:01.420> at<00:03:01.800> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
that's shining let's take a look at the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.230 
that's shining let's take a look at the
black<00:03:04.510> oxide<00:03:05.140> there<00:03:06.010> we<00:03:06.160> go<00:03:06.310> alright<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.210> I

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
black oxide there we go alright so I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.460 
black oxide there we go alright so I
move<00:03:07.480> both<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.690> these<00:03:07.840> back<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.260> forth

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
move both of these back and forth

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.840 
move both of these back and forth
through<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.830> light<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.130> can<00:03:09.280> see<00:03:09.460> that<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
through the light you can see that the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.390 
through the light you can see that the
black<00:03:10.060> paint<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.570> shining<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.140> lot<00:03:11.290> more<00:03:11.590> that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
black paint is shining a lot more that

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.190 
black paint is shining a lot more that
may<00:03:12.520> not<00:03:12.670> seem<00:03:12.940> like<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.210> big<00:03:13.300> deal<00:03:13.690> but<00:03:14.020> you're

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
may not seem like a big deal but you're

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.570 
may not seem like a big deal but you're
talking<00:03:14.380> about<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.680> tactical<00:03:15.190> setting<00:03:15.490> when

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
talking about a tactical setting when

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.520 
talking about a tactical setting when
you're<00:03:15.700> trying<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:15.970> be<00:03:16.120> covert<00:03:16.530> basically

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
you're trying to be covert basically

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.530 
you're trying to be covert basically
what<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:17.860> doing<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.490> same<00:03:18.760> kind<00:03:19.300> of

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
what this is doing is the same kind of

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.080 
what this is doing is the same kind of
idea<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.620> stealth<00:03:20.920> technology<00:03:21.340> does<00:03:21.820> to

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
idea that the stealth technology does to

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.960 
idea that the stealth technology does to
a<00:03:22.120> radar<00:03:22.720> which<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:22.930> scatter<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.340> from<00:03:24.820> any

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
a radar which is scatter it so from any

a radar which is scatter it so from any
kind<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.270> a<00:03:25.390> distance<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.990> know<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.740> five<00:03:27.220> or

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
kind of a distance you know the five or

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.710 
kind of a distance you know the five or
six<00:03:27.640> hundred<00:03:27.940> meters<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.270> him<00:03:28.390> he's<00:03:28.540> going<00:03:28.630> to

six hundred meters of him he's going to

six hundred meters of him he's going to
be<00:03:28.780> at<00:03:28.990> this<00:03:29.260> is<00:03:29.410> guaranteed<00:03:30.010> not<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.370> give

be at this is guaranteed not to give
away<00:03:30.850> your<00:03:31.090> position<00:03:31.330> because<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.710> know

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
away your position because it's you know

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.500 
away your position because it's you know
scattering<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.490> light<00:03:33.700> all<00:03:33.940> over<00:03:34.240> the<00:03:34.330> place

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.200 
scattering the light all over the place
whereas<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.110> is<00:03:36.100> going<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.610> be<00:03:36.700> reflecting

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
whereas this is going to be reflecting

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.000 
whereas this is going to be reflecting
at<00:03:37.300> that<00:03:37.480> pretty<00:03:37.810> much<00:03:37.960> wholesale<00:03:38.620> even

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
at that pretty much wholesale even

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.840 
at that pretty much wholesale even
though<00:03:39.130> it<00:03:39.280> does<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.490> black<00:03:40.030> on<00:03:40.270> it<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.850> there

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
though it does have black on it so there

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.460 
though it does have black on it so there
you<00:03:42.940> go<00:03:43.060> that's<00:03:43.270> basically<00:03:43.780> my<00:03:43.990> problem<00:03:44.350> for

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
see the shape of the handle is a little

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.920 
see the shape of the handle is a little
weird<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.340> I'll<00:04:58.730> let<00:04:58.970> them<00:04:59.150> slide<00:04:59.510> with<00:04:59.750> that

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
weird so I'll let them slide with that

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.630 
weird so I'll let them slide with that
although<00:05:00.140> if<00:05:00.530> they<00:05:00.650> remake<00:05:01.040> this<00:05:01.250> knife<00:05:01.460> I

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
although if they remake this knife I

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.430 
although if they remake this knife I
expect<00:05:02.060> them<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.270> change<00:05:02.420> the<00:05:02.870> handle<00:05:03.200> shape

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
expect them to change the handle shape

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.520 
expect them to change the handle shape
to<00:05:04.010> allow<00:05:04.310> for<00:05:04.640> tip<00:05:04.850> up<00:05:05.030> carry<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:06.350> would

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
to allow for tip up carry and I would

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.070 
to allow for tip up carry and I would
also<00:05:06.710> expect<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:08.060> pocket<00:05:08.600> clip<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.930> be

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
also expect the pocket clip to be

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.720 
also expect the pocket clip to be
reversible<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:09.950> we<00:05:10.130> go<00:05:10.220> ahead<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.520> show<00:05:10.670> you

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
reversible and we go ahead and show you

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:20.430 
reversible and we go ahead and show you
how<00:05:10.910> it<00:05:11.030> looks<00:05:11.180> in<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.360> pocket<00:05:19.090> already<00:05:20.090> then

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
how it looks in the pocket already then

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.490 
how it looks in the pocket already then
one<00:05:21.440> pocket<00:05:21.850> one<00:05:22.850> knife

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.590 

all<00:05:27.100> right<00:05:27.250> so<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:27.640> does<00:05:27.790> have<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.000> very<00:05:28.330> long

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
all right so it does have a very long

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.810 
all right so it does have a very long
pocket<00:05:29.200> clip<00:05:29.350> which<00:05:29.680> is<00:05:29.860> neither<00:05:30.100> a<00:05:30.250> good<00:05:30.550> nor

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
pocket clip which is neither a good nor

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.370 
pocket clip which is neither a good nor
bad<00:05:30.850> thing<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.450> allows<00:05:31.540> you<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:31.870> get<00:05:32.020> plenty<00:05:32.260> of

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
bad thing it allows you to get plenty of

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.660 
bad thing it allows you to get plenty of
grip<00:05:32.770> but<00:05:33.400> it's<00:05:33.850> also<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.360> know<00:05:35.100> kind<00:05:36.100> of<00:05:36.310> long

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
grip but it's also you know kind of long

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.310 
grip but it's also you know kind of long
you<00:05:37.030> can<00:05:37.180> see<00:05:37.420> it<00:05:37.540> really<00:05:37.780> easy<00:05:37.960> it's<00:05:38.230> not

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
you can see it really easy it's not

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.650 
you can see it really easy it's not
really<00:05:38.560> concealed<00:05:39.040> too<00:05:39.310> well<00:05:39.490> but<00:05:40.450> it<00:05:40.570> in

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
but then that that's not really too

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.100 
but then that that's not really too
important<00:05:45.790> so<00:05:46.150> I'm<00:05:46.270> going<00:05:46.420> to<00:05:46.450> let<00:05:46.570> that<00:05:46.720> slide

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110
