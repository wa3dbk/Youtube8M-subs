00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 the people my name is julian title and 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.470
 this is a running personal training today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.990
 it's about the subject yes so hurt 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.550
 here in the forearm and yes what can I 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 do it and where does that come from 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.340
 fun ok so more and more people 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.990
 Write to me and say if they are 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 dumbbell, for example , grab the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 barbell or here at the truck or 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.689
 With pull-ups we always do them 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 the exercise and then they leave that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.119
 weight off and suddenly it pulls here 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.130
 really pure 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.810
 it can be the pain at some point 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.160
 even to a tendonitis 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.570
 comes and thus always needs to be careful 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.600
 be but they decide that he so 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.950
 a thing happens often more often 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.149
 one behind the other and ignites 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.040
 really permanent can be one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.510
 that means you have to become chronic 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.070
 take a longer break from the training 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.420
 if the tendonitis 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.920
 I always recommend you can do everything 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.660
 possible further training but tried 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 really not in the pain 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.600
 So it's not really 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.829
 hurt and hurt again and again and we 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.539
 do I have experienced the most amazing things 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.129
 that some over one and a half years 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.289
 could not train properly because 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.660
 Do not get it at the right time 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.739
 have made a good break 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.180
 i can give a little tip and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.590
 First of all, train me in the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.390
 pain into it when it's already there 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.809
 secondly, if you do not want it 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 his 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 to go in this extreme as well as nation 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.380
 and then to have weight on it 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.180
 it does not make it to it for so long 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.040
 someday i can have exactly the same thing 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 problem there I could never barbell 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.790
 make girls with a lot of weight so have 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.600
 Immediately pulled into the forearms 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.180
 i have tendon inflammation 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.650
 get and so on and so on and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.479
 through this you about marcel one 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.130
 have entertainment here comes somewhere other 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.689
 pain in it is not the point 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.630
 the thing therefore tried in the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.240
 biceps exercises always a hammer handle 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.070
 to do so long until it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 At some point that comes to you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.259
 first exercises with hammer excess means 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.280
 exhausted and thus low weight 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.450
 At some point he is training 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.100
 example of an oblique bank there you can 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.079
 Do not take so much weight then 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.430
 her oblique bank as really takes all 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.590
 at the end for the last two sentences 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.270
 here again briefly tried the muscle 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.950
 to get used to it tries muscles around 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.740
 the ribbons around the lakes around 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.450
 form and one with many with me also 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.040
 were the first time too weak for that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.770
 I actually he could not 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.060
 take twenties and zucchini girls 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.619
 it is clear that if the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.600
 forearm or muscles too 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.010
 that is weak 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.150
 on the rhine that means first 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.490
 neutral handle or even per nation 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.989
 So palms down or 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.510
 even that was the case with the truck 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.150
 that we do not take reverse but 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.220
 that's what we take here with the girls 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.870
 I always do the goal I take now 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.920
 not here the fifties otherwise 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.140
 Of course you always enter at 50 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.580
 Concentration process is no we 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.739
 make hammer cologne really let 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.880
 the arm can do exactly the same thing here 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.780
 we also take rope down 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.150
 fix 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.700
 I say it again so hammer cross 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.209
 have seen there has traction too 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.220
 seen 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.110
 this handle seconds and the hammer 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.180
 curls if that is a connection now 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.709
 yes, you could be here too 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.110
 wonderful hammer handle all the way up 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.250
 bit apart and work here 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.390
 so you can still biceps 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.630
 train without necessarily this now 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.910
 to have pain and in the cities 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.290
 to board the Rhine plus a whole 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.640
 a bit under training at the end 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.350
 here twice two seats very fast 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.670
 under the cross and stock market and then comes 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.700
 to train us a bit 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.680
 but does not have to help ok so there is one 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.480
 Do not pay attention to this total 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.040
 so-called because some are not 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.329
 built 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.900
 you can train it on the first time on 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.190
 The End 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.720
 yes, by the end when the muscle 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.269
 already it barely weights her weight 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.010
 then could take the two three 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.049
 Do it again with the colts and 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.820
 then someday you will manage 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.170
 it as very first exercise had long 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.940
 to make kÃ¶lns with full 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.530
 weight without hurting her 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.420
 or something happens with injuries 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.850
 so at least Julian zietlow with me 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.170
 on the beach is ok people 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.459
 if you liked this clip then 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.019
 I'm going to subscribe to tubes 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.790
 set in the infobox in all links 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.130
 my social media channels and mine 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.840
 programs yes you have in general 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.400
 something like pain or as well 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.720
 I always have where I can help you 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.549
 can then write me that one in the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.530
 comments and I try a video 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.019
 to do it or you too 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.310
 answer on the channel itself 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.750
 so in the comments julian zietlow 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.750
 it is charged on the beach
