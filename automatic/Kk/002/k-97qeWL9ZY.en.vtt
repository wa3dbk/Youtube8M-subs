this 13 millimeter bolt here for the
battery<00:01:08.659> positive<00:01:09.579> then<00:01:10.579> we<00:01:10.700> have<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:10.850> 15

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.370 
millimeter bolt here and a 15 millimeter
bolt<00:01:14.600> down<00:01:14.869> there<00:01:19.689> got<00:01:20.689> my<00:01:20.719> socket<00:01:21.020> down<00:01:21.229> on

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
bolt down there got my socket down on

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.870 
bolt down there got my socket down on
the<00:01:21.439> hole<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.770> I'm<00:01:21.859> loosening<00:01:22.429> that<00:01:22.609> first

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
the hole and I'm loosening that first

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.919 
the hole and I'm loosening that first
bolt<00:01:23.149> now<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:23.840> hose<00:01:24.079> can<00:01:24.469> be<00:01:24.530> pretty<00:01:24.950> stiff

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
bolt now this hose can be pretty stiff

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.660 
bolt now this hose can be pretty stiff
over<00:01:26.929> time<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:27.439> you<00:01:27.499> have<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.649> work<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.159> or<00:01:28.549> if

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
over time so you have to work it or if

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.489 
over time so you have to work it or if
the<00:01:28.789> wrench<00:01:28.999> and<00:01:29.149> socket<00:01:29.389> or<00:01:30.079> work<00:01:30.289> should

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
the wrench and socket or work should

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:32.520 
the wrench and socket or work should
socket<00:01:30.950> through<00:01:31.069> there<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.219> little<00:01:31.340> bit<00:01:31.490> but

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
socket through there a little bit but

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.419 
socket through there a little bit but
little<00:01:33.530> effort<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.950> can<00:01:34.100> get<00:01:34.219> it<00:01:34.310> through

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
little effort you can get it through

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.510 
little effort you can get it through
there<00:01:34.609> and<00:01:34.789> then<00:01:35.119> loosen<00:01:35.329> up<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:35.630> bolt<00:01:36.520> and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
there and then loosen up this bolt and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.149 
there and then loosen up this bolt and
there's<00:01:38.389> out<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.719> socket<00:01:39.079> move<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.039> the

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
there's out the socket move to the

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:49.609 
there's out the socket move to the
second<00:01:40.490> one

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.889 

like<00:01:50.619> so<00:01:50.969> and<00:01:51.969> we'll<00:01:52.090> just<00:01:52.180> continue<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
like so and we'll just continue to the

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.709 
like so and we'll just continue to the
third<00:01:53.200> one<00:01:53.409> down<00:01:53.590> there<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> here's<00:01:58.570> the

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
third one down there so here's the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.779 
third one down there so here's the
alternator<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.259> see<00:01:59.350> it's<00:01:59.469> got<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.619> slot<00:01:59.950> so

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
alternator you see it's got a slot so

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.179 
alternator you see it's got a slot so
actually<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.270> tough<00:02:01.509> bolt<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:02.110> get<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:05.189> you

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
actually that tough bolt to get to you

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.460 
actually that tough bolt to get to you
don't<00:02:06.280> need<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.520> take<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.759> all<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.970> way<00:02:07.060> out

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
don't need to take it all the way out

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.830 
don't need to take it all the way out
maybe<00:02:08.470> three<00:02:08.679> or<00:02:08.709> four<00:02:08.830> turns<00:02:09.220> as<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> guess<00:02:09.840> be

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
maybe three or four turns as a guess be

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.110 
maybe three or four turns as a guess be
enough<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.290> slide<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.099> alternator<00:02:12.730> out<00:02:15.120> just

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
enough to slide the alternator out just

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.600 
enough to slide the alternator out just
use<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.299> screwdriver<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:17.530> get<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.190> connector

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
use a screwdriver to get this connector

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.500 
use a screwdriver to get this connector
off<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.970> back<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.360> alternator<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.510> we're

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
off the back of the alternator and we're

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.530 
off the back of the alternator and we're
good<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.720> go<00:02:23.910> here's<00:02:24.910> some<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.269> basic

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
good to go here's some of the basic

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.970 
good to go here's some of the basic
tools<00:02:25.690> I'll<00:02:25.959> be<00:02:25.989> using<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.500> remove<00:02:26.829> the

15 millimeter deep

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.990 
15 millimeter deep
I<00:02:32.079> have<00:02:32.590> medium<00:02:32.920> sockets<00:02:33.400> medium<00:02:33.790> deep

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
I have medium sockets medium deep

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.670 
I have medium sockets medium deep
sockets<00:02:34.420> I'll<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.630> using<00:02:34.750> those<00:02:34.989> probably<00:02:35.500> and

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
sockets I'll be using those probably and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.819

then<00:02:35.890> 13<00:02:36.459> millimeter<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.060> 15<00:02:37.360> millimeter

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
then 13 millimeter and 15 millimeter

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.430 
then 13 millimeter and 15 millimeter
wrenches<00:02:39.510> should<00:02:40.510> allow<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.930> get<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.260> job

done back on whatever they will be

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.490 
done back on whatever they will be
pretty<00:02:44.680> true<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:47.769> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
pretty true on it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.610 
pretty true on it
so<00:02:49.980> I'm<00:02:50.100> happy<00:02:50.310> with<00:02:50.550> it
