sure you hit like if you want to see
more<00:00:07.259> episodes<00:00:07.820> so<00:00:08.820> for<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.179> particular

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
more episodes so for this particular

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.970 
more episodes so for this particular
episode<00:00:09.630> we're<00:00:10.110> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:10.440> mostly<00:00:10.650> using

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
episode we're going to be mostly using

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.499 
episode we're going to be mostly using
the<00:00:11.040> Monza<00:00:11.370> circuit<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.150> see<00:00:12.269> that

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the Monza circuit as you can see that

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.180 
the Monza circuit as you can see that
and<00:00:12.780> also<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> need<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.980> turn<00:00:14.160> off

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and also going to need to turn off

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.450 
and also going to need to turn off
braking<00:00:14.700> assist<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.179> abs<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.680> braking<00:00:17.310> then

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
braking assist and abs so braking then

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.189 
braking assist and abs so braking then
it's<00:00:18.270> important<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.750> good<00:00:18.869> on<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:18.990> brake

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
it's important to be good on the brake

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.150 
it's important to be good on the brake
so<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.500> don't<00:00:19.680> lose<00:00:19.800> time<00:00:19.980> through

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
so you don't lose time through

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.769 
so you don't lose time through
inconsistency<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.330> also<00:00:21.420> gain<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
inconsistency and you can also gain a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.960 
inconsistency and you can also gain a
lot<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> time<00:00:22.289> under<00:00:22.529> braking<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:23.670> also<00:00:23.820> of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
lot of time under braking it's also of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.460 
lot of time under braking it's also of
course<00:00:24.000> very<00:00:24.390> important<00:00:24.750> for<00:00:24.840> overtaking<00:00:25.320> its

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
course very important for overtaking its

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.960 
course very important for overtaking its
most<00:00:25.680> moves<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:26.010> done<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.430> least<00:00:26.580> finished

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
most moves are done or at least finished

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.269 
most moves are done or at least finished
under<00:00:27.269> braking<00:00:27.439> first<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> look<00:00:29.160> at

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
under braking first up going to look at

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.820 
under braking first up going to look at
braking<00:00:29.550> setup<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.869> we've<00:00:31.170> got<00:00:31.320> three<00:00:31.529> options

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
braking setup so we've got three options

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
braking setup so we've got three options
here<00:00:31.890> balance<00:00:32.550> pressure<00:00:33.059> brakes<00:00:33.660> eyes

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
here balance pressure brakes eyes

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.959 
here balance pressure brakes eyes
they're<00:00:34.710> fairly<00:00:34.920> self-explanatory<00:00:35.280> but

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
they're fairly self-explanatory but

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.250 
they're fairly self-explanatory but
balance<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.570> where<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> braking<00:00:37.140> pressure

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
balance is where the braking pressure

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.650 
balance is where the braking pressure
will<00:00:37.500> go<00:00:37.710> front<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.219> rear<00:00:38.420> usually<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
will go front or rear usually want to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299 
will go front or rear usually want to
set<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> around<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.680> otherwise<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.190> can

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
set it around here as otherwise you can

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.770 
set it around here as otherwise you can
easily<00:00:41.520> lock<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:41.910> brakes<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.390> well<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.660> see

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
easily lock your brakes as well to see

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
easily lock your brakes as well to see
in<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.930> minute<00:00:43.219> pressure<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
in a minute pressure is just as it

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
in a minute pressure is just as it
sounds<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.480> how<00:00:45.600> much<00:00:45.750> pressure<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.260> put<00:00:46.289> on

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
sounds it's how much pressure we put on

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.990 
sounds it's how much pressure we put on
the<00:00:46.590> brakes<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.370> hilar<00:00:47.640> pressure

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the brakes the hilar pressure

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.970 
the brakes the hilar pressure
the<00:00:48.180> stronger<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> brakes<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> lot

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the stronger the brakes if you get a lot

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
the stronger the brakes if you get a lot
of<00:00:50.039> locking<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.460> high<00:00:50.610> pressure<00:00:50.879> set<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
of locking on high pressure set it a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.209 
of locking on high pressure set it a
little<00:00:51.629> lower

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
little lower

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.010 
little lower
brick<00:00:53.219> size<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> size<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> disks<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
brick size is the size of the disks the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.360 
brick size is the size of the disks the
bigger<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.680> more<00:00:55.770> effective<00:00:56.250> they

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
bigger they are the more effective they

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.830 
bigger they are the more effective they
are<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.059> does<00:00:57.210> mean<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> carry

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
are but it does mean you have to carry

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.119 
are but it does mean you have to carry
around<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> extra<00:00:58.469> weight<00:00:58.620> making<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
around the extra weight making you a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
around the extra weight making you a
little<00:00:59.190> bit<00:00:59.430> slower<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.789> corners<00:01:00.180> brick

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
little bit slower in the corners brick

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.630 
little bit slower in the corners brick
size<00:01:01.350> also<00:01:01.680> affects<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> calling<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
size also affects the calling so if you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.130 
size also affects the calling so if you
break<00:01:02.820> through<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.969> repeating<00:01:03.329> use<00:01:03.780> larger

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
break through a repeating use larger

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
break through a repeating use larger
discs<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.090> I'm<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
discs so here we go then I'm going to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
discs so here we go then I'm going to
try<00:01:06.570> doing<00:01:06.780> 60/40<00:01:07.619> balancing<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
try doing 60/40 balancing see so it's a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
try doing 60/40 balancing see so it's a
very<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.119> forward<00:01:09.570> balance<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.500> we're

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
very very forward balance and they we're

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.630 
very very forward balance and they we're
gonna<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:10.890> happens<00:01:11.100> ending<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> replay

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
gonna see what happens ending the replay

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.859 
gonna see what happens ending the replay
here<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.909> go<00:01:12.030> coming<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> corner<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.780> all

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
here we go coming to corner got all

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.450 
here we go coming to corner got all
locked<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.470> completely<00:01:14.100> missed<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
locked up and just completely missed the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.740 
locked up and just completely missed the
apex<00:01:14.520> he<00:01:14.790> goes<00:01:15.000> from<00:01:15.150> an<00:01:15.210> onboard<00:01:15.540> shot

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
apex he goes from an onboard shot

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.420 
apex he goes from an onboard shot
braking<00:01:16.380> nice<00:01:16.500> Nelly<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.920> now<00:01:17.159> just

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
braking nice Nelly and now just

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.800 
braking nice Nelly and now just
completely<00:01:17.759> locked<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.150> absolutely<00:01:18.390> no

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
completely locked up absolutely no

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.030 
completely locked up absolutely no
chance<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.200> making<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> corner<00:01:19.680> soo<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> be

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
chance of making the corner soo to be

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.289 
chance of making the corner soo to be
careful<00:01:20.400> how<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.549> set<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:20.790> balance<00:01:21.060> forward

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
careful how you set your balance forward

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
careful how you set your balance forward
and<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.590> rearward<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.280> once

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and now on to rearward then so once

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.070 
and now on to rearward then so once
again<00:01:23.580> we've<00:01:23.759> gone<00:01:23.820> 60/40<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.750> time<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
again we've gone 60/40 but this time to

coming<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> same<00:01:27.750> corner<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.170> go

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
coming to the same corner here we go

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.240 
coming to the same corner here we go

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
be careful how you set your brake

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.080 
be careful how you set your brake
balance<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.310> let's<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.700> how<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.850> should<00:01:39.000> be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
balance so let's see how it should be

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.580 
balance so let's see how it should be
done<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> see<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.290> we've<00:01:40.470> come

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
done then so as you see there we've come

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
done then so as you see there we've come
back<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.100> setup<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.670> used<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270

here<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.430> after<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.240> just

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
here just after it there we go just

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.420 
here just after it there we go just
after<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:51.750> there<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.350> straight<00:01:52.860> full

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
after there there we go so straight full

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
push the pedal any harder just to just

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.490 
push the pedal any harder just to just
up<00:01:57.210> go<00:01:57.299> down<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.600> third<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.930> second<00:01:58.200> gear<00:01:58.290> just

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
up go down to third and second gear just

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
up go down to third and second gear just
ease<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> brake<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.880> by<00:01:59.939> little

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
ease off the brake just little by little

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.429 
ease off the brake just little by little
and<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.329> more<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> slow<00:02:00.810> down<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> more<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
and the more you slow down the more you

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.959 
and the more you slow down the more you
easing<00:02:01.649> off<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> brakes<00:02:01.950> there<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.250> go<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
easing off the brakes there we go and I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.280 
easing off the brakes there we go and I
just<00:02:03.119> got<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.659> bit<00:02:03.840> me<00:02:03.960> entry<00:02:04.170> there

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
just got a little bit me entry there

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.359 
just got a little bit me entry there
actually<00:02:04.710> break<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.100> bit<00:02:05.250> too

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
actually break it a little bit too

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.870 
actually break it a little bit too
effectively<00:02:05.880> into<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.119> corner

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
effectively into that corner

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.120 
effectively into that corner
into<00:02:08.209> their<00:02:08.330> next<00:02:08.539> one<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:09.229> now<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
into their next one just now so the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.350 
into their next one just now so the
important<00:02:10.399> thing<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:10.700> easing<00:02:11.120> off<00:02:11.239> the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
important thing is so easing off the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.760 
important thing is so easing off the
brakes<00:02:11.540> towards<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.200> end<00:02:12.319> we'll<00:02:12.470> watch<00:02:12.590> that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
brakes towards the end we'll watch that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.070 
brakes towards the end we'll watch that
again<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.489> here<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:13.700> go<00:02:13.790> straight<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.569> full

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
again so here we go straight to full

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.600 
again so here we go straight to full
brake<00:02:15.290> sense<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:15.739> barely<00:02:16.160> any<00:02:16.250> delay<00:02:16.459> between

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
brake sense so barely any delay between

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.550 
brake sense so barely any delay between
the<00:02:16.790> two<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:17.420> absolute<00:02:17.959> full<00:02:18.110> brakes<00:02:18.290> together

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
the two on absolute full brakes together

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.660 
the two on absolute full brakes together
that's<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.769> third<00:02:18.980> or<00:02:19.130> second<00:02:19.310> gear<00:02:19.370> then<00:02:19.519> just

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
that's a third or second gear then just

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.559 
that's a third or second gear then just
start<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:19.970> then<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.360> see<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.540> just

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
start and then we can see it just

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.020 
start and then we can see it just
starting<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.440> ease<00:02:21.650> off<00:02:21.680> right<00:02:22.640> there<00:02:22.910> way

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
starting to ease off right there way

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.350 
starting to ease off right there way
down<00:02:23.269> until<00:02:23.599> you're<00:02:23.959> not<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.440> at<00:02:24.500> all<00:02:24.650> and

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
down until you're not on it at all and

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.490 
down until you're not on it at all and
that's<00:02:26.360> about<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.630> watch<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.080> now<00:02:27.200> at<00:02:27.319> full

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
that's about it watch that now at full

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.530 
that's about it watch that now at full
speed<00:02:27.739> then<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.069> here<00:02:28.220> we<00:02:28.340> go<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:29.239> happens<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
speed then so here we go so it happens a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.479 
speed then so here we go so it happens a
lot<00:02:29.569> faster<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:30.110> course<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.410> was<00:02:30.500> 25%<00:02:30.890> speed<00:02:31.310> and

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
lot faster of course I was 25% speed and

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.040 
lot faster of course I was 25% speed and
there<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.730> go<00:02:31.910> there<00:02:32.269> it<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.660> that's<00:02:32.810> how<00:02:32.930> it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
there we go there it is so that's how it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.080 
there we go there it is so that's how it
should<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.349> done<00:02:33.550> but<00:02:34.550> it's<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.760> always<00:02:34.849> quite

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
should be done but it's not always quite

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.309 
should be done but it's not always quite
so<00:02:35.209> easy<00:02:35.360> as<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.660> as<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.870> see<00:02:36.050> here<00:02:36.230> in

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
so easy as that as we see here in

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.930 
so easy as that as we see here in
Bahrain<00:02:36.650> massively<00:02:37.430> lock<00:02:37.670> on<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.910> inside

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
Bahrain massively lock on the inside

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.820 
Bahrain massively lock on the inside
wheel<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:38.840> about<00:02:39.019> mysimon<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.530> corner

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
wheel that just about mysimon the corner

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.680 
wheel that just about mysimon the corner
anyway<00:02:40.010> but<00:02:40.790> usually<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.209> would<00:02:41.330> push<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
anyway but usually that would push it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.479 
anyway but usually that would push it
quite<00:02:41.900> why<00:02:42.019> didn't<00:02:42.290> he<00:02:42.410> see<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.040> once<00:02:43.310> again

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
quite why didn't he see it once again

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.640 
quite why didn't he see it once again
here<00:02:43.670> from<00:02:43.790> onboard<00:02:44.030> shot<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.200> inside<00:02:45.560> wheel

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
here from onboard shot the inside wheel

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.930 
here from onboard shot the inside wheel
just<00:02:45.799> one<00:02:46.010> star<00:02:46.250> locks<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.549> she's<00:02:46.700> turning

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
just one star locks and she's turning

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.180 
just one star locks and she's turning
left<00:02:47.180> anyway<00:02:47.510> off<00:02:47.720> loaded<00:02:48.290> wheel<00:02:48.470> wants<00:02:49.010> to

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
left anyway off loaded wheel wants to

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.960 
left anyway off loaded wheel wants to
lock<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.549> there<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.790> goes

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
lock and there it goes

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.620 
lock and there it goes
so<00:02:50.630> let's<00:02:51.349> see<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:51.650> how<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.890> should<00:02:52.099> be<00:02:52.190> done

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
so let's see then how it should be done

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.479 
so let's see then how it should be done
from<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.720> super<00:02:54.170> slo-mo<00:02:54.410> onboard<00:02:54.890> shot<00:02:55.099> as<00:02:55.250> per

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
from a super slo-mo onboard shot as per

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.890 
from a super slo-mo onboard shot as per
so<00:02:55.940> once<00:02:56.209> again<00:02:56.390> we've<00:02:56.569> got<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.690> brake

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
so once again we've got a brake

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.150 
so once again we've got a brake
indicator<00:02:57.290> on<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.410> left<00:02:57.560> hand<00:02:57.739> side<00:02:57.890> there

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
indicator on the left hand side there

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.940 
indicator on the left hand side there
I've<00:02:58.519> clearly<00:02:59.060> just<00:02:59.239> cut<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.420> corner<00:02:59.690> there

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
I've clearly just cut a corner there

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
I've clearly just cut a corner there
because<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.099> warning<00:03:01.370> at<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.489> top<00:03:01.549> so

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
because of the warning at the top so

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.220 
because of the warning at the top so
here<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.209> go<00:03:02.329> then<00:03:02.510> gonna<00:03:02.870> come<00:03:03.019> onto<00:03:03.140> the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
here we go then gonna come onto the

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.720 
here we go then gonna come onto the
brakes<00:03:03.380> just<00:03:03.680> now<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:04.220> we<00:03:04.280> go<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.430> if<00:03:04.549> we<00:03:04.610> can

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
brakes just now here we go so if we can

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.190 
brakes just now here we go so if we can
quite<00:03:04.910> hard<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:05.180> not<00:03:05.269> quite<00:03:05.569> fully<00:03:05.870> easing

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
quite hard but not quite fully easing

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.110 
quite hard but not quite fully easing
off<00:03:06.290> very<00:03:06.590> early<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.610> it's<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.940> case<00:03:08.090> of

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
off very early so it's just a case of

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.809 
off very early so it's just a case of
Basie's<00:03:08.599> pushing<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.019> less<00:03:09.310> same<00:03:10.310> principle

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
Basie's pushing it less same principle

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.849 
Basie's pushing it less same principle
but<00:03:11.420> push<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.840> less<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.260> he's<00:03:12.350> off<00:03:12.530> earlier

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
but push it less and he's off earlier

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.970 
but push it less and he's off earlier
and<00:03:13.100> there<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.090> go<00:03:14.269> I'm<00:03:15.170> around<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.950> corner

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
and there we go I'm around the corner

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.039 
and there we go I'm around the corner
and<00:03:16.430> get<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.579> half<00:03:16.819> nice<00:03:17.000> nexus<00:03:17.420> well<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.630> said

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
and get a half nice nexus well I said

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.500 
and get a half nice nexus well I said
just<00:03:18.260> be<00:03:19.069> very<00:03:19.489> very<00:03:19.790> careful<00:03:20.000> on<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.299> brakes

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
just be very very careful on the brakes

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.150 
just be very very careful on the brakes
so<00:03:21.260> let's<00:03:21.410> have<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.530> look<00:03:21.650> at<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.829> full<00:03:21.980> speed

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
so let's have a look at a full speed

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.620 
so let's have a look at a full speed
version<00:03:22.370> now<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:22.819> obviously<00:03:23.000> all<00:03:23.239> happens<00:03:23.569> a

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
version now so obviously all happens a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.270 
version now so obviously all happens a
lot<00:03:23.810> faster<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:24.260> be<00:03:24.440> very<00:03:24.650> careful<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.130> brakes

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
lot faster so be very careful the brakes

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.280 
lot faster so be very careful the brakes
the<00:03:25.430> easing<00:03:25.700> off<00:03:25.790> very<00:03:26.030> early<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.959> getting

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the easing off very early and getting

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.129 
the easing off very early and getting
into<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.560> corner<00:03:27.709> just<00:03:28.310> nicely<00:03:28.690> however<00:03:29.690> what

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
into the corner just nicely however what

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.300 
into the corner just nicely however what
happens<00:03:30.380> when<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:30.590> do<00:03:30.739> not<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:31.040> be<00:03:31.130> always

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
happens when you do not to be always

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.530 
happens when you do not to be always
happens<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.609> the<00:03:31.730> best<00:03:31.819> of<00:03:31.940> us<00:03:32.000> look<00:03:32.209> here<00:03:32.389> look

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
happens to the best of us look here look

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.090 
happens to the best of us look here look
just<00:03:32.810> look<00:03:33.079> towards<00:03:33.200> coming<00:03:33.590> into<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.889> and

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
just look towards coming into that and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.400 
just look towards coming into that and
then<00:03:34.280> wind<00:03:34.489> up<00:03:34.579> running<00:03:34.700> very<00:03:35.030> wide<00:03:35.299> so<00:03:36.079> let's

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
then wind up running very wide so let's

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.750 
then wind up running very wide so let's
do<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.530> slimmer<00:03:36.859> version<00:03:36.889> of<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.250> exactly

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
do a slimmer version of that exactly

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.490 
do a slimmer version of that exactly
incident<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:38.959> I'm<00:03:39.019> gonna<00:03:39.109> come<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.380> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
incident then so I'm gonna come to the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.809 
incident then so I'm gonna come to the
corner<00:03:39.620> once<00:03:39.829> again<00:03:40.040> breaking<00:03:40.280> our<00:03:40.519> normal

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
corner once again breaking our normal

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.420 
corner once again breaking our normal
point<00:03:41.049> just<00:03:42.049> after<00:03:42.350> this<00:03:42.440> line<00:03:42.650> here<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.190> to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
point just after this line here so on to

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.340 
point just after this line here so on to
watch<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.730> front<00:03:44.090> right<00:03:44.420> tyre<00:03:44.840> here<00:03:45.109> so<00:03:45.260> we

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
watch the front right tyre here so we

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.930 
watch the front right tyre here so we
succumb<00:03:45.590> braking<00:03:46.010> no<00:03:46.160> locking<00:03:46.519> just<00:03:46.730> yet

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
succumb braking no locking just yet

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.610 
succumb braking no locking just yet
we'll<00:03:47.569> get<00:03:47.720> in<00:03:47.870> just<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.139> moment<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:48.380> was<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.500> bit

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
we'll get in just a moment I was a bit

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.379 
we'll get in just a moment I was a bit
too<00:03:48.799> keen<00:03:49.010> with<00:03:49.220> roll<00:03:49.430> with<00:03:49.819> a<00:03:49.880> break<00:03:50.030> rather<00:03:50.209> -

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
too keen with roll with a break rather -

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.370 
too keen with roll with a break rather -
trying<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.569> get<00:03:50.660> slowed<00:03:50.870> down<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.170> we<00:03:51.230> should

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
trying to get slowed down and we should

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.500 
trying to get slowed down and we should
lock<00:03:51.590> any<00:03:51.799> second<00:03:52.310> now<00:03:52.340> there<00:03:53.030> we<00:03:53.180> go<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:53.389> got

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
lock any second now there we go so got

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.729 
lock any second now there we go so got
it<00:03:53.600> locked<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:53.959> watch<00:03:54.290> now<00:03:54.440> Alex<00:03:54.680> was

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
it locked and watch now Alex was

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.160 
it locked and watch now Alex was
starting<00:03:55.280> to<00:03:55.400> spin<00:03:55.670> little<00:03:56.299> by<00:03:56.510> little<00:03:56.780> just<00:03:56.930> a

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
starting to spin little by little just a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.240 
starting to spin little by little just a
little<00:03:57.290> bit<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.620> keep<00:03:57.739> stopping<00:03:58.010> and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
little bit so I keep stopping and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.470 
little bit so I keep stopping and
starting<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.579> should<00:03:58.760> see<00:03:58.940> wheel<00:03:59.150> from<00:03:59.329> one

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
starting you should see wheel from one

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.569 
starting you should see wheel from one
job<00:03:59.660> just<00:03:59.900> as<00:03:59.989> well<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.350> allows<00:04:00.889> me<00:04:01.100> suggest

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
job just as well that allows me suggest

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.699 
job just as well that allows me suggest
about<00:04:01.940> make<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.269> corner<00:04:02.569> look<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.590> course

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
about make the corner look so of course

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.900 
about make the corner look so of course
in<00:04:03.859> someone<00:04:04.040> like<00:04:04.069> Monaco<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.549> could<00:04:04.730> stop

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
in someone like Monaco that could stop

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.250 
in someone like Monaco that could stop
you<00:04:04.940> from<00:04:05.030> going<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.540> wall<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:05.989> in<00:04:06.139> this

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
you from going to the wall so in this

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.240 
you from going to the wall so in this
particular<00:04:06.470> track<00:04:06.709> wouldn't<00:04:06.980> matter<00:04:07.069> if<00:04:07.160> I

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
particular track wouldn't matter if I

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.449 
particular track wouldn't matter if I
ran<00:04:07.400> wide<00:04:07.579> but<00:04:08.510> how<00:04:08.989> I<00:04:09.019> did<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.349> if<00:04:09.560> we<00:04:09.650> start

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
ran wide but how I did that if we start

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.770 
ran wide but how I did that if we start
again<00:04:10.579> now<00:04:10.849> look<00:04:11.269> on<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:11.450> left-hand<00:04:11.750> side

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
again now look on the left-hand side

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.030 
again now look on the left-hand side
once<00:04:12.019> again<00:04:12.109> so<00:04:12.349> look<00:04:12.500> at<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.650> brake<00:04:12.859> this

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
once again so look at the brake this

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.720 
once again so look at the brake this
time<00:04:13.250> though<00:04:13.370> look

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
time though look

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.999 
time though look
so<00:04:14.000> once<00:04:14.389> again<00:04:14.480> fall<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.380> start<00:04:15.680> easing

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
so once again fall and I start easing

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.590 
so once again fall and I start easing
off<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.310> locked<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.669> wheel<00:04:16.790> so<00:04:16.970> he's<00:04:17.180> right<00:04:17.419> off

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
off I locked the wheel so he's right off

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.949 
off I locked the wheel so he's right off
back<00:04:17.930> on<00:04:18.139> off<00:04:18.650> on<00:04:18.859> off<00:04:19.340> on<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:20.720> I'm

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
back on off on off on so I'm

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.300 
back on off on off on so I'm
just<00:04:21.109> trying<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.739> stop<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.039> wheel<00:04:22.160> from

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
just trying to stop the wheel from

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.460 
just trying to stop the wheel from
locking<00:04:22.580> just<00:04:22.759> a<00:04:22.850> little<00:04:23.060> bit<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.389> it<00:04:24.199> didn't

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
locking just a little bit and it didn't

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.390 
locking just a little bit and it didn't
really<00:04:24.530> help<00:04:24.680> in<00:04:24.830> that<00:04:24.889> instance<00:04:25.250> but

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
really help in that instance but

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.350 
really help in that instance but
sometimes<00:04:25.729> that<00:04:25.850> can<00:04:25.970> stop<00:04:26.180> people<00:04:26.330> from

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
sometimes that can stop people from

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.700 
sometimes that can stop people from
locking<00:04:26.720> all<00:04:26.870> together<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.350> give<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.560> your

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
locking all together and give you your

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.140 
locking all together and give you your
full<00:04:27.889> of<00:04:28.009> brake<00:04:28.340> effectiveness<00:04:28.970> back

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
full of brake effectiveness back

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.640 
full of brake effectiveness back
particular<00:04:29.690> happens<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.139> early<00:04:30.410> part<00:04:30.620> of

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
particular happens in the early part of

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.070 
particular happens in the early part of
the<00:04:30.740> braking<00:04:31.130> so<00:04:32.030> here<00:04:32.479> we<00:04:32.539> go<00:04:32.630> this<00:04:32.780> gonna<00:04:32.960> be

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
the braking so here we go this gonna be

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.080 
the braking so here we go this gonna be
the<00:04:33.169> four<00:04:33.319> speed<00:04:33.590> version<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.190> yep<00:04:34.819> look<00:04:35.000> at

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
the four speed version so yep look at

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.820 
the four speed version so yep look at
that<00:04:35.210> locking<00:04:35.569> the<00:04:35.630> heavily<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.319> just<00:04:36.740> to

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
that locking the heavily and just to

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.140 
that locking the heavily and just to
help<00:04:36.919> -<00:04:37.099> make<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.370> corn<00:04:37.580> out<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:37.789> there<00:04:37.880> we<00:04:38.030> go

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
help - make the corn out and there we go

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.999 
help - make the corn out and there we go
and<00:04:38.360> for<00:04:39.020> those<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.139> that<00:04:39.440> using<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.770> manual

and for those you that using a manual

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.830 
and for those you that using a manual
gearbox<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.789> will<00:04:41.090> give<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.360> hint

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
gearbox I will give you a hint

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.779 
gearbox I will give you a hint
so<00:04:42.289> you<00:04:42.590> see<00:04:42.770> here<00:04:42.949> I'm<00:04:43.039> gonna<00:04:43.130> shift<00:04:43.340> um<00:04:43.490> very

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
so you see here I'm gonna shift um very

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.189 
so you see here I'm gonna shift um very
aggressively<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:44.479> very<00:04:44.750> much<00:04:44.900> in<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.080> rev

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
aggressively so very much in the rev

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.210 
aggressively so very much in the rev
limiter<00:04:45.440> most<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:45.949> braking<00:04:46.190> zone

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
limiter most of the braking zone

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.040 
limiter most of the braking zone
absolutely<00:04:47.210> full<00:04:47.330> on<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.449> brakes<00:04:47.660> just<00:04:47.840> for<00:04:48.020> a

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
absolutely full on the brakes just for a

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.659 
absolutely full on the brakes just for a
fair<00:04:48.229> test<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:48.650> here<00:04:48.740> we<00:04:48.830> go<00:04:48.919> just<00:04:49.370> gets<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
fair test and here we go just gets the

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:50.830 
fair test and here we go just gets the
edge<00:04:49.789> of<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.030> ashtray<00:04:50.300> definite<00:04:50.569> left-hand

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
edge of the ashtray definite left-hand

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.659 
edge of the ashtray definite left-hand
side<00:04:50.960> there<00:04:51.169> same<00:04:51.680> thing<00:04:51.710> but<00:04:52.009> not<00:04:52.250> shift<00:04:52.520> down

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
side there same thing but not shift down

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.730 
side there same thing but not shift down
at<00:04:52.880> all<00:04:53.090> lock<00:04:53.509> the<00:04:53.630> wheels<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.930> same<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.530> run

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
at all lock the wheels the same and run

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.290 
at all lock the wheels the same and run
a<00:04:54.770> lot<00:04:55.250> lot<00:04:55.729> further

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
a lot lot further

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.120 
a lot lot further
so<00:04:57.020> we'll<00:04:57.199> go<00:04:57.289> three<00:04:57.440> like<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.710> then<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:57.919> just

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
so we'll go three like and then so just

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.189 
so we'll go three like and then so just
shifting<00:04:58.430> down<00:04:58.660> heard<00:04:59.660> of<00:04:59.750> there's<00:04:59.900> just<00:05:00.050> now

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
shifting down heard of there's just now

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.650 
shifting down heard of there's just now
very<00:05:00.560> very<00:05:00.949> aggressively<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:02.150> order<00:05:02.389> to<00:05:02.509> slow

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
very very aggressively in order to slow

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.790 
very very aggressively in order to slow
it<00:05:02.750> down<00:05:02.780> low<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.050> probably<00:05:03.470> make<00:05:03.560> sure<00:05:03.680> you

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
it down low it probably make sure you

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.320 
it down low it probably make sure you
break<00:05:04.009> probably<00:05:04.460> about<00:05:04.789> a<00:05:04.820> meter<00:05:05.060> or<00:05:05.210> two

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
break probably about a meter or two
