of people they intend to just take a
break<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.429> just<00:01:20.639> completely

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
break you become kind of completely

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.559 
break you become kind of completely
detached<00:01:26.460> from<00:01:26.609> things<00:01:26.969> once<00:01:27.299> you're<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.539> of

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.149 
detached from things once you're out of
the<00:01:27.749> loop<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.109> stuff<00:01:28.319> and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.889> you<00:01:28.979> lose

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the loop and stuff and then you lose

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.349 
the loop and stuff and then you lose
interest<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:29.789> you<00:01:29.909> don't<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.149> have

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
interest and then you don't really have

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:31.969 
interest and then you don't really have
much<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.539> a<00:01:30.719> reason<00:01:30.899> to<00:01:31.079> return<00:01:31.289> but<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
much of a reason to return but I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
much of a reason to return but I
certainly<00:01:32.399> have<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.609> reason<00:01:32.969> to<00:01:33.030> return<00:01:33.149> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
certainly have a reason to return to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270 
certainly have a reason to return to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.419 
enjoy this commentary and anyway I'll
get<00:01:43.380> into<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> gameplay<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.100> quick<00:01:44.280> moment

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
get into the gameplay for a quick moment

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.129 
get into the gameplay for a quick moment
because<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.090> definitely<00:01:45.329> deserves<00:01:45.959> some

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
because it definitely deserves some

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.080 
because it definitely deserves some
recognition<00:01:46.289> this<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> from<00:01:47.399> carnage<00:01:47.850> mush

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
recognition this is from carnage mush

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.580 
recognition this is from carnage mush
and<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.539> reason<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.020> deserves<00:01:49.439> recognition

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and the reason it deserves recognition

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260 
and the reason it deserves recognition
is<00:01:50.069> because<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.700> such<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> unique

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
is because it's just such a unique

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.330 
is because it's just such a unique
gameplay<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.139> jump<00:01:52.590> shot<00:01:52.799> only<00:01:53.159> come

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
gameplay it's a jump shot only come

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.309 
gameplay it's a jump shot only come
straight<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.759> mean<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.359> you<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.659> about<00:01:54.929> it<00:01:55.109> it

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
straight I mean if you think about it it

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.260 
straight I mean if you think about it it
seems<00:01:55.499> simple<00:01:55.829> enough<00:01:55.889> but<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.969> actually

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
seems simple enough but this is actually

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
seems simple enough but this is actually
pretty<00:01:57.450> difficult<00:01:57.689> because<00:01:58.109> if<00:01:58.499> you<00:01:58.889> think

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
pretty difficult because if you think

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.919 
pretty difficult because if you think
about<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.369> guys<00:01:59.609> when<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.270> jump<00:02:00.539> shouting<00:02:00.840> in

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
about it guys when your jump shouting in

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.959 
about it guys when your jump shouting in
a<00:02:01.020> game<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.279> it<00:02:02.429> when<00:02:02.639> you<00:02:02.729> actually

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
a game if you do it when you actually

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.760 
a game if you do it when you actually
shouldn't<00:02:03.539> be<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.289> jump<00:02:04.560> shot<00:02:04.740> at

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
shouldn't be like if you jump shot at

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.559 
shouldn't be like if you jump shot at
the<00:02:04.920> wrong<00:02:05.189> moment<00:02:05.429> it<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:06.179> screws<00:02:06.389> you

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
the wrong moment it really screws you

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.809 
the wrong moment it really screws you
over<00:02:06.599> because<00:02:06.929> you<00:02:07.170> can't<00:02:07.380> strafe<00:02:07.709> you<00:02:08.280> can't

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
over because you can't strafe you can't

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.020 
over because you can't strafe you can't
go<00:02:09.119> down<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.660> cover<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.730> jump

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
go down for cover so you know jump

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.400 
go down for cover so you know jump
shotting<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.450> something<00:02:12.750> that's<00:02:12.900> meant<00:02:13.200> only

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
shotting is something that's meant only

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
shotting is something that's meant only
for<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.040> times<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.550> instinctively<00:02:14.910> use

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
for the times when you instinctively use

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.000 
for the times when you instinctively use
it<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.840> when<00:02:15.960> you're<00:02:16.080> using<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.620> every

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it so when you're using it for every

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.200 
it so when you're using it for every
kill<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.310> really<00:02:17.580> makes<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.910> lot<00:02:18.000> trickier

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
kill that really makes it a lot trickier

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.980 
kill that really makes it a lot trickier
and<00:02:18.540> also

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
and also

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.420 
and also
I think<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.410> know<00:02:19.530> its<00:02:19.710> unique<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.220> for<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
I think you know its unique just for the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.980 
I think you know its unique just for the
fact<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:20.910> such<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> such<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.570> creative

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
fact that it's such a such a creative

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.140

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
gameplay is that it's a jump shot only

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.940 
gameplay is that it's a jump shot only
kem<00:02:41.880> strike<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.540> one<00:02:42.930> kill<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.740> jump

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
kem strike but one kill was not a jump
