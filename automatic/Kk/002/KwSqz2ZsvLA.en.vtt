00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
hey there welcome to cg nuggets here we

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.320 
hey there welcome to cg nuggets here we
are<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.450> February<00:00:13.049> 2011<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.150> we're<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.269> to

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
are in February 2011 and we're going to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.900 
are in February 2011 and we're going to
continue<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.310> anatomy<00:00:17.760> work

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
continue on with the the anatomy work

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.779 
continue on with the the anatomy work
we've<00:00:18.150> been<00:00:18.300> working<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> today<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.670> will

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
we've been working on so today we will

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.689 
we've been working on so today we will
be<00:00:20.820> discussing<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:22.080> head<00:00:22.460> since<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.580> are

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
be discussing the head since we are

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.910 
be discussing the head since we are
using<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.630> kind<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> basis<00:00:25.650> for

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
using it for kind of the basis for

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.220 
using it for kind of the basis for
measuring<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.640> rest<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> body<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.510> figure

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
measuring the rest of the body I figure

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
measuring the rest of the body I figure
it'd<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:28.619> topic<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.519> go<00:00:29.730> into<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.210> far

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
it'd be a good topic to go into as far

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.370 
it'd be a good topic to go into as far
as<00:00:30.539> breaking<00:00:30.779> down<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> head<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.980> unit<00:00:32.669> so

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
as breaking down the head as a unit so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.430 
as breaking down the head as a unit so
we'll<00:00:34.380> look<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.890> some<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:36.290> different<00:00:37.290> head

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
we'll look at some just different head

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.709 
we'll look at some just different head
types<00:00:37.910> different<00:00:38.910> kinds<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.390> things<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> think

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
types different kinds of things to think

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.209 
types different kinds of things to think
about<00:00:39.930> when<00:00:40.260> we're<00:00:40.410> modeling<00:00:40.680> ahead<00:00:41.010> or

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
about when we're modeling ahead or

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.549 
about when we're modeling ahead or
sculpting<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> head<00:00:41.879> where<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.780> comes<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
sculpting a head where it comes with the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.400 
sculpting a head where it comes with the
skull<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.280> muscles<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> stuff

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
skull the muscles and I like it stuff

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.440 
skull the muscles and I like it stuff
won't<00:00:46.620> get<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> medical<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.180> everything

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
won't get to medical with it everything

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600 
won't get to medical with it everything
like<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:48.960> technical<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.739> will<00:00:49.920> look

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
like that or technical but we will look

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
like that or technical but we will look
at<00:00:50.730> things<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.300> pertinent<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.960> making<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
at things that are pertinent to making a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.910 
at things that are pertinent to making a
good<00:00:53.340> start<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.300> ahead<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.870> i<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.800> as

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
good start on ahead and i will get as

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.549 
good start on ahead and i will get as
far<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.809> getting<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.079> sculpt

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559

head alright I'm hit the s key make my
brush<00:01:19.740> size<00:01:19.770> smaller<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.479> going

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
brush size smaller and we're just going

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.380 
brush size smaller and we're just going
to<00:01:21.659> start<00:01:21.840> sketching<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:23.460> boning<00:01:23.790> bony

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to start sketching in the boning bony

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.350 
to start sketching in the boning bony
areas<00:01:24.810> we're<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:25.290> into<00:01:26.360> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
areas we're going to put into this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
areas we're going to put into this
zygomatic<00:01:28.320> orbital<00:01:29.040> bone<00:01:29.869> but<00:01:30.890> just<00:01:31.890> wraps

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
zygomatic orbital bone but just wraps

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.350 
zygomatic orbital bone but just wraps
around<00:01:32.310> where<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> eyeballs<00:01:33.329> should<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.720> held

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
around where the eyeballs should be held

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
around where the eyeballs should be held
everything<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.509> real<00:01:36.659> rough<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
everything is real rough right now and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.380 
everything is real rough right now and
we're<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.430> point<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.880> towards<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> ear

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
we're going to point it towards the ear

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.890 
we're going to point it towards the ear
which<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> where<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.960> eventually<00:01:40.400> tapers<00:01:41.400> out

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.480 

there's<00:01:47.500> what<00:01:47.710> happens<00:01:47.950> if<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.130> take<00:01:48.250> out<00:01:48.400> the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
there's what happens if you take out the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.300 
there's what happens if you take out the
nose<00:01:49.290> let's<00:01:50.290> see<00:01:50.470> what<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.710> card<00:01:50.920> without<00:01:51.190> the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
nose let's see what the card without the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.160 
nose let's see what the card without the
cartilage<00:01:51.700> but<00:01:52.540> we're<00:01:52.840> not<00:01:52.930> gonna<00:01:53.020> do<00:01:53.140> that

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
cartilage but we're not gonna do that

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.630 
cartilage but we're not gonna do that
since<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.530> already<00:01:53.620> got<00:01:53.830> them<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.340> model

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
since you already got them the model

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.830 
since you already got them the model
kind<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.090> set<00:01:55.510> up<00:01:55.600> for<00:01:55.840> fri<00:01:56.230> nose<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.630> not

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
kind of set up for fri nose just not

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.290 
kind of set up for fri nose just not
getting<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.110> good<00:02:04.350> flow<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:06.070> bone<00:02:06.300> we're

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
getting a good flow of the bone we're

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.880 
getting a good flow of the bone we're
going<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.510> add<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.690> little<00:02:07.840> ridges<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.440> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
going to add the little ridges on the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.370 
going to add the little ridges on the
forehead<00:02:09.520> part<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.570> on<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> frontal<00:02:11.170> part

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
forehead part of the on the frontal part

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.970 
forehead part of the on the frontal part
of<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.500> skull<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.290> suggestion<00:02:14.680> where<00:02:14.920> it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
of the skull just a suggestion where it

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.500 
of the skull just a suggestion where it
goes<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.460> mean<00:02:15.580> look<00:02:15.760> at<00:02:15.850> smooth<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.300> little

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
goes I mean look at smooth that little

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.480 
goes I mean look at smooth that little
bit<00:02:16.600> later<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.080> gives<00:02:17.350> us<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.560> good<00:02:17.710> start

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
bit later on this gives us a good start

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.710 
bit later on this gives us a good start
I<00:02:20.520> am<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.760> forehead<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> little

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
I am for the forehead it's like a little

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.640 
I am for the forehead it's like a little
bit<00:02:23.050> too<00:02:23.950> much<00:02:24.810> smooth<00:02:25.810> out<00:02:26.020> there<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.410> we<00:02:26.500> need

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
bit too much smooth out there so we need

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.050 
bit too much smooth out there so we need
to<00:02:26.740> adjust<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.160> shape<00:02:27.400> i'm<00:02:27.670> going<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.940> use<00:02:28.030> a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
to adjust the shape i'm going to use a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.520 
to adjust the shape i'm going to use a
move<00:02:28.300> brush<00:02:28.570> for<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.870> instead<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.320> clay

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
move brush for that instead of the clay

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.710 
move brush for that instead of the clay
build<00:02:30.070> up<00:02:30.220> because<00:02:30.520> it's<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.150> gets<00:02:31.390> us<00:02:31.570> there

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
build up because it's a it gets us there

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.120 
build up because it's a it gets us there
a<00:02:31.780> lot<00:02:31.930> faster<00:02:32.790> since<00:02:33.790> we're<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:33.970> lower<00:02:34.630> poly

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
a lot faster since we're in lower poly

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.770 
a lot faster since we're in lower poly
form<00:02:36.130> lower<00:02:36.400> resolution<00:02:37.090> we<00:02:37.390> should<00:02:37.600> be<00:02:37.720> able

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
form lower resolution we should be able

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.750 
form lower resolution we should be able
to<00:02:37.900> push<00:02:38.530> things<00:02:38.740> around<00:02:39.040> with<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> move<00:02:39.490> brush

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
to push things around with a move brush

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.630 
to push things around with a move brush
and<00:02:40.209> have<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.140> little<00:02:42.010> bit<00:02:42.100> more<00:02:42.220> success<00:02:42.610> with

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
and have a little bit more success with

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.140 
and have a little bit more success with
that<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.120> get<00:02:43.270> faster<00:02:44.260> results<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.790> macro

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
that and get faster results on the macro

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:55.220 
that and get faster results on the macro
level<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:50.290> change<00:02:50.560> them<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.800> nose<00:02:53.459> shape

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
level and change them the nose shape

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.060 
level and change them the nose shape
just<00:02:56.230> make<00:02:56.410> sure<00:02:56.440> i'm<00:02:56.620> going<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.800> spin<00:02:56.980> my

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
just make sure i'm going to spin my

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.770 
just make sure i'm going to spin my
model<00:02:57.340> around<00:02:57.580> make<00:02:57.760> sure<00:02:57.790> things<00:02:58.239> good<00:02:58.660> on

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
model around make sure things good on

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.900 
model around make sure things good on
each<00:02:59.310> area<00:03:02.310> let's<00:03:03.310> go<00:03:03.400> ahead<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:03.640> bring<00:03:03.730> in

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
each area let's go ahead and bring in

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.449 
each area let's go ahead and bring in
that<00:03:04.060> jawbone<00:03:04.360> back<00:03:04.780> that's<00:03:05.440> cut<00:03:06.190> lost

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
that jawbone back that's cut lost

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.430 
that jawbone back that's cut lost
earlier<00:03:06.880> when<00:03:07.000> we<00:03:07.030> smooth<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.480> out<00:03:07.570> give<00:03:08.290> him

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
earlier when we smooth that out give him

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.040 
earlier when we smooth that out give him
a<00:03:08.470> bit<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.920> more<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.340> structure<00:03:09.640> there<00:03:10.050> and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
a bit of a more of a structure there and

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.810 
a bit of a more of a structure there and
I<00:03:11.320> will<00:03:11.470> just<00:03:11.500> kind<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.890> smooth<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.550> out<00:03:12.610> as<00:03:12.760> we

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
I will just kind of smooth it out as we

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.390 
I will just kind of smooth it out as we
go<00:03:13.110> it's<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.350> big<00:03:14.590> chunk<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:14.980> I'll<00:03:15.100> smooth

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
go it's to a big chunk and I'll smooth

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.680 
go it's to a big chunk and I'll smooth
it<00:03:15.489> just<00:03:15.670> like<00:03:15.790> you're<00:03:15.940> doing<00:03:15.970> regulars<00:03:16.420> you

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
it just like you're doing regulars you

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.309 
it just like you're doing regulars you
know<00:03:16.900> traditional<00:03:17.650> sculpting

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.229 

all<00:03:22.129> right<00:03:22.310> she's<00:03:22.489> got<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.700> bit<00:03:22.879> more<00:03:22.999> of<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> nice

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
all right she's got a bit more of a nice

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.199 
all right she's got a bit more of a nice
mandible<00:03:23.719> going<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.909> we'll<00:03:25.909> just<00:03:25.999> continue

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
mandible going and we'll just continue

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.629 
mandible going and we'll just continue
to<00:03:26.450> start<00:03:26.810> building<00:03:27.139> up<00:03:27.260> more<00:03:28.129> of<00:03:28.189> the<00:03:28.310> rest<00:03:28.519> of

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
to start building up more of the rest of

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.009 
to start building up more of the rest of
the<00:03:28.730> face<00:03:28.879> here<00:03:31.239> we<00:03:32.239> need<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.420> check<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.719> shape

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
the face here we need to check the shape

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.009 
the face here we need to check the shape
of<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.409> via<00:03:34.129> the<00:03:34.340> mouth<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:35.269> lips<00:03:35.480> here<00:03:35.810> it's

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
of the via the mouth the lips here it's

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.280 
of the via the mouth the lips here it's
looking<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.560> little<00:03:36.939> boring<00:03:37.939> so<00:03:38.750> I'm<00:03:39.079> going<00:03:39.109> to

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
looking a little boring so I'm going to

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.839 
looking a little boring so I'm going to
we<00:03:39.889> don't<00:03:40.040> want<00:03:40.159> it<00:03:40.219> to<00:03:40.280> be<00:03:40.400> like<00:03:40.579> just<00:03:40.700> a

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
we don't want it to be like just a

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.220 
we don't want it to be like just a
straight<00:03:41.150> across<00:03:41.359> thing<00:03:41.780> we<00:03:41.959> need<00:03:42.079> to

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
straight across thing we need to

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.929 
straight across thing we need to
actually<00:03:42.379> have<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.799> little<00:03:43.099> bit<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.519> shape<00:03:43.760> to

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
actually have a little bit of a shape to

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.729 
actually have a little bit of a shape to
it<00:03:43.969> so<00:03:44.870> that's<00:03:44.989> what<00:03:45.079> we're<00:03:45.170> going<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.349> go<00:03:45.500> for

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
it so that's what we're going to go for

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.879 
it so that's what we're going to go for
here<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.129> a<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:47.450> know<00:03:47.569> an<00:03:47.959> indication<00:03:48.439> of<00:03:48.650> some

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
here is a you know an indication of some

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.309 
here is a you know an indication of some
must<00:03:49.639> you<00:03:50.299> know<00:03:50.389> or<00:03:50.480> some<00:03:50.629> form<00:03:50.989> underneath

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
must you know or some form underneath

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.970 
must you know or some form underneath
there<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:52.209> little<00:03:53.209> shape<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.840> mouth<00:03:56.980> so

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
there a little shape to the mouth so

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.589 
there a little shape to the mouth so
we'll<00:03:58.069> just<00:03:58.189> kind<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.370> move<00:03:58.549> some<00:03:58.730> stuff<00:03:59.449> into

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
we'll just kind of move some stuff into

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.949 
we'll just kind of move some stuff into
spot<00:04:00.109> to<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.919> right<00:04:01.069> spot<00:04:01.780> we're<00:04:02.780> going<00:04:02.900> to

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
spot to the right spot we're going to

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.020 
spot to the right spot we're going to
need<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.169> little<00:04:03.260> bit<00:04:03.409> more<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:05.000> know

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
need a little bit more you know

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.759 
need a little bit more you know
subdivision<00:04:05.599> later<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.169> really<00:04:06.409> make<00:04:06.590> this

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
subdivision later on to really make this

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.619 
subdivision later on to really make this
impacting<00:04:08.859> but<00:04:09.859> general<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:11.299> want<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.540> give

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
impacting but general just want to give

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.580 
impacting but general just want to give
a<00:04:11.659> little<00:04:11.930> bit<00:04:12.139> of<00:04:12.199> shape<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.250> slip<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:15.290> makes

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
a little bit of shape to slip that makes

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.640 
a little bit of shape to slip that makes
a<00:04:15.650> little<00:04:15.709> bit<00:04:15.889> more<00:04:17.109> aesthetic<00:04:18.549> sense

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.499 

because<00:04:24.220> once<00:04:24.400> we<00:04:24.430> subdivide<00:04:24.910> this<00:04:25.060> it's<00:04:25.300> just

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
because once we subdivide this it's just

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.600 
because once we subdivide this it's just
