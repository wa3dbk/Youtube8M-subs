gives five points of adjustability that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.930 
gives five points of adjustability that
way<00:00:57.839> I<00:00:57.869> can<00:00:58.080> just<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.159> move<00:00:59.220> it<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.909> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
way I can just kind of move it to a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
way I can just kind of move it to a
height<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.540> comfortable<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.320> yet<00:01:01.559> at

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.929 
the same time isn't so low that that
will<00:01:03.960> ever<00:01:03.989> happen<00:01:04.290> again<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:07.189> I<00:01:08.189> got<00:01:08.880> a

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
wanna try to up to normal riding I'm at

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.650 
wanna try to up to normal riding I'm at
the<00:05:13.760> 4th<00:05:15.280> adjustment<00:05:16.280> here<00:05:16.580> so<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.270> second

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
the 4th adjustment here so the second

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.600 
the 4th adjustment here so the second
lowest<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:18.020> can<00:05:18.050> possibly<00:05:18.500> get<00:05:18.710> I'm<00:05:19.310> at<00:05:19.490> least

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
lowest you can possibly get I'm at least

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.159 
lowest you can possibly get I'm at least
gonna<00:05:19.789> try<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.060> move<00:05:20.210> it<00:05:20.360> up<00:05:20.419> -<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.660> see<00:05:21.020> where

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
gonna try to move it up - and see where

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.469 
gonna try to move it up - and see where
that<00:05:21.260> goes<00:05:21.530> okay<00:05:21.889> so<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:22.940> bike<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.210> currently

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
that goes okay so the bike is currently

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.600 
that goes okay so the bike is currently
up<00:05:23.660> at<00:05:23.840> stock<00:05:24.050> height<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.620> like<00:05:25.039> it<00:05:25.250> where<00:05:25.370> it's

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
up at stock height I like it where it's

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.730 
up at stock height I like it where it's
at<00:05:25.850> so<00:05:26.120> what<00:05:26.570> I'm<00:05:26.660> gonna<00:05:26.780> do<00:05:26.960> now<00:05:27.110> is<00:05:27.410> that<00:05:27.680> I'm

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
at so what I'm gonna do now is that I'm

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.219 
at so what I'm gonna do now is that I'm
gonna<00:05:27.860> tighten<00:05:28.100> it<00:05:28.250> down<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.820> specs<00:05:29.150> that's<00:05:29.870> 40

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
gonna tighten it down to specs that's 40

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.450 
gonna tighten it down to specs that's 40
foot<00:05:31.030> 44<00:05:32.139> foot-pound<00:05:33.139> of<00:05:33.200> torque<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:33.710> then

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
foot 44 foot-pound of torque and then

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.529

here but uh tighten down to 44 pounds 44
foot-pounds<00:05:49.099> of<00:05:49.130> torque<00:05:49.190> and<00:05:49.700> should<00:05:50.450> be<00:05:50.539> good

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
foot-pounds of torque and should be good

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.820 
foot-pounds of torque and should be good
and<00:05:52.210> adjustment<00:05:53.260> what's<00:05:54.260> up<00:05:54.349> first<00:05:54.560> notch
