00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
could die down really soon even though

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
could die down really soon even though
the<00:00:50.880> price<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.079> particular<00:00:52.200> car<00:00:52.559> went

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
I kind of feel like they're going to be

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.969 
I kind of feel like they're going to be
in<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.799> disadvantage<00:01:08.340> later<00:01:09.020> every<00:01:10.020> day<00:01:10.229> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
in a disadvantage later every day this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.139 
in a disadvantage later every day this
format<00:01:11.459> can<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.329> will<00:01:12.630> probably<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.909> hurts<00:01:14.909> on

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
format can and will probably be hurts on

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.419 
format can and will probably be hurts on
by<00:01:15.329> macro<00:01:15.779> cosmos<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:18.829> most<00:01:19.829> decks<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.279> play

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
by macro cosmos but most decks can play

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.090 
by macro cosmos but most decks can play
around<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.060> unlike<00:01:21.869> before<00:01:22.499> my<00:01:22.920> mac

the deck a lot faster but now you can't
really<00:07:13.300> run<00:07:13.479> gold<00:07:13.720> start<00:07:13.990> because<00:07:14.229> it's<00:07:14.350> too

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
really run gold start because it's too

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.310 
really run gold start because it's too
slow<00:07:14.770> an<00:07:15.100> opponent<00:07:15.790> can<00:07:15.880> wipe<00:07:16.450> you<00:07:16.690> out<00:07:16.930> in

slow an opponent can wipe you out in

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.480

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.940 
like two turns take you in the game too
so<00:07:21.490> I'd<00:07:22.479> much<00:07:22.780> rather<00:07:22.810> just<00:07:23.669> grind<00:07:24.669> it<00:07:24.850> out<00:07:25.000> and

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:25.950 
so I'd much rather just grind it out and

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.320 
so I'd much rather just grind it out and
beat<00:07:26.950> them<00:07:27.100> with<00:07:27.280> a<00:07:27.310> beat<00:07:27.820> with<00:07:27.940> the<00:07:28.000> trapline

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330
