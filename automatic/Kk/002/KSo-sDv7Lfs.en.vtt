 it's called the band broadcast cut and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.690
 is about the relationship that the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.840
 concierge and the guy in the lobby of a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.230

 if they are older than 17 if they were not 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.230
 patients and if they have the opportunity to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.059
 see it in the movies do it in Mexico it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.059
 they are projecting in different cities 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 as part of the 56 sample 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.260

 invisible and is about a teenager 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.039
 unpopular that abruptly turns 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.680
 popular when the student council of 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.600
 your school confuses an accident with a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150
