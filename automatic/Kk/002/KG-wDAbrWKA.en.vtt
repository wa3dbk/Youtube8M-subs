exactly what they want to do and follow

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.299 
exactly what they want to do and follow
their<00:00:29.970> passions<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.260> instead<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.650> focusing<00:00:31.890> on

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
their passions so instead of focusing on

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.670 
their passions so instead of focusing on
the<00:00:32.489> danger<00:00:33.030> or<00:00:33.329> focusing<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.290> fact<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the danger or focusing on the fact that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.979 
the danger or focusing on the fact that
they<00:00:35.370> could<00:00:35.520> lose<00:00:35.670> their<00:00:35.850> lives<00:00:36.149> or<00:00:36.570> something

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
they could lose their lives or something

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170 
they could lose their lives or something
bad<00:00:37.110> could<00:00:37.410> happen<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:38.399> could<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.700> injured

bad could happen they could get injured

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.119 
bad could happen they could get injured
I<00:00:39.510> think<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.980> more<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:42.649> being<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.739> part<00:00:44.010> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
I think of it as more of being a part of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.709 
I think of it as more of being a part of
something<00:00:44.340> really<00:00:44.789> neat<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.239> getting<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
something really neat and getting to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.580 
something really neat and getting to
watch<00:00:45.870> someone<00:00:46.350> come<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.550> an<00:00:47.640> idea<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
watch someone come up with an idea that

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
watch someone come up with an idea that
didn't<00:00:49.590> previously<00:00:49.829> exist<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> Dean<00:00:51.960> such<00:00:52.230> an

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
didn't previously exist and Dean such an

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.439 
didn't previously exist and Dean such an
innovator<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.370> neat<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> watch<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
innovator and it's so neat to watch that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.040 
innovator and it's so neat to watch that
go<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.199> an<00:00:55.320> idea<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:57.050> actually

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
go from just an idea to actually

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.010 
go from just an idea to actually
something<00:00:59.010> physical<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.699> happens<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.719> he

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
something physical that happens that he

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.119 
something physical that happens that he
has<00:01:01.530> created<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:02.190> nothing<00:01:03.979> documents<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
has created from nothing documents it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
has created from nothing documents it
and<00:01:05.489> inspires<00:01:05.970> other<00:01:06.299> people<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.750> follow<00:01:07.140> him

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and he's done it again and again and so

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.950 
and he's done it again and again and so
instead<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> worrying<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:10.909> him<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
instead of worrying about him or them I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.140 
instead of worrying about him or them I
kind<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.590> view<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.610> much<00:01:14.760> more<00:01:14.939> positive

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
kind of view it in a much more positive

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.230
