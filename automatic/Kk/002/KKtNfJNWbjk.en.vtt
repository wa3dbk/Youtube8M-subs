over France and Italy yes and it's been

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.230 
over France and Italy yes and it's been
a<00:00:16.949> blast<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:17.340> we've<00:00:17.520> learned<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:17.850> much<00:00:18.000> too

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
a blast but we've learned so much too

a blast but we've learned so much too
and<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.810> thing<00:00:18.990> that's<00:00:19.140> become<00:00:19.199> really

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
and one thing that's become really

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.970 
and one thing that's become really
apparent<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.160> evolution<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.970> fpv<00:00:21.390> goggles

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
apparent is the evolution of fpv goggles

brother<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.130> started<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.550> off<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.910> goggles

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
brother you started this off and goggles

brother you started this off and goggles
were<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.630> visual<00:00:25.050> items<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.529> would<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
were just visual items that would be the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.920 
were just visual items that would be the
image<00:00:26.220> down<00:00:26.490> nothing<00:00:26.820> more<00:00:26.970> right<00:00:27.150> well<00:00:27.720> when

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
image down nothing more right well when

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.269 
image down nothing more right well when
I<00:00:27.960> started<00:00:28.080> their<00:00:28.590> work<00:00:28.769> there<00:00:28.980> were<00:00:29.099> other

I started their work there were other

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.919 
I started their work there were other
video<00:00:29.580> goggles<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.060> market<00:00:30.539> yeah<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
video goggles on the market yeah and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.319 
video goggles on the market yeah and
what<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> started<00:00:31.980> doing<00:00:32.040> playing<00:00:32.460> RC<00:00:32.850> vehicles

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
what I started doing playing RC vehicles

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.729 
what I started doing playing RC vehicles
and<00:00:33.510> stuff<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.870> try<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> put<00:00:34.559> systems

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and stuff and try to put systems

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.760 
and stuff and try to put systems
together<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> reliability<00:00:37.050> just

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
together and but the reliability just

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590 
together and but the reliability just
just<00:00:38.040> wasn't<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.760> transmit

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
just wasn't there it put transmit

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.940 
just wasn't there it put transmit

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
together headset and you lose your

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
together headset and you lose your
signal<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.640> finally<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.510> figured<00:00:42.750> out

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
signal and I finally just figured out

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.150 
signal and I finally just figured out
it's<00:00:42.989> got<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> better<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.890> started

know<00:01:28.770> where<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.340> were<00:01:29.430> fortunate<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> 5.8

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
know where we were fortunate the 5.8

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.780 
know where we were fortunate the 5.8
came<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:30.930> were<00:01:30.960> able<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.759> adapt<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
came out and we were able to adapt to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.789 
came out and we were able to adapt to
the<00:01:33.030> 2.4<00:01:33.509> gigahertz<00:01:33.689> radios<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.710> know

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the 2.4 gigahertz radios you know

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.899 
the 2.4 gigahertz radios you know
there's<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> lot<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.250> key<00:01:35.400> features<00:01:35.579> when

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
there's a lot of key features when

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.069 
there's a lot of key features when
someone<00:01:36.150> looks<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.360> goggle<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.930> want

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
someone looks for goggle that you want

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.140 
someone looks for goggle that you want
to<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:38.189> thing<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> field<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> can

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
to use and one thing is field of you can

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
to use and one thing is field of you can
explain<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.630> basically<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.920> your

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
explain what that is basically it's your

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.929 
explain what that is basically it's your
ear<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.240> relative<00:01:42.720> viewing<00:01:42.990> angle<00:01:43.320> yeah

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
ear up your relative viewing angle yeah

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
ear up your relative viewing angle yeah
the<00:01:44.939> higher<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.329> magnification<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.110> larger

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the higher your magnification the larger

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.950 
the higher your magnification the larger
the<00:01:46.829> screen<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.460> more<00:01:48.420> immersive<00:01:48.720> experience

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the screen and more immersive experience

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.520 
the screen and more immersive experience
is<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.060> you're<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> guy

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
is so you know if you're the kind of guy

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.719 
is so you know if you're the kind of guy
that<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:52.860> wants<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> feel<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.490> you're<00:01:53.640> in

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that really wants to feel like you're in

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.700 
that really wants to feel like you're in
the<00:01:53.790> plane<00:01:54.000> obviously<00:01:54.869> bigger<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.200> better<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the plane obviously bigger is better you

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.440 
the plane obviously bigger is better you
want<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:55.979> wide<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.340> possible<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:57.000> also<00:01:57.240> we

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
want as wide as possible because also we

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.850 
want as wide as possible because also we
fly<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.659> wide-angle<00:01:58.229> lenses<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
fly with wide-angle lenses and if you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.139 
fly with wide-angle lenses and if you
have<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> wide-angle<00:01:59.340> lens<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> narrow

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
have a wide-angle lens and a narrow

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
have a wide-angle lens and a narrow
field<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.479> view<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> lot<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> cinema

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
field of view like a lot of the cinema

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.830 
field of view like a lot of the cinema
goggles<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:03.030> lose<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.630> yeah

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
goggles do you lose a lot of that yeah

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.480 
goggles do you lose a lot of that yeah
then<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.710> trade-offs<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.280> course

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
then what are the trade-offs of course

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.399 
then what are the trade-offs of course
when<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.149> larger<00:02:06.479> field<00:02:06.509> view<00:02:07.229> you

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
when you go to a larger field view you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.139 
when you go to a larger field view you
have<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.680> use<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.920> higher<00:02:08.069> magnifications<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
have to use a higher magnifications the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.040 
have to use a higher magnifications the
optics<00:02:09.509> get<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:09.840> difficult

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
optics get more difficult

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.650 
optics get more difficult
and<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.740> course<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.220> also<00:02:12.790> get<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.570> know

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and of course you also get you know

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.750 
and of course you also get you know
wider<00:02:14.140> pixels<00:02:14.590> less<00:02:14.800> pixel<00:02:15.190> density<00:02:15.580> which

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
wider pixels less pixel density which

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.490 
wider pixels less pixel density which
kind<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> distracts<00:02:16.900> from<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:17.050> clarity

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
kind of distracts from your clarity

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.170 
kind of distracts from your clarity
another<00:02:18.310> thing<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.610> people<00:02:18.640> are<00:02:18.820> looking<00:02:18.970> at

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
another thing that people are looking at

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.790 
another thing that people are looking at
too<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.420> immersion<00:02:20.170> actually<00:02:20.500> came<00:02:20.620> out<00:02:20.710> with

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
too and immersion actually came out with

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.440 
too and immersion actually came out with
the<00:02:20.890> earliest<00:02:21.280> version<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:22.180> was<00:02:22.300> head

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the earliest version of this it was head

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.150 
the earliest version of this it was head
tracking<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.290> head<00:02:23.500> tracking<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:23.890> basically

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
tracking and head tracking is basically

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.440 
tracking and head tracking is basically
where<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.460> look<00:02:24.640> around<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.090> that's<00:02:25.240> come<00:02:25.420> a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
where you look around and that's come a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.970 
where you look around and that's come a
long<00:02:25.600> ways<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.960> now<00:02:26.080> has<00:02:26.260> certainly<00:02:26.830> and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
long ways to now has certainly and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.080 
long ways to now has certainly and
that's<00:02:27.100> actually<00:02:27.430> but<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.730> know<00:02:27.760> how<00:02:28.060> we

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
that's actually but you know how we

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.880 
that's actually but you know how we
immersion<00:02:28.840> our<00:02:28.930> senior<00:02:29.230> Fatshark<00:02:29.470> started

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
immersion our senior Fatshark started

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.320 
immersion our senior Fatshark started
working<00:02:30.130> together<00:02:30.220> was<00:02:30.610> was<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> head

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
working together was was on the head

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.420 
working together was was on the head
tracking<00:02:31.600> okay<00:02:32.170> now<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.040> got<00:02:33.190> them<00:02:33.400> to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
tracking okay now and I got them to

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.280 
tracking okay now and I got them to
start<00:02:33.880> working<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.210> his<00:02:34.360> system<00:02:34.660> Jim<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.110> that

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
start working on his system Jim and that

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.690 
start working on his system Jim and that
was<00:02:35.410> originally<00:02:35.740> just<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.920> simple<00:02:36.190> gyro<00:02:36.460> going

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
was originally just a simple gyro going

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.280 
was originally just a simple gyro going
left<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:36.970> right<00:02:37.060> correct<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.600> now<00:02:38.110> it's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
left and right correct and now it's

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.070 
left and right correct and now it's
immersed<00:02:38.560> into<00:02:38.770> what<00:02:39.190> Jiro's<00:02:40.080> accelerometers

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
immersed into what Jiro's accelerometers

stations<00:04:56.410> with<00:04:56.560> external<00:04:56.830> receivers<00:04:57.400> they

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
stations with external receivers they

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.160 
stations with external receivers they
don't<00:04:57.910> use<00:04:58.120> every<00:04:58.300> all<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.630> features<00:04:58.960> they

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
don't use every all the features they

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.840 
don't use every all the features they
just<00:04:59.470> want<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.650> pair<00:04:59.800> of<00:04:59.830> video<00:05:00.070> glasses<00:05:00.490> to

just want a pair of video glasses to

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.510 
just want a pair of video glasses to
view<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:01.660> this<00:05:01.990> allows<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.560> purchase<00:05:03.220> that

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520

later<00:05:05.980> should<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.460> want<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.910> add<00:05:06.970> head

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
later should you want to add head

with your receivers and the head
tracking<00:05:10.600> this<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.020> actually<00:05:11.410> something

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
tracking this is actually something

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.230 
tracking this is actually something
different<00:05:11.950> this<00:05:12.010> is<00:05:12.070> actually<00:05:12.430> 3<00:05:12.640> axis<00:05:13.030> gyro

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
different this is actually 3 axis gyro

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.880 
different this is actually 3 axis gyro
head<00:05:13.570> tracking<00:05:13.840> before<00:05:14.260> or<00:05:14.380> just<00:05:14.410> left<00:05:14.740> and

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
head tracking before or just left and

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.020 
head tracking before or just left and
right<00:05:15.010> then<00:05:15.190> it<00:05:15.280> was<00:05:15.310> left<00:05:15.550> right<00:05:15.730> up<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:15.910> down

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
right then it was left right up and down

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.300 
right then it was left right up and down
right<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.450> now<00:05:16.960> it's<00:05:17.170> 3<00:05:17.380> axis<00:05:17.770> where<00:05:17.980> you<00:05:18.160> have

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
right and now it's 3 axis where you have

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.130 
right and now it's 3 axis where you have
full<00:05:18.580> motion<00:05:18.820> so<00:05:19.510> you<00:05:19.570> can<00:05:19.690> tilt<00:05:19.810> your<00:05:19.990> head

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
full motion so you can tilt your head

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.990 
full motion so you can tilt your head
you<00:05:20.710> can<00:05:20.890> you<00:05:21.040> can<00:05:21.160> move<00:05:21.310> anyway<00:05:21.610> we<00:05:21.730> want<00:05:21.910> to

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
you can you can move anyway we want to

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.150 
you can you can move anyway we want to
set<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.240> back<00:05:22.330> well<00:05:22.750> yes<00:05:23.170> it's<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.620> 9<00:05:23.770> degree<00:05:24.040> of

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
set it back well yes it's a 9 degree of

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.610 
set it back well yes it's a 9 degree of
freedom<00:05:24.430> IMU<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.500> basically<00:05:26.500> what<00:05:26.590> that

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
freedom IMU and basically what that

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.140 
freedom IMU and basically what that
means<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:26.980> three<00:05:27.160> axes<00:05:27.490> for<00:05:27.700> each<00:05:27.850> mech

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
means it's three axes for each mech

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.240 
means it's three axes for each mech
domitor<00:05:28.540> and<00:05:28.780> accelerometer<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.680> gyro

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
domitor and accelerometer and the gyro

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.670 
domitor and accelerometer and the gyro
ok<00:05:30.640> and<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.600> third<00:05:31.780> axis<00:05:32.169> was<00:05:32.380> kind<00:05:32.650> of

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
ok and the third axis was kind of

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.080 
ok and the third axis was kind of
incidentally<00:05:33.340> there<00:05:33.669> was<00:05:33.760> a<00:05:33.790> whole<00:05:33.940> new

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
incidentally there was a whole new

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.630 
incidentally there was a whole new
paradigm<00:05:35.080> of<00:05:35.110> their<00:05:35.500> algorithms<00:05:36.250> used<00:05:36.520> to

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
paradigm of their algorithms used to

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.730 
paradigm of their algorithms used to
track<00:05:37.060> your<00:05:37.210> motion<00:05:37.570> before<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.320> was<00:05:38.440> you<00:05:38.650> know

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
track your motion before it was you know

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.230 
track your motion before it was you know
when<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:38.950> head<00:05:39.100> check<00:05:39.250> was<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.580> axis<00:05:39.940> against

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
when the head check was to axis against

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.490 
when the head check was to axis against
measure<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.690> actually<00:05:40.960> see<00:05:41.050> what<00:05:41.169> happens

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
measure to actually see what happens

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.530 
measure to actually see what happens
this<00:05:41.980> actually<00:05:42.400> kind<00:05:42.580> of<00:05:42.610> predicts<00:05:43.360> your

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
this actually kind of predicts your

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.030 
this actually kind of predicts your
vector<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.290> vector<00:05:44.440> that<00:05:44.710> you're<00:05:44.860> going<00:05:45.010> to

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
vector the vector that you're going to

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.150 
vector the vector that you're going to
go<00:05:45.220> go<00:05:45.730> in<00:05:45.910> so<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.570> makes<00:05:47.230> extremely<00:05:47.770> accurate

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
go go in so it makes extremely accurate

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.130 
go go in so it makes extremely accurate
it's<00:05:48.550> kind<00:05:48.820> of<00:05:48.850> a<00:05:48.940> passive<00:05:49.780> thing<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:49.960> don't

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
it's kind of a passive thing you don't

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
it's kind of a passive thing you don't
you<00:05:50.320> know<00:05:50.440> it's<00:05:50.530> nothing<00:05:50.620> you<00:05:50.770> can<00:05:50.890> really<00:05:50.919> put

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
you know it's nothing you can really put

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.590 
you know it's nothing you can really put
your<00:05:51.250> finger<00:05:51.400> on<00:05:51.550> yeah<00:05:51.910> but<00:05:52.210> when<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.390> get<00:05:52.480> up

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
your finger on yeah but when you get up

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.700 
your finger on yeah but when you get up
there<00:05:52.630> you<00:05:52.810> just<00:05:52.930> notice<00:05:53.290> that<00:05:53.380> everything<00:05:53.560> is

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
there you just notice that everything is

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.040 
there you just notice that everything is
so<00:05:54.100> natural<00:05:54.310> yeah<00:05:54.850> you're<00:05:55.450> not<00:05:55.600> locked<00:05:55.870> on

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
so natural yeah you're not locked on

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.840 
so natural yeah you're not locked on
this<00:05:56.169> pan<00:05:56.350> tilt<00:05:56.620> roll<00:05:56.860> what<00:05:57.580> it's<00:05:57.700> whatever

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
this pan tilt roll what it's whatever

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.440 
this pan tilt roll what it's whatever
you<00:05:58.060> do

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
you do

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.090 
you do
yeah<00:05:58.750> cameras<00:05:59.140> doing<00:05:59.290> as<00:05:59.470> well<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.830> you<00:05:59.890> kind

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
yeah cameras doing as well and you kind

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.470 
yeah cameras doing as well and you kind
of<00:06:00.130> forget<00:06:00.280> that<00:06:00.580> you're<00:06:00.700> using<00:06:00.910> a<00:06:01.150> head

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
of forget that you're using a head

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.180 
of forget that you're using a head
tracker<00:06:01.750> that's<00:06:02.320> smooth<00:06:02.500> we<00:06:02.890> did<00:06:03.010> much

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
tracker that's smooth we did much

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.030 
tracker that's smooth we did much
earlier<00:06:03.550> back<00:06:04.450> in<00:06:04.480> Columbus<00:06:05.350> Ohio<00:06:05.440> we<00:06:05.860> did<00:06:06.010> a

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
earlier back in Columbus Ohio we did a

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.710 
earlier back in Columbus Ohio we did a
head<00:06:06.220> tracking<00:06:06.460> episode<00:06:06.970> with<00:06:07.180> a<00:06:07.480> pair<00:06:07.690> of

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
head tracking episode with a pair of

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.890 
head tracking episode with a pair of
attitude<00:06:08.280> STS<00:06:09.280> and<00:06:09.490> it<00:06:09.850> was<00:06:09.940> amazing<00:06:10.210> but<00:06:10.690> the

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
attitude STS and it was amazing but the

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.210 
attitude STS and it was amazing but the
one<00:06:11.050> thing<00:06:11.260> that<00:06:11.290> we<00:06:11.530> noticed<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:11.950> stuff<00:06:12.070> it

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
one thing that we noticed and stuff it

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.010 
one thing that we noticed and stuff it
was<00:06:12.280> very<00:06:12.550> like<00:06:12.700> if<00:06:12.940> you<00:06:13.030> move<00:06:13.210> too<00:06:13.330> quickly<00:06:13.540> it

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
was very like if you move too quickly it

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.540 
was very like if you move too quickly it
would<00:06:14.140> jump<00:06:14.290> back<00:06:14.440> to<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:14.650> middle<00:06:14.919> this<00:06:15.400> is

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
would jump back to the middle this is

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.890 
would jump back to the middle this is
fixed<00:06:15.880> all<00:06:15.970> that<00:06:16.000> that<00:06:16.480> advanced<00:06:16.720> technology

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
fixed all that that advanced technology

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.480 
fixed all that that advanced technology
has<00:06:17.440> definitely<00:06:17.830> fixed<00:06:18.040> all<00:06:18.130> that<00:06:18.160> where<00:06:18.400> if

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
has definitely fixed all that where if

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.490 
has definitely fixed all that where if
you<00:06:18.580> go<00:06:18.730> quickly<00:06:19.240> it<00:06:19.419> follows<00:06:19.990> your<00:06:20.110> motions

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
you go quickly it follows your motions

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.570 
you go quickly it follows your motions
it<00:06:20.620> can<00:06:20.740> tell<00:06:20.919> what<00:06:21.070> you're<00:06:21.190> doing<00:06:21.400> it<00:06:21.550> doesn't

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
it can tell what you're doing it doesn't

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.640 
it can tell what you're doing it doesn't
freak<00:06:21.940> out<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:22.510> doesn't<00:06:22.720> trigger<00:06:23.080> that<00:06:23.260> you

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
freak out and doesn't trigger that you

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.780 
freak out and doesn't trigger that you
can't<00:06:23.860> trip<00:06:24.040> it<00:06:24.190> up<00:06:24.280> and<00:06:24.460> I<00:06:24.490> think<00:06:24.580> that's

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
can't trip it up and I think that's

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.530 
can't trip it up and I think that's
fantastic

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
fantastic

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.090 
fantastic
along<00:06:25.990> with<00:06:26.110> that<00:06:26.290> a<00:06:26.350> lot<00:06:26.560> of<00:06:26.650> people<00:06:26.830> are<00:06:26.919> find

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
along with that a lot of people are find

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.700 
along with that a lot of people are find
easier<00:06:27.460> HF<00:06:27.880> in<00:06:28.210> long-range<00:06:28.480> systems<00:06:29.020> now<00:06:29.530> that

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
easier HF in long-range systems now that

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.700 
easier HF in long-range systems now that
frees<00:06:29.890> up<00:06:30.040> that<00:06:30.160> 2.4<00:06:30.730> gig

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
frees up that 2.4 gig

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.530 
frees up that 2.4 gig
again<00:06:31.920> and<00:06:32.100> you<00:06:32.550> can<00:06:32.640> change<00:06:32.880> out<00:06:33.000> this<00:06:33.120> module

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
again and you can change out this module

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.640 
again and you can change out this module
now<00:06:33.630> so<00:06:33.810> if<00:06:33.870> you're<00:06:33.990> flying<00:06:34.140> a<00:06:34.290> long-range

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
now so if you're flying a long-range

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.350 
now so if you're flying a long-range
system<00:06:35.070> you<00:06:35.160> can<00:06:35.280> go<00:06:35.340> to<00:06:35.400> 2.4<00:06:35.910> which<00:06:36.090> gives<00:06:36.300> you

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
system you can go to 2.4 which gives you

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.630 
system you can go to 2.4 which gives you
far<00:06:36.570> better<00:06:36.840> distance<00:06:37.830> doesn't<00:06:37.980> it<00:06:38.160> so<00:06:38.490> if<00:06:38.580> you

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
far better distance doesn't it so if you

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.860 
far better distance doesn't it so if you
want<00:06:38.790> to<00:06:38.850> fly<00:06:38.970> a<00:06:39.000> little<00:06:39.270> bit<00:06:39.360> further

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
want to fly a little bit further

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.620 
want to fly a little bit further
use<00:06:40.350> your<00:06:40.530> UHF<00:06:41.010> drop<00:06:41.610> that<00:06:41.760> in<00:06:41.940> yeah<00:06:42.420> now<00:06:42.600> I

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
use your UHF drop that in yeah now I

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.790 
use your UHF drop that in yeah now I
wouldn't<00:06:42.990> suggest<00:06:43.110> that<00:06:43.380> we<00:06:43.560> were<00:06:43.650> flying

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
wouldn't suggest that we were flying

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.650 
wouldn't suggest that we were flying
earlier<00:06:44.160> with<00:06:44.370> patch<00:06:44.580> antennas<00:06:44.940> 45.8<00:06:45.510> they're

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
earlier with patch antennas 45.8 they're

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.850 
earlier with patch antennas 45.8 they're
nice<00:06:45.780> and<00:06:45.810> compact<00:06:46.290> I<00:06:46.410> wouldn't<00:06:46.710> suggest

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
nice and compact I wouldn't suggest

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.700 
nice and compact I wouldn't suggest
doing<00:06:47.310> a<00:06:48.030> 2.4<00:06:48.690> patch<00:06:48.900> on<00:06:49.140> your<00:06:49.170> on<00:06:49.470> your<00:06:49.500> guy

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
doing a 2.4 patch on your on your guy

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.270 
doing a 2.4 patch on your on your guy
but<00:06:49.890> no<00:06:50.160> but<00:06:50.280> I've<00:06:50.400> got<00:06:50.730> to<00:06:50.910> point<00:06:51.120> for<00:06:51.450> Omni

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
but no but I've got to point for Omni

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.740 
but no but I've got to point for Omni
circular<00:06:53.280> polarizers<00:06:53.570> absolutely<00:06:54.570> lovely

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
circular polarizers absolutely lovely

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.690 
circular polarizers absolutely lovely
and<00:06:54.960> now<00:06:55.170> I<00:06:55.200> get<00:06:55.470> you<00:06:55.590> about<00:06:55.770> 1<00:06:55.920> 5<00:06:56.250> kilometer

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
and now I get you about 1 5 kilometer

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.160 
and now I get you about 1 5 kilometer
that's<00:06:56.940> my<00:06:57.120> problem<00:06:57.330> what<00:06:57.750> it<00:06:57.840> does<00:06:57.990> it<00:06:58.140> just

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
that's my problem what it does it just

that's my problem what it does it just
gives<00:06:58.590> you<00:06:58.680> so<00:06:58.860> much<00:06:58.950> freedom<00:06:59.310> you<00:06:59.430> can<00:06:59.550> fly

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
gives you so much freedom you can fly

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.370 
gives you so much freedom you can fly
around<00:07:00.060> buildings<00:07:00.600> you<00:07:00.690> can<00:07:00.840> do<00:07:00.990> you<00:07:01.350> know

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
around buildings you can do you know

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.680 
around buildings you can do you know
invert<00:07:01.740> it<00:07:01.860> don't<00:07:02.760> get<00:07:02.850> great<00:07:03.030> pass<00:07:03.240> slow<00:07:03.510> it's

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
invert it don't get great pass slow it's

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.400 
invert it don't get great pass slow it's
fun<00:07:03.870> to<00:07:03.960> fly<00:07:04.110> way
