dammed at this point one of my
inspirations<00:00:43.750> was<00:00:44.380> getting<00:00:44.920> curious<00:00:45.250> about

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
inspirations was getting curious about

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.490 
inspirations was getting curious about
some<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:45.970> these<00:00:46.090> big<00:00:46.480> rivers<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:47.140> are<00:00:47.260> still

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
some of these big rivers that are still

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.229 
some of these big rivers that are still
free-flowing<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:48.160> are<00:00:48.250> left<00:00:48.430> on<00:00:48.550> our<00:00:48.670> planet

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
free-flowing that are left on our planet

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.660 
free-flowing that are left on our planet
and<00:00:49.450> I<00:00:49.720> came<00:00:49.930> across<00:00:50.079> this<00:00:50.440> list<00:00:50.800> of<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.399> ten

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
and I came across this list of the ten

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.729 
and I came across this list of the ten
longest<00:00:52.149> free-flowing<00:00:52.600> rivers<00:00:52.930> that<00:00:53.500> still

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
longest free-flowing rivers that still

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.650 
longest free-flowing rivers that still
existed<00:00:54.160> on<00:00:54.280> our<00:00:54.399> planet<00:00:54.640> but<00:00:55.120> there<00:00:55.300> was<00:00:55.420> one

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
existed on our planet but there was one

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.210 
existed on our planet but there was one
name<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.230> I<00:00:56.260> had<00:00:56.410> never<00:00:56.710> heard<00:00:56.950> of<00:00:57.070> before

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
name that I had never heard of before

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.250 
name that I had never heard of before
and<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:58.120> was<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.300> AMA<00:00:58.570> River

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
and it was the AMA River

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.490 
and it was the AMA River
this<00:00:59.890> place<00:01:00.160> has<00:01:00.430> leopards<00:01:01.079> Tigers<00:01:02.079> still

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
this place has leopards Tigers still

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.100 
this place has leopards Tigers still
there<00:01:02.770> it<00:01:02.980> has<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.700> largest<00:01:04.089> salmon<00:01:04.479> fish<00:01:04.899> in

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
there it has the largest salmon fish in

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.139 
there it has the largest salmon fish in
the<00:01:05.229> world<00:01:05.439> not<00:01:06.040> only<00:01:06.280> that<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.700> had<00:01:06.880> not<00:01:07.090> a

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
the world not only that it had not a

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.510 
the world not only that it had not a
single<00:01:07.600> dam<00:01:08.020> on<00:01:08.290> its<00:01:08.440> entire<00:01:08.799> length<00:01:09.130> so<00:01:09.400> this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
single dam on its entire length so this

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.940 
single dam on its entire length so this
river<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:10.000> almost<00:01:10.229> 3,000<00:01:11.229> miles<00:01:11.380> long<00:01:11.680> and

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
river is almost 3,000 miles long and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.890 
river is almost 3,000 miles long and
that<00:01:12.580> would<00:01:12.729> be<00:01:12.850> like<00:01:13.030> paddling<00:01:13.540> from<00:01:13.780> New

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
that would be like paddling from New

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.960 
that would be like paddling from New
York<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.409> San<00:01:14.560> Francisco<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.370> not<00:01:15.610> saying<00:01:15.850> a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
York to San Francisco and not saying a

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.660 
York to San Francisco and not saying a
single<00:01:16.000> dam<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:17.229> then<00:01:17.620> not<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:18.010> mention<00:01:18.220> it

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
single dam and then not to mention it

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.910 
single dam and then not to mention it
started<00:01:19.570> in<00:01:19.659> this<00:01:19.780> incredible<00:01:20.470> part<00:01:20.710> of

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
started in this incredible part of

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.609 
started in this incredible part of
Mongolia<00:01:21.460> in<00:01:22.330> this<00:01:22.630> wild<00:01:22.930> wild<00:01:23.200> part<00:01:23.560> of

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
Mongolia in this wild wild part of

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.560 
Mongolia in this wild wild part of
northern<00:01:23.890> Mongolia<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.610> then<00:01:24.970> traversed<00:01:25.330> all

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
northern Mongolia and then traversed all

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.289 
northern Mongolia and then traversed all
the<00:01:26.170> way<00:01:26.320> through<00:01:26.860> southern<00:01:27.190> Siberia<00:01:27.820> through

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
the way through southern Siberia through

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.270 
the way through southern Siberia through
some<00:01:28.540> incredibly<00:01:29.020> wild<00:01:29.350> country<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:30.159> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
some incredibly wild country to the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.580 
some incredibly wild country to the
Pacific<00:01:30.700> Ocean

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
Pacific Ocean

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.740 
Pacific Ocean
so<00:01:32.590> with<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.760> all<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:34.510> information

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
so with that and all of that information

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.210 
so with that and all of that information
that<00:01:35.020> we<00:01:35.140> gathered<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.680> nobodies<00:01:36.040> River

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
that we gathered the nobodies River

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.969 
that we gathered the nobodies River
project<00:01:36.610> was<00:01:36.790> born<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.720> concept<00:01:38.229> became<00:01:38.560> to

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
project was born the concept became to

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.280 
project was born the concept became to
travel<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.549> length<00:01:39.760> of<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.030> AMA<00:01:40.210> River<00:01:40.540> by

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
travel the length of the AMA River by

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.050 
travel the length of the AMA River by
whatever<00:01:41.560> means<00:01:41.860> we<00:01:42.010> could<00:01:42.280> from<00:01:42.670> its

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
whatever means we could from its

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.120 
whatever means we could from its
Mongolian<00:01:43.720> headwaters<00:01:44.380> all<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.830> way<00:01:44.920> through

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
Mongolian headwaters all the way through

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.950 
Mongolian headwaters all the way through
southern<00:01:45.430> Siberia<00:01:46.030> along<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.630> border<00:01:46.930> of

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
southern Siberia along the border of

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.050 
southern Siberia along the border of
China<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:47.439> Russia<00:01:47.619> out<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.670> Pacific

China and Russia out to the Pacific

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.499 
China and Russia out to the Pacific
Ocean<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.470> this<00:01:51.009> is<00:01:51.220> our<00:01:51.400> team<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.909> wild<00:01:52.060> women

Ocean so this is our team of wild women

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.140 
Ocean so this is our team of wild women
that<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:52.930> slowly<00:01:53.320> assembled<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.820> one<00:01:54.970> with

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
that I slowly assembled and the one with

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.850
