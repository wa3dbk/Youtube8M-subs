continental<00:02:32.780> knitter<00:02:32.990> unless<00:02:33.380> I'm<00:02:33.560> doing

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
continental knitter unless I'm doing

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.270 
continental knitter unless I'm doing
color<00:02:34.040> work<00:02:34.370> then<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.240> make<00:02:35.690> use<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:35.959> both<00:02:36.350> so

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
color work then I make use of both so

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.920 
color work then I make use of both so
now<00:02:37.490> I've<00:02:37.790> reached<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.209> point<00:02:38.450> again<00:02:38.570> in<00:02:38.810> my

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
now I've reached the point again in my

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.330 
now I've reached the point again in my
pattern<00:02:39.380> where<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.510> tells<00:02:41.510> me<00:02:41.840> with<00:02:42.500> yarn<00:02:43.070> and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
pattern where it tells me with yarn and

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.120 
pattern where it tells me with yarn and
back<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.480> because<00:02:45.410> we've<00:02:45.560> been<00:02:45.709> doing<00:02:45.980> knit

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
back and because we've been doing knit

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.690 
back and because we've been doing knit
stitches<00:02:46.459> our<00:02:47.000> yarns<00:02:47.360> already<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.080> back

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
stitches our yarns already in the back

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.470 
stitches our yarns already in the back
so<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:50.030> get<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.660> go<00:02:50.810> ahead<00:02:51.790> do<00:02:52.790> what<00:02:53.000> my<00:02:53.120> pattern

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
so I get to go ahead do what my pattern

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.240 
so I get to go ahead do what my pattern
tells<00:02:53.690> me<00:02:53.930> after<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.380> says<00:02:54.560> with<00:02:54.770> yarn<00:02:55.040> back

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
tells me after it says with yarn back

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.020 
tells me after it says with yarn back
and<00:02:55.640> then<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.660> move<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:58.340> now<00:02:58.489> I'll<00:02:58.610> just<00:02:58.730> go

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
and then I move on so now I'll just go

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.460 
and then I move on so now I'll just go
ahead<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.820> keep<00:03:02.030> working<00:03:02.300> my<00:03:02.540> pattern<00:03:03.110> until

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
ahead and keep working my pattern until

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.690 
ahead and keep working my pattern until
I<00:03:03.770> reach<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.340> next<00:03:04.550> section<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:07.190> am<00:03:07.370> going

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
I reach the next section and I am going

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.740 
I reach the next section and I am going
to<00:03:12.280> pretend<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:14.209> know<00:03:14.300> I'll<00:03:14.360> just<00:03:14.420> go<00:03:14.630> back

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
to pretend you know I'll just go back

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.690 
to pretend you know I'll just go back
and<00:03:14.959> fix<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.260> later<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:16.610> my<00:03:17.270> pattern<00:03:17.750> said

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
and fix this later that my pattern said

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.289 
and fix this later that my pattern said
to<00:03:19.700> purl<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.540> stitch<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:26.120> I've

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
to purl this stitch so now that I've

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.220 
to purl this stitch so now that I've
done<00:03:26.330> that<00:03:26.769> my<00:03:27.769> yarn<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.280> in<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.580> front<00:03:29.110> but<00:03:30.110> my

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
done that my yarn is in the front but my

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.800 
done that my yarn is in the front but my
pattern<00:03:30.650> now<00:03:30.769> says<00:03:31.070> with<00:03:31.310> yarn<00:03:31.610> back<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.690> I'm

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
pattern now says with yarn back so I'm

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.430 
pattern now says with yarn back so I'm
gonna<00:03:32.870> bring<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.530> back<00:03:35.230> slip<00:03:36.230> two

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440
