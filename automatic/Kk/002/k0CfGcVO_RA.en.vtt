00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.060
 it is very strange but they do or the experience in asia is a few years 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.260
 in the tenth round of games a couple of this band was through it earlier that day 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.160
 very strange it also sounds earlier I may have a little no without 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.649
 sponsoring 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:16.119
 the question was of course too 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.550
 fritz korbach to provide the desired shock effect 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.009
 in any case it is marco van basts at ajax with a cross 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.710
 how deep through the dust 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 nicely on the bar 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.710
 Ajax received the lead 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.000
 disappointment for korbach and a boost 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.400
 trainer louis van gaal 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.330
 marco van basta's cross everyone knew feyenoords i didn't like it 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.030
 give way 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.330
 hereby through the ghost kingdom from as little frank rich 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 provides a 0 for the Amsterdammers 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 from neighbors then 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.730
 March that had a nice evening 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.630
 do you want pale skin 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.630
 It says litmans were ready 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.550
 the holes come to believe 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.240
 scoring van gaal 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 ball on the bar of litmans 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 who was much faster than his opponent 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.060
 in April left Monday on the edge of the penalty area 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.600
 but he shoots beside 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.350
 the top scorer from ajax 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.350
 the ten goals 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 no moons 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 up the beautiful ball 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 free stupid mass he blew 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.590
 mass position 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.430
 beautiful ball of joyce and it is 2 0 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.650
 via marc overmars 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.650
 the second goal of this season 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.769
 greyoord and there is 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.629
 certainly three people are seasonally hit 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.019
 jari litmanes 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.099
 and then of course the competition is over 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.099
 in the final phase, cambuur tries to give something back 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.999
 yahoo stream 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.479
 the street has come into the field for aprons 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.479
 the aging population 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.809
 and fritz korbach
