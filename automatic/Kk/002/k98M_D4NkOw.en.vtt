problems associated with aging so I

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.620 
problems associated with aging so I
think<00:00:27.000> go<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.150> two<00:00:30.449> layer

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
think go for it so this is a two layer

think go for it so this is a two layer
technique<00:00:31.080> i'm<00:00:31.289> doing<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.619> i'm<00:00:31.859> using<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
technique i'm doing here i'm using a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.990 
technique i'm doing here i'm using a
stain<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.899> once<00:00:34.230> you've<00:00:34.440> done<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:35.000> then

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
stain and once you've done that then

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.690 
stain and once you've done that then
apply<00:00:36.420> gloss<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> top<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.579> what

the<00:00:52.660> problem<00:00:53.110> with<00:00:53.350> red<00:00:54.010> lipstick<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:54.580> the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
the problem with red lipstick is the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.400 
the problem with red lipstick is the
first<00:00:54.910> time<00:00:55.090> we<00:00:55.150> have<00:00:55.240> a<00:00:55.300> cup<00:00:55.450> of<00:00:55.570> coffee<00:00:55.750> the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
first time we have a cup of coffee the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.220 
first time we have a cup of coffee the
whole<00:00:56.560> thing<00:00:56.800> comes<00:00:57.040> off<00:00:57.190> on<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.400> cup<00:00:58.080> so<00:00:59.080> by

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
whole thing comes off on the cup so by

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.620 
whole thing comes off on the cup so by
just<00:00:59.290> applying<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:00.190> using<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.760> lip<00:01:00.940> brush<00:01:01.090> and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
just applying it using a lip brush and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.930 
just applying it using a lip brush and
by<00:01:02.170> working<00:01:02.470> it<00:01:02.770> in<00:01:02.920> more<00:01:03.160> it's<00:01:03.520> gonna<00:01:03.700> last

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
by working it in more it's gonna last

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.810 
by working it in more it's gonna last
much<00:01:04.150> longer

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
much longer

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.550 
much longer
but<00:01:06.820> I'm<00:01:07.090> here<00:01:07.180> only<00:01:07.330> for<00:01:07.600> teas<00:01:07.840> you're<00:01:08.170> losing

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
but I'm here only for teas you're losing

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.230 
but I'm here only for teas you're losing
a<00:01:08.620> little<00:01:08.920> bit<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.160> plumpness<00:01:09.610> from<00:01:09.910> your<00:01:10.030> lips

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
a little bit of plumpness from your lips

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.120 
a little bit of plumpness from your lips
naturally<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:11.140> sometimes<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.890> could<00:01:11.979> have

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
naturally and sometimes you could have

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.270 
naturally and sometimes you could have
some<00:01:12.490> fine<00:01:12.760> lines<00:01:13.090> coming<00:01:13.540> around<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.840> lips

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
some fine lines coming around the lips

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.490 
some fine lines coming around the lips
strong<00:01:15.280> bright<00:01:15.820> colors<00:01:16.300> can<00:01:16.810> make<00:01:16.990> lips<00:01:17.260> look

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
strong bright colors can make lips look

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.540 
strong bright colors can make lips look
thinner<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:18.550> best<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.210> avoid<00:01:19.300> them<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:21.340> best

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
thinner so best to avoid them the best

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.490 
thinner so best to avoid them the best
approach<00:01:21.940> I<00:01:22.210> think<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.810> use<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:23.080> lip<00:01:23.320> stain

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
approach I think is to use a lip stain

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.100 
approach I think is to use a lip stain
so<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.190> really<00:01:24.430> allows<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:25.119> natural<00:01:25.630> texture

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
so it really allows the natural texture

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.630 
so it really allows the natural texture
of<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.290> lips<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.710> show<00:01:26.890> through<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:27.490> it's<00:01:27.610> a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
of the lips to show through so it's a

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.430 
of the lips to show through so it's a
little<00:01:27.910> bit<00:01:28.000> more<00:01:28.180> forgiving<00:01:28.660> it's

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
little bit more forgiving it's

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.770 
little bit more forgiving it's
incredibly<00:01:29.890> quick<00:01:30.369> to<00:01:30.610> apply<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.360> mean<00:01:31.690> I'm

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
incredibly quick to apply I mean I'm

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.420 
incredibly quick to apply I mean I'm
using<00:01:31.990> my<00:01:32.200> fingers<00:01:32.649> here<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.250> you're<00:01:33.369> not

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
using my fingers here so you're not

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.280 
using my fingers here so you're not
gonna<00:01:33.550> have<00:01:33.700> any<00:01:33.970> harsh<00:01:34.330> lines<00:01:34.720> which<00:01:35.020> again

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
gonna have any harsh lines which again

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.260 
gonna have any harsh lines which again
is<00:01:35.410> very<00:01:35.619> aging<00:01:37.710> getting<00:01:38.710> into<00:01:38.950> 50s<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:40.090> want

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
is very aging getting into 50s you want

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.230 
is very aging getting into 50s you want
to<00:01:40.390> be<00:01:40.479> avoiding<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.320> real<00:01:41.560> dark<00:01:42.190> blocks<00:01:42.820> of

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
to be avoiding the real dark blocks of

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.740 
to be avoiding the real dark blocks of
color<00:01:43.540> it's<00:01:44.470> better<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.220> go<00:01:45.399> for<00:01:45.430> sheers<00:01:46.000> and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
color it's better to go for sheers and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.630 
color it's better to go for sheers and
what's<00:01:47.050> great<00:01:47.320> about<00:01:47.500> them<00:01:48.009> is<00:01:48.160> they're

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
what's great about them is they're

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.330 
what's great about them is they're
incredibly<00:01:49.180> moisturizing<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.920> it's<00:01:51.040> good<00:01:51.310> for

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
incredibly moisturizing so it's good for

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.840 
incredibly moisturizing so it's good for
older<00:01:51.880> lips<00:01:52.090> which<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.690> often<00:01:53.050> dryer<00:01:53.850> no

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
older lips which you often dryer no

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.040 
older lips which you often dryer no
harsh<00:01:55.149> lines<00:01:55.920> soft<00:01:56.920> edges<00:01:57.580> they're<00:01:58.509> quick<00:01:58.810> and
