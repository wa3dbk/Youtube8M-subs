00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:14.000
 Takeuchi is the feeling of total immersion is today 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.000
 This time I will explain the points that make crawling kicks easier 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.539
 There are two types of crawl kicks , 6 b and kicks and two-beat kicks. 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.190
 I will 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.590
 6 b and kick are 123 while entering one hand 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:35.560
 123 when inserting the other 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:41.260
 And kick 3 times a total of 6 times on the left and right 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:47.210
 6 b and kick always move the foot and push water down there 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:53.480
 It can be used when you want to stabilize the lower body or you want to gain momentum 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.230
 Light kicks when practicing drills or hard kicks when swimming short distances quickly 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.230
 It is usable 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:07.220
 On the other hand 2 beat kick once during the incoming water the one hand 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:12.670
 When putting the other hand, I will kick twice in total once on the left and right 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.670
 Help your body rotate by hitting hard quickly 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.910
 It can be used when swimming easily or swimming long 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.590
 Because the aim of ti swim is to swim easily and long 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.590
 I recommend a two-beat kick 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.820
 Next, let's look at the features of the two-beat kick 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.630
 Two beat kick is 1 stroke 1 kick but hand 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:43.330
 We will be in the water with the opposite foot at the time of water injection 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:48.870
 Then your waist will turn and you will be back twisting 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.870
 Use this twist to accelerate water entry 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:59.840
 Thus, the movement of the foot is transmitted in the same direction as the traveling direction 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.840
 So the 2d kick looks beautiful 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:10.979
 Also the strength of one kick will be stronger than 6 b and kick 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.979
 The number of kicks is reduced to one third so you can kick easily 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.810
 Furthermore, the leverage which goes many times ahead of the kick width 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.810
 Can also expect this effect 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.680
 Let's look at ways to make kicks easier with Two Beat Kicks 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.069
 Let's go 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.020
 First, not to kick for floating the lower half of the body 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:42.130
 Take the balance of the front and back with his head and hands 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:42.130
 Next , check the position of the left and right foot and control by moving the foot alternately 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:58.640
 At the next stage , the water on the other side will be synchronized with the hand news movement . 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:00.700
 Stabilize your posture by keeping it stretched for as long as possible and making it a momentary action 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.700
 I will 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:09.870
 If you can do a two-beat kick , you can offset the kick timing and kick width 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:15.049
 It changed to further quick movement by decreasing 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.049
 This results in more momentum and leverage 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.870
 Two-beat kicks will be kicked one at a time according to the entry of water to the left and right hands 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:34.969
 The waist rotates by snapping the foot lightly 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.969
 Acceleration can be obtained by transmitting the rotation movement to the hand and the hand to be flooded 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.790
 What did you think 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:47.490
 2 d and tickets are essential for long and easy swimming 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:50.480
 Practice ti swim and master a clean and efficient two-beat kick 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.480
 Thank you very much
