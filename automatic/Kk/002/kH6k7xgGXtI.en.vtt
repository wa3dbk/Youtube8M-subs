in this line has an impressive alt mode
it's<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:46.280> proportions<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.460> great

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it's this one the proportions are great

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.930 
it's this one the proportions are great
and<00:00:48.109> it's<00:00:49.109> got<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> nice<00:00:49.680> Arctic<00:00:50.430> camouflage

and it's got a nice Arctic camouflage
deco<00:00:52.699> but<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> mole<00:00:54.120> detailing<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.469> best

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
deco but the mole detailing is the best

thing<00:00:55.980> about<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.429> boat<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:58.039> incredible

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
thing about this boat it's incredible

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.459 
thing about this boat it's incredible
and<00:00:59.250> particularly<00:01:00.239> impressive<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:01.019> a<00:01:01.050> figure

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and particularly impressive for a figure

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.030 
and particularly impressive for a figure
this<00:01:01.649> small<00:01:02.870> there<00:01:03.870> aren't<00:01:04.230> many<00:01:04.350> paint<00:01:04.769> apps

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
this small there aren't many paint apps

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.270 
this small there aren't many paint apps
here<00:01:05.660> but<00:01:06.660> they're<00:01:07.170> not<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.620> needed<00:01:08.160> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
here but they're not really needed in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.240 
here but they're not really needed in
this<00:01:08.430> case<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.840> mold<00:01:10.110> detailing<00:01:10.710> stands<00:01:11.040> out

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
this case the mold detailing stands out

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.320 
this case the mold detailing stands out
well<00:01:11.490> enough<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.830> if<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.730> weren't<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.090> all

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
well enough as is if it weren't for all

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.069 
well enough as is if it weren't for all
the<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.990> gaps<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.740> transformation<00:01:17.490> seams

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
the little gaps and transformation seams

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.870 
the little gaps and transformation seams
this<00:01:19.079> would<00:01:19.380> probably<00:01:19.560> pass<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> proper

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
this would probably pass for a proper

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.999 
this would probably pass for a proper
model<00:01:21.350> as<00:01:23.150> nice<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.540> looks<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.439> even<00:01:25.860> has

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
model as nice as this looks it even has

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.639 
model as nice as this looks it even has
a<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> play<00:01:26.610> value<00:01:27.259> because<00:01:28.259> these

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
a bit of play value because these

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.149 
a bit of play value because these
missile<00:01:29.130> parts<00:01:29.369> are<00:01:29.700> adjustable<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:31.159> can

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
missile parts are adjustable you can

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.590 
missile parts are adjustable you can
position<00:01:32.610> them<00:01:32.939> almost<00:01:33.210> anywhere<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.869> want

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.759 
they're not too bad once you get used to
them<00:03:14.299> plus<00:03:15.299> they<00:03:15.569> give<00:03:15.810> him<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.019> proper<00:03:16.319> alien

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
them plus they give him a proper alien

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.460 
them plus they give him a proper alien
appearance<00:03:17.250> along<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.329> curved<00:03:18.569> thighs

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.920 

articulation<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.650> quite<00:03:23.069> good<00:03:23.370> he<00:03:24.360> even<00:03:24.510> has

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
articulation is quite good he even has

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.420 
articulation is quite good he even has
movable<00:03:25.440> thumbs<00:03:27.230> though<00:03:28.230> posing<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.190> legs

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
movable thumbs though posing the legs

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.300 
movable thumbs though posing the legs
can<00:03:29.700> be<00:03:29.850> tricky<00:03:30.239> at<00:03:30.329> first<00:03:30.650> especially<00:03:31.650> since

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
can be tricky at first especially since

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.430 
can be tricky at first especially since
the<00:03:32.700> hips<00:03:32.940> are<00:03:33.180> loose<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:34.139> feet<00:03:34.410> are

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
the hips are loose and the feet are

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.289 
the hips are loose and the feet are
integrated<00:03:35.250> into<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.639> kibble<00:03:38.000> but<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.120> get

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
integrated into the kibble but you get

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.539 
integrated into the kibble but you get
round<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.780> eventually<00:03:41.840> also<00:03:43.100> these<00:03:44.100> pods

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
round that eventually also these pods

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.960 
round that eventually also these pods
have<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.880> better<00:03:45.150> range<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.630> motion<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:46.970> not

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
have a better range of motion here not

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.729 
have a better range of motion here not
to<00:03:48.150> mention<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.750> pads<00:03:48.989> they<00:03:49.260> rest<00:03:49.530> on

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
to mention that the pads they rest on

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.900 
to mention that the pads they rest on
can<00:03:49.980> move<00:03:50.220> too<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.650> play<00:03:52.920> value<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.549> still

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
can move too so play value is still

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.780 
can move too so play value is still
great<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:56.000> wait<00:03:57.000> there's<00:03:57.750> more<00:03:58.130> he<00:03:59.130> has<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
great but wait there's more he has a

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.020 
great but wait there's more he has a
barrel<00:04:00.150> mode<00:04:00.359> which<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.530> only<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.130> few<00:04:02.430> twists

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
barrel mode which is only a few twists

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:11.720 
barrel mode which is only a few twists
and<00:04:03.209> turns<00:04:03.480> away

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.630 

basically<00:04:12.660> you've<00:04:13.530> turned<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.129> boat<00:04:14.340> house

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
basically you've turned the boat house

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.430 
basically you've turned the boat house
into<00:04:15.270> skis<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:17.040> actually<00:04:17.639> looks<00:04:17.850> pretty<00:04:17.940> cool

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
into skis it actually looks pretty cool

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.490 
into skis it actually looks pretty cool
even<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.650> bonus<00:04:19.980> mode<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:21.810> certainly<00:04:22.260> makes

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
even for a bonus mode it certainly makes

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.090 
even for a bonus mode it certainly makes
use<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.040> kibble<00:04:23.400> he's<00:04:23.550> got<00:04:24.800> but<00:04:25.800> for<00:04:25.980> him

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
to stand up properly he has to be

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.629 
to stand up properly he has to be
