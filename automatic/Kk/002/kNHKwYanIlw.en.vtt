way<00:03:08.319> okay<00:03:09.319> um<00:03:12.190> another<00:03:13.190> thing<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:14.000> is

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
way okay um another thing that I like is

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.610 
way okay um another thing that I like is
the<00:03:14.269> shutter<00:03:15.019> speed<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:16.420> very<00:03:17.420> soft<00:03:18.380> and

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
the shutter speed this very soft and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.339 
the shutter speed this very soft and
subtle<00:03:19.130> so<00:03:19.700> it's<00:03:19.880> really<00:03:20.239> good<00:03:20.510> then<00:03:20.780> when<00:03:21.170> you

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
subtle so it's really good then when you

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.300 
subtle so it's really good then when you
work<00:03:22.220> in<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.549> crowd<00:03:23.150> or<00:03:23.810> silent<00:03:24.560> environment

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
work in the crowd or silent environment

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.050 
work in the crowd or silent environment
and<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.810> continuous<00:03:27.410> shooting<00:03:27.799> is<00:03:28.430> really

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
and the continuous shooting is really

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.890 
and the continuous shooting is really
good<00:03:29.299> too<00:03:30.110> because<00:03:30.849> 8<00:03:31.849> frame<00:03:32.239> per<00:03:32.420> second<00:03:32.810> we

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
good too because 8 frame per second we

d300 d300s has similar 8 frame per

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.270 
d300 d300s has similar 8 frame per
second<00:03:42.109> but<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.470> problem<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.459> need<00:03:43.910> to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
second but the problem is you need to

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:53.770 
second but the problem is you need to
have<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.840> need<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.170> health<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:52.480> battery<00:03:53.480> grip

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
have you need to health the battery grip

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.620 
have you need to health the battery grip
to<00:03:54.260> support<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.799> if<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.639> don't<00:03:55.880> have<00:03:56.030> battery

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
to support it if you don't have battery

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.539 
to support it if you don't have battery
grip<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:56.930> only<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.739> five<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.280> six

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
grip it only like five to six

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:23.730 
grip it only like five to six
frames<00:03:58.970> per<00:03:59.120> second<00:03:59.540> let<00:03:59.930> me<00:04:00.079> show<00:04:00.319> you<00:04:00.349> how

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.529 

except<00:04:24.740> how<00:04:25.009> it<00:04:25.250> sounds<00:04:27.129> okay<00:04:28.129> um<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:29.300> things

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
except how it sounds okay um the things

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.249 
except how it sounds okay um the things
that<00:04:29.719> I<00:04:30.400> like<00:04:31.400> about<00:04:31.460> this<00:04:31.789> is<00:04:32.060> obviously<00:04:32.750> the

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
that I like about this is obviously the

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.770 
that I like about this is obviously the
continuation<00:04:34.009> shielding<00:04:34.340> speed<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.879> also

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
continuation shielding speed and also

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.189 
continuation shielding speed and also
the<00:04:35.990> new<00:04:36.319> autofocus<00:04:37.069> system<00:04:37.099> 19<00:04:38.199> autofocus

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
the new autofocus system 19 autofocus

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.749 
the new autofocus system 19 autofocus
system<00:04:39.409> with<00:04:40.960> with<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.319> all<00:04:42.889> cross<00:04:43.430> stripe

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
system with with the all cross stripe

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.260 
system with with the all cross stripe
and<00:04:44.560> also<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.620> can<00:04:45.979> customize<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.789> autofocus

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
and also you can customize the autofocus

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.890 
and also you can customize the autofocus
in<00:04:47.750> 25<00:04:48.229> zone<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:48.919> it's<00:04:49.099> easier<00:04:49.639> to<00:04:49.909> for<00:04:50.599> you<00:04:50.719> to

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
in 25 zone so it's easier to for you to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.360 
in 25 zone so it's easier to for you to
select<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:52.729> move<00:04:53.690> around<00:04:54.610> autofocus<00:04:55.610> point

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
select and move around autofocus point

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.279 
select and move around autofocus point
the<00:04:58.370> things<00:04:58.879> that<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.120> don't<00:04:59.479> like<00:04:59.659> it's<00:05:00.020> a

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
the things that I don't like it's a

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.619 
the things that I don't like it's a
about<00:05:01.069> this<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:02.319> the<00:05:03.669> there's<00:05:04.669> still<00:05:05.120> no<00:05:05.360> auto

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
about this is the there's still no auto

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.040 
about this is the there's still no auto
ISO<00:05:06.199> limiter<00:05:07.069> like<00:05:07.639> in<00:05:07.849> nikon<00:05:08.240> camera<00:05:08.659> so<00:05:08.990> you

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
ISO limiter like in nikon camera so you

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.119 
ISO limiter like in nikon camera so you
cannot<00:05:09.500> set<00:05:10.190> maximum<00:05:10.969> or<00:05:11.270> minimum<00:05:11.300> I<00:05:12.139> saw<00:05:12.860> and

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 
cannot set maximum or minimum I saw and

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.070 
cannot set maximum or minimum I saw and
you<00:05:13.400> cannot<00:05:14.110> set<00:05:16.150> minimum<00:05:17.150> shutter<00:05:17.690> speed

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
you cannot set minimum shutter speed

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.129 
you cannot set minimum shutter speed

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
consider pretty lights in this today but

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.959 
consider pretty lights in this today but
it<00:05:48.849> still<00:05:49.849> control<00:05:50.449> noise<00:05:50.719> pretty<00:05:51.229> good<00:05:51.969> the

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
it still control noise pretty good the

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:59.709 
it still control noise pretty good the
noise<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:55.150> 1600<00:05:56.150> is<00:05:56.330> very<00:05:56.680> low<00:05:57.680> and<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:59.360> image

noise in 1600 is very low and the image

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:07.409 
noise in 1600 is very low and the image
actually<00:06:00.259> very<00:06:00.710> usable<00:06:01.310> up<00:06:01.490> to<00:06:03.069> even<00:06:04.479> 64,000

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
actually very usable up to even 64,000

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.809 
actually very usable up to even 64,000
especially<00:06:08.419> because<00:06:08.779> of<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:09.289> software<00:06:09.889> now

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
has a really good noise reduction like

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:23.920 
has a really good noise reduction like
like<00:06:14.930> room<00:06:15.279> so<00:06:18.610> 3206<00:06:20.020> 6400<00:06:21.020> snows<00:06:21.349> very<00:06:22.930> usable

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
like room so 3206 6400 snows very usable

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.129
