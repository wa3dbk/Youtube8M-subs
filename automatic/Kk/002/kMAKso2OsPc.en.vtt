00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.679
 16th step assembly of the structure 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.570
 for that we will need it 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.280
 2 internships in the eight prospective platelet trade 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.799
 we have four crossings 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.589
 which are a little bit wider than 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.009
 the four crossings 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.880
 we will also need m 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.039
 profile number 2 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.460
 that is to say, who was going to pocket 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.460
 to start we will take the crossings 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.289
 and we go 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.519
 the crusaders with the profile of the roads thanks to the close sums 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.410
 the four sides of our profile are not all it's equivalent there are 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.150
 two sides then la rochelle 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.730
 which presents all the hollows 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.730
 that we are going to cross at feet 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.970
 then there are 2 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.650
 those with bumps 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.650
 that we have crossed with the more crossings 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 assembled the heart of our life 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.640
 we are going now 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.240
 take profile number one 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.020
 so profiling the pose on the work plan putting the pretty side against 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.950
 the work plan so that we are left with him 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.110
 landmarks 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.320
 2 I'm happy superimpose of the Colombian structure of the assembly 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.540
 by doing well to superimpose hollows and bumps 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 we will gather this structure for profile 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 thanks to pieces of gummed kraft 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.440
 so we go it is used 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.460
 this piece of skull gomis 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.530
 help them through 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.070
 so for that it is very important of the century to position the cross at 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.700
 level of the mark as we drew earlier 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.960
 on england the next issue 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.750
 once he has crossed 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 at the benchmark and that she was not good enough 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.950
 for pro or too low 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.509
 in addition to bulk mail 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.849
 two pieces of crabos 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.399
 the other floor of the crossing 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.070
 criticize this operation for each 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.070
 eight crossings 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:28.299
 so we say it so well and we mark many other languages ​​ready through 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:28.749
 well 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.749
 frog at most 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.089
 for once they can cross 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.039
 we can therefore go hunting harrier 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.649
 there we will repeat the same operation by taking the profile number 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.219
 3 so we place it on the worktop the pretty side against the 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.599
 table and takes super buddy away our structure 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.469
 always the same we went well 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.499
 chain assembly 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.089
 the sleepers are well positioned at the markers 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.329
 the advantage of having taken its bearings it makes it possible to be sure of having 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.259
 bushings 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.259
 it's niculae perfumes 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.429
 we were only at each crossing two pieces of skull 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:04.899
 this is our 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.409
 structure 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.730
 so last step we will strengthen the structure at the level of 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.199
 profile august number 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.059
 so we will go beyond 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:16.359
 iron lady through 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.359
 and we will support him asleep at each intersection 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.019
 -each crosses and profile numbered 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.819
 do I have general winter through cross 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:29.729
 according to master between two of the four Greek tracks 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.729
 Everytime 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.939
 assembling these shots gap 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.580
 the next step will be dressing up the indoor murder space a bit 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.740
 all over
