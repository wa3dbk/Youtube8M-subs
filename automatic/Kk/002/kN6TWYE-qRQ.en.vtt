00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.350
 chemistry and 83 of general rating as 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.270
 team now let's see the images of 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.650
 the games with this team friend the 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.900
 first team that we face is 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.720
 a team from the german bundesliga with 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.270
 100% chemistry and 86 general rating 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.070
 let's see the pictures friends 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.570
 I tell them what I'm trying to do 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.850
 many more movements like 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.560
 can see in all my games and play 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.960
 it was better to start the game scored 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.390
 the first goal with Xabi Alonso and 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.720
 immediately I see is the little circle giving 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.720
 turns 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.130
 and the message has lost the connection 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.020
 with his opponent leaves the game on 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.720
 next rival again is a team of 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.000
 the German Bundesliga very strong for 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.790
 true with elevated habomai forest and 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.800
 Ã¡lava team of the year 'of neuer in the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.110
 goalkeeper the best goalkeeper with a 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.450
 100% chemical and 70 network and channel 9 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.799
 we go to the images in the first 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.630
 matches I always try to see what I can 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.790
 adjust the equipment to play better there 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.470
 with a pumped pass and also a 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.410
 pumped shot obayan gets the front 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.480
 against us 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.010
 again is my rival that in the 34th minute 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.830
 with a spectacular head shot 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.800
 Leave my doorman with nothing to do and go 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.599
 hiding the score 2 goals to 0 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.580
 we then avoid this shot 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.229
 corner is walcott who when trying to 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.509
 clear the ball sends you a pass my 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.389
 rival and diego puts it at the bottom of the 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.400
 networks without any mercy the quality of 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.080
 the passes of Xabi Alonso is indisputable 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.729
 however this was the type of matches 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.830
 where nothing works out as you can see 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.830
 I was hitting the post I was 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.870
 having arrivals but nothing 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.370
 subsequently this beautiful free kick 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.169
 which my rival did not waste and 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.389
 it became a goal too 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.699
 I finally had my chance with this 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.699
 center which became a goal 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.050
 of popcorn however for this point 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.909
 I mean, he had realized that 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.800
 my unstoppable way and I was 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:16.009
 taking advantage of its speed throwing by the 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.169
 pumped and long filtered passes for 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.330
 reach them with water and not even write down 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.099
 and that is how you can see my defenders 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.199
 they did not reach their players so now 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.110
 I was at a total disadvantage and receiving 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:32.600
 many goals so finally this 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.370
 I lost it 61 party receives 431 coins 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.840
 already by this point friends I realized 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.700
 it was time to make some adjustments 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.010
 he traveled the lines forward with 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.050
 a training of 433 using a fit 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.340
 de brun as an offensive midfielder and 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.580
 also Miranda as central defender 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.020
 left is faster than varane 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.640
 in this way we maintained the chemistry of 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.800
 team and the results were a lot 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.199
 I'll show you the images 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.669
 after making all these adjustments we 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.590
 we head to our next match 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.840
 we played a league team and pl with 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.759
 rooney and suÃ¡rez to the front 100% of 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.039
 chemistry and 81 of general rating a team 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.810
 very strong with a very very good rival 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.370
 but let's see what happens in the 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.120
 6 minute with this directed reception 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.050
 Walcott friends open the scoreboard 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.150
 later with this corner kick 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.340
 or fellini shows us because he has 85 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.660
 capping layer and here is walcott 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.190
 who shows us that he not only has 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.990
 speed but also knows how to do 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.850
 triple and dribbling we see how it 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.110
 removes clichÃ© and later david wyss 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.600
 to then make a shot towards the 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.280
 background of the networks after seeing this 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.780
 festival of goals roberto soldier does not 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.370
 wants to be left behind and with this average 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.830
 Scissors shows us its quality for 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.450
 define a goal then there is something that 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.070
 I have never been able to understand how they are marked 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.040
 the penalties in fifa as you can see here 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.440
 I just got pink check though 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.480
 mark a penalty has against me 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.430
 opponent there are times that knock me down 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.930
 totally and they do not mark anything then it is 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.280
 something very strange 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.350
 obviously I was not going to waste this 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.180
 opportunity and convert the criminal has 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.620
 a goal for this point I thought that my 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.780
 opponent was going to disconnect without 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.080
 However he continued to play and the goals 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.849
 they kept coming 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.439
 by this point I was not playing so 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.510
 seriously and I made this mistake that my 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:07.730
 opponent obviously took advantage very well 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.590
 again in the 84th minute with a shot of 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.260
 corner is kabul now who drilled the 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.910
 networks here we can see how useful is 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.620
 technique of rolling the ball 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.410
 watch as xabi alonso took off defense 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.850
 sends the filtered pass to fellini and 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.920
 fellini do not waste this opportunity 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.930
 to send it to the networks and also 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.640

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.930
 Dodge tutorial on how to roll the 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.460
 I put the ball on the screen in 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.560
 this moment you can see how it is 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.170
 very useful despite being a very dribble 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.200
 basic finally we won this match 7 

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.710
 to 1 friends and we received a total of 587 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.710
 coins 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.480
 Now I'm going to show you after 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.830

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.150
 results of this team friends like 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.740

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.470
 they played and the goals they scored each 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.600
 one give you my honest opinion this 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.130
 team is very good is very good without 

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.690
 However, it can still be improved if 

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.070
 we put the left side to Christian 

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.820
 ronaldo if we play well the 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:03.140
 coins if we put mamÃ©s and this one I do not know 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.760
 there are some ways in which 

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.170
 can can be improved however I 

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.170
 I wanted to keep the budget that I 

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.460
 They asked that it was 30 thousand coins and 

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.660
 I recommend it, I'm sure that with 

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.130
 this team you can reach the 

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.080
 fifth fourth division without any 

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.640
