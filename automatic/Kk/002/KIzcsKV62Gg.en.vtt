00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
hoplites will start doing better and

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.450 
hoplites will start doing better and
better<00:04:50.030> they'll<00:04:50.330> get<00:04:50.479> more<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.840> more<00:04:50.900> kills

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
better they'll get more and more kills

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.430 
better they'll get more and more kills
so<00:04:52.460> it's<00:04:53.000> really<00:04:53.210> important<00:04:53.960> for<00:04:54.050> me<00:04:54.139> to<00:04:54.169> just

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
so it's really important for me to just

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.990 
so it's really important for me to just
try<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:54.860> stay<00:04:55.160> alive<00:04:55.400> for<00:04:55.700> as<00:04:55.789> long<00:04:55.940> as

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
try and stay alive for as long as

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.490 
try and stay alive for as long as
possible<00:04:56.300> you<00:04:56.570> can<00:04:56.690> see<00:04:56.780> some<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:57.020> his<00:04:57.139> hoplite

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
possible you can see some of his hoplite

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.620 
possible you can see some of his hoplite
starting<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.919> waver<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.520> now<00:04:59.030> his<00:04:59.300> cavalry

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
starting to waver and now his cavalry

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.080 
starting to waver and now his cavalry
starts<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.169> become<00:05:00.289> trapped<00:05:00.889> as<00:05:01.460> my<00:05:01.669> hoplites

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
starts to become trapped as my hoplites

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.940 
starts to become trapped as my hoplites
come<00:05:02.330> back<00:05:02.539> into<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.900> fact<00:05:03.139> that<00:05:03.289> fight<00:05:03.650> they

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
come back into the fact that fight they

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.279 
come back into the fact that fight they
run<00:05:04.160> out<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.400> places<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.789> flee<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.750> when

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
run out of places to flee to and when

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.529 
run out of places to flee to and when
they<00:05:06.410> flee<00:05:06.680> they<00:05:06.889> take<00:05:07.099> losses<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.880> his

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
they flee they take losses and his

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.080 
they flee they take losses and his
Persian<00:05:09.530> hoplites<00:05:09.979> are<00:05:10.130> mostly<00:05:10.430> dead<00:05:10.729> which

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
Persian hoplites are mostly dead which

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.640 
Persian hoplites are mostly dead which
means<00:05:11.330> that<00:05:11.510> he<00:05:11.570> can<00:05:11.720> no<00:05:11.840> longer<00:05:11.870> pressure<00:05:12.410> me

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
means that he can no longer pressure me

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.950 
means that he can no longer pressure me
from<00:05:13.099> the<00:05:13.190> front<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.729> I<00:05:14.150> can<00:05:14.330> turn<00:05:14.510> more<00:05:14.750> of<00:05:14.840> my

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
from the front and I can turn more of my

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.480 
from the front and I can turn more of my
attention<00:05:15.260> to<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.560> back<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.950> take<00:05:16.130> all<00:05:16.280> of<00:05:16.310> my

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
attention to the back I take all of my

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.250 
attention to the back I take all of my
hoplites<00:05:16.849> out<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.240> formation<00:05:17.510> attack<00:05:17.930> when

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
hoplites out of formation attack when

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.960 
hoplites out of formation attack when
issuing<00:05:18.530> orders<00:05:18.830> onto<00:05:19.310> his<00:05:19.400> cavalry<00:05:19.669> because

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
issuing orders onto his cavalry because

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.310 
issuing orders onto his cavalry because
I<00:05:20.030> want<00:05:20.180> them<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.330> break<00:05:20.599> formation<00:05:21.020> and

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
I want them to break formation and

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.100 
I want them to break formation and
engage<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.940> way<00:05:23.150> his<00:05:23.360> guys<00:05:23.570> can't<00:05:24.050> just

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
engage that way his guys can't just

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.080 
engage that way his guys can't just
cleanly<00:05:24.650> withdraw<00:05:25.039> from<00:05:25.280> an<00:05:25.460> even<00:05:25.700> line<00:05:25.910> of

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
cleanly withdraw from an even line of

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.120 
cleanly withdraw from an even line of
hoplites<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:26.780> got<00:05:27.169> some<00:05:27.320> cavalry<00:05:27.620> into<00:05:28.010> his

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
hoplites I got some cavalry into his

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.219 
hoplites I got some cavalry into his
pelvis<00:05:28.550> back<00:05:28.760> here<00:05:29.060> and<00:05:29.450> I'm<00:05:29.690> trying<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:30.080> take

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
pelvis back here and I'm trying to take

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.080 
pelvis back here and I'm trying to take
them<00:05:30.470> down<00:05:30.680> keep<00:05:31.460> them<00:05:31.580> from<00:05:31.700> being<00:05:31.849> able<00:05:31.970> to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
them down keep them from being able to

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.120 
them down keep them from being able to
play<00:05:32.300> any<00:05:32.479> further<00:05:32.690> role<00:05:32.930> and<00:05:33.200> slowly<00:05:33.830> but

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
play any further role and slowly but

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.680 
play any further role and slowly but
surely<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.580> fights<00:05:34.789> actually<00:05:35.180> turning<00:05:35.389> back

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
surely the fights actually turning back

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.060 
surely the fights actually turning back
to<00:05:35.840> my<00:05:35.960> favor<00:05:36.229> and<00:05:36.440> as<00:05:36.530> they<00:05:36.650> start<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:36.889> take

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
to my favor and as they start to take

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.290 
to my favor and as they start to take
losses<00:05:37.310> you<00:05:37.610> can<00:05:37.729> now<00:05:37.849> see<00:05:38.030> them<00:05:38.150> around

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
losses you can now see them around

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.360 
losses you can now see them around
turning<00:05:38.630> against<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:39.229> Parthians

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370

200<00:05:46.160> meters<00:05:46.450> royal<00:05:47.450> cataracts<00:05:47.900> did<00:05:48.050> a<00:05:48.110> great

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
200 meters royal cataracts did a great

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.379 
200 meters royal cataracts did a great
job<00:05:48.400> but<00:05:49.400> this<00:05:49.520> time<00:05:49.700> it's<00:05:49.880> just<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.090> game<00:05:50.240> in

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
job but this time it's just a game in

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.360 
job but this time it's just a game in
numbers<00:05:50.720> so<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.290> think<00:05:51.710> what<00:05:51.830> happened<00:05:52.130> here<00:05:52.280> is

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
numbers so I think what happened here is

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.780 
numbers so I think what happened here is
my<00:05:52.730> opponent<00:05:53.120> strategy<00:05:53.570> was<00:05:53.750> superior<00:05:54.790> he

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
my opponent strategy was superior he

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.159 
my opponent strategy was superior he
brought<00:05:56.000> an<00:05:56.120> army<00:05:56.240> that<00:05:56.480> I<00:05:56.540> didn't<00:05:56.810> expect

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
brought an army that I didn't expect

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.080 
brought an army that I didn't expect
that<00:05:57.410> countered<00:05:58.220> very<00:05:58.430> well<00:05:58.669> what<00:05:58.910> I<00:05:58.940> had

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
that countered very well what I had

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.390 
that countered very well what I had
brought<00:05:59.440> had<00:06:00.440> this<00:06:00.620> been<00:06:00.770> on<00:06:00.800> open<00:06:01.250> ground

where there was no trees my men would

where there was no trees my men would
have<00:06:03.770> just<00:06:03.980> been<00:06:04.040> slain<00:06:04.610> by<00:06:04.910> his<00:06:05.300> javelins

absolutely<00:06:06.500> slain<00:06:06.830> and<00:06:07.130> I<00:06:07.220> would<00:06:07.340> have<00:06:07.430> gotten

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
absolutely slain and I would have gotten

absolutely slain and I would have gotten

mopped up hardcore the trees saved me

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.040 
mopped up hardcore the trees saved me
their<00:06:10.160> big<00:06:10.490> time<00:06:10.760> and<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.510> fact<00:06:11.720> that<00:06:11.810> I<00:06:11.900> was

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
their big time and the fact that I was

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.730 
their big time and the fact that I was
on<00:06:12.139> that<00:06:12.200> hill

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
on that hill

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.140 
on that hill
kept<00:06:13.010> his<00:06:13.130> cab<00:06:13.340> from<00:06:13.550> being<00:06:13.760> able<00:06:13.850> to<00:06:13.970> have

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
kept his cab from being able to have

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.750 
kept his cab from being able to have
wide<00:06:14.720> open<00:06:15.140> full-speed<00:06:15.950> charges<00:06:16.550> and<00:06:16.700> that

probably also saved me I did not expect

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
did quite well so an interesting game

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.570 
did quite well so an interesting game
like<00:07:12.380> I<00:07:12.500> said<00:07:12.680> the<00:07:12.860> only<00:07:12.890> thing<00:07:13.070> that<00:07:13.190> saved<00:07:13.490> me

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
like I said the only thing that saved me

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.370 
like I said the only thing that saved me
here<00:07:13.760> was<00:07:13.910> the<00:07:13.940> terrain<00:07:14.330> and<00:07:14.630> the<00:07:14.900> terrain<00:07:15.140> was

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
here was the terrain and the terrain was

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.080 
here was the terrain and the terrain was
partly<00:07:15.650> given<00:07:16.070> to<00:07:16.250> me<00:07:16.400> because<00:07:16.669> that<00:07:16.700> was<00:07:16.940> my

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
partly given to me because that was my

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.840 
partly given to me because that was my
deployment<00:07:17.690> zone<00:07:17.720> so<00:07:18.590> my<00:07:19.250> opponent<00:07:19.640> I<00:07:19.669> guess

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
deployment zone so my opponent I guess

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.159 
deployment zone so my opponent I guess
ended<00:07:20.090> up<00:07:20.180> half<00:07:20.300> that<00:07:20.450> charged<00:07:20.750> me<00:07:20.870> in<00:07:20.930> a<00:07:20.990> bad

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:21.169 
ended up half that charged me in a bad

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:23.710 
ended up half that charged me in a bad
position<00:07:21.880> had<00:07:22.880> he<00:07:23.030> waited<00:07:23.240> because

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
position had he waited because

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.540 
position had he waited because
inevitably<00:07:24.530> I<00:07:24.590> probably<00:07:25.070> would<00:07:25.370> have<00:07:25.400> come

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
inevitably I probably would have come

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.130 
inevitably I probably would have come
off<00:07:25.610> the<00:07:25.880> hill<00:07:26.060> some<00:07:26.330> to<00:07:26.510> try<00:07:26.630> and<00:07:26.780> skirmish

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.140 
off the hill some to try and skirmish

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.320 
off the hill some to try and skirmish
with<00:07:27.320> him<00:07:27.470> it<00:07:28.160> may<00:07:28.340> have<00:07:28.490> been<00:07:28.580> enough<00:07:28.850> to<00:07:29.180> get

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
with him it may have been enough to get

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.420 
with him it may have been enough to get
me<00:07:29.450> there<00:07:29.630> so<00:07:29.660> kudos<00:07:30.590> to<00:07:30.710> my<00:07:30.830> opponent<00:07:31.280> very
