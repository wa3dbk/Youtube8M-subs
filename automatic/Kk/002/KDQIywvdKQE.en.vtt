00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
helps with the cooling because it gets

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.799 
helps with the cooling because it gets
really<00:00:33.480> hot<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.880> problem<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.360> i<00:00:36.600> made

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:22.680 
replacing that so let's fire it up and
see<00:02:09.979> if<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.880> leaks
