00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
in NBA 2k16 it will be more difficult to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.720

get<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> green<00:00:27.029> release<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:28.050> also<00:00:28.490> even<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:29.609> you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
get a green release and also even if you

get<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> green<00:00:30.300> release<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.260> shot<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.710> not

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
get a green release the shot is not

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.270 
get a green release the shot is not
guaranteed<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.610> go<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:34.020> NBA<00:00:34.350> 2k15<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
guaranteed to go in now in NBA 2k15 I

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160 
guaranteed to go in now in NBA 2k15 I
know<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> few<00:00:35.969> times<00:00:36.329> I've<00:00:36.870> gotten

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
know there are a few times I've gotten

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.440 
know there are a few times I've gotten
green<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.129> shot<00:00:38.370> would<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.120> so

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
green and the shot would not go in so

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
green and the shot would not go in so
that<00:00:39.629> doesn't<00:00:39.930> bother<00:00:40.050> me<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.379> much<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:41.340> in

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that doesn't bother me as much but in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
that doesn't bother me as much but in
the<00:00:41.700> next<00:00:41.910> 2k<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.230> made<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.410> more

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the next 2k if they made it more

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
the next 2k if they made it more
difficult<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> green<00:00:44.910> maybe<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
difficult to get the green maybe the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.840 
difficult to get the green maybe the
shot<00:00:46.079> should<00:00:46.379> go<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.520> sure<00:00:47.670> how<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
shot should go in I'm not sure how I

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
shot should go in I'm not sure how I
feel<00:00:48.030> about<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.480> because<00:00:49.170> I'll<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.590> like

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
feel about that because I'll do like

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010 
feel about that because I'll do like
seeing<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.100> green<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.730> mean<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.449> goes<00:00:51.809> in

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
seeing that green I mean when it goes in

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.450 
seeing that green I mean when it goes in
of<00:00:52.140> course<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.800> knowing<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.309> this

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of course I just like knowing that this

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
of course I just like knowing that this
shot<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> next<00:00:55.860> 2k<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
shot is going in so in the next 2k I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.639 
shot is going in so in the next 2k I
might<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.910> turn<00:00:57.180> off<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> shot<00:00:57.899> meter<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
might just turn off the shot meter and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.860 
might just turn off the shot meter and
go<00:00:58.859> back<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> old<00:00:59.430> style<00:00:59.640> 2k<00:01:00.090> without<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
go back to the old style 2k without the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.930 
go back to the old style 2k without the
shot<00:01:01.079> meter<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.649> think<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.520> might<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
shot meter I think that might be the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.149 
shot meter I think that might be the
move<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.359> me<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.739> might<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
move for me and also that might be the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.620 
move for me and also that might be the
move<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> lot<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> people<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> know

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
move for a lot of people because I know

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.810 
move for a lot of people because I know
a<00:01:06.720> lot<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.110> people<00:01:07.380> not<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.400> seeing<00:01:08.640> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
a lot of people not like seeing that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
a lot of people not like seeing that
shot<00:01:09.090> meter<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.600> line<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> throwing<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
in 2k 16 I might just turn the shot

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700 
in 2k 16 I might just turn the shot
meter<00:01:14.909> off<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> next<00:01:16.200> thing<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.439> learned

patch<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.720> were<00:01:39.869> left<00:01:40.049> with<00:01:40.229> this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
patch for and we were left with this

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
patch for and we were left with this
patch<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> summer<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.970> two<00:01:42.150> reasons<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
patch for the summer for two reasons the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.920 
patch for the summer for two reasons the
first<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> del<00:01:44.490> team<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.240> working<00:01:45.600> on

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
first one is the del team is working on

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.200 
first one is the del team is working on
the<00:01:46.259> new<00:01:46.439> 2k<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.729> time<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.090> go

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the new 2k they don't have time to go

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690 
the new 2k they don't have time to go
back<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.630> tweak<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.920> previous<00:01:50.399> patch

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
back and tweak the previous patch

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.380 
back and tweak the previous patch
another<00:01:51.659> reason<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:53.070> costs<00:01:53.430> money<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.030> think

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
another reason is it costs money I think

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.870 
another reason is it costs money I think
from<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.960> company<00:01:55.380> standpoint<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:56.430> look<00:01:56.670> back

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
from a company standpoint they look back

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.550 
from a company standpoint they look back
and<00:01:57.060> say<00:01:57.240> we're<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> pay<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and say we're not about to pay all this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.069 
and say we're not about to pay all this
money<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.340> update<00:01:59.570> shooting<00:02:00.570> percentages

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
money to update shooting percentages

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.270 
money to update shooting percentages
because<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> problem<00:02:02.100> was<00:02:02.219> with

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
because that's what the problem was with

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.910 
because that's what the problem was with
me<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.329> shooting<00:02:03.479> percentages<00:02:04.140> but

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
me it was just shooting percentages but

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.719 
me it was just shooting percentages but
