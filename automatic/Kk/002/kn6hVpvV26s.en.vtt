00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.060 
pieces all black and white but they're
all<00:02:00.670> different<00:02:01.230> patterns<00:02:02.230> so<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.740> kind<00:02:03.010> of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
all different patterns so you kind of

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.320 
all different patterns so you kind of
get<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.220> mix<00:02:03.520> patterns<00:02:03.700> but<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:04.150> still

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
get to mix patterns but it's still

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.000 
get to mix patterns but it's still
somehow<00:02:04.660> makes<00:02:05.140> sense<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.650> coordinates

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
somehow makes sense and coordinates

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.830 
somehow makes sense and coordinates
together<00:02:06.310> because<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.880> colors<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.420> I

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
together because of the colors so I

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
together because of the colors so I
don't<00:02:08.200> know<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.290> thought<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.530> was<00:02:08.740> really

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
don't know I thought that was really

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.110 
don't know I thought that was really
cool<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.160> very<00:02:09.340> chic<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:15.700> know<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:15.940> say

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
cool and very chic and I know you say

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.520 
cool and very chic and I know you say
you<00:02:16.180> don't<00:02:16.240> like<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.510> follow<00:02:16.660> trends<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.350> hate

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530

more about that I think there is no such

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.190 
more about that I think there is no such
thing<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.120> trends<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.990> could<00:02:23.170> be
