00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.569 
really solid actually we have a slide or
a<00:03:06.390> disc<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.739> rather<00:03:07.920> than<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.280> tray

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
a disc in here rather than the tray

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.170 
a disc in here rather than the tray
which<00:03:08.970> would<00:03:09.150> come<00:03:09.329> with<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> 360<00:03:10.079> on<00:03:11.180> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
which would come with the 360 on the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.620 
which would come with the 360 on the
back<00:03:12.390> here<00:03:12.829> got<00:03:13.829> our<00:03:14.150> control<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.390> for<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
back here got our control so for the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.380 
back here got our control so for the
power<00:03:15.810> we<00:03:16.109> have<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.410> hdmi<00:03:16.680> out<00:03:17.150> we<00:03:18.150> have<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
power we have the hdmi out we have the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.080 
power we have the hdmi out we have the
hdmi<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.440> actually<00:03:19.590> watch<00:03:20.519> TV<00:03:20.940> on

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
hdmi in so you can actually watch TV on

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.729 
hdmi in so you can actually watch TV on
here<00:03:21.269> put<00:03:21.450> your<00:03:21.480> cable<00:03:22.049> provider<00:03:22.079> in<00:03:22.470> there<00:03:22.620> we

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
here put your cable provider in there we

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.690 
here put your cable provider in there we
have<00:03:22.859> USB<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:24.150> plug<00:03:24.420> for<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.930> connect<00:03:25.700> as

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
have USB the plug for the connect as

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.870 
have USB the plug for the connect as
well<00:03:26.940> as<00:03:27.060> your<00:03:27.739> network<00:03:28.739> cables<00:03:29.549> as<00:03:29.700> well

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
although this does have Wi-Fi built into

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.650 
although this does have Wi-Fi built into
it<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.519> don't<00:03:32.730> actually<00:03:32.910> need<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.329> plug<00:03:33.510> in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
it so you don't actually need to plug in

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.440 
it so you don't actually need to plug in
if<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.810> don't<00:03:33.959> want<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.180> go<00:03:38.450> so

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
if you don't want to there we go so

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.390 
if you don't want to there we go so
let's<00:03:39.600> actually<00:03:39.780> take<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:43.319> let's<00:03:44.220> I

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
let's actually take this and let's I

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.190 
let's actually take this and let's I
actually<00:03:44.639> have<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> 360<00:03:45.510> here<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:45.900> we<00:03:45.989> can<00:03:46.049> kind

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
actually have a 360 here so we can kind

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.660 
actually have a 360 here so we can kind
of<00:03:46.290> see<00:03:46.470> what<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:46.680> look<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:46.889> side<00:03:47.250> by<00:03:47.280> side

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
of see what they look like side by side

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.890 
of see what they look like side by side
we<00:03:48.329> have<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.680> 360<00:03:50.430> slim<00:03:50.790> we<00:03:51.720> take

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
we have the this is the 360 slim we take

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.509 
we have the this is the 360 slim we take
a<00:03:51.930> look<00:03:52.109> at<00:03:52.200> what<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.470> xbox<00:03:52.920> one<00:03:53.130> looks<00:03:53.340> like

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
a look at what the xbox one looks like

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.819 
a look at what the xbox one looks like
compared<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.930> put<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.139> two<00:03:55.380> side<00:03:55.680> by

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
compared to it and put the two side by

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.740 
compared to it and put the two side by
side<00:03:55.859> here<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.790> can<00:03:56.940> see<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.150> xbox<00:03:57.450> one<00:03:57.660> is

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
side here you can see the xbox one is

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.840 
side here you can see the xbox one is
actually<00:03:58.019> quite<00:03:58.139> a<00:03:58.230> bit<00:03:58.410> taller<00:03:58.650> than<00:03:59.609> the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
actually quite a bit taller than the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.080 
actually quite a bit taller than the
slim<00:04:00.180> we<00:04:01.049> were<00:04:01.139> to<00:04:01.260> compare<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:02.280> controllers

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
slim we were to compare the controllers

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.080 
slim we were to compare the controllers
with<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.900> 360<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:05.669> xbox<00:04:06.269> one

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
with the 360 and the xbox one

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.050 
with the 360 and the xbox one
I<00:04:07.180> can<00:04:08.140> see<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.760> control<00:04:09.760> here<00:04:09.940> actually

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
I can see that the control here actually

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.570 
I can see that the control here actually
looks<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.420> lot<00:04:10.540> nicer<00:04:10.599> than<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.769> 360

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
looks a lot nicer than the 360

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.360 
looks a lot nicer than the 360
controller<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:14.470> have<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.709> nice<00:04:14.860> black
