looking out for the enemy guards with
their<00:00:49.000> machine<00:00:49.329> guns<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.159> have<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.399> think

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
their machine guns so you have to think

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.700 
their machine guns so you have to think
on<00:00:51.670> your<00:00:51.790> feet<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:52.000> lot<00:00:52.180> more<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.600> it's<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.559> lot

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
so effectively it's a lot more faster

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.799
