00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
and cleft or so yeah we were like

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.960 
and cleft or so yeah we were like
interested<00:03:49.890> only<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.459> ending<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.850> the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
game you can probably skip to the last

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.360 
game you can probably skip to the last
part<00:03:53.359> when<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.480> action<00:03:54.780> starts<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.769> those<00:03:56.160> me

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
part when the action starts and those me

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.420 
part when the action starts and those me
against<00:03:57.090> cleft<00:03:57.930> or<00:03:58.109> anyways<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.070> think<00:03:59.340> I've

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
against cleft or anyways I think I've
