gaming great and they will last very

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.439 
gaming great and they will last very
long<00:00:55.920> they're<00:00:56.160> saying<00:00:56.399> around<00:00:56.670> 50<00:00:56.969> million

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
long they're saying around 50 million

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
keystrokes that's a very long time

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.900 
keystrokes that's a very long time
probably<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.629> lot<00:01:01.050> longer<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.579> have

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
of that the keyboard is on okay let's

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.180 
of that the keyboard is on okay let's
have<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.110> closer<00:04:55.320> look<00:04:55.470> at<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.800> feet<00:04:55.980> as<00:04:56.130> you

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
have a closer look at the feet as you

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.730

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
can see they are large and rubbery so

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.830 
can see they are large and rubbery so
the<00:04:58.830> keyboard<00:04:59.010> isn't<00:04:59.400> going<00:04:59.940> anywhere<00:05:00.180> very
