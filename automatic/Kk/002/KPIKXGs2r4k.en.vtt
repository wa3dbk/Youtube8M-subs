00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.660 
um although I could have just followed
the<00:02:49.200> second<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.890> T<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.460> actually

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the second one to the T but I actually

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.490 
the second one to the T but I actually
think<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:51.480> pretty<00:02:51.750> good<00:02:52.050> that's<00:02:52.260> really

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
think it is pretty good that's really

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.020 
think it is pretty good that's really
really<00:02:52.980> Mashable<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:53.790> still<00:02:53.970> pretty

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
really Mashable but it's still pretty

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.540 
really Mashable but it's still pretty
warm<00:02:54.480> from<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.840> boiling<00:02:55.260> water<00:02:55.290> right<00:02:55.710> now<00:02:55.860> so

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
warm from the boiling water right now so

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.310 
warm from the boiling water right now so
I<00:02:56.580> think<00:02:56.670> when<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.090> cools<00:02:58.010> it'll<00:02:59.010> be<00:02:59.310> different

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
I think when it cools it'll be different

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.080 
I think when it cools it'll be different
good<00:03:01.320> job<00:03:01.560> Zeke<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.460> looks<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.910> can
