00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:04.446
Let's play "Sign Language"!
Dani, Elidio e Gustavo!

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:07.256
In this game, we'll have
a talk show over there.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:12.087
And Gustavo Miranda will have
to translate everything they say

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:15.010
into sign language, like ASL.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.500
Elidio will be the interviewer and
Daniel will be an expert in something,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.811
raise your hand if you have a suggestion
on what could be his expertise.

00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:25.711
- Dentures!
- 'Dentures'! Perfect. Go!

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:44.388
We're back with our dear
guest, Samuel Souza da Cruz,

00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:54.110
who may have got new discoveries on
the origin of the dentures, right?

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.248
Exactly. First, let me say
it's a pleasure to be here,

00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:06.691
I have to say that I follow your
show, you have incredible topics,

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:13.533
for instance, to give space to the dentures,
which are very little known in Brazil.

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:16.769
Although a lot of people use them!

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:18.179
A lot of people?

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:25.230
My most recent research says 80% of
people above 50 years old, wear dentures.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.751
I see. What are the
most used kinds of teeth?

00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:34.332
Look, the canine tooth is
the one which breaks the most.

00:01:36.173 --> 00:01:40.574
And people end up asking
to make only canines, right?

00:01:40.574 --> 00:01:46.162
And there was a time in the 80's,
maybe you'll remember,

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:56.064
when young people were into vampires,
they asked a lot for vampire dentures.

00:01:56.064 --> 00:02:04.166
Which is a normal thing. There's
also the incisors, they end up...

00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:17.428
They are more resistant, but a lot
of people want to pull them out,

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:19.631
and then they miss it
and want them back in!

00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:21.983
And finally, there's the molars.

00:02:21.983 --> 00:02:27.934
The molars are rare to fall out,

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:33.127
but, when they fall, it's a mess.

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:37.260
And they fall all the time! You think
they don't fall... And they fall!

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.850
Fall a lot!
Fall like hell!

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.410
So they do fall, right?

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.671
Look, I could say that in every
10 people, it falls with 8.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.248
- But let's skip this subject!
- Sure! Let's skip this subject.

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:55.119
- Let's skip, then!
- Let's skip.

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.301
We skip.
This subject is skipped.

00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.901
So we don't fall!

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:06.806
- Let me ask you something.
- Ask away.

00:03:06.806 --> 00:03:14.946
How long have we been fixing
dentures on the roof of the mouth?

00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:21.950
That's an interesting question, because
most people use the grandma kind,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.323
the one you take off at night
and put it in a glass of water,

00:03:26.323 --> 00:03:31.287
this is the picture people have of dentures. But
now there's models that can access the internet!

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:39.134
Dentures' technology
rivals cars', for instance.

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:46.087
- Really? Is there any... - All of this to
explain that, to fix on the roof of the mouth,

00:03:46.087 --> 00:03:51.360
we had people who used super
glue to do that, literally!

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.901
And this kind of... That was
toxic. It could kill someone.

00:03:55.901 --> 00:04:03.024
So we began to research vacuum
systems to lock the dentures!

00:04:07.517 --> 00:04:12.298
"Sign Language", Gustavo
Miranda, ladies and gentlemen!

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.981
I think you heard it wrong,
Gustavo. He said 'vacuum'!

00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:25.102
I heard 'cow'!

00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:28.703
