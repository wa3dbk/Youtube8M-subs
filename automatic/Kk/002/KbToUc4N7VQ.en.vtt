00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
are better than you magic is a game

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.570 
are better than you magic is a game
that's<00:03:57.960> very<00:03:58.200> complicated<00:03:58.800> there's<00:03:59.340> also<00:03:59.460> a

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
that's very complicated there's also a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.190 
that's very complicated there's also a
lot<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.760> variance<00:04:00.210> to<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.480> too<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:00.840> it's<00:04:00.990> easy

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
lot of variance to it too so it's easy

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.350 
lot of variance to it too so it's easy
to<00:04:01.500> attribute<00:04:01.890> your<00:04:01.920> losses<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:03.000> not<00:04:03.150> drawing

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
to attribute your losses to not drawing

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.580 
to attribute your losses to not drawing
enough<00:04:03.600> lands<00:04:03.840> or<00:04:04.050> not<00:04:04.170> drawing<00:04:04.350> enough

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
enough lands or not drawing enough

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.500 
enough lands or not drawing enough
spells<00:04:04.920> but<00:04:05.520> there's<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.940> lot<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.210> room<00:04:06.480> to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
spells but there's a lot of room to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.390 
spells but there's a lot of room to
improve<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.710> really<00:04:07.890> only<00:04:08.100> get<00:04:08.310> to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400
