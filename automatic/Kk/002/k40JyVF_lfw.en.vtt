hello<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.260> I'd<00:00:02.190> like<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.520> show<00:00:02.820> you<00:00:02.879> my<00:00:03.210> tupid

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hello guys I'd like to show you my tupid

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.380 
hello guys I'd like to show you my tupid
al<00:00:04.049> you<00:00:04.230> design<00:00:04.529> it<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:05.700> capable<00:00:06.089> of

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
al you design it is capable of

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.820 
al you design it is capable of
performing<00:00:07.250> addition<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.639> subtraction<00:00:09.389> as

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
performing addition and subtraction as

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.589 
performing addition and subtraction as
well<00:00:10.830> as<00:00:10.980> between<00:00:11.550> end<00:00:12.210> or<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.990> xor<00:00:14.360> it<00:00:15.360> is

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
well as between end or and xor it is

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.370 
well as between end or and xor it is
fairly<00:00:15.960> compact<00:00:16.470> my<00:00:17.460> design<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.390> uh<00:00:18.420> let's

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
fairly compact my design it is uh let's

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.320 
fairly compact my design it is uh let's
see<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:21.020> seven<00:00:22.020> wide<00:00:25.160> 17<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.340> length<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.119> it's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
see it's seven wide 17 in length so it's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.070 
see it's seven wide 17 in length so it's
rather<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.800> long<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.630> seven<00:00:30.960> in

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
rather a long one and it's seven in

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.610 
rather a long one and it's seven in
height<00:00:32.239> yeah<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.630> case<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.079> haven't<00:00:34.170> noticed

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
height yeah in case you haven't noticed

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.470 
height yeah in case you haven't noticed
I<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> cold<00:00:36.680> that's<00:00:37.680> why<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> sound<00:00:38.480> quite

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
I have a cold that's why I sound quite

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.069 
I have a cold that's why I sound quite
funny<00:00:39.750> today<00:00:41.930> sorry<00:00:42.930> Baghdad<00:00:44.840> these<00:00:45.840> two

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
funny today sorry Baghdad these two

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.400 
funny today sorry Baghdad these two
lures<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:46.829> symbolize<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.200> 21<00:00:49.200> bit

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
lures here they symbolize the 21 bit

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
lures here they symbolize the 21 bit
inputs<00:00:50.090> we<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.300> turn<00:00:51.539> these<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
inputs we can turn these on there so the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.110 
inputs we can turn these on there so the
input<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.930> now<00:00:55.110> 11<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.489> ALU<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.730> input

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
input is now 11 for this ALU the input

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.660 
input is now 11 for this ALU the input
goes<00:01:01.730> down<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:03.120> into<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.539> full<00:01:04.049> letter<00:01:04.670> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
goes down here into a full letter this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.280 
goes down here into a full letter this
construction<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> full<00:01:07.110> letter

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
construction on here is a full letter

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.210 
construction on here is a full letter
and<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.570> well<00:01:10.020> goes<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.930> free<00:01:13.220> big

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and it as well goes up here in free big

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.560 
and it as well goes up here in free big
by<00:01:14.369> skates<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.020> 6<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:16.650> gate<00:01:17.570> this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
by skates this here is 6 or gate this

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.600 
by skates this here is 6 or gate this
here<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.200> gate<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> end

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
here is the or gate and this is the end

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.100 
here is the or gate and this is the end
gate

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.690 

this<00:01:24.710> lure<00:01:24.950> here<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:26.210> carry<00:01:26.630> input<00:01:26.840> of

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
this lure here is the carry input of

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:37.300 
this lure here is the carry input of
this<00:01:29.440> adder<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:35.110> over<00:01:36.110> here<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.710> course<00:01:36.920> we

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
this adder and over here is of course we

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.560 
this adder and over here is of course we
carry<00:01:37.610> output<00:01:37.850> for<00:01:38.540> of<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.140> error

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.440 

so<00:01:44.230> because<00:01:44.590> all<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:44.890> these<00:01:45.159> gates<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.820> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
so because all of these gates and the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.620 
so because all of these gates and the
other<00:01:46.600> are<00:01:47.010> activated<00:01:48.010> at<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.159> same<00:01:48.400> time<00:01:48.670> we

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
other are activated at the same time we

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.710 
other are activated at the same time we
need<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:50.220> multiplexer<00:01:51.220> or<00:01:51.430> some<00:01:52.090> kind<00:01:52.300> of<00:01:52.360> logic

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
need a multiplexer or some kind of logic

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.760 
need a multiplexer or some kind of logic
unit<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:54.330> display<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.570> proper<00:01:56.050> tract<00:01:56.350> we<00:01:56.590> want

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
unit to display the proper tract we want

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.680 
unit to display the proper tract we want
to<00:01:56.979> select<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.610> end<00:01:57.900> so<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:01.210> here<00:02:01.510> is<00:02:01.660> the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
to select in the end so this here is the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.719 
to select in the end so this here is the
final<00:02:02.110> output<00:02:02.440> of<00:02:03.330> our<00:02:04.330> ALU<00:02:05.050> as<00:02:05.430> well<00:02:06.430> as<00:02:06.550> on

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
final output of our ALU as well as on

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.540 
final output of our ALU as well as on
the<00:02:06.910> other<00:02:07.000> side<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:08.590> are<00:02:08.770> exactly<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.310> same

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
the other side they are exactly the same

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.180 
the other side they are exactly the same
so<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.060> doesn't<00:02:10.360> matter<00:02:10.450> which<00:02:10.600> side<00:02:11.190> you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
so it doesn't matter which side you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:21.780 
so it doesn't matter which side you
prefer<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:17.820> these<00:02:18.820> two<00:02:19.060> inputs<00:02:19.480> here<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:21.100> for

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
prefer and these two inputs here is for

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.870 
prefer and these two inputs here is for
the<00:02:22.060> track<00:02:22.450> selection<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:27.250> can<00:02:27.430> see<00:02:27.640> here

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
the track selection you can see here

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.640 
the track selection you can see here
these<00:02:28.060> four<00:02:28.450> tracks<00:02:28.780> on<00:02:28.959> top<00:02:30.600> these<00:02:31.600> free<00:02:32.380> are

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
these four tracks on top these free are

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.370 
these four tracks on top these free are
hooked<00:02:32.950> up<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.489> free<00:02:33.700> gates<00:02:33.970> here<00:02:34.300> in

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
hooked up to the free gates here in

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.830 
hooked up to the free gates here in
citrix<00:02:35.380> or<00:02:35.620> gate<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.580> or<00:02:37.030> gate<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.720> end

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
citrix or gate the or gate and the end

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.130 
citrix or gate the or gate and the end
gate<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.640> one<00:02:39.850> over<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:40.090> goes<00:02:40.600> comes

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
gate and this one over here goes comes

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.720 
gate and this one over here goes comes
from<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.580> arrow<00:02:42.580> down<00:02:42.880> here<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.800> now<00:02:45.100> let's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
from the arrow down here so now let's

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.720 
from the arrow down here so now let's
have<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.000> look<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.450> torture<00:02:46.840> sir<00:02:47.730> this

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
have a look on the torture sir this

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.030 
have a look on the torture sir this
track<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.090> selected<00:02:49.660> at<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.019> moment<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.860> this

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
track is selected at the moment so this

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.340 
track is selected at the moment so this
means<00:02:51.220> six<00:02:51.549> or<00:02:51.760> gate<00:02:51.970> pigs<00:02:52.750> or<00:02:52.959> gate<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.200> off

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
means six or gate pigs or gate is off

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.580 
means six or gate pigs or gate is off
the<00:02:54.250> output<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.610> off<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.170> seems<00:02:56.410> to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
the output is off so and it seems to

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.780 
the output is off so and it seems to
work<00:02:56.850> now<00:02:57.850> let's<00:02:58.060> see<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:59.380> end<00:02:59.920> gate<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.640> of

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
work now let's see the end gate is on of

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.670 
work now let's see the end gate is on of
course<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.620> let's<00:03:02.890> pick<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.430> end<00:03:03.549> gate<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:05.560> you

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
course so let's pick the end gate if you

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.930 
course so let's pick the end gate if you
switch<00:03:05.890> both<00:03:06.130> on<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:09.100> track<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.549> selected

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
switch both on this track is selected

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.910 
switch both on this track is selected
and<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.850> end<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.209> is<00:03:13.299> also<00:03:13.810> be<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.380> final

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
and the end get is also be a final

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.309 
and the end get is also be a final
output<00:03:15.070> is<00:03:15.370> all

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.830 

now<00:03:19.189> the<00:03:19.249> fun<00:03:19.519> thing<00:03:19.849> about<00:03:19.879> this<00:03:20.359> is<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.629> you

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
now the fun thing about this is that you

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.649 
now the fun thing about this is that you
can<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:21.340> put<00:03:22.340> these<00:03:22.659> constructions

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
can just put these constructions

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.910 
can just put these constructions
side-by-side<00:03:24.499> and<00:03:25.420> build<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.719> much<00:03:26.989> bigger<00:03:27.319> ALU

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
side-by-side and build a much bigger ALU

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.239 
side-by-side and build a much bigger ALU
so<00:03:28.790> for<00:03:29.150> example<00:03:29.239> if<00:03:29.629> you<00:03:29.810> put<00:03:30.079> eight<00:03:30.859> of<00:03:31.099> these

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:31.249 
so for example if you put eight of these

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:33.789 
so for example if you put eight of these
inside<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.849> each<00:03:31.969> other<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:33.049> can<00:03:33.260> chain<00:03:33.560> these

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
inside of each other you can chain these

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.839 
inside of each other you can chain these
just<00:03:34.639> like<00:03:34.909> linking<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.959> carry<00:03:36.469> output<00:03:36.849> to

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
just like linking the carry output to

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.920 
just like linking the carry output to
the<00:03:37.879> carry<00:03:38.450> input<00:03:38.659> of<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.019> next<00:03:39.139> one<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:40.930> you

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
the carry input of the next one and you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.280 
the carry input of the next one and you
can<00:03:42.310> build<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.579> very<00:03:44.120> big<00:03:44.329> area<00:03:44.629> you<00:03:44.870> with<00:03:45.079> this

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
can build a very big area you with this

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.929 
can build a very big area you with this
design<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.889> actually<00:03:46.519> quite<00:03:46.700> easily

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:46.939 
design and actually quite easily

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:56.420 
design and actually quite easily
especially<00:03:47.629> with<00:03:48.139> MCEdit

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.589 

and<00:03:56.549> i<00:03:57.180> think<00:03:57.239> i'm<00:03:57.659> going<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.200> do<00:03:58.439> a<00:03:58.469> 8-bit<00:03:59.569> so<00:04:00.569> a

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
and i think i'm going to do a 8-bit so a

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.220 
and i think i'm going to do a 8-bit so a
one-bite<00:04:01.379> ALU<00:04:01.950> with<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.640> design<00:04:03.170> add<00:04:04.170> a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
one-bite ALU with this design add a

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.339 
one-bite ALU with this design add a
little<00:04:04.500> bit<00:04:04.769> of<00:04:04.969> memory<00:04:05.969> or<00:04:06.239> like<00:04:06.750> registers

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
little bit of memory or like registers

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.690 
little bit of memory or like registers
or<00:04:07.469> something<00:04:07.890> for<00:04:08.730> storing<00:04:09.239> values<00:04:09.659> and<00:04:10.700> I

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
or something for storing values and I

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.660 
or something for storing values and I
think<00:04:12.480> it's<00:04:12.629> going<00:04:12.719> to<00:04:12.900> be<00:04:13.019> fun<00:04:13.370> I'll<00:04:14.370> of

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
think it's going to be fun I'll of

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.340 
think it's going to be fun I'll of
