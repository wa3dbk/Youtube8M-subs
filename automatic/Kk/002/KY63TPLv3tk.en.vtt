00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

hey<00:00:00.269> guys<00:00:00.450> today<00:00:01.079> I'm<00:00:01.230> here<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.500> talk<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:02.129> you

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey guys today I'm here to talk to you

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.550 
hey guys today I'm here to talk to you
really<00:00:02.399> quickly<00:00:02.730> about<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.750> different<00:00:04.140> parts

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
really quickly about the different parts

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.470 
really quickly about the different parts
that<00:00:04.770> make<00:00:04.950> up<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.370> trigger<00:00:05.730> trap<00:00:06.029> shield

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
that make up the trigger trap shield

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.930 
that make up the trigger trap shield
it's<00:00:06.960> not<00:00:07.140> very<00:00:07.200> hard<00:00:07.680> but<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.130> figured<00:00:08.550> because

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
it's not very hard but I figured because

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.120 
it's not very hard but I figured because
some<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.360> won't<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.019> familiar<00:00:10.590> with

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
some of you won't be that familiar with

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.490 
some of you won't be that familiar with
electronics<00:00:12.059> I'll<00:00:12.269> give<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.690> quick<00:00:12.870> talk

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
electronics I'll give you a quick talk

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.609 
electronics I'll give you a quick talk
through<00:00:13.740> anyway<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.759> know<00:00:15.170> what<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
through anyway so you know what the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.260 
through anyway so you know what the
different<00:00:16.920> parts<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.970> should<00:00:18.150> be

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
different parts do what you should be

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.120 
different parts do what you should be
looking<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.350> put<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.830> trigger

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
looking for when you put the trigger

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.880 
looking for when you put the trigger
trap<00:00:20.340> together<00:00:20.930> right<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> final<00:00:22.470> device

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
trap together right so the final device

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.359 
trap together right so the final device
is<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.789> sit<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.269> top<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.630> your<00:00:25.199> or<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.250> we

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
is going to sit on top of your or do we

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.089 
is going to sit on top of your or do we
know<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.080> because<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.949> is

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
know and because of that this is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.959 
know and because of that this is
basically<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.550> piggyback<00:00:29.970> device<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:31.969> Arduino

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
basically a piggyback device in Arduino

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.990 
basically a piggyback device in Arduino
world<00:00:33.180> that's<00:00:33.570> known<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.260> shield<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.640> what

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
world that's known as a shield so what

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.869 
world that's known as a shield so what
this<00:00:36.149> does<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.020> buy<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.590> Arduino<00:00:38.579> you

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
this does is that you buy a Arduino you

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
this does is that you buy a Arduino you
load<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> correct<00:00:39.540> software<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.469> through<00:00:40.620> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
load the correct software on through it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.889 
load the correct software on through it
for<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.219> trigger<00:00:41.430> trap<00:00:41.640> then<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.390> place<00:00:42.660> this

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
for the trigger trap then you place this

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.700 
for the trigger trap then you place this
shield<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.649> top<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.840> Arduino<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.020> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
shield on top of your Arduino and it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
shield on top of your Arduino and it
fits<00:00:46.950> perfectly<00:00:47.430> which<00:00:47.850> means<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> all<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
fits perfectly which means that all the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.810 
fits perfectly which means that all the
pins<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> Arduino<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:50.039> being<00:00:50.280> used<00:00:50.489> by

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
pins on the Arduino are being used by

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.930 
pins on the Arduino are being used by
the<00:00:50.879> trigger<00:00:51.570> trap<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> device

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the trigger trap and you get a device

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
the trigger trap and you get a device
that<00:00:53.969> has<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> functionality<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.949> want

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that has all the functionality you want

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.900 
that has all the functionality you want
from<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.660> camera<00:00:57.660> trigger<00:00:58.399> right<00:00:59.399> let's<00:00:59.670> start

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
from a camera trigger right let's start

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
from a camera trigger right let's start
taking<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.270> look<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
taking a look at this on the right you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.479 
taking a look at this on the right you
see<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.719> unused<00:01:03.719> trigger<00:01:04.229> trap<00:01:04.530> board<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
see a unused trigger trap board which is

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
see a unused trigger trap board which is
the<00:01:05.640> same<00:01:05.820> type<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.530> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the same type as you will get when you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.359 
the same type as you will get when you
buy<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:08.400> trigger<00:01:08.820> trap<00:01:09.060> shield<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> top

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
buy your trigger trap shield so the top

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.660 
buy your trigger trap shield so the top
left<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.689> tactile<00:01:13.670> momentary

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
left here we have a tactile momentary

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
left here we have a tactile momentary
switch<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.750> basically<00:01:16.080> means<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.380> when

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
switch that basically means that when

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.960 
switch that basically means that when
you<00:01:16.650> press<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:16.950> down<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.430> makes<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.759> connection

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you press it down it makes a connection

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.109 
you press it down it makes a connection
and<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.600> let<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.990> again<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.770> gone<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.310> it's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and we let go again it's gone and it's

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
and we let go again it's gone and it's
called<00:01:21.420> textile<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> gives<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
called textile because it gives you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.050 
called textile because it gives you
little<00:01:22.770> click<00:01:23.159> sound<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.790> press<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
little click sound when you press it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
little click sound when you press it
down<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.200> been<00:01:25.350> pressed

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
down so you know when it's been pressed

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.890 
down so you know when it's been pressed
with<00:01:26.310> five<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.759> these<00:01:26.909> there's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> big<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
with five of these there's a big one and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.469 
with five of these there's a big one and
then<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.920> four<00:01:29.189> smaller<00:01:29.490> ones<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.119> each

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
then we have four smaller ones and each

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.330 
then we have four smaller ones and each
one<00:01:30.750> has<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.900> different<00:01:30.990> function<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.250> it's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
one has a different function and it's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
one has a different function and it's
printed<00:01:32.759> above<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.479> does<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.900> was

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
printed above what it does so this was

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.440 
printed above what it does so this was
the<00:01:34.079> mode<00:01:34.350> button<00:01:34.380> listen<00:01:35.009> select<00:01:35.520> button<00:01:35.790> we

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the mode button listen select button we

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.010 
the mode button listen select button we
have<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> down<00:01:37.500> buttons<00:01:38.960> down<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
have the up and down buttons down the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.670 
have the up and down buttons down the
side<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.729> row<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.409> dots

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
side here we have a row of little dots

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.039 
side here we have a row of little dots
now<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:44.790> little<00:01:45.149> dots<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.659> basically<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
now these little dots are basically the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.190 
now these little dots are basically the
pins<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.280> better<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:48.200> these

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
pins that you can see better here these

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.260 
pins that you can see better here these
are<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> pins<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.829> connect<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.490> into<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
are the pins have connect down into the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
are the pins have connect down into the
trigger<00:01:51.509> trap<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:52.350> look<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.590> strange

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
trigger trap so they look a bit strange

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
trigger trap so they look a bit strange
from<00:01:53.189> above<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> others<00:01:54.509> other

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
from above but from the others other

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
from above but from the others other
side<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.350> makes<00:01:55.560> sense<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.520> just

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
side it makes sense these are just

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
side it makes sense these are just
simple<00:01:56.880> solder<00:01:57.360> points<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.590> makes<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
simple solder points and that makes a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.550 
simple solder points and that makes a
connection<00:02:00.079> then<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
connection then here we have a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.800 
connection then here we have a
photodiode<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.270> sensor<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
photodiode this is a little sensor that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.249 
photodiode this is a little sensor that
helps<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.979> trigger<00:02:05.219> traps<00:02:05.549> see<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.570> ambient

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
helps the trigger traps see the ambient

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.229 
helps the trigger traps see the ambient
light<00:02:07.469> sensor<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.280> will<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.520> using<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:09.000> take

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
light sensor you will be using we take

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.059 
light sensor you will be using we take
pictures<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.569> stuff<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.200> lightning<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:10.979> if

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
pictures of stuff like lightning or if

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.670 
pictures of stuff like lightning or if
you<00:02:11.190> want<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.489> trigger<00:02:11.700> trap<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.330> used<00:02:12.569> as<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you want to trigger trap to be used as a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.149 
you want to trigger trap to be used as a
slave<00:02:14.040> flash<00:02:14.400> trigger<00:02:15.560> here<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:16.709> have<00:02:16.829> a<00:02:16.890> laser

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
slave flash trigger here we have a laser

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.550 
slave flash trigger here we have a laser
sensor<00:02:17.670> that's<00:02:18.060> another<00:02:18.329> photodiode<00:02:19.079> but

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
sensor that's another photodiode but

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280 
sensor that's another photodiode but
this<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:19.890> has<00:02:20.010> been<00:02:20.159> covered<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:21.290> heat

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
this one has been covered in a heat

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.429 
this one has been covered in a heat
shrink<00:02:22.890> wrapper<00:02:23.879> which<00:02:24.540> means<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.989> all<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
shrink wrapper which means that all the

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.830 
shrink wrapper which means that all the
ambient<00:02:25.920> light<00:02:26.189> is<00:02:26.430> hidden<00:02:26.849> from<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.510> only

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
ambient light is hidden from it and only

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.240 
ambient light is hidden from it and only
the<00:02:27.959> light<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.319> comes<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.739> from<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:29.040> bottom

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the light that comes in from the bottom

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.910 
the light that comes in from the bottom
here<00:02:29.609> gets<00:02:30.359> measured<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.379> perfect<00:02:31.769> for

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
here gets measured this is perfect for

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.679 
here gets measured this is perfect for
the<00:02:32.010> laser<00:02:32.219> beam<00:02:32.459> which<00:02:32.760> points<00:02:33.180> straight<00:02:33.480> in

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
the laser beam which points straight in

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.750 
the laser beam which points straight in
here<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.349> then<00:02:34.859> we<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.010> measure<00:02:35.280> properly

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
here and then we can measure properly

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.920 
here and then we can measure properly
when<00:02:36.090> laser<00:02:36.689> beam<00:02:36.900> has<00:02:37.109> been<00:02:37.290> broken<00:02:37.530> or<00:02:37.889> not

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
when laser beam has been broken or not

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.000 
when laser beam has been broken or not
right<00:02:39.930> let's<00:02:40.170> move<00:02:40.290> along<00:02:40.439> a<00:02:40.739> little<00:02:40.889> bit

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
right let's move along a little bit

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.970 
right let's move along a little bit
further<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.810> round<00:02:43.079> thing<00:02:43.170> we<00:02:43.469> have<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:43.829> is

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
further this round thing we have here is

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.759 
further this round thing we have here is
our<00:02:44.129> microphone<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.109> which<00:02:46.109> is<00:02:46.290> being<00:02:46.530> used

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
our microphone and which is being used

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.979 
our microphone and which is being used
for<00:02:46.919> the<00:02:47.280> sound<00:02:47.519> sensor<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.810> being

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
for the sound sensor it's being

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.720 
for the sound sensor it's being
amplified<00:02:49.260> by<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.799> little<00:02:50.010> transistor<00:02:50.400> here

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
amplified by this little transistor here

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.460 
amplified by this little transistor here
and<00:02:50.939> then<00:02:51.299> take<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.659> into<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.019> chip<00:02:52.260> for

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
and then take it into the chip for

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.909 
and then take it into the chip for
analysis<00:02:53.419> move<00:02:54.419> along<00:02:54.569> further<00:02:54.959> we<00:02:55.349> have<00:02:55.379> in

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
analysis move along further we have in

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.940 
analysis move along further we have in
infrared<00:02:56.790> LED<00:02:57.629> that's<00:02:58.139> this<00:02:58.439> little<00:02:58.620> thing

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
infrared LED that's this little thing

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.720 
infrared LED that's this little thing
here<00:02:59.359> now<00:03:00.359> this<00:03:00.569> little<00:03:00.900> device<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.730> can

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
here now this little device and can

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.809 
here now this little device and can
actually<00:03:02.879> transmit<00:03:03.739> infrared<00:03:04.739> signals<00:03:05.310> to

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
actually transmit infrared signals to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.000 
actually transmit infrared signals to
your<00:03:06.209> camera<00:03:06.599> all<00:03:07.169> for<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.709> matter<00:03:07.889> for

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
your camera all for that matter for

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.379 
your camera all for that matter for
anything<00:03:08.280> else<00:03:08.609> if<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.909> can<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.239> of

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
anything else if you can think of

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.569 
anything else if you can think of
anything<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.989> can<00:03:10.139> program<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:11.340> can<00:03:11.489> be

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
anything you can program that can be

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.699 
anything you can program that can be
controlled<00:03:11.939> with<00:03:12.030> infrared<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.349> add<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
controlled with infrared you can add the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.470 
controlled with infrared you can add the
codes<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.280> trigger<00:03:14.579> trap<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.090> then<00:03:15.269> use

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
codes to the trigger trap and then use

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.360 
codes to the trigger trap and then use
it<00:03:15.659> for<00:03:16.169> example<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.560> could<00:03:16.709> use<00:03:16.859> it<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:17.040> clap

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
it for example you could use it to clap

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.580 
it for example you could use it to clap
your<00:03:17.519> hands<00:03:17.729> to<00:03:18.000> turn<00:03:18.359> your<00:03:18.540> TV<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.139> off<00:03:19.260> or

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
your hands to turn your TV on and off or

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.569 
your hands to turn your TV on and off or
whatever<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.849> that<00:03:21.060> one's<00:03:21.209> fine<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:23.549> next

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
whatever so that one's fine the next

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.149 
whatever so that one's fine the next
thing<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.120> here<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.959> row<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.560> pins

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
thing we have here is this row of pins

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.080 
thing we have here is this row of pins
this<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> pin<00:03:27.540> header<00:03:27.840> that's<00:03:28.530> being<00:03:28.739> used

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
this is a pin header that's being used

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.059 
this is a pin header that's being used
when<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.120> plug<00:03:30.510> them<00:03:30.720> screen<00:03:31.470> onto<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
when we plug them screen onto the

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.129 
when we plug them screen onto the
trigger<00:03:32.459> trap<00:03:32.699> and<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.449> screen<00:03:33.659> is<00:03:33.689> not<00:03:33.810> shown

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
trigger trap and the screen is not shown

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.599 
trigger trap and the screen is not shown
in<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.379> picture<00:03:34.560> because<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.220> would<00:03:35.370> cover

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
in this picture because it would cover

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.219 
in this picture because it would cover
some<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.510> other<00:03:36.599> components<00:03:37.079> we're

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
some of the other components we're

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.869 
some of the other components we're
looking<00:03:37.470> at<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:38.129> basically<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.549> just<00:03:38.579> slots

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
looking at but basically it just slots

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.429 
looking at but basically it just slots
into<00:03:39.060> place<00:03:39.329> there<00:03:39.629> and<00:03:39.659> then<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.139> screen

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 
into place there and then the screen

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.479 
into place there and then the screen
starts<00:03:40.829> working<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.449> the<00:03:42.449> middle<00:03:42.720> here<00:03:43.489> we

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
starts working in the middle here we

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.140 
starts working in the middle here we
have<00:03:44.609> this<00:03:44.790> big<00:03:45.739> nxp<00:03:46.739> marked<00:03:47.189> integrated

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
have this big nxp marked integrated

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.869 
have this big nxp marked integrated
circuit<00:03:48.569> this<00:03:49.199> is<00:03:49.349> a<00:03:49.379> register<00:03:49.979> bus<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
circuit this is a register bus the

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.149 
circuit this is a register bus the
reason<00:03:51.120> we're<00:03:51.269> using<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.199> the<00:03:52.769> the

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
reason we're using that is that the the

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.020 
reason we're using that is that the the
Arduino<00:03:53.729> only<00:03:54.060> has<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.569> many<00:03:54.780> pins<00:03:55.229> and<00:03:56.030> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
Arduino only has so many pins and the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.960 
Arduino only has so many pins and the
trigger<00:03:57.659> trap<00:03:57.959> uses<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.739> lot<00:03:59.069> more<00:03:59.310> pins<00:03:59.609> than

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
trigger trap uses a lot more pins than

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.909 
trigger trap uses a lot more pins than
we<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.269> available<00:04:00.479> we<00:04:01.109> use<00:04:01.259> this<00:04:01.409> register

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
we have available we use this register

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.699 
we have available we use this register
bus<00:04:02.099> mostly<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:02.729> control<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> screen<00:04:03.709> right

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
bus mostly to control the screen right

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.809 
bus mostly to control the screen right
and<00:04:05.009> up<00:04:05.909> here<00:04:05.939> we<00:04:06.799> have<00:04:07.799> two<00:04:08.220> interesting

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
and up here we have two interesting

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.520 
and up here we have two interesting
things<00:04:08.849> this<00:04:09.629> one<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:09.870> used<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.199> trigger<00:04:10.409> your

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
things this one is used to trigger your

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.020 
things this one is used to trigger your
camera<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.430> three-and-a-half

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
camera it's a three-and-a-half

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.119 
camera it's a three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:04:12.299> stereo<00:04:13.139> headphone<00:04:13.590> jack<00:04:13.889> and

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
millimeter stereo headphone jack and

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.430 
millimeter stereo headphone jack and
this<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.060> where<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.299> plug<00:04:15.479> in<00:04:15.659> your<00:04:15.870> camera

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
this is where you plug in your camera

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.939 
this is where you plug in your camera
lead<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:17.449> trigger<00:04:18.449> your<00:04:18.509> camera<00:04:18.930> right<00:04:19.560> next

lead to trigger your camera right next

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.979 
lead to trigger your camera right next
to<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.489> little<00:04:20.729> square<00:04:21.030> integrated

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
to it this little square integrated

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.459 
to it this little square integrated
circuit<00:04:22.320> here<00:04:22.529> is<00:04:22.740> our<00:04:23.870> optocoupler<00:04:24.870> this

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
circuit here is our optocoupler this

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.379 
circuit here is our optocoupler this
thing<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.860> for<00:04:25.979> protect<00:04:26.430> your<00:04:26.610> camera

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
thing is for protect your camera

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.170 
thing is for protect your camera
from<00:04:27.569> the<00:04:27.780> trigger<00:04:28.020> trap<00:04:28.259> and<00:04:28.469> vice<00:04:28.680> versa<00:04:29.180> so

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
from the trigger trap and vice versa so

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.459 
from the trigger trap and vice versa so
what's<00:04:30.330> happening<00:04:30.599> here<00:04:30.659> is<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.020> there<00:04:31.379> is

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:31.469 
what's happening here is that there is

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.749 
what's happening here is that there is
inside<00:04:32.120> on<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.330> side<00:04:33.569> there's<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.199> pin<00:04:34.560> with<00:04:35.490> a

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
inside on this side there's a pin with a

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.239 
inside on this side there's a pin with a
little<00:04:36.180> LED<00:04:36.719> on<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.409> lives<00:04:37.680> inside<00:04:37.889> this

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:38.249 
little LED on it it lives inside this

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:40.369 
little LED on it it lives inside this
box<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.909> there's<00:04:39.539> two<00:04:39.749> of<00:04:39.779> them<00:04:39.930> there's<00:04:40.259> one

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
box so there's two of them there's one

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.559 
box so there's two of them there's one
here<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.800> one<00:04:40.860> there<00:04:41.129> now<00:04:41.999> when<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.300> single

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 
here and one there now when a single

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.019 
here and one there now when a single
gets<00:04:42.810> sent<00:04:43.139> through<00:04:43.379> here<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.099> LED<00:04:44.460> lights<00:04:44.729> up

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:45.029 
gets sent through here the LED lights up

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.390 
gets sent through here the LED lights up
and<00:04:45.449> when<00:04:45.749> the<00:04:45.840> LED<00:04:46.139> lights<00:04:46.379> up<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.800> lets<00:04:47.039> power

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
and when the LED lights up it lets power

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.459 
and when the LED lights up it lets power
stream<00:04:47.939> through<00:04:48.270> here<00:04:48.599> the<00:04:49.080> same<00:04:49.259> thing

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
stream through here the same thing

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.519 
stream through here the same thing
happens<00:04:49.740> up<00:04:49.889> here<00:04:50.419> power<00:04:51.419> goes<00:04:51.629> through<00:04:51.930> LED

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:52.529 
happens up here power goes through LED

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:54.860 
happens up here power goes through LED
goes<00:04:52.740> on<00:04:53.069> and<00:04:53.370> power<00:04:53.849> gets<00:04:54.120> lets<00:04:54.360> through<00:04:54.629> here

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
goes on and power gets lets through here

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.170 
goes on and power gets lets through here
now<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.710> reason<00:04:56.009> we've<00:04:56.310> done<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.729> is<00:04:56.999> that

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
now the reason we've done that is that

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.330 
now the reason we've done that is that
because<00:04:57.330> this<00:04:57.659> is<00:04:57.779> done<00:04:57.930> with<00:04:58.110> light<00:04:58.469> there<00:04:59.219> is

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
because this is done with light there is

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.269 
because this is done with light there is
no<00:04:59.639> actual<00:05:00.349> electrical<00:05:01.349> connection<00:05:01.889> between

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:02.279 
no actual electrical connection between

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.420 
no actual electrical connection between
your<00:05:02.580> camera<00:05:03.029> and<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.479> trigger<00:05:03.719> trap<00:05:04.250> it's<00:05:05.250> not

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
your camera and a trigger trap it's not

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.969 
your camera and a trigger trap it's not
completely<00:05:05.939> fail<00:05:06.270> proof<00:05:06.569> if<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.050> if<00:05:07.680> your

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
completely fail proof if you if your

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.559 
completely fail proof if you if your
trigger<00:05:08.550> trap<00:05:08.789> were<00:05:08.909> to<00:05:09.029> be<00:05:09.150> struck<00:05:09.419> by

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
trigger trap were to be struck by

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:10.939 
trigger trap were to be struck by
lightning<00:05:10.080> there's<00:05:10.319> a<00:05:10.349> good<00:05:10.500> chance<00:05:10.740> that

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
lightning there's a good chance that

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.149 
lightning there's a good chance that
your<00:05:11.069> camera<00:05:11.219> will<00:05:11.520> go<00:05:11.699> but<00:05:12.509> in<00:05:13.409> theory<00:05:13.770> anyway

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
your camera will go but in theory anyway

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.629 
your camera will go but in theory anyway
it's<00:05:14.340> quite<00:05:14.520> well-protected<00:05:14.750> right<00:05:16.490> on<00:05:17.490> the

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
it's quite well-protected right on the

round thing in the middle this is a

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.499 
round thing in the middle this is a
capacitor<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:44.189> which<00:05:45.149> is<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.419> only

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
capacitor and which is the only

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.719 
capacitor and which is the only
capacitor<00:05:46.229> on<00:05:46.379> here<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.649> is<00:05:46.949> directional

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
capacitor on here that is directional

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.249 
capacitor on here that is directional
which<00:05:48.180> means<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:48.509> have<00:05:48.659> to<00:05:48.689> be<00:05:48.839> quite<00:05:49.050> careful

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
which means you have to be quite careful

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.409 
which means you have to be quite careful
that<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:49.710> plug<00:05:50.069> it<00:05:50.219> in<00:05:50.339> the<00:05:50.490> right<00:05:50.699> way<00:05:50.759> plug

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
that you plug it in the right way plug

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.629 
that you plug it in the right way plug
it<00:05:51.509> in<00:05:51.599> the<00:05:51.659> wrong<00:05:51.810> way<00:05:51.870> it<00:05:52.289> won't<00:05:52.529> work<00:05:52.649> so<00:05:53.339> we

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
it in the wrong way it won't work so we

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.040 
it in the wrong way it won't work so we
have<00:05:53.789> a<00:05:53.819> couple<00:05:54.120> of<00:05:54.210> other<00:05:54.360> things<00:05:54.629> on<00:05:54.779> here<00:05:54.930> as

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
have a couple of other things on here as

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.559 
have a couple of other things on here as
well<00:05:55.080> we<00:05:55.649> have<00:05:55.740> a<00:05:55.770> transistor<00:05:56.339> here<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:57.000> a

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
well we have a transistor here and a

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
different lesson you can do about that

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.110 
different lesson you can do about that
I'd<00:07:02.560> suggest<00:07:03.040> to<00:07:03.190> read<00:07:03.400> up<00:07:03.550> on<00:07:03.700> them<00:07:03.850> if<00:07:04.000> you're

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
I'd suggest to read up on them if you're

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.060 
I'd suggest to read up on them if you're
not<00:07:04.240> quite<00:07:04.480> sure<00:07:04.510> what<00:07:04.870> the<00:07:04.960> resistors<00:07:05.380> do<00:07:05.560> but

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
not quite sure what the resistors do but

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.340 
not quite sure what the resistors do but
they're<00:07:06.190> really<00:07:06.310> interesting<00:07:06.850> to<00:07:07.170> to<00:07:08.170> know<00:07:08.320> a

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
they're really interesting to to know a

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.020 
they're really interesting to to know a
little<00:07:08.500> bit<00:07:08.710> more<00:07:08.890> about<00:07:08.950> what<00:07:09.190> they<00:07:09.610> do<00:07:09.670> and

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
little bit more about what they do and

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.310 
little bit more about what they do and
as<00:07:10.450> you're<00:07:10.630> putting<00:07:10.840> your<00:07:10.900> trigger<00:07:11.110> trap

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
as you're putting your trigger trap

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.990 
as you're putting your trigger trap
together<00:07:11.620> you'll<00:07:12.070> probably<00:07:12.250> figure<00:07:12.580> out<00:07:12.730> and

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
together you'll probably figure out and

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.240 
together you'll probably figure out and
what<00:07:13.600> each<00:07:13.750> of<00:07:13.930> them<00:07:14.110> do<00:07:14.260> as<00:07:14.500> you<00:07:14.710> trace<00:07:15.010> what

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
what each of them do as you trace what

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.430 
what each of them do as you trace what
how<00:07:15.430> they're<00:07:15.640> connected<00:07:16.140> now<00:07:17.140> that<00:07:17.290> we've

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
how they're connected now that we've

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.020 
how they're connected now that we've
talked<00:07:17.650> a<00:07:17.770> little<00:07:17.920> bit<00:07:18.130> about<00:07:18.370> how<00:07:18.610> all<00:07:18.880> the

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
talked a little bit about how all the

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.910 
talked a little bit about how all the
different<00:07:19.300> parts<00:07:19.540> fit<00:07:19.720> together<00:07:19.840> in<00:07:20.320> the<00:07:20.680> next

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:20.920 
different parts fit together in the next

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.070 
different parts fit together in the next
video<00:07:21.010> we'll<00:07:21.490> see<00:07:21.970> how<00:07:22.000> to<00:07:22.570> actually<00:07:22.780> build

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
video we'll see how to actually build

video we'll see how to actually build
one<00:07:23.410> of<00:07:23.440> these<00:07:23.650> so<00:07:24.310> we'll<00:07:24.460> go<00:07:24.610> from<00:07:24.940> the

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
one of these so we'll go from the
