00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.550
 good to all welcome to a new 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.519
 good video does not know little about 7 to 5 and 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.519
 the information that arrives is very very little 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.990
 yesterday between yesterday and today a news came out 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.230
 quite that left me quite badly 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.630
 of mouth is not news that good not 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.029
 I was 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.660
 not confirmed either but he was with 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.830
 quite good arguments in my opinion 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.960
 the news says so clearly 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.290
 7 to 5 mbps and are 3 could have worse 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.780
 graphics that in 360 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.710
 what this is based on is going to be what 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.960
 we all know no entertainment network 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.920
 it was worse on playstation3 than on xbox 360 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.890
 7 to 4 same 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 it was worse in precision 3 than in xbox 360 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.329
 and what is this all due to the one who owes 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.460
 that you can think the same thing is said 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.420
 that the version that I use 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.759
 rockstar for the gta 5 trailer was from 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.610
 xbox 360 is a pretty possibility 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.259
 high if it were like that they are supposed to be 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.380
 developing it mainly for 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.720
 xbox what would give us a port for 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.780
 playstation3 are by means of that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.909
 ends with a console and is transferred to 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.460
 the other good by modifying some things 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.440
 which is more complicated than me 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.530
 right now I 'm not going to detail in a 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.090
 video because they are too long to explain 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.210
 and maybe I'll explain to bad I do not know 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.789
 I understood you would not understand me well or not 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.100
 base the base console would be that it costs 60 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.090
 what I would notice that in three 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.090
 more likely it was worse 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.590
 and the safest thing is that I started to be better 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.450
 that in a team 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.030
 if there are three for those who are thinking 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.900
 in all this surely come out later 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.700
 but it has improved 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.950
 What do I think about this 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.430
 news I see it reliable I do not see it reliable 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.830
 I really is possible if possible 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.010
 that this should happen we have 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.640
 seen in the previous two games we have 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.369
 viewed 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.140
 change in some scenes something radical 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.410
 is the case of gta 4 good 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.870
 the truth was felt sincerely 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.300
 I noticed in 3-d prevention not only take 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.569
 so much more than anything there was more vegetation 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.250
 there was a more alive world as well 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.690
 small details that touch you 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.860
 balls you have not spent the same 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.820
 money that a user of xbox 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.010
 and you want the same thing the most normal thing is that 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.590
 you want the same thing but good what there is 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.120
 is what happens and basically I have done 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.440
 this news to know what you think 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.500
 you guys think that rockstar is going 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.360
 to do it right this time and it will not take 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.800
 anything 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.580
 above all what must be highlighted the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.400
 4 people 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.580
 is that the multiplayer company are three 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.130
 at the beginning it was very very bad that 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.390
 bought game at first as I will know what 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.400
 what am I saying and will I know what 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.230
 I mean it was very wrong you could not invite 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.120
 nothing and it took a long time 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.860
 fix it pretty enough 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.590
 the problem gta 51 and the same 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.080
 and I do not think they do it is possible 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.480
 possible has said before in my opinion what 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.890
 which could happen if it may be that what 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.800
 better have worse graphics and such but 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.720
 that the difference is not so high 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.020
 make it a tiny difference 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.600
 do not think that it is going to end 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.010
 this generation or I think it's going to 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.530
 be the last rockstar game for 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.560
 this generation and in the next have 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.570
 that I gain confidence no no I do not think 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.650
 want to lose people 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.690
 What will happen to us is that they lose 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.360
 people people are not going to change 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.460
 console just like that for a for a game 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.800
 they make me case people do not change by 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.030
 a player people yes but not all 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.880
 the world is changed by a game it 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.400
 They exchanged for another type of things not 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.080
 I have faith that I also have faith 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.910
 I have faith the course of the fingers 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.300
 I already have the information that comes out 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.630
 gta 5 is very rare you almost do not have to 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.090
 sale is a type to these 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.920
 and the truth I want a good news not 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.940
 I want news of this kind of a whore 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.670
 time I want the good news fuck very 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.010
 good kids I hope you think what 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.750
 what do you think and talio my opinion he has 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.240
 left has not made it very clear is 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.240
 clear one or two very clear that either 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.529
 I do not know my feelings go to what I know 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:45.149
 what I want, I do not know what is very 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.669
 likely to come back the same thing happens 

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:50.639
 always and I want it not to happen not if I 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:54.210
 they understand if they read it they catch it but 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.330
 good what what I pretend to say 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.880
 nothing more kids this has been all 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.639
 good as an exception the 'dwarf' bar 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.610
 It will also make subtract but 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.280
 developed by team gbandi and it was better 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.620
 companies are three that in xbox 360 but 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.100
 good 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.230
 to see what happens this time 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.990
