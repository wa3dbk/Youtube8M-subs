today I'm going to be talking a little
bit<00:00:02.220> about<00:00:02.399> expansion<00:00:02.909> tanks<00:00:03.419> going<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.020> tell

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
bit about expansion tanks going to tell

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.990 
bit about expansion tanks going to tell
you<00:00:04.259> how<00:00:04.500> much<00:00:04.710> pressure<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.250> put<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.520> them<00:00:05.670> how

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
you how much pressure to put in them how

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.639 
you how much pressure to put in them how
to<00:00:06.060> tell<00:00:06.420> how<00:00:06.600> much<00:00:06.779> pressure<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.259> put<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.529> them

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
we would charge it for so you pre charge

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060 
you'll start popping off relief valves
so<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> pre<00:01:40.560> charge<00:01:40.860> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so you're going to pre charge this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.580 
so you're going to pre charge this
before<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> connect<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.420> why<00:01:42.899> before<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
before you connect it why before you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.410 
before you connect it why before you
connect<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.130> pay<00:01:44.340> close<00:01:44.670> attention<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.240> this

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
connect it pay close attention to this

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.969 
connect it pay close attention to this
why<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.079> preach<00:01:46.259> our<00:01:46.470> JIT<00:01:46.649> before<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
why do you preach our JIT before you

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.920 
why do you preach our JIT before you
connect<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.939> hook<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> 70

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
connect it if you hook it to the 70

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.710 
connect it if you hook it to the 70
pound<00:01:49.369> system<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.610> has<00:01:50.790> 12<00:01:51.060> pounds<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.509> there

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
pound system and has 12 pounds in there

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
pound system and has 12 pounds in there
when<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.500> check<00:01:53.220> your<00:01:53.369> pressure<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.880> here

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
when you check your pressure right here

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.460 
when you check your pressure right here
it's<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> show<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.840> seventy<00:01:55.170> pounds

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it's going to show you seventy pounds

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.139 
it's going to show you seventy pounds
because<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.920> air<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.280> now<00:01:56.399> compressed<00:01:56.909> by

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
because that air is now compressed by

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.340 
because that air is now compressed by
the<00:01:57.210> pressure<00:01:57.570> coming<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> from<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.259> other

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the pressure coming in from the other

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.920 
the pressure coming in from the other
side<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.799> before<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.790> connect<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.329> before<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
side so before you connect it before you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.080 
side so before you connect it before you
connect<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.409> did<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.130> hear<00:02:02.310> me<00:02:02.460> before<00:02:02.939> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
connect it did you hear me before you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.350 
connect it did you hear me before you
connect<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.990> need<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.350> pre<00:02:04.560> charge<00:02:04.890> this

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
connect it you need to pre charge this

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.880 
connect it you need to pre charge this
this<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.479> another<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> my<00:02:07.049> famous<00:02:07.409> not<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
this is another one of my famous not to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.320 
this is another one of my famous not to
scale<00:02:08.099> drawings<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.819> supposed<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
scale drawings this is supposed to be a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.090 
scale drawings this is supposed to be a
tank<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:09.989> your<00:02:10.319> system<00:02:10.679> connect

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
tank this is your system connect

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.280 
tank this is your system connect
coming<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.300> an<00:02:12.420> isolation<00:02:12.900> valve

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
coming in this is an isolation valve

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.560 
coming in this is an isolation valve
ball<00:02:13.710> valve<00:02:14.040> whatever<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.910> want<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.150> use<00:02:15.330> I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
ball valve whatever you want to use I

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.080 
ball valve whatever you want to use I
recommend<00:02:16.530> putting<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.890> tee<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.430> another<00:02:17.850> ball

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
recommend putting a tee and another ball

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.120 
recommend putting a tee and another ball
valve<00:02:18.390> here<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.870> way<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.470> isolate<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
valve here that way you can isolate the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.910 
valve here that way you can isolate the
tank<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.670> take<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.480> system<00:02:21.750> pressure<00:02:22.200> off<00:02:22.500> of

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
tank and take the system pressure off of

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.650 
tank and take the system pressure off of
this<00:02:23.070> tank<00:02:23.370> when<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.700> isolate<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.390> here<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
this tank when you isolate it here and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.360 
this tank when you isolate it here and
open<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.020> one<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.710> you'll<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.070> able<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
open this one then you'll be able to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.550 
open this one then you'll be able to
read<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.790> charge<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.930> cannot<00:02:28.290> isolate

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
read that charge if you cannot isolate

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560 
read that charge if you cannot isolate
the<00:02:29.040> tank<00:02:29.340> or<00:02:29.610> if<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.940> cannot<00:02:30.210> take<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
the tank or if you cannot take the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.270 
the tank or if you cannot take the
pressure<00:02:30.810> off<00:02:30.990> whatever<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.890> system

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
pressure off whatever the system

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.740 
pressure off whatever the system
pressure<00:02:32.460> is<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.210> read<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
pressure is is going to read on that

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.150 
pressure is is going to read on that
tank<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> won't<00:02:34.440> know<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:34.770> your<00:02:34.950> pre

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
tank and you won't know what your pre

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.790 
tank and you won't know what your pre
charge<00:02:35.490> was
