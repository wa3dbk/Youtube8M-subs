00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
models and these are models that I

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.870 
models and these are models that I
wanted<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.300> grow<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> while<00:00:09.690> now<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.880> finally

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
wanted to grow a while now and finally

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.530 
wanted to grow a while now and finally
picking<00:00:12.240> up<00:00:12.389> because<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.719> had<00:00:12.960> extra<00:00:13.320> money<00:00:13.349> and

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
picking up because I had extra money and

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.660 
picking up because I had extra money and
there<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:15.660> nothing<00:00:16.049> really<00:00:16.289> else<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:17.580> I

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
there was nothing really else that I

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.120 
there was nothing really else that I
wanted<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.449> cost<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.560> amount<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.920> money

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
wanted that cost the amount of money

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.689 
wanted that cost the amount of money
that<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.400> had<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.449> figured<00:00:22.140> I'd<00:00:22.230> go<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> my

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
that I had so I figured I'd go to my

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.810 
that I had so I figured I'd go to my
never-ending<00:00:23.699> list<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.130> I'll<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.490> get<00:00:26.699> off

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
never-ending list and I'll just get off

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630 
never-ending list and I'll just get off
and<00:00:27.029> order<00:00:27.269> models<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.779> there<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.490> one<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.609> two

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and order models on there and one or two

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.690 
and order models on there and one or two
things<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.359> there<00:00:31.070> are<00:00:32.070> stuff<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.430> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
things on there are stuff that I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.440 
things on there are stuff that I
actually<00:00:34.399> you<00:00:35.399> know<00:00:35.430> wouldn't<00:00:35.910> expect<00:00:36.210> myself

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
actually you know wouldn't expect myself

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.010 
actually you know wouldn't expect myself
to<00:00:36.750> order<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:38.390> um<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.540> ordered<00:00:39.870> them<00:00:40.260> anyway

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
first thing I want to take out is the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.420 
first thing I want to take out is the
Bobcat<00:00:44.670> s<00:00:44.910> 175<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> something<00:00:47.160> that

Bobcat s 175 and this is something that

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.160 
Bobcat s 175 and this is something that
I<00:00:47.460> could<00:00:47.579> see<00:00:47.850> myself<00:00:47.879> ordering<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.020> two

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
I could see myself ordering one or two

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.549 
I could see myself ordering one or two
more<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.850> number<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.289> price

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
more of number one because of the price

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
more of number one because of the price
and<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.760> actually<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.629> these<00:00:54.840> smaller

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and I actually really like these smaller

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.229 
and I actually really like these smaller
models<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.070> some<00:00:56.250> reason<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> someone

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
models not for some reason and someone

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
models not for some reason and someone
told<00:01:00.420> me<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> don't<00:01:01.079> expect<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.800> too<00:01:01.980> nice

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
told me I don't expect it to be too nice

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.609 
told me I don't expect it to be too nice
but<00:01:02.660> looking<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.780> right<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> doesn't

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
but looking at it right now it doesn't

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
but looking at it right now it doesn't
actually<00:01:04.710> look<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.339> bad<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:07.200> definitely

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
actually look that bad it's definitely

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.920 
actually look that bad it's definitely
very<00:01:07.920> small<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:09.210> again<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:09.750> like

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
very small but then again you know like

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
very small but then again you know like
a<00:01:09.960> bobcat<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.530> real<00:01:10.830> life<00:01:11.040> isn't<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.520> large

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a bobcat in real life isn't that large

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.899 
a bobcat in real life isn't that large
at<00:01:12.060> all<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.979> it's<00:01:13.979> actually<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.580> bad

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
at all and it's actually not that bad

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.120 
at all and it's actually not that bad
now<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.530> hands<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.040> I

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
now that I have it in my hands and I

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.749 
now that I have it in my hands and I
know<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.369> sounds<00:01:17.580> crazy<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:19.729> actually<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
know that sounds crazy but actually a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.100 
know that sounds crazy but actually a
really<00:01:20.939> nice<00:01:21.150> model<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:21.750> probably<00:01:21.900> gonna

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
really nice model and I'm probably gonna

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.620 
really nice model and I'm probably gonna
order<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.439> more<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.790> would<00:01:23.880> also<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.270> really

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
order one more it would also look really

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.270 
order one more it would also look really
cool<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.990> diorama<00:01:25.350> being<00:01:25.680> lifted<00:01:25.860> from<00:01:26.040> an

because I seen caterpillar 7:29 get it
and<00:01:57.110> after<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.140> seen<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.680> had<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.310> it

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
and also a lot of people always ask me

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.350 
and also a lot of people always ask me
why<00:02:01.979> don't<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.280> collect<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> older<00:02:02.970> machines

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
have any older machines because I have

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.910 
have any older machines because I have
the<00:02:07.380> Northwest's<00:02:07.950> 25<00:02:08.490> now<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.959> overall<00:02:10.770> I'd

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the Northwest's 25 now and I overall I'd

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.160 
the Northwest's 25 now and I overall I'd
really<00:02:11.190> like<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.459> look<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.880> model<00:02:12.240> this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
really like to look at this model this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.140 
really like to look at this model this
is<00:02:13.380> one<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> models<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.760> was<00:02:14.970> not

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
is one of the models that I was not

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.740 
is one of the models that I was not
expecting<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.750> order<00:02:16.170> at<00:02:16.380> all<00:02:16.640> but<00:02:17.640> um<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.239> seen

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
expecting to order at all but um I seen

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.290 
expecting to order at all but um I seen
the<00:02:18.840> price<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.470> was<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.709> 45<00:02:20.489> bucks<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the price of it it was like 45 bucks and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.940 
the price of it it was like 45 bucks and
I<00:02:21.450> thought<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.900> was<00:02:22.020> more<00:02:22.290> than<00:02:22.500> reasonable

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
I thought that was more than reasonable

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.790 
I thought that was more than reasonable
I<00:02:23.340> wasn't<00:02:24.150> gonna<00:02:24.239> pay<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.750> 80<00:02:24.930> bucks<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
I wasn't gonna pay the 80 bucks that the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.500 
I wasn't gonna pay the 80 bucks that the
other<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.160> goes<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:26.850> figured<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.330> was

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
other one goes for so I figured this was

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.840 
other one goes for so I figured this was
the<00:02:27.660> next<00:02:27.840> best<00:02:28.020> thing<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:29.430> looks<00:02:29.610> very

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
the next best thing and it looks very

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.300 
the next best thing and it looks very
reasonable<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.440> nice<00:02:31.650> enough<00:02:32.010> I'm

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
reasonable if it is nice enough I'm

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.699 
reasonable if it is nice enough I'm
actually<00:02:32.640> gonna<00:02:32.910> get<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.720> guess<00:02:34.500> it's

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
actually gonna get the I guess it's

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.440 
actually gonna get the I guess it's
called<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> shovel<00:02:35.459> version<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.239> kind<00:02:36.420> of

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
called the shovel version it's kind of

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.170 
called the shovel version it's kind of
like<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.690> front<00:02:36.930> shovel<00:02:37.700> now<00:02:38.700> one<00:02:38.940> thing<00:02:39.090> I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
like the front shovel now one thing I

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.280 
like the front shovel now one thing I
want<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.390> point<00:02:39.570> out<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.620> also<00:02:40.800> has<00:02:41.280> a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
want to point out is that it also has a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.860 
want to point out is that it also has a
winch<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.500> that's<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.890> power<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.870> believe

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
winch and that's the power I believe

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.860 
winch and that's the power I believe
it's<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.860> Carl<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> bucket<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.780> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
it's the the Carl on the bucket and it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.449 
it's the the Carl on the bucket and it
just<00:02:49.049> goes<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> side<00:02:49.739> right<00:02:50.010> there<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
just goes in the side right there and

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.580 
just goes in the side right there and
I'll<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.000> how<00:02:51.330> good<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.989> if<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.410> nice

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
I'll see how good it is and if it's nice

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.610 
I'll see how good it is and if it's nice
enough<00:02:52.860> I'll<00:02:53.040> order<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.489> next<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:54.620> even

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
enough I'll order the next one even

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.920 
enough I'll order the next one even
though<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.830> 80<00:02:56.010> bucks<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.580> it's<00:02:57.540> not<00:02:57.750> that

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
though it's 80 bucks it's it's not that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.020 
though it's 80 bucks it's it's not that
much<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.720> here<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.650> very<00:03:02.040> old<00:03:02.700> looking

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
much so here it is a very old looking

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.460 
much so here it is a very old looking
machine<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:05.480> believe<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:06.870> seen<00:03:07.230> these<00:03:07.440> in

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
machine I believe I have seen these in

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.650 
machine I believe I have seen these in
real<00:03:07.950> life<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.340> don't<00:03:08.370> know<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.030> 25<00:03:09.450> D

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
real life I don't know if it's a 25 D

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.940 
real life I don't know if it's a 25 D
but<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.870> have<00:03:10.049> seen<00:03:10.260> them<00:03:10.380> at<00:03:10.500> an<00:03:10.620> antique

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
but I have seen them at an antique

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.690 
but I have seen them at an antique
equipment<00:03:11.519> show<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:13.170> um<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.830> guess<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.580> goes

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
equipment show so um I guess that goes

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.970 
equipment show so um I guess that goes
along<00:03:14.910> with<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.510> know<00:03:16.049> these<00:03:16.260> another<00:03:16.560> reason

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
along with I know these another reason

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.100 
along with I know these another reason
why<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.130> got<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.299> show<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.630> winch<00:03:18.870> in

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
why I got it and to show the winch in

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.770 
why I got it and to show the winch in
operation<00:03:20.630> raises<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.810> lowers<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.380> boom<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
operation raises and lowers the boom I

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.020 
operation raises and lowers the boom I
think<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:24.959> really<00:03:25.260> cool<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:26.640> think<00:03:26.670> if

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
think that's really cool and I think if

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.259 
think that's really cool and I think if
you<00:03:27.180> open<00:03:27.510> up<00:03:27.600> this<00:03:27.840> door<00:03:28.170> right<00:03:28.200> here<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:30.090> can

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
you open up this door right here we can

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.710 
you open up this door right here we can
operate<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.860> curl<00:03:32.190> which<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.090> really<00:03:33.480> cool

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
operate the curl which is really cool

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.950 
operate the curl which is really cool
especially<00:03:34.380> for<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.860> price

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.540 

but<00:03:38.960> that's<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.410> really<00:03:39.620> cool<00:03:39.890> feature<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.340> like

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
but that's a really cool feature I like

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.230 
but that's a really cool feature I like
that<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.790> lot

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
that a lot

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.610 
that a lot
I<00:03:41.270> can't<00:03:41.540> wait<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.750> do<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.990> review<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:42.500> this

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
I love the wide tires on it and not only

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.750 
I love the wide tires on it and not only
that<00:04:56.660> but<00:04:56.930> it's<00:04:57.110> very<00:04:57.530> nicely<00:04:57.860> detailed<00:04:58.310> and

it's huge as well now it's obviously not
as<00:05:02.840> big<00:05:03.020> as<00:05:03.140> a<00:05:03.169> mining<00:05:03.590> loader<00:05:03.830> and<00:05:04.070> when<00:05:04.730> I<00:05:04.760> say

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
as big as a mining loader and when I say

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.760 
as big as a mining loader and when I say
huge<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.570> mean<00:05:05.600> it's<00:05:05.900> huge<00:05:06.110> for<00:05:06.200> my<00:05:06.440> collection

huge I mean it's huge for my collection

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.770 
huge I mean it's huge for my collection

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
because I don't really have any loaders

because I don't really have any loaders
this<00:05:09.350> large<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:10.100> do<00:05:10.340> have<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.910> 1988<00:05:11.570> F<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.200> such

this large I do have the 1988 F and such

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
but nothing really as large as this I

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.210 
but nothing really as large as this I
can't<00:05:18.350> tell<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.590> enough<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.890> glue<00:05:19.040> that

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
can't tell you enough to glue that

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.760 
can't tell you enough to glue that
fender<00:05:19.640> back<00:05:19.880> or<00:05:20.210> maybe<00:05:20.390> not<00:05:20.570> but<00:05:20.840> a<00:05:21.440> really

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
fender back or maybe not but a really

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.230 
fender back or maybe not but a really
nice<00:05:21.890> loader<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.430> one<00:05:22.640> thing<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:22.910> have<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.030> say

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
nice loader and one thing I have to say

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.880 
nice loader and one thing I have to say
is<00:05:23.360> I<00:05:23.419> like<00:05:23.600> how<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:23.840> has<00:05:23.990> no<00:05:24.320> teeth<00:05:24.590> on<00:05:24.800> the

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
is I like how it has no teeth on the

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.090 
is I like how it has no teeth on the
bucket<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:26.120> it's<00:05:26.240> like<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.419> sand<00:05:26.980> bucket<00:05:27.980> or

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
bucket so it's like a sand bucket or

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.550 
bucket so it's like a sand bucket or
whatever<00:05:28.400> one<00:05:28.580> would<00:05:28.640> call<00:05:28.820> it<00:05:29.560> actually

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
whatever one would call it actually

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.690 
whatever one would call it actually
really<00:05:30.919> nice<00:05:31.450> limited<00:05:32.500> articulation<00:05:33.500> but<00:05:34.370> the

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
really nice limited articulation but the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.340 
really nice limited articulation but the
detail<00:05:35.150> on<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.570> surprisingly<00:05:36.290> really<00:05:36.740> good

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.620 

and<00:05:40.890> I<00:05:41.070> bet<00:05:41.580> it'll<00:05:41.700> look<00:05:41.910> really<00:05:42.240> nice<00:05:42.360> on<00:05:42.570> a

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
and I bet it'll look really nice on a

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.330 
and I bet it'll look really nice on a
lowboy<00:05:43.050> -<00:05:45.170> and<00:05:46.170> last<00:05:46.860> but<00:05:46.980> not<00:05:47.220> least<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.910> a

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
lowboy - and last but not least is a

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.410 
lowboy - and last but not least is a
model<00:05:50.340> that<00:05:50.460> I'm<00:05:50.580> sure<00:05:50.760> many<00:05:50.970> people<00:05:51.060> have

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
model that I'm sure many people have

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:58.910 
model that I'm sure many people have
it's<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:52.050> nzg<00:05:52.530> 325<00:05:53.400> Beall<00:05:57.230> and<00:05:58.230> this<00:05:58.590> is<00:05:58.740> one<00:05:58.890> I

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
it's the nzg 325 Beall and this is one I

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.450 
it's the nzg 325 Beall and this is one I
got

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
got

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.900 
got
because<00:06:00.380> simply<00:06:01.380> just<00:06:02.010> basically<00:06:02.310> for<00:06:02.550> my<00:06:02.640> cat

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
because simply just basically for my cat

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.710 
because simply just basically for my cat
collection<00:06:03.180> I<00:06:03.720> also<00:06:04.650> ordered<00:06:04.980> a<00:06:05.220> 325<00:06:06.120> BL<00:06:06.510> so

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
collection I also ordered a 325 BL so

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.030 
collection I also ordered a 325 BL so
this<00:06:06.870> will<00:06:07.020> go<00:06:07.140> good<00:06:07.350> along<00:06:07.560> with<00:06:07.620> it<00:06:09.410> and<00:06:10.410> I

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
this will go good along with it and I

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.280 
this will go good along with it and I
don't<00:06:11.130> need<00:06:11.460> that<00:06:11.760> because<00:06:12.660> I<00:06:12.870> don't<00:06:13.080> plan<00:06:13.230> on

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
don't need that because I don't plan on

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.620 
don't need that because I don't plan on
selling<00:06:13.800> this<00:06:13.950> but<00:06:14.880> I<00:06:14.940> think<00:06:15.120> this<00:06:15.240> goes<00:06:15.450> for

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
selling this but I think this goes for

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.170 
selling this but I think this goes for
about<00:06:15.750> 45<00:06:16.260> bucks<00:06:16.500> on<00:06:16.740> there<00:06:16.920> a<00:06:17.550> lot<00:06:17.880> of<00:06:17.940> times

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
about 45 bucks on there a lot of times

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.730 
about 45 bucks on there a lot of times
you<00:06:18.270> see<00:06:18.420> them<00:06:18.510> for<00:06:18.720> like<00:06:18.840> 90<00:06:19.200> hundred<00:06:19.560> bucks

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
you see them for like 90 hundred bucks

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.340 
you see them for like 90 hundred bucks
on<00:06:19.830> eBay<00:06:20.220> so<00:06:20.280> 45<00:06:21.180> bucks<00:06:21.450> is<00:06:21.660> more<00:06:21.900> than<00:06:21.990> a<00:06:22.050> great

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
on eBay so 45 bucks is more than a great

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.450 
on eBay so 45 bucks is more than a great
deal<00:06:23.010> I<00:06:24.350> don't<00:06:25.350> know<00:06:25.560> how<00:06:25.710> they<00:06:25.860> still<00:06:26.130> have<00:06:26.280> so

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
these models a lot I I guess you could

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.110 
these models a lot I I guess you could
plan<00:07:34.560> on<00:07:34.710> me<00:07:34.830> getting<00:07:34.950> more<00:07:35.310> unboxings<00:07:35.940> of

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 
plan on me getting more unboxings of

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.170 
plan on me getting more unboxings of
these<00:07:36.270> smaller<00:07:36.660> models<00:07:37.490> maybe<00:07:38.490> every<00:07:38.820> now<00:07:38.940> and

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
these smaller models maybe every now and

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.750 
these smaller models maybe every now and
then<00:07:39.380> because<00:07:40.380> I<00:07:40.500> actually<00:07:40.650> want<00:07:40.950> to<00:07:41.010> get<00:07:41.160> the

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:41.760 
then because I actually want to get the

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.560 
then because I actually want to get the
shuffle<00:07:42.210> off<00:07:42.390> this<00:07:42.630> now<00:07:43.040> and<00:07:44.330> I'll<00:07:45.330> probably

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:45.570 
shuffle off this now and I'll probably

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.530 
shuffle off this now and I'll probably
order<00:07:45.810> another<00:07:46.200> US<00:07:46.440> 175<00:07:47.370> along<00:07:47.700> with<00:07:47.880> that<00:07:48.030> but

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.540 
order another US 175 along with that but

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.030
