00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.210
 paco 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.820
 getting closer 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.339
 we present you the blind clay color plus 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.529
 a wide range of tones that will allow you to do all kinds of crafts 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.240
 and professional creative arts 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.650
 Regarding its handling we advise you to knead the clay 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.539
 previously to moderate that lara more malleable to the ways of six bars is 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.839
 usual that during the course of the past the modeling threshing loses 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.299
 certain plasticity to recover the solidity the hands deserved the problem 

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:43.870
 solved 6 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.929
 the clay recovered its texture since the water acted as lubricants 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.610
 its clayey nature gives it excellent plastic for modeling and its 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.650
 Soft and fine texture allows us to perform very precise details 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.710
 that makes it become a great material to deepen the expression 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.440
 plastic from the age of 3 and that is a color alternative for 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.470
 those who are already and besieged in the tdt potter's wheel 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.200
 If you want to expand the range of colors with the clubs you can mix all the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.380
 each other and create new 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.180
 if we mix the red yellow and a little white we will get the color 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.180
 perfect meat if you want to model a human figure 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.860
 This is a good exercise to work with color theory in a support that 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 goes beyond the purely pictorial 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 late 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.050
 because clays and eyes color plus stain hands during modeling the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.030
 answer is as simple as if novel is the piece with clay 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.690
 conventional as I am doing I must that the hands mosquera stained 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.670
 of a brown tone 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.810
 in the same tone that emerges from its composition both entities already have 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.480
 rivals 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.660
 so it is not surprising that with the groups composed of the same 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.970
 materials plus a foundation process 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.580
 we have awakened the color with which we are working the best solution 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.420
 for a good finish is to worry about being careful and clean with the piece of 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.930
 pottery that we are working 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.540
 dirty hands 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.540
 clean hands 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.100
 and if staining the table worries us and isa 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.100
 with a damp cloth you can clean it without leaving a trace 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.479
 to choose to win 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.219
 here are some tools for modeling 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.369
 well arrived at this point we are going to provide you with some tricks regarding the 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.489
 union of clay pieces with flows 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.900
 suppose that we are going to be a subject books with light colors for 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.420
 our library first we make two attentive rectangles because we will take the 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.150
 coupon or any tool that allows us to support the faces of the clay 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.989
 thus they should come into contact with each other wet with water the striped sides and 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.010
 Now you can buy them and they assured a lasting union 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.309
 If the pieces that are to be joined do not have such a large surface, 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:05.150
 only one is to say the points of union with the help of the hands or better of a 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
 brush hahahahaha 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.789
 If you need to rest reflect on where your creativity goes 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.330
 you can always let our ideas rest and the figure inside a bag of 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.459
 plastic that the foot 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.939
 its premature drying 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.459
 the slower it has dried, the lower the possibility of cracks 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.489
 between them the drying process lasts between two and five days depending on 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.049
 the dimensions of the piece 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.540
 you can further increase poverty by ending that charge in a 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.999
 body any 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:34.940
 between 100 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.619
 and 110 degrees centigrade 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:39.179
 that tool 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:40.949
 respect 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.729
 you can also paralyze it that will help fan the peoples of Africa that already 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:45.590
 It is used 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.440
 In addition to this way the cleaning is a greater durability of the piece and a 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.829
 better subsequent cleaning 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.719
 you should not fear that your petty purposes are stabilizing through 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.859
 drying process the pigment got caught in the material 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.050
 Here are some examples of objects made with blind color plus 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.050
 observe that finished and I want to lend 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.190
