hello everybody I am Jim t-shirt and
this<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:03.000> my<00:00:03.179> latest<00:00:03.720> carrera<00:00:04.290> tutorial<00:00:04.920> this

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
this is my latest carrera tutorial this

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.140 
this is my latest carrera tutorial this
time<00:00:05.370> talking<00:00:05.819> about<00:00:06.060> using<00:00:06.270> fake<00:00:06.750> GI<00:00:08.150> so

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
time talking about using fake GI so

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.240 
time talking about using fake GI so
first<00:00:09.540> things<00:00:09.809> first<00:00:09.900> why<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> name<00:00:11.130> of

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
first things first why in the name of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.549 
first things first why in the name of
God<00:00:11.610> would<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.059> want<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.360> use<00:00:12.509> fake<00:00:12.990> global

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
God would you want to use fake global

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.980 
God would you want to use fake global
illumination<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:14.280> carrara<00:00:14.630> when<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.870> do

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
illumination in carrara when it can do

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.099 
illumination in carrara when it can do
the<00:00:16.139> real<00:00:16.289> thing<00:00:16.970> well<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> answer<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.539> simply

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the real thing well the answer is simply

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.160 
the real thing well the answer is simply
because<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.529> rendering<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.539> Carrera<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.660> one

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
because of rendering time Carrera is one

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.340 
because of rendering time Carrera is one
of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> faster<00:00:22.980> applications<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.910> there<00:00:24.350> but

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
of the faster applications out there but

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.140 
of the faster applications out there but
global<00:00:25.740> illumination<00:00:25.920> does<00:00:26.670> take<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.090> time

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
global illumination does take some time

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.880 
global illumination does take some time
to<00:00:27.420> render<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:28.080> not<00:00:28.289> ideal<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:29.160> animations

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
to render it's not ideal for animations

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.139 
to render it's not ideal for animations
and<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.219> ideal<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.700> scenes<00:00:32.940> where

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and it's not ideal for scenes where

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.120 
and it's not ideal for scenes where
you've<00:00:33.300> got<00:00:33.480> lots<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.809> geometry<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.590> lots<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you've got lots of geometry like lots of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.000 
you've got lots of geometry like lots of
vicki's<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> Michaels<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.149> whatnot

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
vicki's and Michaels and whatnot

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.819 
vicki's and Michaels and whatnot
learning<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.450> fake<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.660> GI<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.350> very

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
learning how to fake the GI is a very

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.450 
learning how to fake the GI is a very
useful<00:00:41.340> skill<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:43.290> actually<00:00:43.460> widely

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
useful skill and it's actually widely

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090 
useful skill and it's actually widely
used<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> CG<00:00:45.390> industry<00:00:45.840> probably<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:46.860> so

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
used in the CG industry probably more so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.200 
used in the CG industry probably more so
than<00:00:47.280> using<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.820> full<00:00:48.270> GI<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> let<00:00:50.670> us<00:00:50.700> get

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
than using a full GI so let us get

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.319 
than using a full GI so let us get
started<00:00:52.010> here<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> carreras<00:00:53.850> assembly

set<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.629> I<00:01:03.629> am<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.070> set<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
set and I am going with this set for the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.539 
set and I am going with this set for the
tutorial<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:07.320> only<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.619> stephannie

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
tutorial because not only is stephannie

tutorial because not only is stephannie
an<00:01:08.820> amazing<00:01:09.450> artist<00:01:09.840> he's<00:01:10.710> also<00:01:10.920> very<00:01:11.070> smart

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
an amazing artist he's also very smart

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.200 
an amazing artist he's also very smart
when<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.150> comes<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> design<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.350> his<00:01:13.619> sets

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
when it comes to the design of his sets

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.990 
when it comes to the design of his sets
this<00:01:15.439> whole<00:01:16.439> set<00:01:16.740> piece<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.220> actually<00:01:17.549> divided

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
this whole set piece is actually divided

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
this whole set piece is actually divided
into<00:01:18.180> separate<00:01:18.450> objects<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.470> ground<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
into separate objects the ground the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
into separate objects the ground the
buildings<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.580> separate<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:22.290> is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
buildings are all separate and that is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.359 
buildings are all separate and that is
imperative<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.030> type<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> lighting

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
imperative for for this type of lighting

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.399 
imperative for for this type of lighting
so<00:01:26.369> first<00:01:26.700> things<00:01:26.939> first<00:01:27.030> I'm<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.900> frame

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
so first things first I'm going to frame

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.140 
so first things first I'm going to frame
my<00:01:28.680> shot<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:30.119> things<00:01:30.329> set<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:31.939> show<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
my shot here get things set up show the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.230 
my shot here get things set up show the
production<00:01:33.810> frame<00:01:34.759> go<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> bit<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
production frame go for a bit of a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.260 
production frame go for a bit of a
dramatic<00:01:36.479> angle<00:01:37.200> here

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.590 

and<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:44.009> always<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.490> bank<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.030> camera

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and I always like to bank my camera

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.209 
and I always like to bank my camera
because<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> looks<00:01:46.229> cool<00:01:48.380> all<00:01:49.380> right<00:01:49.590> switch

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
because it looks cool all right switch

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.770 
because it looks cool all right switch
over<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.719> directors<00:01:51.719> camera<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.850> I'm

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
over to the directors camera and I'm

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.809 
over to the directors camera and I'm
going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.110> take<00:01:55.319> my<00:01:55.530> ambient<00:01:56.039> seen<00:01:56.280> light<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
going to take my ambient seen light and

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.469 
going to take my ambient seen light and
turn<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.179> down<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.600> zero<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.259> don't<00:01:58.560> need<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
turn it down to zero I don't need it and

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.539 
turn it down to zero I don't need it and
for<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.539> backdrop<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.409> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.709> use<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.069> by

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
for the backdrop I'm going to use a by

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.209 
for the backdrop I'm going to use a by
gradient<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:04.049> could<00:02:04.200> use<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> realistic<00:02:04.979> sky

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
gradient you could use a realistic sky

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859 
gradient you could use a realistic sky
but<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> want<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.909> show<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.719> done

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
but I want to show you what can be done

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.740 
but I want to show you what can be done
with<00:02:06.929> just<00:02:07.259> seeing<00:02:07.709> lights<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.280> backdrop<00:02:08.750> so

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
with just seeing lights in a backdrop so

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.940 
with just seeing lights in a backdrop so
by<00:02:10.110> gradient<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.069> I'm<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.209> start<00:02:12.390> by

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
by gradient it is I'm going to start by

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.300 
by gradient it is I'm going to start by
taking<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.250> blue<00:02:14.579> color<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.950> going<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.069> bit

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
taking the blue color and going with bit

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.180

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
just going to use lights to accomplish

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.500 
just going to use lights to accomplish
this<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.280> for<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:02.549> type<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:03.000> scene<00:03:03.239> there

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
this so for this type of a scene there

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.870 
this so for this type of a scene there
are<00:03:03.660> three<00:03:04.170> forms<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.829> light<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.519> have<00:03:05.700> to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
are three forms of light that we have to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.680 
are three forms of light that we have to
think<00:03:06.269> about<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.859> they<00:03:07.859> are<00:03:08.010> sunlight

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
think about and they are sunlight

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.650 
think about and they are sunlight
skylight<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.099> indirect<00:03:11.099> light<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:12.569> i'm

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
skylight and indirect light and i'm

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.780 
skylight and indirect light and i'm
going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> start<00:03:13.139> by<00:03:13.650> dealing<00:03:14.220> with<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
going to start by dealing with the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.319 
going to start by dealing with the
skylight<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:17.190> insert<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.639> distant<00:03:18.209> light

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
skylight so we insert a distant light

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.839 
skylight so we insert a distant light
into<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.630> scene<00:03:19.280> now<00:03:20.280> if<00:03:20.459> you're<00:03:20.639> new<00:03:20.819> to

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
into the scene now if you're new to

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.490 
into the scene now if you're new to
Carrera<00:03:21.359> a<00:03:22.700> distant<00:03:23.700> light<00:03:23.819> is<00:03:23.970> basically<00:03:24.450> a

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
Carrera a distant light is basically a

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.800 
Carrera a distant light is basically a
directional<00:03:25.500> light<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.010> has<00:03:26.880> no<00:03:27.120> source<00:03:27.419> it's

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
directional light it has no source it's

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.199 
directional light it has no source it's
just<00:03:28.079> like<00:03:28.139> coming<00:03:28.590> from<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.769> direction<00:03:29.209> these

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
just like coming from a direction these

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.920 
just like coming from a direction these
lights<00:03:30.480> are<00:03:30.660> huge<00:03:31.169> and<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:33.030> light<00:03:33.329> object

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
lights are huge and this light object

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.680 
lights are huge and this light object
that<00:03:34.200> loads<00:03:34.500> into<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.859> screen<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.690> nothing

that loads into the screen is nothing

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.050 
that loads into the screen is nothing
more<00:03:36.870> than<00:03:37.139> an<00:03:37.530> arrow<00:03:37.950> letting<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.849> know

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
more than an arrow letting you know

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.500 
more than an arrow letting you know
where<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.139> light<00:03:40.319> is<00:03:40.500> headed<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:42.120> makes<00:03:42.419> no

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
where the light is headed to it makes no

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.449 
where the light is headed to it makes no
difference<00:03:42.630> whatsoever<00:03:43.139> where<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.220> light

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
difference whatsoever where this light

is<00:03:44.489> in<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.849> scene<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.930> only<00:03:46.139> thing<00:03:46.290> that

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
is in the scene the only thing that

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.719 
is in the scene the only thing that
matters<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.280> rotation<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.480> object

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
matters is the rotation of this object

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.939 
matters is the rotation of this object
so<00:03:50.729> I<00:03:51.180> know<00:03:51.389> I'm<00:03:51.720> moving<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.410> up<00:03:52.500> here<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.859> the

so I know I'm moving it up here to the

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.969 
so I know I'm moving it up here to the
top<00:03:52.979> this<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.299> for<00:03:54.540> my<00:03:54.660> own

method if I have to come back to the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.720 
method if I have to come back to the
scene<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.560> couple<00:03:58.830> weeks<00:03:58.950> at<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> glance<00:03:59.520> I

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
scene in a couple weeks at a glance I

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.690 
scene in a couple weeks at a glance I
know<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.360> probably<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.900> skylight

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
know that this is probably a skylight

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.830 
know that this is probably a skylight
but<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.790> can<00:04:02.940> skip<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.180> step<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.690> not

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
but you can skip that step it's not

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.390 
but you can skip that step it's not
necessary<00:04:04.350> like<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.770> said<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:05.010> doesn't<00:04:05.040> matter

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
necessary like I said it doesn't matter

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.030 
necessary like I said it doesn't matter
where<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:05.790> light<00:04:06.000> goes<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.680> I'm<00:04:07.890> going<00:04:07.920> to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
where this light goes so I'm going to

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.720 
where this light goes so I'm going to
call<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.400> skylight<00:04:09.500> obviously<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:13.550> for<00:04:14.550> the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
call this skylight obviously and for the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.520 
call this skylight obviously and for the
color<00:04:15.270> I'm<00:04:15.540> going<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.720> go<00:04:15.840> with<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.050> similar

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
color I'm going to go with a similar

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.280 
color I'm going to go with a similar
shade<00:04:16.980> of<00:04:17.130> blue<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.790> what<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:17.940> used<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.330> my<00:04:18.360> my

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
shade of blue to what I used in my my

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.960 
shade of blue to what I used in my my
gradient<00:04:19.800> although<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.489> time<00:04:20.550> I'm<00:04:20.790> going<00:04:20.880> to

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
gradient although this time I'm going to

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.350 
gradient although this time I'm going to
go<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.090> little<00:04:21.209> bit<00:04:21.360> darker<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.930> deeper<00:04:23.360> now

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
go a little bit darker and deeper now

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.540 
go a little bit darker and deeper now
for<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.660> shadows<00:04:24.900> because<00:04:25.440> i'm<00:04:25.980> at<00:04:26.490> a

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
for the shadows because i'm at a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.200 
for the shadows because i'm at a
distance<00:04:27.510> from<00:04:27.800> from<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.920> buildings<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.640> don't

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
distance from from the buildings I don't

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.570 
distance from from the buildings I don't
have<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.420> do<00:04:30.510> anything<00:04:30.690> fancy<00:04:30.960> if<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:32.340> are

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
have to do anything fancy if you are

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.730 
have to do anything fancy if you are
doing<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:33.000> close-up<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:33.690> let's<00:04:33.900> say<00:04:34.080> Victoria

doing a close-up of let's say Victoria

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.800 
doing a close-up of let's say Victoria
for<00:04:35.010> you're<00:04:35.970> probably<00:04:36.180> going<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.450> want<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.690> go

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
for you're probably going to want to go

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.040 
for you're probably going to want to go
with<00:04:36.990> soft<00:04:37.320> shadows<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.130> if<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.580> do<00:04:38.730> so<00:04:39.050> the

with soft shadows and if you do so the

with soft shadows and if you do so the
the<00:04:40.530> radius<00:04:40.920> of<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.100> shadows<00:04:41.490> needs<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.180> be

the radius of the shadows needs to be

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.070 
the radius of the shadows needs to be
hundreds<00:04:43.260> of<00:04:43.410> feet<00:04:43.650> at<00:04:43.890> least<00:04:45.080> skylight

hundreds of feet at least skylight
doesn't<00:04:46.500> produce<00:04:46.620> much<00:04:46.980> in<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.190> way<00:04:47.220> of

the purpose of this tutorial and I'm
actually<00:04:57.780> going<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.080> just<00:04:58.350> leave<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.100> shadow

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
actually going to just leave the shadow

actually going to just leave the shadow
options<00:04:59.940> alone<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.420> turn<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.630> intensity

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
options alone and turn the intensity

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.460 
options alone and turn the intensity
down<00:05:01.290> to<00:05:01.590> fifteen<00:05:02.280> percent<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:03.410> for<00:05:04.410> the

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
brightness I'm going to turn this down

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.220 
brightness I'm going to turn this down
to<00:05:06.300> let's<00:05:07.020> say<00:05:07.200> thirty-five<00:05:08.070> percent<00:05:08.340> i<00:05:09.230> said

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
to let's say thirty-five percent i said

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.220 
to let's say thirty-five percent i said
thirty-five<00:05:10.680> thank<00:05:11.430> you<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:12.000> actually<00:05:12.960> let

thirty-five thank you and actually let

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.930 
thirty-five thank you and actually let
me<00:05:13.350> adjust<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.220> color<00:05:14.460> just<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:15.000> little<00:05:15.210> bit

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
me adjust the color just a little bit

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.150 
me adjust the color just a little bit
now<00:05:17.940> skylight<00:05:18.660> is<00:05:18.900> obviously<00:05:19.410> light<00:05:19.740> from<00:05:20.010> the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
now skylight is obviously light from the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.850 
now skylight is obviously light from the
sky<00:05:20.400> from<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:20.880> atmosphere<00:05:21.420> and<00:05:21.680> it's<00:05:22.680> going

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
sky from the atmosphere and it's going

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.560 
sky from the atmosphere and it's going
to<00:05:22.950> be<00:05:23.130> coming<00:05:23.310> down<00:05:23.580> on<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.850> scene<00:05:24.060> from<00:05:24.330> all

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
to be coming down on the scene from all

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.070 
to be coming down on the scene from all
directions<00:05:24.750> at<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.500> downward<00:05:26.250> angle<00:05:26.780> so<00:05:27.780> one

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
directions at a downward angle so one

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.930 
directions at a downward angle so one
light<00:05:28.350> is<00:05:28.590> not<00:05:28.620> going<00:05:29.130> to<00:05:29.220> do<00:05:29.310> it<00:05:29.460> I'm<00:05:29.760> going<00:05:29.850> to

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
light is not going to do it I'm going to

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.070 
light is not going to do it I'm going to
have<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.060> make<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.240> bunch<00:05:30.450> of<00:05:30.510> copies<00:05:30.690> of<00:05:30.900> this

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
have to make a bunch of copies of this

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.180 
have to make a bunch of copies of this
guy<00:05:31.260> now<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:33.570> I<00:05:33.600> just<00:05:33.930> grabbed<00:05:34.170> my<00:05:34.380> Universal

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
guy now so I just grabbed my Universal

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.510 
guy now so I just grabbed my Universal
manipulator<00:05:35.640> tool<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:37.800> make<00:05:37.980> a<00:05:38.010> copy<00:05:38.340> of

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
manipulator tool and to make a copy of

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.670 
manipulator tool and to make a copy of
anything<00:05:39.000> in<00:05:39.090> Carrera<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:40.080> just<00:05:40.290> simply<00:05:40.440> use

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
anything in Carrera you just simply use

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.940 
anything in Carrera you just simply use
the<00:05:40.710> keyboard<00:05:41.310> shortcut<00:05:41.660> ctrl<00:05:42.660> D<00:05:43.290> for

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
the keyboard shortcut ctrl D for

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.300 
the keyboard shortcut ctrl D for
duplicate<00:05:44.840> so<00:05:45.840> make<00:05:46.230> a<00:05:46.260> copy<00:05:46.500> of<00:05:46.650> this<00:05:46.770> guy<00:05:46.950> and

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
duplicate so make a copy of this guy and

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.360 
duplicate so make a copy of this guy and
I'm<00:05:47.430> going<00:05:47.730> to<00:05:47.810> have<00:05:48.810> him<00:05:49.100> pointing<00:05:50.100> to<00:05:50.280> the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
I'm going to have him pointing to the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.920 
I'm going to have him pointing to the
left<00:05:50.900> now<00:05:51.900> if<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.320> control<00:05:52.800> D<00:05:53.040> again<00:05:53.750> you<00:05:54.750> can

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
left now if I control D again you can

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.640 
left now if I control D again you can
see<00:05:55.110> that<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.800> copy<00:05:56.220> that<00:05:57.000> Carrera<00:05:57.330> made<00:05:57.660> has

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
see that the copy that Carrera made has

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.520 
see that the copy that Carrera made has
the<00:05:58.980> translation<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:00.000> the<00:06:00.060> rotation<00:06:00.660> that

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
the translation and the rotation that

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.640 
the translation and the rotation that
the<00:06:01.710> previous<00:06:02.070> copy<00:06:02.280> did<00:06:02.900> this<00:06:03.900> can<00:06:04.410> be<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:04.590> very

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
the previous copy did this can be a very

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.310 
the previous copy did this can be a very
handy<00:06:05.370> little<00:06:05.910> feature<00:06:06.030> a<00:06:06.360> Carrera<00:06:06.750> but<00:06:07.169> in

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
handy little feature a Carrera but in

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.050 
handy little feature a Carrera but in
our<00:06:07.650> case<00:06:07.680> here<00:06:08.190> it's<00:06:08.490> just<00:06:08.700> going<00:06:08.820> to<00:06:08.850> get<00:06:08.970> in

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
our case here it's just going to get in

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.770 
our case here it's just going to get in
the<00:06:09.120> way

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
the way

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.110 
the way
so<00:06:10.110> let<00:06:10.230> me<00:06:10.260> undo<00:06:10.590> that<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:11.130> I'm<00:06:11.880> just<00:06:12.030> going

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
so let me undo that and I'm just going

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.360 
so let me undo that and I'm just going
to<00:06:12.240> keep<00:06:12.360> copying<00:06:12.870> my<00:06:13.230> first<00:06:13.530> light<00:06:13.830> over<00:06:14.250> and

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
to keep copying my first light over and

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.770
