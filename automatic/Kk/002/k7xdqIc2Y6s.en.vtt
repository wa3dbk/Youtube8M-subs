touching the upper part of the glass

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.450 
touching the upper part of the glass
where<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.630> ingredients<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> drink<00:01:41.220> are

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
where the ingredients of the drink are

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.690 
where the ingredients of the drink are
now<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:43.110> reason<00:01:43.409> why<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.070> don't<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
now the reason why you don't want to

now the reason why you don't want to
grab<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.509> here<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.759> heat<00:01:48.060> will

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
grab it up here is because the heat will

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.340 
grab it up here is because the heat will
transfer<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.920> hand<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:50.970> glass<00:01:51.350> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the cocktail in the glass

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.160 
the cocktail in the glass
and<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:56.100> always<00:01:56.369> want<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> keep<00:01:57.060> drinks<00:01:57.960> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and we always want to keep drinks that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.920 
and we always want to keep drinks that
are<00:01:58.200> served<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.950> most<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.340> these<00:01:59.460> glasses

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
are served at most of these glasses

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.330 
are served at most of these glasses
chilled<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.340> long<00:02:02.340> as<00:02:02.729> possible<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:04.189> this<00:02:05.189> is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
chilled as long as possible so this is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340 
chilled as long as possible so this is
the<00:02:05.460> reason<00:02:05.759> behind<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.210> stem<00:02:06.450> glass<00:02:06.600> because

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the reason behind the stem glass because

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.369 
the reason behind the stem glass because
