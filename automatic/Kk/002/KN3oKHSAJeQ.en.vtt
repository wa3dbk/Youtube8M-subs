 they run it as administrator 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.240
 and the program is already operating 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.540
 one thing when they download a game they 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.959

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.120
 that the web 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.270

 and this doing the conversion 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.069
 this may take a little 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.269
 suddenly 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.560

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.629
