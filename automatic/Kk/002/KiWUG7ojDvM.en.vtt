00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
else we haven't had from the wing at all

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.600

like<00:01:46.710> when<00:01:46.890> was<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.040> last<00:01:47.100> time<00:01:47.220> had<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> high

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
like when was the last time had a high

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
school in winner and I think it is an

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.929 
school in winner and I think it is an
excellent<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.280> business<00:01:50.369> from<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> club

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
excellent bit of business from the club

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.899 
excellent bit of business from the club

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and but what next because ultimately

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.780 
and but what next because ultimately
we've<00:01:54.630> still<00:01:54.869> got<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.259> huge<00:01:55.829> hole<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
we've still got this huge hole in the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.459 
we've still got this huge hole in the
middle<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> pitch<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.780> him<00:01:57.840> centre-back

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
middle of the pitch for him centre-back

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.959
