00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 on television more also it is possible that 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.470
 Perseverance is key to achieving the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.690
 goals that we all propose young 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.900
 Mexicans are a sign of it and know that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.900
 have managed to create a robotic arm 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.230
 the initial 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.480
 we keep some experience 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.160
 us in climbing robots then 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.619
 with those climbing robots we think of 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.210
 clean facades of buildings and what 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.470
 that started the company started was that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.140
 well we enter the incubator 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.059
 companies the tutors tells us he hears the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.610
 arms is activated by where the robots 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.930
 climbers are something that can be very 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.420
 good business but anyone is 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.670
 can copy very easily then by 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.199
 why are not we going to look for other options and 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.440
 that 's where we go to the 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.730
 industry and we saw that they needed 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.149
 they are a group of young entrepreneurs 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.980
 del tec de monterrey campus santa fe su 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.130
 project has been finalized and they begin to 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.110
 receive the first fruits of it what 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.800
 that we have here is an arm 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.740
 parallel 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.680
 delta that refers to the configuration 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.170
 in triangular shape of the arms 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.940
 since the effector that is this piece of 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.550
 here it is always parallel to the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.740
 base of the arm this allows us to generate 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110
 many very versatile activities for 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.060
 the arm for three and a half years does not 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.980
 they gave up they knocked on the doors 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.180
 needed until you find support and 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.810
 trust needed 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.330
 but the biggest challenge begins just 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.390
 keep and grow we design like 10 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.580
 robots of which 3 powerful the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.220
 material and this was the last 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.790
 version was the one that hit the market what 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.820
 we patented and well we went to the market in 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.440
 February 2013 in the country there are several 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.860
 companies that sell robotic products 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.420
 but few like the technical automatic are 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.869
 Mexican women from the design and 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.970
 programming to manufacturing everything 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.970
 what is here except some small 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.550
 pieces is manufactured in mexico the design 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.680
 was done internally by de facto 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.560
 by Juan Pablo and this one all the pieces 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.569
 they were sent to do 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 provide with Mexico suppliers of 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.530
 different states and some even 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.450
 printed locally on a printer 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.910
 3d how is this piece here and all 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.860
 its components selling five arms 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.530
 robotic your company can continue a 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.390
 year more but they are in talks with 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 the possibility that they are 30 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.810
 the most difficult thing is the fear we have 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.330
 at the beginning 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.730
 many times good I think we 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.099
 we Mexicans see that we have talent 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.530
 we are very ingenious that is clear but 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.230
 it gives us a little fear of giving the first 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.060
 step are seven people who work 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.160
 at this time and more than 50 suppliers 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.630
 those who benefit from this idea that 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.360
 started with cleaning robots of 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.519
 facades now the possibilities of 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.900
 arm depend on the needs and 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.120
 imagination of your clients
