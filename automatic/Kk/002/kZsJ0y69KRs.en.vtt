00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.029 
space because I think it needs an
outside<00:02:01.210> space<00:02:01.570> if<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.500> was<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.710> do<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.890> again

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
outside space if I was to do it again

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.520 
outside space if I was to do it again
I'd<00:02:03.159> make<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.430> bigger<00:02:03.640> in<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.630> utilize<00:02:05.350> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
I'd make it bigger in you utilize the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.699 
I'd make it bigger in you utilize the
outside<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.890> bit<00:02:06.070> more<00:02:06.250> but<00:02:06.720> but<00:02:07.720> yeah<00:02:07.899> I<00:02:08.200> want

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
outside a bit more but but yeah I want

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.820 
outside a bit more but but yeah I want
to<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:10.119> some<00:02:10.360> other<00:02:10.599> opinions<00:02:10.720> on<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.500> design

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
to get some other opinions on the design

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.759 
to get some other opinions on the design
and<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.610> sort<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.660> waterproofing<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.560> an

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
and and sort of waterproofing is an

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.509 
and and sort of waterproofing is an
issue<00:02:14.920> with<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.880> sort<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.239> house<00:02:16.750> obviously

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
issue with this sort of house obviously

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.130 
issue with this sort of house obviously
that's<00:02:18.519> something<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.880> need<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.060> work<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.450> yeah

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
that's something I need to work on yeah

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.870 
that's something I need to work on yeah
well<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.920> finished<00:02:21.220> my<00:02:21.310> first<00:02:21.400> year<00:02:21.760> of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
well I just finished my first year of

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.240 
well I just finished my first year of
engineering<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.569> what<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:23.890> going<00:02:24.040> good

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
engineering it's what it's going good

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.670 
engineering it's what it's going good
I'm<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.209> my<00:02:25.330> second<00:02:25.660> year<00:02:25.690> now<00:02:25.959> actually<00:02:26.560> what

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
I'm in my second year now actually what

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.199 
I'm in my second year now actually what
I'm<00:02:26.739> hoping<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.130> do<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.549> I<00:02:27.700> want<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.940> finish<00:02:28.120> my

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
I'm hoping to do is I want to finish my

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.900 
I'm hoping to do is I want to finish my
engineering<00:02:28.450> degree<00:02:28.870> get<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.860> then<00:02:30.010> maybe<00:02:30.700> do

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
engineering degree get and then maybe do

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.670 
engineering degree get and then maybe do
architecture<00:02:31.569> because<00:02:31.900> I've<00:02:32.319> always<00:02:32.470> been

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
architecture because I've always been

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.080 
architecture because I've always been
interested<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.190> architecture<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.940> that's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
interested in architecture and that's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.180 
interested in architecture and that's
what<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.840> want<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.049> do<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:35.470> figured<00:02:36.040> having

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
what I want to do but I figured having

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.289 
what I want to do but I figured having
an<00:02:36.400> engineering<00:02:36.730> background<00:02:36.819> would

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
an engineering background would

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.110 
an engineering background would
obviously<00:02:38.110> help<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:38.980> be<00:02:39.130> really

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
obviously help with that and be really

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.209 
obviously help with that and be really
useful
