 evens color under normal conditions 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.399
 skin cell lives about 28 days and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 originated in the lower layer and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.079
 already peeled off the skin 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.969
 how the skin is constantly updated 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.530
 and wounds and cuts alive ideally 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.269
 chemical front needed 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 however, most of our babies are n't 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.260
 peel off ok so they 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.359
 begin to accumulate on the surface 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.489
 shaping uneven unhealthy skin tones 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.260
 This explains the need 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.839
 applying chemical peels he 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 dissolves connections between cells that 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.979
 leads verse exfoliation in the end 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.810
 healthy color is restored and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.640
 smooth skin most chemical 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.860
 days to which I apply superficial 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.560
 and they are meant to work 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.840
 on the surface layer of the epidermis 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.290
 this is a dead layer or cornified below 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 him 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.729
 living cell layer it was chemical 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.969
 peels work only with the top layer 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.670
 so they are safe and painless 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.039
 and while they are required temporarily 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.289
 skin recovery will be side 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.980
 phenomena immediately after the procedure is applied 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.470
 moisturize 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.900

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.860
 and you can return to your 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.230

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.070
 I apply on the basis of caliph whether you are 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.010

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.110
 acid kazho she will not lead 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.630
 and more from the procedure for this small 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.240
 tingling I found five minutes by the way 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.820
 I use at the same time a cotton swab 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.840
 after five minutes immediately wash our face 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.040
 after that you can even feel that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 skin cleared 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.990

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.450
 plus exceptional six times each 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.060
 a week or a week so remember 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.670
