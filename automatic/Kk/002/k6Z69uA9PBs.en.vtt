00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.960
 Hi everybody 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.689
 today little video a little bit special 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.570
 so that will be a presentation of my 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:28.780
 electric remote control car 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.760
 just because 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.980
 to make you discover another 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.810
 passion that airsoft 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.140
 so that's a car 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.380
 remote controlled then I inform you of 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:46.660
 after this car was offered to me 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:48.700
 by my uncle is so I do not know 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.170
 prices so for the curious it takes 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.030
 look on the Internet 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.470
 so it's a 10th scale car 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.430
 it does not reproduce a model 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.809
 particular of real cars but 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.210
 it's very nice 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.110
 so I specify that the bodywork 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.220
 it's me who did it so I 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.200
 paints with blue of yellow of red and 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.530
 white here and I wanted to make a 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.960
 bombay red bull thing for those who 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.930
 had not yet recognized 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.290
 so here's the little one a little zoom on the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.950
 logo 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.900
 that's just because red bull 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.940
 we see that in every way in all 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.140
 extreme sports that's it but I want 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.430
 not to advertise them 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.369
 they have enough like that and here is mr jack 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.640
 did I turn on the remote 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:48.250
 in taking it not bad how some 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.710
 opt then we want to do a fast 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.990
 presentation of the interior of the stick 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:00.969
 and short here and so the sales logo 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:05.909
 this is red bull hand painted with 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:10.810
 end of the scotch finally brief of painting 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.570
 we go disunited up so just saw notice 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.030
 the red rims of the wheels are not 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.310
 the same but that's the color so 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.500
 I have yellow or green yolk 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.410
 in short, we do not care a bit but that's it 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.370
 you see that it's notched tires 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.490
 so to have a better grip 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.000
 on the clay because this type of 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.630
 model 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.459
 we call it a truck is used rather 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.040
 on the clay only on the tar 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.850
 but we can use it on 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:49.200
 any type of terrain then the 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.200
 bodywork holds with four pins 2 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.920
 and 4 these are these four little ones 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.880
 pins not unpinned finally yes that's it 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.519
 pins pin brief and the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.330
 body gets up 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:10.650
 So here we go to see a little inside 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.650
 mechanics and electronics 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.840
 already we can see that there are points 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.019
 common with airsoft ie uh 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.510
 finally the engine vinci not they are 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.269
 seems but it's a bit the same 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.110
 characteristics we choose them aitor 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.870
 kohail speed 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.079
 so either for speed or 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.739
 arm acceleration that depends on this 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.480
 that we want to donate after we can 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.060
 see that there are suspensions 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.160
 then will recover from what to make of it a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.500
 zoom earlier here are like here and there 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.450
 there are suspensions so his four 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.120
 small pistons with springs 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.150
 so two in the front and two in the back 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:58.570
 we can change them by changing the 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:02.579
 springs short that's after the end by the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:06.470
 two transmissions pass to the dish 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.840
 this engine with fun 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.540
 so the engine there is a sprocket that comes out 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.160
 of lax motor and which drives a great 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:19.940
 a short grenache here after we go 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.700
 try almost like that here we see 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.810
 we zoom in not there we can see a little 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.810
 all the brothels not so much brothel so 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:38.420
 again this here is the speed 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.320
 control so what can we say is a 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.870
 little brain with seeing this is the 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.420
 brain let's say and it's refreshed 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.650
 by a small fan 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.040
 after there is a small battery of 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.170
 connect after down all the way down 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:59.330
 the receiver so with the little chip 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.590
 who goes on TV like the same on the 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.840
 remote control is there so I'm sure of 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:11.120
 70th done that's short it's the frequency 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.770
 on which I lead it we pressed the 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:19.840
 battery that I talked about in the 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:26.000
 video of the charger so the battery merle 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.690
 the ipo in 4000 nth h or in these waters 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.050
 on it 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.119
 that's it and it 's 7.4 volts so that's 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.580
 when 1000 

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:40.860
 mhh pardon milliamperes this for 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:43.050
 autonomy will be according to the on the 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.409
 before the transmission finally the 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.539
 direction rather it's the direction 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.539
 here and besides, we are going to light it 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.960
 I have a bug that I can see 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:00.089
 that the fan turns 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.689
 after I'm going to turn on the remote control on 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:07.949
 go zooms and not in the other direction 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:09.689
 it's going to be a watchable so that's the 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.849
 remote control so see a remote 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:16.979
 a little more evolved than couples to 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:19.050
 these sensitive stay here here and so 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:23.129
 with lots of buttons to fix it 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.709
 in short, here is an antenna that 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:28.189
 deploys very far to have a 

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:31.589
 better range 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:34.229
 we will not do it because here I have 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.479
 no place but we flat first 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.129
 it is very sensitive and its share very quickly 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.949
 because you have to know that I put a 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.509
 brushless motor brushless motor 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:45.080
 will speak in another video but that's 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:48.940
 ten times better than coal engines 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.460
 here I am just showing you 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:07:01.150
 the acceleration to make you feel 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:07:06.870
 go see the snte looked at and I'm not 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.870
 not even to you see with the beta 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:15.810
 so much that it's going fast the tire gets 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.210
 deforms but really once I have 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.870
 badly stuck the tire he's gone 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:25.160
 he's gushed here so it's really 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.120
 very powerful if I have the opportunity 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.000
 besides, I'll try to do that 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.410
 soon to make it turn a little on 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.900
 tar on bumps and filming and I 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:42.510
 just think to show you how that 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:45.210
 or it is that, here, listen to me 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:48.200
 think we're done if we add the 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.200
 bodywork because she is pretty 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:55.590
 here and I will tell you very soon for 

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.010
 car videos and also 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:01.260
 springs 

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:03.470
 do not worry go to very 

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.470
 soon
