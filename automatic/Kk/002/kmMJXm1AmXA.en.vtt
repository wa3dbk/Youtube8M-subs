00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 not only good eyes but also a lot 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.950
 Holger Elsner needs patience for his patience 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.770
 job 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.840

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.269
 new and old clocks tick again 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.039

 founded for the niederelsungen is the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 profession of watchmaker something quite 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.140
 especially the special about this profession 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.790
 for me that is the versatility 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 in the crane the technique that one 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.950
 technology also mastered and that is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.719
 to get it started again 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.120
 the job of the watchmaker has changed 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.890
 in the course of time, very changed during 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 Clocks used by watchmakers, too 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 designed and built 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.379
 today services like 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.199
 Battery change a large part of their 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.270
 to take action from time to time 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.850
 Customers still old watches to holger elsner 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.449
 who breathes life back to them 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.339
 this should also be so that we 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.930
 Relatively much old watches too 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.229
 get those found on the floor 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.790
 will have ideal values â€‹â€‹of grandma 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.740
 stop and then it will be 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.960
 once worked up and restored 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.909
 even if the omaha does not sweat 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 may come so that the clocks do not rust 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.290
 There have already been watches on those Holger 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.530
 elsner has worked over months 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.119
 to get these running again 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 many watches hope but one that was ne 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.219
 had becker factory here mondphase 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.130
 and many different ones 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.359
 still parts missing then the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 moon phase that was wrong because the missing 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.530
 half so that that one that the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.380
 moon phase can move on 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.990
 these wheels were missing and lever and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.539
 I then constructed that and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 restored and then you love 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:03.719

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.939
 and filigree or big and old holger 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.399
 elsner is a challenge 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.819
 for the profession of watchmaker you need 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.799
