00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
if you're really brave about it you can

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.380 
if you're really brave about it you can
actually<00:00:35.280> leave<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> ground<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
actually leave them in the ground and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060 
actually leave them in the ground and
some<00:00:36.600> years<00:00:36.809> they'll<00:00:37.020> make<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.860> other

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
some years they'll make it but other

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.100 
some years they'll make it but other
years<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.489> don't<00:00:38.640> make<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.899> want<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
years they don't make it so you want a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.720 
years they don't make it so you want a
gamble<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.010> stock<00:00:41.309> market

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
gamble like you do in the stock market

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.709 
gamble like you do in the stock market
then<00:00:41.910> leave<00:00:42.059> your<00:00:42.180> bulbs<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> ground

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
then leave your bulbs in the ground

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
then leave your bulbs in the ground
otherwise<00:00:43.410> dig<00:00:44.250> them<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.850> you'll<00:00:44.969> be

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
otherwise dig them up and you'll be

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110 
otherwise dig them up and you'll be
assured<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.649> same<00:00:46.890> bulb<00:00:47.190> next<00:00:47.610> year

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
assured of the same bulb next year

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.389 
assured of the same bulb next year
one<00:00:48.840> thing<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.110> recommend<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.829> when<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.129> dig

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
one thing I recommend is when you dig

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.639 
one thing I recommend is when you dig
them<00:00:50.550> make<00:00:51.059> sure<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.420> label<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.230> you'll

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
them make sure you label them so you'll

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.880 
them make sure you label them so you'll
have<00:00:52.860> you'll<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:53.430> color<00:00:53.760> are<00:00:54.120> where<00:00:54.890> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
have you'll know which color are where I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.970 
have you'll know which color are where I
would<00:00:56.430> recommend<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> dig'em<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.620> some

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
would recommend the dig'em we have some

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.260 
would recommend the dig'em we have some
bulbs<00:00:59.579> here<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.180> stir<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.539> example<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:02.280> put

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
bulbs here in stir for example and put

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.060 
bulbs here in stir for example and put
them<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.480> garage<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> screen<00:01:05.040> or

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
them in your garage up on a screen or

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.530 
them in your garage up on a screen or
something<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> let<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.270> dry<00:01:06.510> out

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
something like and let them dry out

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
something like and let them dry out
before<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> actually<00:01:07.409> store<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.189> so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
before you actually store them so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.240 
before you actually store them so
especially<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.470> soils<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.950> mine

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
especially now if your soils like mine

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.399 
especially now if your soils like mine
it's<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.729> wet<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.869> good<00:01:13.020> idea<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
it's really wet so it's good idea to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
it's really wet so it's good idea to
make<00:01:13.590> sure<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:14.580> dried<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
make sure they get dried out to the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
make sure they get dried out to the
point<00:01:15.630> where<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:15.930> won't<00:01:16.049> mold<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.830> when

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
point where they won't mold on you when

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.640 
point where they won't mold on you when
you<00:01:17.100> put<00:01:17.250> them<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> storage<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> let's<00:01:19.409> say

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you put them in the storage so let's say

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.440 
you put them in the storage so let's say
once<00:01:19.920> you've<00:01:20.130> got<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> them

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
once you've got them out you have them

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.260 
once you've got them out you have them
dry<00:01:21.770> what<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> recommend<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> find<00:01:23.939> an<00:01:24.119> old

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
dry what I recommend is to find an old

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
dry what I recommend is to find an old
box<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:25.049> something<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
box or something like this they got to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.969 
box or something like this they got to
have<00:01:26.490> air<00:01:26.700> circulation<00:01:27.680> there's<00:01:28.680> several

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
have air circulation there's several

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
have air circulation there's several
different<00:01:29.100> media's<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
different media's that you can use the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.160 
different media's that you can use the
one<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.350> recommend<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.979> vermiculite<00:01:33.170> put

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
one I would recommend is vermiculite put

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.020 
one I would recommend is vermiculite put
some<00:01:34.380> old<00:01:34.530> paper<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> bottom<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.700> box

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
some old paper in the bottom of this box

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
some old paper in the bottom of this box
then<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:37.020> layer<00:01:37.170> vermiculite<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
then put a little layer vermiculite and
then<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.850> lay<00:01:39.060> your<00:01:39.270> bulbs<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:40.140> right

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
there on the vermiculite and I recommend

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.639 
there on the vermiculite and I recommend
that<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.250> use<00:01:44.280> some<00:01:44.810> sulfur<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> fungicide

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that you use some sulfur as a fungicide

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.539 
that you use some sulfur as a fungicide
to<00:01:47.430> help<00:01:47.790> prevent<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.299> mold<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.720> whatever<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
to help prevent the mold or whatever and

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
to help prevent the mold or whatever and
dust<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.970> them<00:01:51.210> or<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.869> also<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
dust that on them or you also you can

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.590 
dust that on them or you also you can
put<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.250> bulbs<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.820> bag<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.360> shake<00:01:54.570> it

up<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> sulfur<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> covers<00:01:56.130> them<00:01:56.369> more

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
up with a sulfur so it covers them more

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.209
