00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it ended up purchasing in another

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
it ended up purchasing in another
battery<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> battery<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.030> shot<00:01:42.240> this

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
battery for the battery was shot this

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.999 
battery for the battery was shot this
year<00:01:43.430> had<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> put<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> new<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.720> guess<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.740> part

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
year had to put a new I guess the part

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.980 
year had to put a new I guess the part
they<00:01:47.189> call<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> flange<00:01:48.329> bearing<00:01:48.780> but

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
they call it was a flange bearing but

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.539 
they call it was a flange bearing but
you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.770> you'll<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.009> able<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
you know if you'll be able to see it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.859 
you know if you'll be able to see it
from<00:01:50.670> here

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
from here

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.780 
from here
it's<00:01:52.380> basically<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.040> bushing<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it's basically just that bushing that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.300 
it's basically just that bushing that
goes<00:01:53.970> down<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.799> don't<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.070> gonna<00:01:56.159> be

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
goes down I don't think I'm gonna be

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.889 
goes down I don't think I'm gonna be
able<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> down<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
able to get it down there but for the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.060 
able to get it down there but for the
steering<00:01:58.110> column<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.590> hold<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.950> place

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
steering column to hold it in place

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.100 
steering column to hold it in place
because<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> gears<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.360> wore<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.960> much

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
because of the gears it wore out so much

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.440 
because of the gears it wore out so much
that<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> gears<00:02:01.619> were<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.979> spinning

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.130 

so<00:02:08.450> there<00:02:08.629> it<00:02:08.750> is

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
so there it is

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.559 
so there it is
I<00:02:09.170> mean<00:02:09.580> it's<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.640> pretty<00:02:10.849> good<00:02:10.940> shape<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:14.540> can

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
I mean it's in pretty good shape we can

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.290 
I mean it's in pretty good shape we can
