00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 let's see with you now the task we are 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.899
 wonderfully solved the problems with you 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.870
 last lesson and many many tasks 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.730
 decided and now you and I decided 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.420
 these are the adult task but she 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.609
 It will not be too difficult to ask 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.369
 giving you a problem you give me 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.010
 tell me how I adore putting out 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.980
 then you probably will be the champion all 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.599
 who love to solve problems they sweat 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.369
 They play a very strong here Belov 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.969
 Please, this is quite a problem for you 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:45.600
 forces 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:47.489
 but if we know is, he goes dropped 8 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.239
 king and king d7 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.760
 Black has no chance of winning what 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.289
 win mid not even have a chance to stop 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.730
 pawn even make a draw managers 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.340
 This reception Olesya is called 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.600
 destruction protection we see that horse 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.210
 is an advocate if carefully 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 watch this is a real defender 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.340
 settle a single defender 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.750
 more advocates no measures and we are 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.159
 substitute sheet will 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.290
 stressed and decided to defender to eliminate 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.200
 for giving up this rook we are not greedy with you 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.119
 we took destroyed horse 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.750
 black and translated but we already have currencies 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.610
 returned must be seen that is, we ate and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 horses drove and we only drove 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.659
 It turned out that our generosity is such 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.420
 she was blind here well how to say on 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.770
 By chance, we doubled you 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.820
 that we are so greedy right 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.860
 wonderful and so on 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.360
 protector destroyed and we ate 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.729
 what he defended understood and that 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.010
 schematically how to show the defender can 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.050
 push green but what he 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.360
 defended mark the arrow see let's 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.170
 go with you further and found a solution 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:29.180
 next tasks next task here 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:34.489
 we have a protein like it works without lowered 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.430
 will not play sharply also they will play 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.880
 the real option cannot be transferred 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.040
 dance play well let us raise them 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.520
 essentially black also they collect 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.930
 can't 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:53.780
 is our pie possible at all therefore 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.700
 I think hit the queen is it 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.920
 a proposal that can not be but that's 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.810
 No way not to give up already for black 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.310
 such a sacrifice because our 8 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:11.830
 videos on myself I tried a pistol mate 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:24.459
 yes of course, let me go there to manage and 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:28.930
 maybe you should wash black is obliged yes 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.650
 we are confident you won before 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.739
 confidently won 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.049
 now we will break down the position 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.620
 so well we have one single here 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.250
 defender 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.790
 the king is water we noticed what it is like 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.980
 you see the royal castle door and 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.690
 holidays would open but I had to 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.100
 donate queen not for free 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.210
 right opened and we have water with an important 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.690
 flew priborchik who was behind the door 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.210
 pawn at 6 she helped us a lot 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:09.540
 controls the field fun figured out 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:16.440
 that the next problem here we have killed 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:20.910
 you white position white as here 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.560
 act please then we are king 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.970
 move back the porsche 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:36.330
 so not interesting here this is you 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:39.950
 killed owns this 6 step. 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:45.000
 he owes a pawn so much dark to what mother 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:47.310
 he without a hit and stake on the entire eyelid and that 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.240
 you solve the problem so quickly olesik 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.540
 admit it probably decided worse 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.760
 with dad is not cheap these tasks 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.950
 ancestors call them solve and now she 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.840
 all boys play very strongly 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.110
 afraid not to play because she them 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.770
 beat here is just a wonderful punch 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:12.060
 we found a horse and we are hitting the water 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.220
 horse on 6 to black we owe lightning 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.310
 I will refuse to take the opportunity 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.310
 constantly yes and if not black 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.830
 possibility to refuse or not harness 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.000
 no option fully ported as 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.430
 train rides on rails paragraph item b 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.560
 from Moscow to Daisy drove the train and 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.280
 this train can't go anywhere 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.470
 roll up 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.840
 Only here one rails and he on them 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.440
 the train is able to fly 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.100
 . 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.500
 yes through the river he will not float through the air 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.740
 will not fly u accurate go on rails 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.889
 no stations and others here 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.199
 offshoot from these rails is not clear 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.770
 clearly on the direct route us train 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.300
 drove we did with you a year before 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.719
 also was a defender and here come on 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.909
 let's understand the mechanism to understand the 6th law of 6 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:06.249
 the real defender the defender was 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:09.159
 eliminated and we made you a squirrel 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:12.639
 right last problem for today if 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:14.949
 you decide you'll be a big fellow by the way 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.499
 your dad knows perfectly well i take these 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.330
 puzzles if you want them to give you 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:23.650
 some more i think you are deep 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:26.169
 interesting to solve without me for a long time I 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.840
 I think you will be very interesting folder 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.750
 beneath page give a few tasks and here 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:44.349
 here we had the last problem 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:47.439
 today so wonderful. is not 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.449
 a defender in this assignment 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:51.909
 quarterback protects us queen we 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.069
 destroy this horse well and 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:59.099
 accordingly we ate with you holding 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:59.099
 right usually
