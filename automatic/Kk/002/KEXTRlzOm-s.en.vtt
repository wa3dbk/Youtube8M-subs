00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
violet Pokemon the best thing to do

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.950 
violet Pokemon the best thing to do
thinking<00:00:38.010> wise<00:00:38.219> as<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.910> gonna<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.629> as

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
thinking wise as to what is gonna do as

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.830 
thinking wise as to what is gonna do as
a<00:00:39.989> move<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.610> does<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> evolve<00:00:42.360> into

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
a move is it what does it evolve into

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.330 
a move is it what does it evolve into
and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.500> does<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.890> thing<00:00:43.950> do

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and then think what does that thing do

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.819 
and then think what does that thing do
so<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.450> about<00:00:45.660> obviously<00:00:45.899> vols<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.410> crowbar

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so go about obviously vols in crowbar

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.770 
so go about obviously vols in crowbar
and<00:00:46.980> crow<00:00:47.160> about<00:00:47.190> usually<00:00:47.640> carry<00:00:47.820> torn<00:00:48.149> so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and crow about usually carry torn so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.660 
and crow about usually carry torn so
probably<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.770> good<00:00:49.890> idea<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.219> me<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> set

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
probably not a good idea for me to set

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.340 
probably not a good idea for me to set
up<00:00:50.700> stealth<00:00:50.969> rocks<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.989> works<00:00:52.170> out

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

great to have that thing out the way it
goes<00:01:09.390> into<00:01:09.600> entei<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.170> good<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.189> flare<00:01:11.369> blitz

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
goes into entei and good for flare blitz

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.960 
goes into entei and good for flare blitz
obviously<00:01:12.650> physical<00:01:13.650> entei<00:01:14.100> there's<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
obviously physical entei there's a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.310 
obviously physical entei there's a
trade-off<00:01:15.240> between<00:01:15.450> special<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.990> physical

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
trade-off between special and physical

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.600 
trade-off between special and physical
entei<00:01:16.560> i<00:01:16.710> guess<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.100> better<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.400> has

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
entei i guess it's better that has

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
entei i guess it's better that has
flared<00:01:17.909> list<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.290> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
flared list now but as you can see it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
flared list now but as you can see it
really<00:01:19.590> only<00:01:19.830> does<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.850> under<00:01:21.270> half<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
really only does just just under half to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
really only does just just under half to
me<00:01:21.930> meaning<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:22.950> i<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.369> off<00:01:23.430> from<00:01:23.490> ella

this maybe singles he has quick attack
and<00:03:08.459> i'm<00:03:08.970> pretty<00:03:09.239> sure<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.689> he<00:03:09.810> will<00:03:09.930> have

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
and i'm pretty sure that he will have

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.470 
and i'm pretty sure that he will have
quick<00:03:10.439> attack<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.310> reason<00:03:11.790> i<00:03:12.000> believe<00:03:12.299> he

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
quick attack the reason i believe he

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.629 
quick attack the reason i believe he
didn't<00:03:12.780> stay<00:03:12.989> in<00:03:13.019> on<00:03:13.439> medicham<00:03:14.099> initially

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
didn't stay in on medicham initially

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.429 
didn't stay in on medicham initially
even<00:03:14.939> though<00:03:15.000> he<00:03:15.150> had<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.329> swords<00:03:15.510> dance<00:03:15.810> was

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
even though he had the swords dance was

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.229 
even though he had the swords dance was
quick<00:03:17.099> attack<00:03:17.280> wouldn't<00:03:17.609> have<00:03:17.699> taken<00:03:17.879> me<00:03:18.120> out

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
quick attack wouldn't have taken me out

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.909 
quick attack wouldn't have taken me out
from<00:03:18.479> full<00:03:18.720> health<00:03:18.959> even<00:03:19.319> with<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.500> plus<00:03:19.709> two

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
from full health even with the plus two

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.039 
from full health even with the plus two
so<00:03:20.459> that's<00:03:20.970> why<00:03:21.120> he<00:03:21.269> switched<00:03:21.479> to<00:03:21.599> dust<00:03:21.900> while

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
so that's why he switched to dust while

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.080 
so that's why he switched to dust while
there<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:22.739> now<00:03:23.340> i<00:03:23.370> can't<00:03:23.669> really<00:03:23.909> go<00:03:24.060> into

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
there but now i can't really go into

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.059 
there but now i can't really go into
Quagsire<00:03:24.720> my<00:03:24.989> physically<00:03:25.379> defensive<00:03:25.829> dude

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.399 
Quagsire my physically defensive dude
and<00:03:26.340> even<00:03:26.940> if<00:03:27.030> he<00:03:27.090> saw<00:03:27.269> dances<00:03:27.870> he<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.169> not

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
and even if he saw dances he is not

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.259 
and even if he saw dances he is not
going<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.620> be<00:03:28.739> able<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:29.099> do<00:03:29.250> much<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.639> me<00:03:29.760> just

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
going to be able to do much to me just

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.909 
going to be able to do much to me just
because<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.540> have<00:03:30.810> unaware<00:03:31.379> i'm<00:03:31.590> not<00:03:31.739> using

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
because I have unaware i'm not using

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.289 
because I have unaware i'm not using
water<00:03:32.190> absorb<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.579> think<00:03:32.729> unawares<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.120> nice

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
water absorb I think unawares a nice

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.149 
water absorb I think unawares a nice
ability<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.959> though<00:03:34.229> it's<00:03:34.680> very<00:03:34.889> cool

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
ability to have though it's very cool

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.280 
ability to have though it's very cool
and<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.430> certainly<00:03:35.790> mitigates<00:03:36.750> things<00:03:37.019> like

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
and it certainly mitigates things like

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.469 
and it certainly mitigates things like
scyther<00:03:37.769> who<00:03:37.979> perchance<00:03:38.519> would<00:03:39.030> wish<00:03:39.269> to
