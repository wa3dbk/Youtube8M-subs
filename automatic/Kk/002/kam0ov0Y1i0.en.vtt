of tix your mesh and it unwrapped sit on
a<00:00:25.830> flat<00:00:26.130> plane<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.700> then<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.060> add<00:00:27.210> bits<00:00:27.480> on

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
a flat plane so then you can add bits on

a flat plane so then you can add bits on
and<00:00:27.990> look<00:00:28.200> real<00:00:28.470> hard<00:00:28.770> service<00:00:29.130> stuff<00:00:29.490> things

it<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:32.430> trying<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:32.940> we

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it up so I was trying to think about we

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.270 
it up so I was trying to think about we
do<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.620> digital<00:00:34.770> sculpting

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
do that from a digital sculpting

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.819 
do that from a digital sculpting
perspective<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.060> I<00:00:36.090> came<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.450> with

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
perspective this is what I came up with

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.780 
perspective this is what I came up with
kin<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.160> while<00:00:38.250> guap<00:00:38.460> never

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
kin with a little while guap never

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
kin with a little while guap never
actually<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> chance<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.600> pass<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.350> on

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
actually have the chance to pass this on

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.200 
actually have the chance to pass this on
yet<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.400> this<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.910> new<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:44.000> you'll<00:00:45.000> see

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
yet so this is a new one and you'll see

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
yet so this is a new one and you'll see
the<00:00:45.390> usefulness<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.289> hopefully<00:00:46.920> by<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the usefulness of this hopefully by the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.680 
the usefulness of this hopefully by the
end<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> very<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.570> very

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
end of this this is a very very very

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.259 
end of this this is a very very very
basic<00:00:49.260> example<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.850> honest<00:00:51.120> I've

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
basic example because be honest I've

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.119 
basic example because be honest I've
been<00:00:51.390> recording<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.960> there<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.710> about<00:00:52.829> eight

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
been recording all there for about eight

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.099 
been recording all there for about eight
and<00:00:53.190> nine<00:00:53.430> hours<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.300> am<00:00:54.449> absolutely

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
and nine hours now and I am absolutely

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.709 
and nine hours now and I am absolutely
nacked<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:56.789> sorry<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.090> only<00:00:57.300> word<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.600> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
nacked I'm sorry that's only word for it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.389 
nacked I'm sorry that's only word for it
so<00:00:58.350> let's<00:00:58.469> divide<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.070> gonna<00:00:59.160> divide

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
so let's divide this so I'm gonna divide

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.450 
so let's divide this so I'm gonna divide
it<00:00:59.519> quite<00:00:59.699> high<00:01:00.019> I<00:01:01.019> know<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.710> Machine<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:02.190> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it quite high I know the Machine take so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.260 
it quite high I know the Machine take so
it's<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:02.969> there<00:01:03.929> now<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:05.510> look<00:01:06.510> 69<00:01:07.290> million<00:01:08.270> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it's up there now to look 69 million and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
it's up there now to look 69 million and
I<00:01:09.330> won't<00:01:09.540> take<00:01:10.200> display<00:01:10.890> something<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
I won't take display something up I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.090 
I won't take display something up I
created<00:01:12.060> from<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> hard<00:01:12.960> service<00:01:13.260> models<00:01:14.040> in

just generate from before i start at

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.700 
just generate from before i start at
this<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.540> stick<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.079> there<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.320> press<00:01:22.500> go

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.319 
this and you stick on there and press go
and<00:01:22.740> we'd<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.460> look<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> bit<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> mess<00:01:24.150> because

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
and we'd it look a bit of a mess because

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.359 
and we'd it look a bit of a mess because
it's<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.110> one's<00:01:25.380> based<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> sphere<00:01:25.890> it's

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
it's that one's based on a sphere it's

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.410 
it's that one's based on a sphere it's
couple<00:01:26.579> from<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> sphere<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.299> you're

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
couple from the sphere but if you're

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.929 
couple from the sphere but if you're
using<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.899> this<00:01:28.079> for<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.619> character<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.880> it

as you can see what you can do is if

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
as you can see what you can do is if
you're<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.549> quite<00:01:44.790> sure<00:01:44.820> which<00:01:45.360> bits<00:01:45.860> your

I'm<00:02:02.189> sculpting<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.789> already<00:02:03.210> pretty<00:02:03.329> busy<00:02:03.600> so

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
I'm sculpting is already pretty busy so

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.200 
I'm sculpting is already pretty busy so
we'll<00:02:04.619> try<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> couple<00:02:05.039> things<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.549> fares<00:02:05.880> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
we'll try a couple things with fares and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.380 
we'll try a couple things with fares and
curves<00:02:06.539> so<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.649> down<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> list<00:02:08.160> select<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.180> for

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
curves so go down the list select it for

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
curves so go down the list select it for
a<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.710> navigate<00:02:11.490> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
a see and you can then navigate it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.810 
a see and you can then navigate it
around<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.750> try<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.050> find<00:02:13.320> someone<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.700> I'll

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
around and try and find someone but I'll

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.330 
around and try and find someone but I'll
say<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.240> already<00:02:15.480> pretty<00:02:15.660> putt<00:02:15.990> now

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
say this is already pretty putt now

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.380 
say this is already pretty putt now
remember<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.640> way<00:02:17.850> it's<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.300> get

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
remember that that way it's going to get

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.500 
remember that that way it's going to get
squashed<00:02:19.370> into<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.489> nearly<00:02:20.700> vertical<00:02:20.910> position

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
squashed into a nearly vertical position

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.390 
squashed into a nearly vertical position
you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.750> tell<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.170> by<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.349> top<00:02:22.830> above<00:02:23.160> that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
you can tell that by the top above that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.320 
you can tell that by the top above that
how<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.180> circle<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.810> turned<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:25.140> on

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
how the circle is turned it on

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.300 
how the circle is turned it on
Orville<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.470> we'd<00:02:26.620> use<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.920> as<00:02:27.010> your<00:02:27.040> guide

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
Orville so we'd use that as your guide

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.210 
Orville so we'd use that as your guide
but<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.180> better<00:02:28.330> setup<00:02:28.750> movies<00:02:29.160> great<00:02:30.160> you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
but with better setup movies great you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.280 
but with better setup movies great you
know<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.610> they<00:02:30.730> stick<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:30.970> 300<00:02:31.630> stroke<00:02:32.140> on

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
know so they stick that 300 stroke on

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.790 
know so they stick that 300 stroke on
curve<00:02:33.270> it'll<00:02:34.270> use<00:02:34.510> current<00:02:35.230> brush<00:02:35.410> settings

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
curve it'll use current brush settings

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.550 
curve it'll use current brush settings
now<00:02:36.040> that's<00:02:36.220> way<00:02:36.730> too<00:02:37.150> aggressive<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
now that's way too aggressive of the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.050 
now that's way too aggressive of the
other<00:02:38.680> quick<00:02:39.130> look<00:02:39.280> hide<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.610> curves<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.940> can

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
other quick look hide the curves you can

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.290 
other quick look hide the curves you can
see<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:41.080> know<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.230> too<00:02:41.590> deep<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:46.000> what

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
see it's you know it's too deep so what

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.050 
see it's you know it's too deep so what
we'll<00:02:46.420> do<00:02:46.570> is<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:47.470> create<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.830> new<00:02:47.860> curve<00:02:48.220> this

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
we'll do is and create a new curve this

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.200 
we'll do is and create a new curve this
time<00:02:49.330> we'll<00:02:49.480> go<00:02:49.570> for<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.780> square<00:02:50.880> French<00:02:51.880> cubes

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
time we'll go for a square French cubes

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.460 
time we'll go for a square French cubes
actually<00:02:52.450> quite<00:02:52.600> nice<00:02:52.750> if<00:02:52.990> you<00:02:53.110> want<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.320> try

is<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.570> sometimes<00:03:05.050> if<00:03:05.200> you're<00:03:05.260> working<00:03:05.560> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
is if sometimes if you're working a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.430 
is if sometimes if you're working a
different<00:03:05.980> scale<00:03:06.300> you've<00:03:07.300> got<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.510> maybe<00:03:08.230> have

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
different scale you've got a maybe have

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.370 
different scale you've got a maybe have
one<00:03:08.620> or<00:03:08.709> two<00:03:08.880> goes<00:03:09.880> at<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.650> brush<00:03:12.480> strength<00:03:13.480> on

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
one or two goes at the brush strength on

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.680 
one or two goes at the brush strength on
this<00:03:14.680> now<00:03:15.310> as<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.520> say<00:03:15.670> this<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.060> first<00:03:16.270> time

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
this now as I say this is the first time

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.080 
this now as I say this is the first time
I've<00:03:16.959> recorded<00:03:17.380> trying<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:19.230> at<00:03:20.230> all<00:03:21.090> it's

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
I've recorded trying this at all it's

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.900 
I've recorded trying this at all it's
been<00:03:22.300> an<00:03:22.390> ideal<00:03:22.720> up<00:03:22.900> till<00:03:23.080> now<00:03:23.110> so<00:03:23.830> you'll<00:03:24.700> see

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
been an ideal up till now so you'll see

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.830 
been an ideal up till now so you'll see
the<00:03:25.090> first<00:03:25.300> go<00:03:25.540> i<00:03:25.570> have<00:03:27.240> my<00:03:28.240> duplicate<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.750> on

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
the first go i have my duplicate it on

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.330 
the first go i have my duplicate it on
care<00:03:29.080> of<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.320> brush<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.769> little<00:03:30.160> bit<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:35.340> to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
care of the brush is a little bit to to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.920 
care of the brush is a little bit to to
shuttle<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.150> we<00:03:37.239> do<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:37.420> again<00:03:37.570> on<00:03:37.690> something

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
shuttle so we do it again on something

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.740 
shuttle so we do it again on something
heavier<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.100> what<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.310> can<00:03:39.400> see<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:39.760> it

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
heavier this is what you can see that it

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.850 
heavier this is what you can see that it
works<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:41.140> not<00:03:41.290> quite<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.760> we<00:03:42.850> try<00:03:43.090> something

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
works but not quite so we try something

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.590 
works but not quite so we try something
we'll<00:03:44.860> see<00:03:45.070> even<00:03:45.340> try<00:03:45.670> bit<00:03:46.120> more<00:03:46.540> aggressive

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
we'll see even try bit more aggressive

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.830 
we'll see even try bit more aggressive
brush<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.410> lot<00:03:47.590> stronger<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.790> will<00:03:49.120> scale<00:03:49.660> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
brush a lot stronger and will scale that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.699 
brush a lot stronger and will scale that

and<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:06.850> grid<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.630> then<00:04:07.750> hide<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.050> curves

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640

and<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.700> week<00:04:09.880> will<00:04:10.060> basically<00:04:10.540> then<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:10.930> can

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
and the week will basically then you can

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.580 
and the week will basically then you can
generate<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.920> new<00:04:12.130> displacement<00:04:12.489> map<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:14.410> they

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
generate a new displacement map and they
