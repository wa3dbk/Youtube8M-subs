00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.190
 girls all big hello today we 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.280
 begin the second part of our test 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.639
 bases under the shadows it will be with us today 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.789
 a meeting 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.960
 from the essense and we start our makeup and 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.480
 so first we put the base 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.070
 what can I say about this base at all she 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.950
 It is presented to us not only as a base but also 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.530
 eyeshadow with applicator base under 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.780
 shadows for a more resistant make up here 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.699
 she has such a wonderful nose 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.149
 very comfortable actually their eyes 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:45.140
 pretty liquid she's good 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.379
 superimposed dries well in principle 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.480
 there is no special care for her 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.100
 need to 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.719
 special forge smearing there and so 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.449
 Further, that is, in principle, everything is very 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.949
 quickly done but anyway i think 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.129
 I need to dry a little bit of course 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.290
 despite the fact that she has such 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.899
 let's say so beige flesh tinged by 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.869
 in the end there is no 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.140
 she does not give shade here it is already 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.180
 dried up 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.520
 need a little tatey soak in 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.880
 dry than we actually do 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.360
 now back in a minute put 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.100
 small pillow and for cleanliness 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.829
 the experiment will be applied 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.570
 the same shadows that I want all the same 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.880
 for yourself to reanimate it 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.500
 color tattoo from meybellin white 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.829
 so ugly me this is all the same 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:49.359
 tassel adjust height 09 fray at all 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.359
 just godless 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:59.270
 I have already shown them color tattoo 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.390
 white even if these shadows or for 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.710
 itself is not revived, he probably would have 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.700
 use them like a highlighter but in 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:15.050
 In principle, it may be quite good yesterday. 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.580
 I tried to put on the cheekbones on the upper 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.680
 generally cool all the shadows applied need 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.340
 you need to give them literally two minutes what 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.890
 dry out further we apply a dimming 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.290
 hue this is my cola tattoo from 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.810
 meybellin that's the color he's cold 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.180
 brown gray-brown it is more 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.890
 surely gray than brown 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.890
 that's what it looks like 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.519
 Here is a color to notice and the color is very 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.019
 beautiful he fits my very 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.060
 eyes and 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:02.120
 i have exactly the same shade of shadow 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:06.010
 from from revlon now I'll show here they are very 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.010
 alike are starting to dim the century 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.569
 we put mascara and 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.280
 is ready 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.150
 and so I have time now 1534 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.150
 that is, floor 4 let's see how it will be 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.590
 behave for an hour at 9 probably and then 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.590
 check already completely before bedtime 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.650
 so let's see what we have 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.239
 it was half past eight 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.239
 in fact, in principle, looks 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.540
 not bad but the only catch is 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.700
 that here already started 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.180
 the slide of it probably won't be seen 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:11.360
 on video but I'm afraid that the slide is already 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 started here and another such 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.650
 minus a pretty big I 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.400
 hike business base ate shadows or shadows 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.800
 she wore much 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.530
 I do not know that you have abundant reason I 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.539
 they have gone somewhere a little bit more 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.680
 like with makeup and see what happens 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.680
 at 11 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.419
 so girls immediately apologize for 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:43.330
 I have this lighting in the evening 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.580
 get me right really here 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.650
 here in this folds rolled up the wall you 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.500
 there may not transfer the camera but also 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.990
 fine see it myself looked in 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.190
 the mirror looked into the camera it is absolutely 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:02.400
 two different two different things but in reality 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:06.789
 In fact here here are those from riding 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.909
 probably not a very nice base effect 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:14.710
 ate the shadows these shadows that they left 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:16.979
 rolled up the base from essense probably not 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.229
 set not the best option for my 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.810
 meybellin color tattoo unfortunately we will 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.150
 hope for a base from vivienne sabo 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.199
 this will be our next base which we 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.050
 we will test 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.620
 don't miss this video and stay with 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.620
 bye bye 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.810
 so let's
