backwards<00:01:01.110> this<00:01:02.110> is<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.470> blade<00:01:02.710> 350<00:01:03.250> QX<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
backwards this is the blade 350 QX this

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.280 
backwards this is the blade 350 QX this
has<00:01:05.080> GPS<00:01:05.850> stabilization<00:01:06.870> as<00:01:07.870> you<00:01:08.050> can<00:01:08.170> see

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
has GPS stabilization as you can see

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.870 
has GPS stabilization as you can see
from<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.620> green<00:01:08.860> light<00:01:09.159> on<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.460> back<00:01:09.640> this

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
from the green light on the back this

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.870 
from the green light on the back this
means<00:01:10.120> that<00:01:10.270> it's<00:01:10.540> in<00:01:10.720> GPS<00:01:11.320> mode<00:01:11.620> of<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.460> GPS

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
means that it's in GPS mode of the GPS

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.649 
means that it's in GPS mode of the GPS
system<00:01:13.810> keeps<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.830> quad<00:01:15.610> exactly<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:16.510> the

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
system keeps the quad exactly in the

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.050 
system keeps the quad exactly in the
place<00:01:16.870> where<00:01:17.200> you've<00:01:17.799> left<00:01:18.010> it<00:01:18.190> so<00:01:18.940> I'm<00:01:19.030> not

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
place where you've left it so I'm not

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.030 
place where you've left it so I'm not
holding<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.570> controls<00:01:19.990> it's<00:01:20.650> just<00:01:20.830> flying

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
holding the controls it's just flying

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.870 
holding the controls it's just flying
itself<00:01:21.400> we're<00:01:22.090> moving<00:01:22.240> on<00:01:22.510> from<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.880> more

itself we're moving on from the more

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.450 
itself we're moving on from the more
basic<00:01:25.600> models<00:01:26.259> up<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> more<00:01:26.799> advanced<00:01:27.100> model

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
basic models up to a more advanced model

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.330 
basic models up to a more advanced model
this<00:01:27.579> is<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.880> DJI<00:01:28.740> 450<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:29.950> in<00:01:30.070> fact<00:01:30.219> this

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
this is the DJI 450 and in fact this

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.100 
this is the DJI 450 and in fact this
used<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.640> be<00:01:30.789> my<00:01:30.820> model<00:01:31.210> when<00:01:31.390> i<00:01:31.420> first<00:01:31.659> started

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
used to be my model when i first started

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.139 
used to be my model when i first started
and<00:01:32.380> pull<00:01:32.799> taking<00:01:33.189> it<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.369> modified<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:33.880> and

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
and pull taking it and modified it and

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.719 
and pull taking it and modified it and
i've<00:01:34.570> also<00:01:34.920> configured<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.009> radio<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:36.579> that<00:01:36.700> i

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
i've also configured the radio so that i

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.569 
i've also configured the radio so that i
can<00:01:36.850> pan<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.240> tilts<00:01:37.659> on<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.469> camera<00:01:38.920> but<00:01:39.100> also

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
can pan and tilts on the camera but also

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.840 
can pan and tilts on the camera but also
as<00:01:40.060> well<00:01:40.299> i<00:01:40.539> can<00:01:40.840> adjust<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.920> pan<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:42.340> tilt<00:01:42.549> on

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
as well i can adjust the pan and tilt on

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.539 
as well i can adjust the pan and tilt on
the<00:01:43.270> knob<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.600> radio<00:01:43.990> as<00:01:44.170> well<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:45.070> i<00:01:45.100> can

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
the knob on the radio as well so i can

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.940 
the knob on the radio as well so i can
see<00:01:45.969> a<00:01:46.000> lot<00:01:46.180> more<00:01:46.210> from<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.810> air<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.619> app<00:01:47.740> will

see a lot more from the air the app will

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.380 
see a lot more from the air the app will
tell<00:01:48.219> you<00:01:48.280> how<00:01:48.399> much<00:01:48.549> effective<00:01:48.969> capacity

with this which is quite a long time and
then<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.270> do<00:02:01.630> need<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.960> really<00:02:02.229> think<00:02:02.259> about

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
then you do need to really think about

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.859 
then you do need to really think about
