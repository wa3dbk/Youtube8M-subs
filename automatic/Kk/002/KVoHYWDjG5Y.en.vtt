so<00:00:30.310> you<00:00:30.580> know<00:00:30.700> but<00:00:30.970> from<00:00:31.210> here<00:00:31.420> looks<00:00:31.750> like<00:00:31.900> a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
so you know but from here looks like a

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.560 
so you know but from here looks like a
pretty<00:00:32.140> standard<00:00:32.880> ultrabook<00:00:33.880> here's<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.420> big

pretty standard ultrabook here's the big
difference<00:00:34.930> however<00:00:35.110> since<00:00:35.470> running

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
difference however since running

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.030 
difference however since running
obviously<00:00:36.250> there's<00:00:36.550> a<00:00:37.650> not<00:00:38.650> a<00:00:38.680> touch<00:00:38.920> screen

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
obviously there's a not a touch screen

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.440 
obviously there's a not a touch screen
over<00:00:39.310> here<00:00:39.340> I<00:00:39.640> do<00:00:39.700> want<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.000> touch<00:00:40.120> it<00:00:40.150> hover

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.720 

you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.430> early

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
you know this is a really early

you know this is a really early
prototype<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:07.290> spoke<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> Samsung<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.670> have

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
prototype we spoke to Samsung they have

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.040 
prototype we spoke to Samsung they have
no<00:01:08.940> idea<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.420> thing<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.750> ever<00:01:09.870> actually

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
no idea if this thing is ever actually

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.310 
no idea if this thing is ever actually
going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> come<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> market<00:01:11.840> but<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.229> know

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
going to come to the market but you know

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.570 
going to come to the market but you know
pretty<00:01:13.500> clear<00:01:13.740> concept<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
pretty clear concept here this is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.430 
pretty clear concept here this is
another<00:01:14.850> way<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.180> taking<00:01:15.570> windows<00:01:16.050> 8<00:01:16.260> and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
another way of taking windows 8 and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.280 
another way of taking windows 8 and
being<00:01:17.010> able<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.280> use<00:01:17.460> both<00:01:17.729> eli's<00:01:18.090> both<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
being able to use both eli's both as a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830 
being able to use both eli's both as a
laptop<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.920> intent<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> tablet<00:01:21.090> it's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
laptop and intent as a tablet it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.710 
laptop and intent as a tablet it's
pretty<00:01:22.020> heavy<00:01:22.200> again<00:01:23.190> it's<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> prototype<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pretty heavy again it's a prototype you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.760 
pretty heavy again it's a prototype you
know<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> interesting<00:01:25.320> things<00:01:25.680> about

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
know one of the interesting things about

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.350 
know one of the interesting things about
this<00:01:26.070> dual<00:01:26.400> screen<00:01:26.640> design<00:01:26.940> however<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
this dual screen design however is the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.230 
this dual screen design however is the
fact<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.190> most<00:01:29.190> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> weight<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.820> actually

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
fact that most of the weight is actually

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
fact that most of the weight is actually
distributed<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.170> upper<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.800> this<00:01:31.950> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
distributed on the upper so this is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.320 
distributed on the upper so this is
something<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> you're<00:01:32.580> not<00:01:32.610> release<00:01:33.000> doing

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
something that you're not release doing

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.420 
something that you're not release doing
a<00:01:33.360> laptop<00:01:33.780> since<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.650> got<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.800> tablet<00:01:35.070> design

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
a laptop since it's got a tablet design

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.029 
a laptop since it's got a tablet design
up<00:01:35.580> there<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> lot<00:01:36.690> of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> parts<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
up there a lot of the parts are and the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.770 
up there a lot of the parts are and the
display<00:01:38.399> there<00:01:39.330> are<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> lot<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> other

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
display there are a lot of other

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
display there are a lot of other
concepts<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.350> we're<00:01:40.470> seeing<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.860> Samsung

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
concepts that we're seeing at Samsung

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.100 
concepts that we're seeing at Samsung
these<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.630> different<00:01:42.899> form<00:01:43.079> factors

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
these are just different form factors

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.740 
these are just different form factors
this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> memo<00:01:44.250> pc<00:01:44.610> right<00:01:44.820> there<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.600> this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
this is the memo pc right there so this

Samsung is taking that across the
different<00:01:58.860> lines<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.970> swivel<00:02:00.360> design<00:02:00.390> so

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
different lines the swivel design so

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.480 
different lines the swivel design so
it's<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.229> swivel<00:02:01.649> hinge<00:02:01.799> mechanism<00:02:02.069> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it's got this swivel hinge mechanism you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.850 
it's got this swivel hinge mechanism you
can<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.759> silver<00:02:03.119> thing<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> top

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
can see that silver thing at the top

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.660 
can see that silver thing at the top
slim<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.130> rugged<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.899> also<00:02:07.079> does<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
slim it's rugged so and this also does a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.009 
slim it's rugged so and this also does a
laptop<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.849> tablet<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.390> clearly<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
laptop and tablet but so clearly this is

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.509 
laptop and tablet but so clearly this is
something<00:02:10.380> that<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.800> Samsung<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.310> really

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
something that that Samsung is really

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.970 
something that that Samsung is really
moving<00:02:11.640> towards<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> moving<00:02:12.959> ahead<00:02:13.080> yet

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
moving towards as a moving ahead yet

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860 
moving towards as a moving ahead yet
another<00:02:14.340> sliding<00:02:14.910> mechanism<00:02:15.180> right<00:02:15.630> here

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
another sliding mechanism right here

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.150 
another sliding mechanism right here
they're<00:02:16.080> calling<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.500> binder<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.010> me<00:02:17.099> it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
they're calling this a binder to me it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.979 
they're calling this a binder to me it
looks<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> lot<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.760> typewriter<00:02:18.209> I'm<00:02:18.690> hoping

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
looks a lot like a typewriter I'm hoping

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.600 
looks a lot like a typewriter I'm hoping
you<00:02:19.110> type<00:02:19.349> in<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.650> thing<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.190> display

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
you type in that thing just the display

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.250 
you type in that thing just the display
moves<00:02:20.819> across<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.420> I'm<00:02:21.840> sure<00:02:22.019> that's<00:02:22.200> not

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
moves across but I'm sure that's not

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.720 
moves across but I'm sure that's not
actually<00:02:22.530> how<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.769> works<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.130> was<00:02:23.220> no<00:02:23.370> logic

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
actually how it works it was no logic

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.880 
actually how it works it was no logic
wired<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:24.989> got<00:02:25.260> sort<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.799> an

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
wired for this and it's got sort of an

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.520 
wired for this and it's got sort of an
easy<00:02:26.069> shift<00:02:26.370> between<00:02:26.610> again<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.530> typing

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
easy shift between again this typing

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.630 
easy shift between again this typing
mode<00:02:28.739> and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
mode and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.210 
mode and
the<00:02:30.150> display<00:02:30.960> mode<00:02:31.170> as<00:02:31.319> well<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.770> mean<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.069> is

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the display mode as well I mean this is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.410 
the display mode as well I mean this is
really<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.520> theme<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.970> we're<00:02:33.120> seeing<00:02:33.240> across

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
really a theme that we're seeing across

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.110 
really a theme that we're seeing across
all<00:02:33.810> these<00:02:33.959> prototypes<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.680> loves<00:02:34.920> park<00:02:35.120> slide

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
all these prototypes in loves park slide

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.720 
all these prototypes in loves park slide
it's<00:02:36.870> got<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.200> also<00:02:37.500> got<00:02:37.620> an<00:02:37.709> engine<00:02:37.950> structure

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it's got to also got an engine structure

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.540 
it's got to also got an engine structure
on<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.480> an<00:02:39.630> adjustable<00:02:39.990> angle<00:02:40.650> looks<00:02:41.340> like

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
on it and an adjustable angle looks like

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.890 
on it and an adjustable angle looks like
it's<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.880> be<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> touchscreen<00:02:42.390> device<00:02:42.750> as

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
it's going to be a touchscreen device as

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.080 
it's going to be a touchscreen device as
well<00:02:42.990> they're<00:02:43.830> not<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:44.190> saying<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.610> it's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
well they're not really saying it it's

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.760 
well they're not really saying it it's
got<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.390> windows<00:02:45.720> 8<00:02:45.900> logo<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.290> there<00:02:46.530> so

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
got that windows 8 logo on there so

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.970 
got that windows 8 logo on there so
that's<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:47.370> pretty<00:02:47.490> safe<00:02:47.700> bet<00:02:47.870> one<00:02:48.870> more<00:02:49.110> most

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that's a pretty safe bet one more most

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.250 
that's a pretty safe bet one more most
brightly<00:02:50.280> colored<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.030> just<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.240> pop-up<00:02:51.480> this

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
brightly colored it's just a pop-up this

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.510 
brightly colored it's just a pop-up this
looks<00:02:52.470> really<00:02:52.620> familiar<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.220> me<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.459> looks

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
looks really familiar to me this looks

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.060 
looks really familiar to me this looks
like<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.959> model<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:55.170> saw<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.410> sony<00:02:55.800> vaio

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070

clearly this is a design that a lot of
people<00:03:00.360> are<00:03:00.690> looking<00:03:01.020> at<00:03:01.140> moving<00:03:02.100> ahead<00:03:02.250> so
