00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.240
 and hello to all friends with you again I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.430
 huskies rusher and today we will find out about you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.789
 quite awesome and not ordinary tank 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.189
 at the seventh level, this is tank 29 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.369
 my story about this unit I 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.899
 I would like to start with personal impressions 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.020
 playing this tank is not in the top 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.820
 configuration and in the first battle 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 practically took time stronger then 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.870
 I was very surprised and the car 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.649
 is like in stock and drags about 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.690
 google then I remembered the T-34 tank and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.199
 I wanted to compare the stock model 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.620
 tank t-29 and thirty four that i 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.859
 saw these tanks are absolutely similar friend 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.039
 on friend and what's the most amazing tower 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.359
 with an impenetrable mask too 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.570
 tank t-34 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.210
 but we have 34 straight lines of the eighth level and he 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.180
 He gets ten and we also turn 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.040
 rarely see and nine respectively, 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.020
 correctly using this tank I 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.070
 received incredible pleasure from 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.729
 playing it after I brought this 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.500
 unit top and again surprised masthead 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.560
 a weapon that is not necessary to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.750
 research is top of the tank 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 t32 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.400
 hence getting this weapon on 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.729
 tank t29 we will not waste our time 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.990
 and experience on researching this instrument on 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.990
 tanker t32 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 coming out in the first fight in the top of my joy 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.980
 there was no limit 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.020
 armor breakdown ordinary bullets in a hundred 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.210
 ninety eight millimeters is quite 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.250
 enough and huge needs in 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.650
 podkaliberov I did not see therefore 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.660
 use gold shells better 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.110
 only in the fight against the ninth 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.560
 levels 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:15.720
 extreme cases against eight better 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.410
 total tank through our impenetrable 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.410
 mask 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.959
 special because of its shelters thanks 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.720
 good tool declination angles down 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.209
 -10 degrees we are no harm to ourselves 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.570
 we can drill any shells except 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.150
 high-explosive and thanks to them she can 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.590
 pass some home 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.220
 The very style of play on this tank is quite 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.950
 simple any situation we try to tank 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.330
 through our mask and try not to 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.330
 substitute our body 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.799
 affect mm armor want to note that 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:04.040
 the fact that it is practically not in our forehead 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:07.430
 102 millimeters in the sides 76 and in the stern 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.519
 only 51 from the tower 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.280
 completely different unit is armored as a whole 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.840
 two hundred seventy nine millimeters this 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.540
 tantamount to armor breakdown 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.400
 the weapon of fri-sau on the tenth level but we 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.900
 get with you only to nine 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.569
 therefore ten we never 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.700
 see but not the fact that they can 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.390
 We even have to break even level 9 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.980
 for the rest, the Bronnitsis separated the board on 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.500
 102 7 millimeters of feed and does 102 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.810
 knowledgeable players which was or is this 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.540
 the unit will constantly shoot at 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.190
 corps or commander's tower 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.670
 which though is under good 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.349
 corners but wbr is wbr and count on 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.349
 indestructibility is clearly not worth it 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.400
 the rate of fire and dpm are also at the level 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.060
 having a one-time damage of 310 units and 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.830
 firing rate with 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.410
 100% crew rammer 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.880
 make up an unprecedented six shots 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:19.350
 a minute and this is 1860 average damage 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.110
 per minute I count for the seventh level 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.210
 this is quite enough spread on 100 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.690
 meters is 042 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.600
 it's almost like big brother 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.050
 but don't forget that there are cards 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.580
 not 500 by 500 meters but much more 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.390
 hence the spread is much 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.900
 more 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.730
 it is almost doubled if you hit the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.920
 surrounded by a large cluster of enemies 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.250
 then my advice to you is to fight them until 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.560
 last breath since our weak 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.669
 dynamics and considerable size of the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.160
 the hull will not be able to leave 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.810
 the maximum speed we have 35 kilometers per hour in 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.210
 aggregate with a mass of sixty 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.390
 four and a half tons can not 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.790
 save us summing up for this tank 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.850
 i will say that like any other so on 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.419
 seventh level t29 deserves attention 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:17.260
 any player for he is absolute 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:19.690

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.919

 tank t-34 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.229
 better ride t29 first 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.040
 try this tank look what he out of 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.110

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.510
 in the future already buy thirty 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.419
