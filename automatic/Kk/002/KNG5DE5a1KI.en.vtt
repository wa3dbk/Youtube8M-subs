00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:12.200
 I graduated in games design and 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.309
 I worked for a while in the company. 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.789
 development of games software 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.830
 interactive stimulators worked 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.380
 also like gm that is a game charge 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.289
 I need you and these games and you look at me 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.119
 online multiplayer and now I'm 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.130
 risking your developer 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.950
 independent of together opening my 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.020
 The game studio has chaia in Spanish 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.890
 I already worked in tea in English 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 Portuguese 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.200
 who do the course here to do with vai? 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.680
 come out with the very legal knowledge of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 how which are all the processes 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.719
 of a game production will come out with the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.750
 knowledge of different 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.010
 software that can be applied in 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.300
 another area and with the general knowledge of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.460
 all the rods that are part of the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.439
 the game development is then the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.439
 from this course she will be able to 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.369
 is to choose which area he will 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.760
 specialize 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.740
 Why or do you do everything that is? 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.500
 usually happens in Brazil for those who 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.509
 you are developing independently or you 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.880
 Focus on something, right? 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.939
 I am specialized in 3d for example 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.799
 so you can have several areas 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.720
 course including cinema and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.470
 video editing has too many within the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.509
 game 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.710
 so it's a cool thing you're going 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.920
 have general idea and from there you 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.950
 You decide what makes a good course starts with 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.479
 My subject is game design and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.540
 concept art 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.200
 The stages of the course are to develop the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.130
 game design do takes the design 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.439
 is to make enemies the whole mechanic of the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.509
 game develop balance game for 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.390
 it does not get so easy it 's difficult 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.110
 after that we will create scenarios 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.709
 create characters create narrative is 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.019
 create typography logo the game then go 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.060
 have this part of game design birthing 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.160
 when did you develop the game? 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.640
 Later you will learn how to draw 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.340
 is to make art of design before the 3d of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.599
 animation and then goes through the hand that goes 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.440
 3d rendering 3d rendering 3d rendering 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.750
 character animation characters and 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.450
 then when you have everything with 13 everything 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.120
 ready 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.950
 eva programming schedule issued the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.329
 people learn to leave he had a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.310
 hygiene where you there is all you 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.780
 developed with the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.930
 then up to the art part hence the people 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.860
 has the programming part also after 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.670
 together in Haiti to this public the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.680
 game 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.290
 I'm opening a studio today with a 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.380
 independent developer but the government 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.190
 is with one going to launch next month a 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.359
 subsidy program to be tap 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.810
 on that floor are these small 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:14.209
 technology companies so we the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.739
 gaming studios frame this today in 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.329
 day if you are independent 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.040
 independent game developer you 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:23.810
 have to know a little bit of everything and a half 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.299
 that make all teams are reduced 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.579
 and the work is huge but I think 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.650
 How we are, Brazil is the third 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.880
 largest consumer of games in the world and 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.799
 these mobile mobile platforms so 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.410
 There are lots of people coming down there. 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:43.389
 the game and paying for it is a market 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.389
 which is in portal ascendancy 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.850
 So who's interested in getting started? 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.520
 to develop a game to begin to understand 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.850
 more about this production is getting 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.980
 increasingly serious and recognized in 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.780
 market is the course will start in May and 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.760
 encourages all ages because it is a 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.530
 fun course is teaching a lot and the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.430
 future of who does game nowadays in the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.430
 Brazil is promising
