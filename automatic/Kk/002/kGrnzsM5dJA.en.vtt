is this front almost crossbow design

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.220 
is this front almost crossbow design
very<00:00:56.190> similar<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> sweep<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.930> would<00:00:58.050> see

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
very similar to the sweep you would see

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
very similar to the sweep you would see
on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> sandy<00:00:59.219> carbon-fiber<00:00:59.820> truck

what's nice about going with a hardshell

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.999 
what's nice about going with a hardshell
not<00:01:47.869> only<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.200> you've<00:01:48.350> got<00:01:48.530> some<00:01:48.859> good

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
ventilation here which obviously if you

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.480 
ventilation here which obviously if you
have<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.630> mesh<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:50.990> get<00:01:51.109> full<00:01:51.439> ventilation<00:01:51.950> but

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490

this<00:04:07.890> is<00:04:08.130> convertible<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.330> if<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.540> decide<00:04:09.959> you

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
this is convertible so if you decide you

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.110 
this is convertible so if you decide you
want<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.920> go<00:04:11.040> with<00:04:11.160> over<00:04:11.400> seat<00:04:11.580> with<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> sake

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.479 
want to go with over seat with a sake
styling<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.140> certainly<00:04:13.410> do<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.830> if<00:04:14.160> you

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
styling you can certainly do that if you

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.159 
styling you can certainly do that if you
buy<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.730> bike<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.330> decide<00:04:15.630> halfway

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
buy the bike and you decide halfway

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.289 
buy the bike and you decide halfway
through<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:17.340> know<00:04:17.430> your<00:04:17.579> trial<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.150> that

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
through you know your trial of it that

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
you want to convert to a different

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.190 
you want to convert to a different
steering<00:04:20.220> method<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:21.480> can<00:04:21.630> be<00:04:21.720> done<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:22.019> well

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
steering method that can be done as well
