00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.660
 tell about the channel of my friend for the sake of 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.600
 dota 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.910
 here you will find the top 10 eyes of the players 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.240
 also dota news still a lot of interesting 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.970

 magna and it's time to see what i have 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.380
 liked this week workshop 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.689
 in fifth place is the color of the bounty 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.840
 hunter here honestly tell you nothing 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.989
 special but that here and but cool 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.910
 tail as a hairstyle and also a bandage on 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.070
 eye in principle for combining with 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.960
 other colors will go but still it 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.829
 fifth place you should not expect something 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.289
 supernatural look further here 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.430
 already coming more interesting set and this 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:57.460
 Set on Queens Well, that is, a house like 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.739
 pink red people long ago 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.480
 He did not go out and I know 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.879
 that this set needs to be advanced that 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.950
 doiden wire biden lovers 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.150
 play recorded on such a lot 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.770
 already I think everyone is fed up and here is 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.310
 In principle, not bad things and a lot of different 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.520
 details 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.400
 50 dreams I like as you already understood 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.180
 that I am not indifferent quarter and here we are 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.030
 can watch the ward in the style of the shadow i'm not 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.240
 I know either just some stone in 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.689
 principle, too, nothing special but 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.329
 compared with others he can principle 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.909
 lessons from someone ward place because 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:44.110
 principle, I like it beautifully 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:48.850
 release hope I think I'll buy it 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.990
 go ahead fourth place we already 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.460
 moving to the top 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.650
 to 1 in the first place because it is more accurate 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.410
 second place I made a little mistake here at 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.300
 us nourishing scorpion too long on this 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.840
 the hero had no sets and here we have 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.050
 performed quite well as well 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.540
 notice the Nixon team 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.780
 or nixon honestly do not know this 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.310
 command but cassettes do it by 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.070
 least they are good 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.920
 most likely they are just a sponsor 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.739
 This more accurately sponsor PR 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.870
 Well, in general, it does not matter the main thing that the light 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.650
 good and for scorpion lovers i 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.140
 I think at least does not weigh but some things 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:39.320
 you can replace a very beautiful plan with 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:44.630
 claws at the end such poison claws to me 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.940
 like and it became looked it came 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.820
 time to look at us in the first place 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.940
 it's hearty burton 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.470
 and it's worth noting what became for him 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.320
 very often do sets 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.610
 if this beautiful set releases it 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.390
 there will be 4 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.290
 if earlier timbersaw lovers by the way to 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.930
 which i belong 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.850
 but there was nothing to wear now 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.880
 combine all sorts of color and therefore 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.860
 that they are all extremely good and not colors 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.340
 that would just like to be removed from 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.040
 amber 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.040
 Well, here you can see what 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.380
 usually saw 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.840
 Fuck principle is normal but red style 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.329
 someone might like him 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.030
 there is nothing outstanding here that 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.769
 can be noted but still as for 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.190
 a month ago, takes first place with us 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.780
 it means the work is done well 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.519
 well thank you all for your attention 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.270

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.320
 would like to still take you 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.620

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.770
 dota2 and if you are talented write there 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.080
 in the comments and leave a link to your 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.910
 Workshop page and I think what it is 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.880
 will get in the next release because I 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.800
 I want to promote young authors 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.660
 which is still very much to me all 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.980
 thank you all thank you for your attention everyone
