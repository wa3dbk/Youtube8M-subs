00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.580
 Hello, you have a good tooth whitening today. 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.320
 Yesterday , I was briefly reminded of the remake of cancer in the collection of white pheasant 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.550
 I'll tell you. 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.330
 Yesterday , I could have had some symptoms of acarashirin in my back . 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.649
 I have it 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.419
 It appears primitive'm gonna doing most of the patients are invested at all 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:28.619
 You do not have to worry. 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.390
 No whitening regrets No 3-day period, 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 At this time, 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.230
 If you are a little uncomfortable, if you do not, just stay. 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.160
 I'd like you to take some painkillers like Ferrero. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.129
 If you have any of these symptoms, we recommend whitening the dentist for 30 minutes 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:50.219
 Then when they are shown only the rib effect 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 It does not appear that it has been such a way to penetrate the whitening agent inside the teeth . 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.309
 I do. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:01.260
 When the whitening agent is applied to the outside of the tooth , it reaches the nerve inside the tooth . 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.010
 Year and takes about 15 minutes. So why look for a while, then assemble them 30 times 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.210
 Most of the time, the whitening effect of the teeth rather than the internal 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.740
 You can see it's time to penetrate the whitening agent. 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.210
 It takes three days for the whitening agent to come out completely. 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.900
 Having a look at the symptoms of tingling jurisdiction in that room, why why 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.180
 natural 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:28.740
 You can see that it's normal. 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.670
 30 minutes of charm, and when the time comes when there are stains on the spot 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.510
 You can see it. You do not have to worry about that part at all . 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.230
 As I said before, why do you have to approach me at the beginning, 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.130
 So I will be the first part to be 100 and get the rest of the senator for the first time . 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.060
 Follow me. 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:50.010
 Since the whitening lasts for one to three days, m200 at first 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.170
 Later this entirely white and clean, so that whitening relieve color 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.610
 I think it would be nice if you could drink it . 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.510
 However , during the treatment period, as long as the whitening agent is penetrated , 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.260
 The 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.740
 Coffee coke green tea that causes coloration You should refrain from these things. 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.030
 It's possible 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.660
 Patients who have the coffee to three minutes refrain coffee is almost never seen 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.280
 do not have 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.230
 Many do not drink coffee before bimongsamong example, I have not eaten about two glasses 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.900
 Because exactly what you'll eat and then eat that I still have more media 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.310
 Do not you have to maximize the limited american effect? 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.090
 So eat and then just gave us joteulgeot rinse thoroughly wipe off the old 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.159
 It's the same. 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.340
 I do not really like cigarettes. If you tell me not to smoke a lot, you will not smoke. 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:39.090
 I mean , you know how to make fashion . 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.569
 Well, there's a lot of people who lie and say they did not go out on the side. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.620
 But please wear your epic cider well. 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.550
 But please rinse Mir effect would be to be a little bit more why the dock 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.360
 news 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:56.160
 And for the future, this effect is a lot of individual variation. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.260
 As I told you before, it's the same as selling this quickly. 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.350
 There are words. 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:08.040
 It is a process of expressing clothes and putting clothes on our teeth 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.910
 Bleaching a whitening agent to soak the whiteness of this tooth when you learn the process 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.140
 It's the same. 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:18.000
 In fact , depending on what clothes the clothes are, the bleaching effect will vary 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.380
 Actually now Shanghai Arthur is whitening everywhere in the world 7 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.720
 The method is the same 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.330
 Such effects are diverge difference in the effect is due to characteristics of the right tooth itself 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.690
 It 's the cause of the whitening discoloration. 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.650
 That's why I do not like the whitening effect or think it's a little less 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.370
 Doesimyeon direction more about Double is a little worried when seeing this sort of thing 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:43.440
