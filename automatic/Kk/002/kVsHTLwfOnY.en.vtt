I<00:00:16.980> guess<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> term<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.850> would<00:00:18.000> use<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.539> it

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
I guess is the term I would use for it

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.529 
I guess is the term I would use for it
and<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:19.920> makes<00:00:20.130> minecraft<00:00:20.640> awesome<00:00:21.210> so

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
can't see very well because perhaps

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.709 
can't see very well because perhaps
doesn't<00:00:35.250> pick<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:35.730> well<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.270> i'm

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.940 
doesn't pick it up very well so i'm
gonna<00:00:36.840> hold<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> lava<00:00:37.290> bucket<00:00:37.500> against<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
guys can see and it lights up the entire

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.080 
guys can see and it lights up the entire
world<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.399> don't<00:00:41.579> actually<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
world now you don't actually have to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.360 
world now you don't actually have to
just<00:00:42.450> hold<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.170> let<00:00:43.710> go<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
just hold this see if I let go of it and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
just hold this see if I let go of it and
move<00:00:45.300> back<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.590> holding<00:00:46.829> any<00:00:46.980> more

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
move back see I'm not holding any more

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.080 
move back see I'm not holding any more
and<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.399> dark<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.510> where<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> placed<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
and it's dark but where I placed it is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.959 
and it's dark but where I placed it is
still<00:00:51.090> light<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.079> cool<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
still light so that's really cool and

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
still light so that's really cool and
this<00:00:53.969> does<00:00:54.210> work<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.809> number<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
this does work with a number of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.380 
this does work with a number of
different<00:00:55.590> things<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> works

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
different things as you can see it works

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.410 
different things as you can see it works
with<00:00:57.539> torches<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.640> actually<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
with torches and this is actually the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.060 
with torches and this is actually the
same<00:01:00.629> brightness<00:01:00.870> as<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> lava<00:01:01.469> bucket<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
same brightness as the lava bucket and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
same brightness as the lava bucket and
they<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.520> different<00:01:02.640> brightnesses<00:01:03.239> so

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
they do have different brightnesses so

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
they do have different brightnesses so
see<00:01:04.199> I'll<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> my<00:01:04.739> lava<00:01:05.040> bucket<00:01:05.309> right<00:01:05.489> now

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
see I'll go to my lava bucket right now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.510 
see I'll go to my lava bucket right now
and<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:07.049> meet<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.320> settled<00:01:07.710> I'll<00:01:08.310> go

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and you really meet it settled I'll go

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.420 
and you really meet it settled I'll go
to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> lava<00:01:08.880> bucket<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> same

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
to the lava bucket it's got the same

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.820 
to the lava bucket it's got the same
range<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.640> light<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.420> next<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> move

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
range of light so next I'm going to move

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
range of light so next I'm going to move
on<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> redstone<00:01:14.939> torch<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.450> actually

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
on to the redstone torch which actually

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.590 
on to the redstone torch which actually
has<00:01:16.049> less<00:01:16.619> light<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.220> let's<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.509> right

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
has less light and let's go to all right

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.800 
has less light and let's go to all right
now<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:21.000> chained<00:01:21.299> let's<00:01:21.689> see

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
now so here we go it's chained let's see

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.320 
now so here we go it's chained let's see
the<00:01:21.900> difference<00:01:22.200> again<00:01:22.939> see<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.060> really

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the difference again see this really

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
the difference again see this really
does<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.750> light<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
does not light up much at all there is a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
does not light up much at all there is a
slight<00:01:26.369> delay<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.939> mean<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.810> perfect<00:01:28.259> but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
slight delay I mean it's not perfect but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.380 
slight delay I mean it's not perfect but
it's<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.890> well<00:01:29.040> done<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.000> same<00:01:30.180> as

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it's really well done and the same as

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.950 
it's really well done and the same as
goes<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.150> place<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> same<00:01:33.930> with

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
goes for this you can place it same with

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.319 
goes for this you can place it same with
all<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.380> stuff<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.799> mod<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.670> yeah

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
all the other stuff in this mod and yeah

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.359 
all the other stuff in this mod and yeah
not<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:36.689> sure<00:01:36.960> why<00:01:37.110> I'd<00:01:37.259> use<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.890> mean

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
not really sure why I'd use this I mean

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
not really sure why I'd use this I mean
maybe<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.820> ran<00:01:39.030> out<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> torches<00:01:39.630> but

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
maybe you ran out of torches but

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
maybe you ran out of torches but
obviously<00:01:40.290> redstone<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.130> lot<00:01:41.340> harder<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
obviously redstone is a lot harder to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
obviously redstone is a lot harder to
get<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.970> kool<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
get them kool so it's not really that

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
get them kool so it's not really that
useful<00:01:43.799> however<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.540> remaining<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
useful however if your remaining and you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.630 
useful however if your remaining and you
run<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.409> torches<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.130> come<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.310> on

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
run out of torches and you come up on

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
run out of torches and you come up on
redstone<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.479> has<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.869> same<00:01:49.170> brightness<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
redstone it has the same brightness as a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.649 
redstone it has the same brightness as a
redstone<00:01:49.979> torch<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.329> hold<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
redstone torch so you can hold the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.999 
redstone torch so you can hold the
redstone<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.710> walk<00:01:52.979> through

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
redstone and you can just walk through

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.700 
redstone and you can just walk through
here<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:54.869> does<00:01:55.110> help<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.530> lights

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
here and it really does help it lights

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.420 
here and it really does help it lights
up<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:55.950> place<00:01:56.430> quite<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> bit<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.960> yeah<00:01:58.710> so

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
work on it just kind of weird so I'm

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
work on it just kind of weird so I'm
gonna<00:02:04.200> hold<00:02:04.409> some<00:02:04.710> redstone<00:02:05.100> blocks<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.939> see

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
gonna hold some redstone blocks and see

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.479 
gonna hold some redstone blocks and see
the<00:02:06.210> redstone<00:02:06.600> block<00:02:06.810> nothing<00:02:07.710> happens<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> is

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the redstone block nothing happens it is

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.600 
the redstone block nothing happens it is
just<00:02:09.030> static<00:02:09.629> no<00:02:10.020> light<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.920> obviously<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
just static no light but obviously you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760 
just static no light but obviously you
can't<00:02:11.819> really<00:02:12.000> mine<00:02:12.360> redstone<00:02:12.930> blocks

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
can't really mine redstone blocks

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
can't really mine redstone blocks
so<00:02:14.220> yeah<00:02:14.780> something<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.900> thought<00:02:16.080> was

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
so yeah something that I thought was

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.010 
so yeah something that I thought was
weird<00:02:16.350> was<00:02:16.650> fire<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.370> can't<00:02:17.640> hold<00:02:17.880> fire<00:02:18.180> even

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
weird was fire you can't hold fire even

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.590 
weird was fire you can't hold fire even
though<00:02:19.200> honestly<00:02:20.160> would<00:02:20.520> never<00:02:20.670> hold<00:02:20.910> fire<00:02:21.270> in

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
though honestly would never hold fire in

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.430 
though honestly would never hold fire in
Minecraft<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.370> can't<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:23.790> fire<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
Minecraft because you can't get fire and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.740 
Minecraft because you can't get fire and
I<00:02:25.440> believe<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.520> go<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> too<00:02:27.150> many<00:02:27.240> items<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.660> get

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
I believe I go to too many items and get

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.000 
I believe I go to too many items and get
my<00:02:27.870> lava<00:02:28.190> lava<00:02:29.190> doesn't<00:02:29.430> work<00:02:29.670> either<00:02:29.990> so
