00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.210
 star named sun movie 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.260
 White snow 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:42.980
 all driving and cracked earth 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.010
 quilt patchwork on her city 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.210
 road loop 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.399
 in the city floating clouds closing 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.750
 sky light 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:00.630
 yellow smoke over the city 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.640
 a city years old 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.640
 lived under the light of a star 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
 but 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:20.010
 thousand years oh on 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:26.040
 war for no particular reason war was 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:30.610
 young anti-wrinkle medicine 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.840
 red blood in an hour already 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.300
 just land two flowers on it and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.259
 grass 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:46.530
 after three she is alive again and and warmed 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.530
 the rays of a star called the sun 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:08.910
 but only that it was always like that 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:14.590
 love more who lives by the laws of others 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:18.760
 about this, he does not remember the words give 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.580
 the word no he remembers nothing in the world 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:28.980
 and able to reach the stars 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:33.020
 except that it is a dream and fall singed 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.020
 star by name 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:52.330
 and immediately to the question of entry is put 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.330
 d d chord is played like this 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.260
 on the next blow up the little finger is put 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.579
 on the first string 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.670
 8 frets for the next blow down the little finger 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.080
 cleaning up the next blow up 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.560
 middle finger we remove 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.560
 and put back and so we play 7 times 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.650
 when we lost seven times 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.740
 pinky and play up-down-up-down 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.260
 and up 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.860
 let all your fingers and then we know that 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.860
 get us 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.130
 well, on the fourth blow up already 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.130
 This topic begins 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.860
 6 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.490
 how do you play the verse and I think not 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.650
 need to chew 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.390
 except there were questions like 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.790
 accents and what you see with us 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:07.310
 there is a fight here are some parts of this fight 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:18.109
 just a hand that holds a chord 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:19.970
 lets go it turns out she is 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.230
 let something off due to this 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.350
 right hand playing an equally well 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.870
 left 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.240
 focuses on who does not know yet 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.040
 such accents and these are deaf here but you 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.610
 not deaf 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.580
 First you will learn how to go to school 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.540
