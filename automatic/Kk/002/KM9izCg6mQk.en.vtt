 plunge back into his child's games this cat 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.879
 sand made hours empty attics near 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.340
 from home to get his hands on 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.989
 Nintendo 64 games for attention 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.910

 man who asked if he had old 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.160
 video games 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 the old man then entrusted him with a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.500
 gray card without label with 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.570
 the majorat inscription written in black at 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.090
 marker the old man tells him he 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.220
 could take it free 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.189
 had belonged to a child of his age 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.549
 today dead jesus sand the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.299
 thanked the world for leaving the old 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.420
 man says to him and good bye 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.710
 back to the sand campus launched the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.320
 cartridge arrived at the loading menu 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.610
 note that a part already existed 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.950
 named ben in uppercase 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.780
 in thinking back he was from elsewhere 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.390
 finally persuaded that the old man 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.700
 had said eh ben goodbye 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.770
 ja y sand years to the party by 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.960
 curiosity but not noticing anything 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.210
 of abnormal and the former player was 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.700
 close to the end of the game so he decided 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.100
 to create a new part named link 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.900
 by tradition but several events 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.870
 strange occurring during his party 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.270
 the intrigued blogs textures of 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.790
 flashes or the game that is saccade is 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.850
 in an unusual way is the thing the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.000
 more innocuous is that some NPCs 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.620
 call him not link but ben thinking a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.380
 bug mixing data from both 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.180
 saved and bored by this bug ja du 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.190
 sand decided to delete the backup 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.709
 called ben and continue his part 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.190
 but he quickly noticed that the NPCs 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.190
 do not quote the link name anymore 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.410
 empty space replace it and it's here 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.310
 that abnormal things taken yet 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.260
 more amplitude on its ja portion of the sand 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.730
 wanted to make the fourth day bug 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.040
 in order to get a game day 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.480
 additional since the concept of 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.760
 majora's mask and finish the game 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.400
 before 72 hours in game 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.140
 otherwise the moon crashes on earth ja 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.150
 sand carried out so the bug consists of 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.049
 speak to an astronomer I was looking in 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.880
 a telescope 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.130
 but instead of talking to the astronomer again 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.840
 ravard take a look 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.580
 the player was teleported to skull 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.709
 kid the game boss 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.780
 ja of the sand begin to receive a 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.240
 random replica of the game 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.690
 and the more they play and the game became 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.190
 hostile towards him they found themselves 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.580
 inexplicably stranded in the village 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.680
 main claude town completely emptied 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.510
 of these pnj and then he wanted 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.970
 try to drown because unable to 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.520
 find a way out a player statue 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.380
 appeared and began to follow him 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.230
 the statue come closer every time 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.970
 that ja sand him turn his back the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.180
 way of the rarer angels of doctor 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.180
 Who 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.950
 m 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.510
 [Music] 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.750
 the cartridge this myth has bugged more and 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.950
 more 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.280
 but I'm acting sand I'm a new 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:04:00.860
 projected against skull kid but this time 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:04:01.670
 his character caught fire returned to 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.670
 the loading screen 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.430
 I have sand noticed with horror that 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.350
 ben's backup had reappeared and 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.900
 that his backup named link be called 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.720
 now you turn 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.329
 in other words, the towers with sand 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.030
 scare the parties to try 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.350
 to understand what was happening but 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.330
 the game was becoming more and more 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.040
 unpredictable disoriented share the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.740
 videos on the internet 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.450
 for proof of his good faith and the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.280
 gameplay you see from the beginning 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.770
 of this video are also the 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.770
 original records of ja sand 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.970
 and broadcasting videos 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.800
 ja sand begins to have 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.770
 the very unpleasant impression of being 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.520
 observed by hardly even outside the 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.080
 game in the notes he shared he 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.320
 claims to have nightmare about the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.470
 statue he was following he is certain 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.270
 to have named the statue ben and the worst 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.090
 came when he nara how ben 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.120
 infects at 100 pc which opened alone a 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.160
 internet page named cleverbot a bot that 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.850
 speak alone and that ben used 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.890
 to speak to him according to him of more age to 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.419
 sand claims that ben censor everything 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.610
 what he was trying to send or 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.560
 communicate with the internet about 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.990
 case we want in his investigation 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.760
 ja of the sand managed to discover that ben 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.070
 was a little boy and found the 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.570
 died shortly before in the 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.030
 last notes of his logbook 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.190
 he claims he was able to finish his part 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.590
 guided by ben going to and cana 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.050
