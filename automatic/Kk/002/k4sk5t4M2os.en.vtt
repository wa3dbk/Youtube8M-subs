 hello guys starting in milan will play the three car bad contrib 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.559
 in a bonnet and the glamor boys 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.939
 I believe my curriculum nineteenth century the mother 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.939
 but not warlike it is only to leave the car with more aggressive visual 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.079
 first 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:20.980
 you come here 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.980
 saw this tool 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 and make an alert 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.810
 copy was 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.780
 he is not here 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.170
 and now she has to leave the city hall and for that she passes 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.560
 it was like this against the cast 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.560
 and passes seven reminds created by the controversy 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.150
 now 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.810
 you have to select 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.330
 this folder that will do it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 let's relate 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.850
 now you risk selection 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.270
 is a place where the texture would be more similar 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.770
 with this texture each pound 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.760
 so in this case to be here 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.680
 and here in the background 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.810
 and copy 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.729
 but when stuck it has to stay on top of blood 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.650
 to stay on top of the line 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.540
 have here 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.740
 stay there 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.090
 therefore against terror 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 It's the fault sheet you can see that was over the line. 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.300
 and now stands 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.430
 on the right place 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.860
 I want my 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.860
 counting that nokia appear also 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.019
 to fix this error that was left here 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.219
 use this fifth tool 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.119
 is the s key 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.989
 arthur 5% 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.809

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.809
 it's like being mixed with colors 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.329
 he notes further that it was everywhere 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 takahashi 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.729
