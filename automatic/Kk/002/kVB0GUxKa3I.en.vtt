00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.740 
once you're in your garage just find any
car<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.939> would<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.450> doesn't

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
car that you would like it doesn't

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.789 
car that you would like it doesn't
matter<00:01:15.869> which<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.290> pick<00:01:16.500> because

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
matter which one you pick because

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.140 
matter which one you pick because
nothing's<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> happen<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.909> car

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
nothing's going to happen to this car

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
nothing's going to happen to this car
but<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.200> outside<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.770> garage

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
but then just go outside of your garage

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.800 
but then just go outside of your garage
with<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> car<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.720> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
with this car and then get out of that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
with this car and then get out of that
car<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.439> right<00:01:22.680> back<00:01:22.860> into<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.340> garage

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
car and go right back into your garage

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.700 
car and go right back into your garage
so<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.240> glitch<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> basically<00:01:25.049> made<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
so this glitch is basically made up of a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.530 
so this glitch is basically made up of a
series<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> steps<00:01:26.490> involving<00:01:26.939> getting<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
series of steps involving getting in and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.270 
series of steps involving getting in and
out<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:27.810> garage<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.590> might<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> little

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
out of your garage so might get a little

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.530 
out of your garage so might get a little
confusing<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.939> make<00:01:30.119> sure<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> pay<00:01:30.509> attention

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
confusing so make sure you pay attention

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.090 
confusing so make sure you pay attention
to<00:01:31.170> make<00:01:31.320> sure<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.590> doing<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.920> correctly

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to make sure you're doing this correctly

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.219 
to make sure you're doing this correctly
but<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.659> once<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.110> into

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
but as you can see here once you go into

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 
but as you can see here once you go into
your<00:01:34.380> garage<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> final<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.939> will

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
your garage for that final time you will

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
your garage for that final time you will
see<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.329> my<00:01:36.509> Lamborghini<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.500> inside<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
see that my Lamborghini is now inside of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
see that my Lamborghini is now inside of
it<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.850> pretty<00:01:39.090> cool<00:01:39.270> glitch<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.689> this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it now it's pretty cool glitch and this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
it now it's pretty cool glitch and this
can<00:01:39.930> work<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.290> many<00:01:40.470> different<00:01:40.650> instances<00:01:41.369> for

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
can work in many different instances for

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.490 
can work in many different instances for
example<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> find<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.750> car<00:01:42.930> off<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> street

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
