00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
mine comes out a little bit easier

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.349 
mine comes out a little bit easier
because<00:01:33.780> I've<00:01:34.729> already<00:01:35.729> taken<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.149> apart

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
because I've already taken it apart

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.209 
because I've already taken it apart
today<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> figure<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.649> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:38.039> see

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
today to figure this out so you can see

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.660 
today to figure this out so you can see
that<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.429> have<00:01:38.459> the<00:01:38.729> LCD<00:01:39.359> module<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.350> lens

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
that you have the LCD module the lens

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.120 
that you have the LCD module the lens
now<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:42.030> people<00:01:42.149> say<00:01:42.569> that<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
now some people say that you can see the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.229 
now some people say that you can see the
ones<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.520> quite<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> movement

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:45.239 
ones that's quite a bit of a movement

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.059 
ones that's quite a bit of a movement
and<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.110> say<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.409> they've<00:01:46.560> had<00:01:46.739> rattle

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
and they say that they've had rattle

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:48.740 
and they say that they've had rattle
from<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.459> well<00:01:47.489> I<00:01:47.819> personally<00:01:48.569> haven't

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
from that as well I personally haven't

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.559 
from that as well I personally haven't
my<00:01:49.319> ones<00:01:50.009> clips<00:01:50.429> into<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.789> case<00:01:51.030> pretty<00:01:51.270> well

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
my ones clips into my case pretty well

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.100 
my ones clips into my case pretty well
so<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.319> keeps<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.099> from<00:01:53.189> vibrating<00:01:54.110> however

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so it keeps it from vibrating however

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.569 
so it keeps it from vibrating however
the<00:01:55.229> battery<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:55.799> LCD<00:01:56.090> did<00:01:57.090> give<00:01:57.629> it<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.579> my

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the battery on the LCD did give it so my

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.919 
the battery on the LCD did give it so my
fix<00:01:59.849> is<00:02:00.000> already<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:02.250> LCD

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
fix is already in there but the LCD

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.350 
fix is already in there but the LCD
module<00:02:03.929> actually<00:02:04.170> sits<00:02:05.039> below<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.549> metal

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
module actually sits below the metal

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240 
module actually sits below the metal

so<00:03:07.919> you<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.160> begin<00:03:08.870> reassembling<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.019> unit

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
so you can begin reassembling the unit

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.099 
so you can begin reassembling the unit
put<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.549> speaker<00:03:11.940> back<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> hole<00:03:12.900> where

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
put the speaker back on the hole where

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:25.820 
put the speaker back on the hole where
it<00:03:13.200> belongs

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.050 

in<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.070> other<00:03:26.220> screw<00:03:27.350> at<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:28.800> point<00:03:29.100> it's<00:03:29.940> a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
in the other screw at this point it's a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.990 
in the other screw at this point it's a
good<00:03:30.210> idea<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:31.040> try<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.220> move<00:03:32.310> your<00:03:32.490> LCD

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
good idea to try and move your LCD

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.860 
good idea to try and move your LCD
around<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.630> see<00:03:33.720> if<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.930> moves<00:03:35.120> because<00:03:36.120> if<00:03:36.720> a

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
around and see if it moves because if a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.690 
around and see if it moves because if a
is<00:03:36.900> still<00:03:37.530> moving<00:03:37.650> then<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.070> need<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.400> put

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
is still moving then you need to put

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.310 
is still moving then you need to put
something<00:03:38.940> take<00:03:39.180> her<00:03:39.270> back<00:03:39.420> there<00:03:39.450> or<00:03:39.870> find

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
something take her back there or find

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.030 
something take her back there or find
another<00:03:40.380> way<00:03:40.710> to<00:03:40.740> secure<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:42.350> so<00:03:43.350> once<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.950> get

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
another way to secure it so once you get

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.570 
another way to secure it so once you get
those<00:03:44.160> two<00:03:44.220> screws<00:03:44.610> back<00:03:44.880> in<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.480> can<00:03:46.400> pop<00:03:47.400> it

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
those two screws back in you can pop it

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.640 
those two screws back in you can pop it
back<00:03:47.610> into<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.090> case<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.630> can't<00:03:49.260> show<00:03:49.410> your

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
back into the case I can't show your

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.830 
back into the case I can't show your
lens<00:03:49.950> lines<00:03:50.730> up<00:03:52.250> then<00:03:54.410> you'll<00:03:55.410> want<00:03:55.710> to

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
lens lines up then you'll want to

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.540 
lens lines up then you'll want to
reinsert<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.320> battery<00:03:58.440> door<00:03:58.860> into<00:03:59.130> its<00:03:59.280> slot

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
reinsert the battery door into its slot

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.350 
reinsert the battery door into its slot
and<00:03:59.820> then<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:01.230> will<00:04:01.350> put<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.650> other<00:04:02.360> line

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
and then you will put the other line

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.699 
and then you will put the other line
this<00:04:03.600> other<00:04:04.590> plastic<00:04:05.160> bit<00:04:05.340> up<00:04:05.660> with<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:07.530> holes

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
this other plastic bit up with the holes

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.280 
this other plastic bit up with the holes
it<00:04:07.860> represents<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:09.330> you'll<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:10.020> it<00:04:10.140> has

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
it represents and you'll see it has

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.130 
it represents and you'll see it has
ridges<00:04:10.709> both<00:04:11.400> along<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.910> side<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.510> along

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
ridges both along that side and along

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.210 
ridges both along that side and along
this<00:04:13.410> side<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.090> pop<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:16.080> as<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.070> back

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
this side and so pop it in as the back

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:26.180 
this side and so pop it in as the back
of<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.430> camera<00:04:17.640> first<00:04:24.590> which<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.770> not<00:04:25.980> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
of the camera first which is not the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.150 
of the camera first which is not the
easiest<00:04:27.710> there<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.770> go

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
easiest there you go

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.210 
easiest there you go
once<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.940> get<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.120> pop<00:04:30.240> them<00:04:30.480> back<00:04:31.010> so<00:04:32.010> they

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
once you get it pop them back so they

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.480 
once you get it pop them back so they
pop<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.610> towards<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.090> front<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.750> then

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
pop it towards the front and then

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:43.750 
pop it towards the front and then
reinsert<00:04:35.490> your<00:04:35.730> two<00:04:35.880> screws

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.350 

and<00:04:44.240> then<00:04:44.570> again<00:04:44.810> at<00:04:45.170> this<00:04:45.380> point<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.950> would

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
and then again at this point I would
