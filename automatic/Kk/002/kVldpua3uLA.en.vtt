so I had to take some of it out and put
it<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.510> bowl<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.530> had<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.920> pound<00:03:38.190> a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
it in a bowl and then I had the pound a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.280 
it in a bowl and then I had the pound a
couple<00:03:38.550> of<00:03:38.640> batches<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.780> don't<00:03:39.930> really<00:03:40.080> need

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
couple of batches you don't really need

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.780 
couple of batches you don't really need
to<00:03:40.410> worry<00:03:40.650> about<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.130> order<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.640> the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
to worry about the order of the

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.610 
to worry about the order of the
ingredients<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.630> just<00:03:42.959> want<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.350> keep<00:03:43.470> on

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
ingredients you just want to keep on

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.740 
ingredients you just want to keep on
pounding<00:03:44.160> until<00:03:44.550> everything<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.209> ground<00:03:45.540> up

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
pounding until everything is ground up

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.650 
pounding until everything is ground up
and<00:03:46.050> everything<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:47.120> turning<00:03:48.120> into<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.390> nice

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
and everything is is turning into a nice

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.140 
and everything is is turning into a nice
buttery<00:03:49.170> paste<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.519> took<00:03:50.640> me<00:03:50.700> about<00:03:50.910> an

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
buttery paste so it took me about an

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.130 
buttery paste so it took me about an
hour<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.720> get<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.110> point<00:03:53.959> once<00:03:54.959> your

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
hour to get to this point once your

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.660 
hour to get to this point once your
paste<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.590> really<00:03:56.100> starting<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.489> come

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
paste is really starting to come

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.130 
paste is really starting to come
together<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.510> see<00:03:57.720> it's<00:03:57.870> turning

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
together and you can see it's turning

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.070 
together and you can see it's turning
smoother<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.459> getting<00:03:59.820> more<00:04:00.030> oily<00:04:00.480> you

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
smoother and and getting more oily you

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.229 
smoother and and getting more oily you
can<00:04:01.230> then<00:04:01.380> add<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.830> two<00:04:02.070> tablespoons<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.880> whole
