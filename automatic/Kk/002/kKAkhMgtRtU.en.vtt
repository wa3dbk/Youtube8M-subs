00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.709 
regatta wheels so put a little research
on<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.730> really<00:00:45.180> believe<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.600> that's

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
on that and I really believe that that's

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
on that and I really believe that that's
the<00:00:45.870> factory<00:00:46.350> wheel<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:47.340> had<00:00:47.520> plenty<00:00:47.700> of

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the factory wheel they had plenty of

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.639 
the factory wheel they had plenty of
contracts<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.660> swing<00:00:48.989> throughout<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> days

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
contracts with swing throughout the days

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.090 
contracts with swing throughout the days
and<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.539> think<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.840> Thea<00:00:52.079> regatta<00:00:52.649> actually

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and I think the Thea regatta actually

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.430 
and I think the Thea regatta actually
came<00:00:53.280> factory<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> front

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
came factory on this one how the front
