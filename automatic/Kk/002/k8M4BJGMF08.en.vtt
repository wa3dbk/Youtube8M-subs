brought<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.229> mm-hmm<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:15.290> honestly<00:01:16.290> feel<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
brought up mm-hmm I honestly feel the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260 
brought up mm-hmm I honestly feel the
exact<00:01:16.979> same<00:01:17.009> way<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> killer<00:01:17.790> frost<00:01:17.970> just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
exact same way the killer frost just

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
exact same way the killer frost just
because<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> achievement<00:01:18.900> lake<00:01:19.409> like

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
because of that achievement lake like

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.719 
because of that achievement lake like
the<00:01:20.970> reason<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.729> Raven

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the reason I think that is because Raven

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
the reason I think that is because Raven
was<00:01:23.939> confirmed<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.540> everybody<00:01:24.930> else<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
was confirmed and everybody else on that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.070 
was confirmed and everybody else on that
list<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.979> confirmed<00:01:26.369> except<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.880> her<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
list was confirmed except for her so it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.960 
list was confirmed except for her so it
she<00:01:29.040> might<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.220> well<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.610> confirmed

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
she might as well just be confirmed

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810 
she might as well just be confirmed
already<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.840> opinion<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.340> think

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
already in my opinion and then I think

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.539 
already in my opinion and then I think
Ares<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.420> he's<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.100> there's<00:01:35.100> three

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
Ares because he's got the there's three

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.730 
Ares because he's got the there's three
like<00:01:35.880> avatar<00:01:36.450> items<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> xbox<00:01:37.560> live
