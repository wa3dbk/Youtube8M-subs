 The most honest account review of all is 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.079
 right 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.899
 this 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.820
 92 hello everyone my name is super beatard 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.399
 it means that in the next seven minutes you 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.810
 learn the whole truth about nps heaven 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.810
 let's go . 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.860
 Immediately it should be noted that all games in 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.479
 racing genre made for degenerates i 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.710
 talked about this his past review on 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.140
 infos say now 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.869
 but what if you are degenerate and clearly 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.159
 realize it in this case with rivals 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.280
 nice stand out from the rest 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.869
 ratings repeat all made 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.240
 for idiots and all my words need 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.009
 perceive with this amendment even if 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.110
 I will praise this game in some places 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.409
 consider it a medal at the Paralympic Games where 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.460
 Russians will probably also collect all the gold 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.460
 the country rose from its knees after all 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.830
 92 and that is exactly the graffiti I have left 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.960
 no good impression count me 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.729
 Grapherdocher I adore the fire emblem on 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.500
 3ds and constantly playing some 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.860
 pixel turkey with original 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.259
 ideas 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.149
 new test no original idea no 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.649
 so you have to look at the chart 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.080
 count poly riders and talk about 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.880
 Texture pleasant impression left in 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.800
 I didn't play the first engine 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.560
 fourth battle but judging by the info about the engine 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.180
 by the way they are the same 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.940
 beautiful picture in games today 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.190
 day but not so good texture 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.580
 environments leave much to be desired grass 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.980
 looks like a disgusting world they are all the same 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.569
 don't bother the variety you'll have 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.120
 ride on some country roads 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.760
 and in the background there will almost always be mountains or 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.959
 the fields are still battles allowed 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.880
 add quite beautiful 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.250
 destructible as objects of the environment 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.780
 so and machines however machines damage 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.239
 cosmetic from what you remember 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.340
 a little bit worse her chariot ride 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.970
 but of course it will be except for those cases 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.780
 when you pierced the wheels and crashed the car 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.940
 completely 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.950
 the world is now open if you see 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.810
 wooden fence and the field behind it 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.600
 you may well break the fence 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.690
 move this field up if you watch 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.470
 This video and do not play in the race to them 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.209
 it is considered cool to move the field but 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.859
 well guys got the drill 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.780
 of course they are very cars 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.579
 overdo it with water droplets on the car 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.230
 but apparently so highlighted their work 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.540
 that they decided to stick this effect everywhere 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.010
 where needed where not needed after a few 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.010
 hours of play starts to annoy 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.710
 Yes 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.670
 92 right after the graphics I want to talk 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.870
 about the sound you are officially the most lousy 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.120
 disgusting causing blood from the ears 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.560
 according to the tracks this music they probably 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.880
 just finds on help and somewhere 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.860
 about shit rockers clubs 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.660
 St. Petersburg and Lebanese forces Tupac 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.210
 which game I had from her 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.220
 listen to the full bucket if you 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.260
 liked at least one song from any 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.660
 her games you know you are full 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.110
 Finished govnoyed still want to note 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.120
 Russian voice acting they chose as 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.890
 as if for the series in Russia 1 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.240
 and it makes an impression yet 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.240
 more cheap sti sound 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.890
 92 you will be surprised at the general games 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.710
 for some reason they began to add a plot 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.030
 for the first time I notice these flows 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.519
 developers add plot freaking 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.350
 who needs it from the other side 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.180
 the plot call it very difficult here 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.280
 just sometimes run videos between 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.030
 races where tell what racers 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.790
 okhuevshie 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.710
 and how the cops catch them they get away from them 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.020
 shorter is not worth it probably draws on 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:38.880
 his attention time is generally about the plot 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:41.580
 remembered 92 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.800
 well, not much has changed here since 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.950
 since the invention of the wheel you go 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.690
 sometimes you need to turn forward but if 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.570
 you are still degenerate then there is for you 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.430
 where to roam first set 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.800
 modes as cops did for daring 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.110
 street racers all sorts of harassment 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.150
 unlocked the power you race time and stuff 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.320
 crap me honestly laziness was even 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.360
 check all these modes 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.430
 I'm sure you will like them a lot 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.200
 for some reason they added perks from call of duty 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.660
 as if it could make the game better 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.640
 so now for example instead of the usual 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.220
 nitro you can also inject some 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.390
 turbo which time will give your car up 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.640
 maximum speed 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:22.770
 but only if you don't crash probably 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.410
 very fragile substance added garage with 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.330
 the ability to paint stickers and even 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.610
 improved vehicle performance 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.240
 it would seem a trifle but our stupid 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.070
 a racer is often not allowed to do that 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.169
 there is also a network game in the new office 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.480
 which I touched only once 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.640
 nothing interesting for me but if you 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.200
 love the speed of sitting at the computer 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.200
 you might like 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:55.220
 92 I missed about six games in the nfs series 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.440
 and no regrets I would put this 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.930
 the game is four out of ten no three with 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.330
 half out of ten nothing new or 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.979
 interesting but you can start 3 points for 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.610
 schedule and over the rain or done 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.460
 any 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.530
 but quite frank assessment 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.800
 for degenerates eight and a half of 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.410
 ten speed cars rapchik in the background 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.410
 noise from the motor is shorter everything as you like 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.410
 and with you was super gt 92 until new meetings
