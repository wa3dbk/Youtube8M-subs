the Hyundai Sonata nameplate has been

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.259 
the Hyundai Sonata nameplate has been

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
around for 30 years the cars that we

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.700 
around for 30 years the cars that we
drove<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> early<00:00:10.019> days<00:00:10.170> well<00:00:10.349> let's<00:00:10.500> just

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
drove in the early days well let's just

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.290 
drove in the early days well let's just
say<00:00:10.830> they<00:00:10.980> weren't<00:00:11.130> exactly<00:00:11.250> designed<00:00:11.759> Queens

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
say they weren't exactly designed Queens

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.509 
say they weren't exactly designed Queens
but<00:00:12.420> remember<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.200> was<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.440> family<00:00:13.830> segment

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
but remember this was the family segment

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.330 
but remember this was the family segment
back<00:00:15.000> then<00:00:15.299> design<00:00:15.929> wasn't<00:00:16.170> considered<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.920> big

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
back then design wasn't considered a big

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760 
back then design wasn't considered a big
selling<00:00:17.789> point<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.449> then<00:00:18.630> around<00:00:18.810> 2009

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
selling point but then around 2009

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.710 
selling point but then around 2009
Hyundai<00:00:20.400> kicked<00:00:20.699> things<00:00:20.880> up<00:00:21.180> with<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> new

the<00:00:24.810> car<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> big<00:00:25.560> success

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the car was a big success

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.339 
the car was a big success
well<00:00:26.939> now<00:00:27.090> you're<00:00:27.300> looking<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> seventh

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
well now you're looking at the seventh

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.009 
well now you're looking at the seventh
generation<00:00:28.640> Sonata<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:30.119> excuse<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
generation Sonata now excuse the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.690 
generation Sonata now excuse the
expression<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.619> really<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
expression but really I look at it and I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700 
expression but really I look at it and I
go<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.120> think<00:00:33.480> they've<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:33.960> dumbed<00:00:34.620> down

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
go I think they've really dumbed down

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.370 
go I think they've really dumbed down
the<00:00:35.130> design<00:00:35.520> quite<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.059> bit<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.110> doesn't

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the design quite a bit it just doesn't

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.069 
the design quite a bit it just doesn't
have<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> shapely<00:00:38.489> figure<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.360> are<00:00:39.960> they

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
have that shapely figure so are they

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.260 
have that shapely figure so are they
just<00:00:40.260> trying<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> save<00:00:40.800> money<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.850> excuse

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
just trying to save money or and excuse

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.069 
just trying to save money or and excuse
the<00:00:42.420> pun<00:00:42.600> maybe<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:43.950> by<00:00:44.129> design<00:00:48.079> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the pun maybe this is all by design the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.450 
the pun maybe this is all by design the
last<00:00:49.350> generation<00:00:49.860> vehicle<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.280> very

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
last generation vehicle was very

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
last generation vehicle was very
successful<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.270> people<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> look<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.020> our

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
successful and got people to look at our

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.630 
successful and got people to look at our
vehicle<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.309> liked<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
vehicle and they really liked the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.160 
vehicle and they really liked the
styling<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.510> obviously<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:55.020> they

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
styling of it and obviously when they

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
styling of it and obviously when they
drove<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.980> drove<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> period<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
drove it and drove it for a period of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.760 
drove it and drove it for a period of
time<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.719> loved<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> car<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
time they really loved the car but the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
time they really loved the car but the
new<00:00:58.920> design<00:00:59.670> language<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> more<00:01:00.420> mature

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
new design language it's a more mature

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
new design language it's a more mature
design<00:01:01.350> language<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.129> last<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.579> lot

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
design language was gonna last a lot

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.830 
design language was gonna last a lot
longer<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> much<00:01:03.660> more

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
longer we think it's a much more

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
longer we think it's a much more
handsome<00:01:04.110> design<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.250> actually<00:01:05.549> much

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
handsome design and it's actually much

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.120 
handsome design and it's actually much
more<00:01:05.850> classic<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.510> its<00:01:06.540> approach

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
more classic in its approach

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.160 
more classic in its approach
well<00:01:08.729> since<00:01:08.970> Hyundai<00:01:09.270> designers<00:01:09.810> didn't<00:01:10.080> have

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
well since Hyundai designers didn't have

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
well since Hyundai designers didn't have
to<00:01:10.320> spend<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.799> much<00:01:10.920> time<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.430> exterior

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to spend so much time in the exterior

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.490 
to spend so much time in the exterior
they<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> lot<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.869> effort<00:01:13.140> into<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
they put a lot of effort into the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
they put a lot of effort into the
interior<00:01:14.009> especially<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> console<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
interior especially the console and the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
interior especially the console and the
instrument<00:01:16.110> cluster<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.770> happy<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> report

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
instrument cluster I'm happy to report

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
instrument cluster I'm happy to report
none<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:17.970> touchy-feely<00:01:18.330> stuff<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.470> all

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
none of that touchy-feely stuff it's all

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
none of that touchy-feely stuff it's all
mechanical<00:01:20.369> knobs<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.240> switches<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
mechanical knobs and switches and I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020 
mechanical knobs and switches and I
think<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> best<00:01:23.100> looking<00:01:23.250> console<00:01:23.850> in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
think it's the best looking console in

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
think it's the best looking console in
this<00:01:24.509> segment<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.110> speaking<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:25.770> doing

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
this segment and speaking of doing

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.120 
this segment and speaking of doing
things<00:01:26.399> well<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:27.270> 2014<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.619> people<00:01:28.890> still

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
things well it's 2014 but people still

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
things well it's 2014 but people still

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
ask me what about quality when it comes

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
model one of the things that they

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.430 
model one of the things that they
realize<00:02:05.069> that<00:02:05.100> they've<00:02:05.429> got<00:02:05.700> an<00:02:05.970> icon<00:02:06.720> with

this car looking like one of their other
cars<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:12.030> think<00:02:12.239> they're<00:02:12.360> trying<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.600> develop<00:02:13.019> a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
cars I think they're trying to develop a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.949 
cars I think they're trying to develop a
bit<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.760> corporate<00:02:14.760> design<00:02:14.910> language

engine<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.870> overall<00:02:27.260> power<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.799> actually

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
engine the overall power is actually

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.520 
engine the overall power is actually
dropped<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.420> little<00:02:29.629> bit<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.170> torque

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
dropped a little bit but the torque

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.679 
dropped a little bit but the torque
numbers<00:02:30.769> are<00:02:31.099> are<00:02:31.459> virtually<00:02:31.939> the<00:02:31.969> same<00:02:32.120> and

our fuel economy is a lot better for
those<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.900> want<00:02:42.019> a<00:02:42.139> little<00:02:42.379> more<00:02:42.530> oomph<00:02:42.739> and

Hyundai<00:03:21.829> have<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> look<00:03:22.250> at<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:22.730> if<00:03:22.879> you're

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
Hyundai have a look at it and if you're

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.849 
Hyundai have a look at it and if you're
taking<00:03:23.180> one<00:03:23.480> for<00:03:23.659> a<00:03:23.719> test<00:03:23.930> drive<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.469> know

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
taking one for a test drive you know

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.729 
taking one for a test drive you know
what<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.129> look<00:03:25.159> for<00:03:26.229> probably<00:03:27.229> as<00:03:27.349> big<00:03:27.560> as

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
what to look for probably as big as

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.559 
what to look for probably as big as
demerit<00:03:28.250> point<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:29.120> it's<00:03:29.329> not<00:03:29.540> a

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
demerit point is that it's not a

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.649 
demerit point is that it's not a
crossover<00:03:30.169> the<00:03:30.620> fact<00:03:30.889> that<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.430> sedan<00:03:31.849> it

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
crossover the fact that it's a sedan it

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.089 
crossover the fact that it's a sedan it
doesn't<00:03:33.019> get<00:03:33.139> a<00:03:33.169> lot<00:03:33.409> of<00:03:33.530> people<00:03:33.799> interested

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
doesn't get a lot of people interested

doesn't get a lot of people interested
in<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.459> first<00:03:34.609> place<00:03:34.909> but<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.479> reality<00:03:35.989> is

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
in the first place but the reality is

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.559 
in the first place but the reality is
with<00:03:36.889> a<00:03:36.949> backseat<00:03:37.489> room<00:03:37.819> and<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.090> rear<00:03:38.269> cargo

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
with a backseat room and a rear cargo

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.289 
with a backseat room and a rear cargo
space<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.500> way<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.859> drives<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.669> the<00:03:41.120> better

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
space the way it drives and the better

space the way it drives and the better
fuel<00:03:41.569> economy<00:03:41.689> I<00:03:42.349> think<00:03:42.949> people<00:03:43.400> need<00:03:43.609> to

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
fuel economy I think people need to

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.369 
fuel economy I think people need to
start<00:03:44.090> looking<00:03:44.329> at<00:03:44.569> these<00:03:44.780> type<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.019> cars

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
start looking at these type of cars

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.970 
start looking at these type of cars
instead<00:03:45.949> of<00:03:46.189> gas<00:03:46.519> guzzling<00:03:46.870> crossovers
