the<00:00:00.539> next<00:00:00.840> setup<00:00:01.050> that<00:00:01.350> GP<00:00:01.650> uses<00:00:02.250> around

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
the next setup that GP uses around

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
the next setup that GP uses around
1952-53<00:00:04.770> in<00:00:05.339> there<00:00:05.549> they<00:00:06.509> came<00:00:07.410> up<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
1952-53 in there they came up with the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.350 
1952-53 in there they came up with the
CJ<00:00:09.179> three<00:00:09.510> bees<00:00:09.809> they<00:00:10.349> started<00:00:10.769> putting<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.360> 129

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
CJ three bees they started putting a 129

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.379 
CJ three bees they started putting a 129
to<00:00:12.660> 3<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> flywheel<00:00:13.910> and<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.240> can

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
to 3 here on the flywheel and you can

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.090 
to 3 here on the flywheel and you can
notice<00:00:15.540> these<00:00:15.809> pretty<00:00:16.170> well<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.650> by<00:00:16.800> looking

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
notice these pretty well just by looking

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.730 
notice these pretty well just by looking
at<00:00:17.250> them<00:00:17.369> because<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:18.750> width<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> ring

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
at them because the width of the ring

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.920 
at them because the width of the ring
gear<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.160> almost<00:00:20.580> twice<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.150> wide<00:00:21.359> as<00:00:21.660> what's

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
gear is almost twice as wide as what's

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.939 
gear is almost twice as wide as what's
on<00:00:22.050> A<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.470> A<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.310> 3a<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.230> they<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.320> 129

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
on A to A or or 3a and they have 129

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.450 
on A to A or or 3a and they have 129
toothed<00:00:26.599> ring<00:00:27.599> gear<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:28.019> them<00:00:28.170> these<00:00:29.160> Bell

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
toothed ring gear on them these Bell

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.700 
toothed ring gear on them these Bell
housings<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.449> he<00:00:30.539> went<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.019> we're

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
housings when he went to that we're

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.670 
housings when he went to that we're
different<00:00:32.099> because<00:00:33.020> they<00:00:34.020> needed<00:00:34.230> more<00:00:34.350> room

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
different because they needed more room

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.950 
different because they needed more room
to<00:00:34.710> put<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> bigger<00:00:35.250> ring<00:00:35.520> gear<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.840> he

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
to put a bigger ring gear in it so he

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.209 
to put a bigger ring gear in it so he
was<00:00:37.050> Ceylonese<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.790> bell<00:00:39.030> housing<00:00:40.219> went

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
was Ceylonese that the bell housing went

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.860 
was Ceylonese that the bell housing went
back<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.850> straighter<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.450> before<00:00:42.780> an

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
back a little straighter here before an

back a little straighter here before an
angled<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.059> bigger<00:00:45.270> ring

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
angled back so that the the bigger ring

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.720 
angled back so that the the bigger ring
gear<00:00:46.140> would<00:00:46.289> fit<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:46.620> Bell<00:00:46.890> House<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
gear would fit into Bell House for the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.470 
gear would fit into Bell House for the
most<00:00:47.910> part<00:00:48.239> these<00:00:48.420> Bell<00:00:48.719> housings<00:00:49.879> they<00:00:50.879> got

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
most part these Bell housings they got

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
most part these Bell housings they got
away<00:00:51.600> from<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.379> starters<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> used<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
away from the starters that used the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.540 
away from the starters that used the
bell<00:00:53.730> housing<00:00:53.910> bushing<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.920> now<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.980> starter

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
bell housing bushing and now the starter

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270 
bell housing bushing and now the starter
so<00:00:56.730> now<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.120> had<00:00:57.449> nose<00:00:57.780> cones<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so now on had nose cones on them and the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
so now on had nose cones on them and the
pushing<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.820> already<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> nose<00:01:00.719> cone<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
pushing was already in the nose cone and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.420 
pushing was already in the nose cone and
not<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> bell<00:01:01.949> housing

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
not in the bell housing

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.050 
not in the bell housing
so<00:01:03.359> these<00:01:04.080> Bell<00:01:04.439> housings<00:01:04.739> usually<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> one

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
so these Bell housings usually the one

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.690 
so these Bell housings usually the one
hole<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.510> threaded<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> top<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:08.460> put

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
hole was threaded at the top that put

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390 
hole was threaded at the top that put
the<00:01:08.820> starter<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.170> other<00:01:10.320> hole<00:01:10.619> was

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the starter on and the other hole was

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.750 
the starter on and the other hole was
drilled<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:11.939> through<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.390> bell<00:01:12.570> housing

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
drilled right through the bell housing

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
drilled right through the bell housing
to<00:01:14.760> mount<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> store<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.479> had<00:01:15.659> bigger<00:01:15.869> bolts

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to mount the store they had bigger bolts

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.760 
to mount the store they had bigger bolts
in<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.850> starters<00:01:18.299> were<00:01:18.509> heavier<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
in because the starters were heavier and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
in because the starters were heavier and
they're<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> little<00:01:21.000> probably<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> might<00:01:21.780> say

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
they're a little probably you might say

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
they're a little probably you might say
there<00:01:22.170> were<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.439> heavier-duty<00:01:22.830> than<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
there were more heavier-duty than the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
there were more heavier-duty than the
earlier<00:01:23.759> ones<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:27.180> these<00:01:27.420> later<00:01:28.140> bell

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
earlier ones and on these later bell

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.080 
earlier ones and on these later bell
housing<00:01:28.650> was<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.400> hole<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> back

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
housing was just a hole in the back

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.740 
housing was just a hole in the back
light<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.990> two<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.729> then<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
where all the bolts went there were

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.929 
where all the bolts went there were
bosses<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:40.159> it<00:01:41.159> wasn't<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
bosses in so that it wasn't just the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.389 
bosses in so that it wasn't just the
thin<00:01:42.210> ring<00:01:42.509> around<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.960> end<00:01:43.079> anymore<00:01:43.350> -<00:01:43.649> it

thin ring around the end anymore - it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.399 
thin ring around the end anymore - it
was<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.670> heavier<00:01:45.060> duty<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> way<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> the

was more heavier duty this way and the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
eight wasn't on the top then there was

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.930 
eight wasn't on the top then there was
just<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.150> stud<00:02:16.390> on<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.660> top<00:02:17.460> like<00:02:18.460> on<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.700> seat

a 3b they used the floor button again
like<00:02:21.730> they<00:02:21.850> did<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> 2a<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:23.410> there

like they did on the 2a so then there
was<00:02:23.710> no<00:02:23.860> solenoid<00:02:24.460> on<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.790> was<00:02:25.300> just<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.690> stud

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
was no solenoid on it was just the stud

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.500 
was no solenoid on it was just the stud
and<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.260> battery<00:02:26.650> wire<00:02:26.830> went<00:02:27.040> right<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.510> onto

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
and the battery wire went right on onto

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.200 
and the battery wire went right on onto
the<00:02:28.630> starter<00:02:29.050> off<00:02:29.200> with<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.470> foot<00:02:30.000> button<00:02:31.000> there

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
the starter off with a foot button there

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.370 
the starter off with a foot button there
and<00:02:35.430> early<00:02:36.430> cj5<00:02:37.060> used<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.660> same<00:02:37.930> thing<00:02:38.200> with

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
and early cj5 used the same thing with

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.890 
and early cj5 used the same thing with
that<00:02:38.560> foot<00:02:38.920> button<00:02:39.280> electrical<00:02:40.270> switch<00:02:40.510> start

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that foot button electrical switch start

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.660 
that foot button electrical switch start
and<00:02:41.140> then<00:02:41.590> they<00:02:41.710> started<00:02:42.040> coming<00:02:42.340> out<00:02:42.430> with<00:02:42.490> a

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
with six volt up into the 60s it could

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.610 
with six volt up into the 60s it could
still<00:04:51.820> get<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.150> with<00:04:52.270> six<00:04:52.480> volts<00:04:52.870> as<00:04:53.440> the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
still get it with six volts as the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.130 
still get it with six volts as the
farmers<00:04:54.100> like<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.460> have<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.730> six<00:04:54.970> volt<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.360> all

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
farmers like to have the six volt of all

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.840 
farmers like to have the six volt of all
their<00:04:56.380> tractors<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:56.950> stuff<00:04:57.160> for<00:04:57.310> six<00:04:57.550> volts

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
their tractors and stuff for six volts

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.720 
their tractors and stuff for six volts
it<00:04:57.940> kept<00:04:58.120> them<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.330> same<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:59.050> then<00:04:59.830> later<00:05:00.640> on

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
it kept them the same and then later on

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:11.500 
it kept them the same and then later on
in<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.090> 60s<00:05:01.420> then<00:05:01.600> they<00:05:01.720> just<00:05:01.900> did<00:05:02.110> away<00:05:02.320> with
