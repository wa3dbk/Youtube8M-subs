00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.490
 we are here of pouring minecraft and good 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.629
 we already did this and we're going for this 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.429
 custom heads that would be 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.960
 basically very easy in fact it's 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.070
 too easy 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.070
 It is what it is 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.110
 let me see what this is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.330
 well i will do 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.430
 that's also going to be another good one 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.050
 I show you once in the title 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.000
 I add that to not make a video more 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.790
 very well this custom classes 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.530
 what is this is the gif command 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.930
 397 what is the item of the head this what 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.670
 they leave everything as is, the only thing 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.300
 that changes the only thing that changes here 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.070
 is this name name that for 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.710
 use this command have to have 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.770
 Internet connection obviously because it's going 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.540
 to use someone's skin 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.540
 in fact the link I have here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.129
 I do not know what they could get to see very well 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.110
 this would be a link I left in the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.050
 description where you are going to look 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.850
 the skin that you want for example 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.330
 I do not know a name here that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330
 is called 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.610
 tnt 002 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.429
 I was yesterday looking up page 25 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.020
 skins of some block and these are the 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.240
 only three that I found plus one of 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.130
 grass but I do not know why they did not work and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.500
 I liked those heads so I used them 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.810
 very well and he gives it to me and it looks like a head 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.390
 normal but it's really a block quoted 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.659
 of tnt because he's using the skin of the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.630
 head of this person to tnt 002 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.329
 this is the head of your corner 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.710
 and because these are heads are blocks 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.560
 little ones and the truth is that they look 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.840
 great who does not want mini you get and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.170
 things like that from the command 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.030
 same is to be in the description all 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.390
 it's more here the only thing that changes is the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.390
 first name 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.290
 in anyone who has skin and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.940
 good 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.630
 and here 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.910
 here to put the head of an owl 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.610
 as I explained back in your hand 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.950
 it's the same more or less but here it is 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.950
 so this I leave it in the description 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.709
 very nice very nice 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.180
 this command is in the description as 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.879
 I said this is if hands legs pants 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.239
 chest and here where the head goes the most 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.299
 sad sixth damaged and the tag school 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.849
 owner and here the name but you have to go 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.390
 in quotes if they remove the quotes and 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.390
 they do not work 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.659
 very well very well very well tnt 002 already 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.209
 they put their heads and all this and I believe them 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.769
 in my party long ago the spoilers 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.270
 because I did not remember what it was for 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.600
 this 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.840
 very well and that's how the command is 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.160
 in the instruction everything very nice and already 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.960
 You know this here is how to change the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.520

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.430

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.290

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.090

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.220

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.290
 interesting all these as is the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.390
