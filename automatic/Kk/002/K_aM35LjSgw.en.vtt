00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.130
 ar sm of session I show you the 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.850
 gibson hummingbird in harry's table 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.850
 sanders 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.070
 I have the hummingbird of gibson the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.520
 so-called also known under and the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.600
 squash or the first came in 1960 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.370
 out and yes, there have been few since then 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.750
 Changes to the 70s was so 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.250
 series that was not so popular 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.250
 They have been trying again since the 80s 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.780
 to come back and what I have here in the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.780
 Hand holding is a standard model of 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.570
 the hummingbird and those of spex very 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.700
 is based on the original from the outside 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.860
 60s with someone tell me entertaining 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.890
 days over it and I explain by the way 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.210
 still a few details and snacks 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.650
 what wood for example made that 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.560
 We start here with the blanket that is 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.300
 a vision blanket in the fall 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.590
 we have a rosewood standing there 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.870
 come to the first highlight already 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 Namely that pickert something in the 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.350
 fall as this kite wing is something 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.820
 actually as the hallmark of 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.920
 guitar next to the tree already that 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.560
 Of course, with the hummingbird on it 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.070
 and cast butterfly up here 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.989
 drive on it and we also see the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.410
 guitar has a triple beining here 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:25.610
 on the side is the color of the ceiling 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.410
 in herten sunburst kept loud gibson 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.220
 so that's nothing original jerry buss 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.650
 as well as the first series you spend 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.910
 but one in the other color 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.250
 bit balanced as it would be 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.260
 already an older guitar like that 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.510
 come to what fingerboard also a 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.650
 binding was here in the side a white 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.340
 then we have palisander in there and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.550
 nice deposits 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.600
 up here is the hotplate gibson 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.070
 lettering on it we can do the same 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.700
 on the strings to have depth which 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.040
 mahogany 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.830
 here it is binding even on here 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.300
 on the back what a nice detail 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.830
 is here on the back of the binding 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.800
 is still twice and not again 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.950
 just like the ground and 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.790
 that appeal mahogany and he thought it 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.280
 made of mahogany one piece what 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.740
 gibson normal and up here we have 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.170
 the mechanics of the body in the case 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:29.360
 chrome colors leave the number 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.930
 okay again, back to the construction of the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.660
 guitar 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.270
 as already mentioned , this is almost a 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.090
 based on the 60s of this pickart 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.400
 hartford schneider was here at that time 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.700
 also designed and will be 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.690
 taken over and used at the guitar 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.700
 there is the successor model is the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.410
 so-called village that is that the luxury 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.440
 Variation that has maple city mahagonny 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.940
 But at the time, that's the best thing 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.040
 blockbuster had been like this one 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:06.770
 And yes, the guitar is really nice 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.910
 has a beautiful sound and me 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.290
 Try a little something now 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.930
 to bring it over to me again 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.640
 over the amplifier again play over 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.080
 the pick-up that intel macs pickup in 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.080
 that we are also the same times on 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.940
 yes, if we do it without it 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.940
 amplifier listen for a moment 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.380
 you just realize that I'm real 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.270
 beautiful rounded better and has 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.460
 heights and yes that makes them something 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.720
 special so do not compare in 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.880
 the third kind in the direction of what 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.320
 Many also did exist back then 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.090
 now also meant that it is no 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.880
 copy should be but their art and 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.000
 as how to understand what they behind 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.889
 this guitar and what is still quite a lot 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.780
 interesting is the to the specs the 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.880
 mensur by the guitarist also shorter than 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.759
 he for example from a hd 28 we 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.120
 here have six 128 mm distance of the 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.650
 saddle is 44 mm wide and yes you can 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.440
 here with 20 volumes on the fingerboard 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:27.330
 until the 14th bund from here is the neck 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.680
 then put on the guitar yes, too 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.780
 in our shop to play to 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.490
 listen to 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.800
 you can come over and see her 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.150
 touch and play through times and if 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.150
 you have questions we ask ourselves
