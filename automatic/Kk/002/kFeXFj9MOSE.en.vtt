 fifth string 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.710
 third fret 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 after this rope third pleasure 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.720

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.719
 ah 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.290
 then let's play the minor 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 do not 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.340
 and we go to the next rhythm 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.000
 one down two up down 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.000
 good 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.580
 and well let's do it twice 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.950
 we change afa 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.010
 twice we change jump we do it 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.470
 here three times and last we give a 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.610
 four-way down four 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.610
 times down ok 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.760
 and we change our choir 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.760
 and we do the same rhythm 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.890
 the biggest and only ok 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.030
 two 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.360
 Y 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.460
 and 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.390
 and we went to our choir 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.390
 greater 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.019
 from lowest to highest 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.980
 and we do it here in rhythm just once 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.819
 for each chord to the graph that 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.819
 would be twice 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.700
 The same is about mom 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.980
 and sing but that sounds like I think 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.310
 it is the least 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.380
 for greater gone greater 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.209
 and we do the same rhythm only 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.209
 once for each cut 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.239
 Y 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.290
 after 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.560
 the two strings of 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.639
 up that would be the sixth and the half 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.639
 because chords 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.759
 Y
