00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:09.400
 ok then try review of the prime 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:11.050
 and find the trees 3 with 3 minutes of 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.810
 this beautiful Saturday in which been 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.700
 abandoned by my daughter if it's true I 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.940
 He left Isabel and went with her friends 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.640
 to the pool and have fun and have lunch 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.500
 and all those things told us and invited me but 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.789
 I really had so many things to do 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.980
 end of the year I'm with the theme 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.830
 degree exams all that so I said 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.030
 no better stay here let's talk about the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.499
 presentation comes in a plastic pot 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.210
 round so it does not bring this view 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.530
 protection in between or anything to 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.199
 producer seems to have a consistency 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.260
 dense enough to not 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.809
 tip over the top or spill 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.020
 contains 14 grams is made in poland 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.420
 and says it's a basis for 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.820
 that my skin instantly 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.000
 feel with the smallest pores more 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.880
 soft 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.510
 and softer looking says he does 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.580
 that lines and pores turn 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.229
 invisible ok then that's the promise 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.979
 of katrice let's see what happens with 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.570
 this prime and fine is very useful finer no 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.979
 says the amount you want to duplicate like this 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.869
 that or instinctively already apply it as 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.960
 I would apply a moisturizer maybe a 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.690
 little less and I think it should also be 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.530
 selective with the areas in which 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.880
 I usually notice that my skin has 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.800
 some lines or pores more dilated than me 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.280
 I would like to make you go unnoticed 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.369
 and that's going to be the nose area 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 Under my eyes I'm already with the subject 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.039
 of those lines of expression and everything 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.660
 that and on this side home you 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.740
 you can see your name recently 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.930
 allergic to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 you honor and I also have some brands like that 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.009
 that I'm going to take advantage of placing it there 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.320
 see what happens because I know that here is that 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.810
 suffer from acne or have imperfections 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.090
 on the skin they may be interested in 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.830
 function of this product so 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.500
 specific to cover those 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.830
 imperfections 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.950
 as for the application you feel a 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.430
 sort of like butter runs down the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.800
 face is not a cream is not a gel is not 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.960
 much denser than that though 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.480
 It runs very smooth and gives me the feeling of 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.300
 that this has a lot of silicone 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.459
 because it runs super soft on the skin 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.230
 is not at all a sensation bothers me nor 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.490
 It's nice but I feel like it 's 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.330
 covering my face a lot 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:50.490
 ok I will use on this occasion to 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.490
 maybelline firm base 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.210
 and the base actually ran extremely 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.210
 good and fast without any problem if 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.090
 I notice that it slides faster and 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.530
 more gently let it settle 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.390
 the product on my skin and that my skin 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.850
 absolve about two minutes 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.510
 two and a half minutes and really not all 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:15.290
 the difference of how the base runs with 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.480
 greater ease in the face is much 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.940
 more even and if I can notice 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.860
 immediately that the first 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.080
 it effectively gets into my pores and the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.600
 stuffed and that gives me the appearance a 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.720
 much much more smooth skin much more 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.630
 juvenile I really loved the effect 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.160
 initial of the first but let's see how 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.680
 it works throughout the day so I go 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.840
 to finish my makeup surely 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.640
 I'll record a tutorial and go back in a couple 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.880
 of more hours to continue this test 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.880
 radiation 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.519
 ok update then of the test 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.840
 first edition of cots are the 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.599
 1718 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.730
 have already gone then 2 hours 20 and I should 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.430
 tell them that I'm pretty pretty 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.769
 agreeable and even amazed at the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.040
 performance of this prime and fine of 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:18.400
 katrice if you can give an account I'm going 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.000
 to show effectively covers very very 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.580
 well the pores and also conceals very 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.130
 well the lines of expression but also 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.470
 has kept my base fixed and in many 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.590
 better conditions for quite 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.690
 time and two hours and something and with a 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.900
 hot but brutal that makes in santiago 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.120
 this Saturday and I'm using a base 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.410
 very common that is the fit me and in addition to 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.930
 a base that many have told me 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.330
 they have conflicts with the subject that is 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.669
 It lasts little, it really shines 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.590
 I find that it 's pretty good for the 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.940
 time that has happened I see them then in 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.050
 one more time for one last 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.690
 upgrade 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.969
 ok ladies last update of 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.909
 this review test is 6 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:03.759
 four have already passed four hours since 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:07.059
 that we apply the test looks katrice 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:09.039
 which is called prime and fun I mean 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:11.169
 that I am extremely satisfied with the 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.599
 result I consider that my face remained 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:19.179
 very uniform compared to when 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:22.709
 used the base tim and without using this this 

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:26.259
 first I loved the consistency not 

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:28.419
 color gives no feeling of heaviness 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.669
 on the contrary it slides with much 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.360
 softness does not really feel like it's going 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.819
 covering does not feel heavy does not give me 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.519
 a feeling of being with something like 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.399
 mask over and makes me perspire more 

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:44.769
 so it's very nice in terms of 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:47.409
 brightness control I would not say it has 

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:51.009
 a great ability to control brightness 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.360
 I think that gives it the base itself 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.919
 that you use with 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.869
 Subsequent is not the objective of this 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.929
 product decrease the brightness but that 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:04.149
 match the skin to prepare it in order 

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:05.939
 to receive the base that has it well 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.489
 clear about the relationship 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:11.319
 price-quality I'm more than happy 

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:13.719
 with this castriz product that I should 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.759
 say that in truth the more the 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:17.210
 I use the more products I try 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.610
 castriz 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.490
 I am surprised by the encounters but great 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.280
 is the consistency as I told them is 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.950
 very very very creamy 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.930
 a little more than a moisturizer one 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.060
 feeling like those cocoa butter 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.419
 when they are 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.880
 in the sun as much heat melts with 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.520
 ease runs very fast on the skin is 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.530
 a very nice feeling indeed 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.980
 a lot way and meets the objectives 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:49.700
 of that yes it does I would like to compare it 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:52.760
 with a similar product quite similar 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.669
 not in four formats if you do not want to 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.950
 it works and it's the test yielding to touré 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.900
 here comes in a presentation of 20 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.510
 grams remember that the actress comes in 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.389
 a presentation of 14 however the one of 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.830
 natura is worth more than twice that of here 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.480
 3 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:13.540
 and it comes in this presentation 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.290
 and it gives us such a moisturizing feeling and 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.150
 not in pairs so much the tone so if I 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.130
 I had to choose between nature 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.290
 which is the most similar thing that I have to this 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.120
 product of castriz between nature and 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.500
 of patrician I stay but to eyes 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.210
 closed with the one of castriz and in relation 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.940
 price-quality what it does effectively 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.340
 In the face, the basis of 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.660
 so pretty good, that was 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.940
 from my own review 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.580
 I hope again that you have been 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.860
 utility makes me very happy 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.290
 I like when I have good results with 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.840
 these tests review and I feel that no 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:53.020
 I lost my money I leave you all down 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.480
 details the quantities amounts product 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.310
 that is coming and all that and anyway 

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.320
 I hope to also make an entry to my 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:03.300
 blog a big kiss and I see them in a 

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.300
 new test bye review
