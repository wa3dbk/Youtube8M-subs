00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
so actually I'm kind of used to the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.990 
so actually I'm kind of used to the
screen<00:02:29.570> looking<00:02:29.900> more<00:02:30.080> like<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.640> just

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
screen looking more like this but I just

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.580 
screen looking more like this but I just
was<00:02:32.240> lucky<00:02:32.600> enough<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.960> don't<00:02:33.110> know<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.410> got

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
was lucky enough I don't know if I got

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.230 
was lucky enough I don't know if I got
frustrated<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.220> wouldn't<00:02:34.700> play<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.060> it's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
frustrated I wouldn't play it it's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.990 
frustrated I wouldn't play it it's
simple<00:02:35.900> enough<00:02:35.960> but<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.890> company<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.730> I

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
simple enough but the company that I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.730 
simple enough but the company that I
would<00:02:38.300> have<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> lot<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.080> time<00:02:39.290> would<00:02:39.530> make

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
would have a lot of the time would make

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.670 
would have a lot of the time would make
a<00:02:39.770> huge<00:02:40.280> difference<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.930> was<00:02:42.050> good<00:02:42.230> we

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
a huge difference so that was good we

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.190 
a huge difference so that was good we
just<00:02:43.250> do<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> lot<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.090> shenanigans<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.959> things

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
just do a lot of shenanigans and things

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.990 
just do a lot of shenanigans and things
like<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.830> swear<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.430> god<00:02:46.760> I'll

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
like that I swear to god I'll

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.640 
like that I swear to god I'll
pistol-whip<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.750> next<00:02:47.990> guy<00:02:48.170> that<00:02:48.200> says

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
pistol-whip the next guy that says

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.590 
pistol-whip the next guy that says
shenanigans<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.490> that<00:02:50.060> makes<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.420> huge

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
shenanigans and that makes a huge

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.479 
shenanigans and that makes a huge
difference<00:02:50.959> because<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.560> can<00:02:51.739> just<00:02:51.770> kind<00:02:52.430> of

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
difference because you can just kind of

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.610 
difference because you can just kind of
laugh<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.180> off<00:02:53.330> with<00:02:53.600> people<00:02:53.930> if<00:02:54.050> something

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
laugh it off with people if something

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.900 
laugh it off with people if something
happens<00:02:55.280> but<00:02:55.900> anyway<00:02:57.070> for<00:02:58.070> me<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.400> biggest

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
happens but anyway for me the biggest

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.330 
happens but anyway for me the biggest
thing<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.050> look<00:03:00.350> for<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.770> game<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.160> just

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
thing that I look for in a game is just

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.550 
thing that I look for in a game is just
how<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.640> plays<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.330> maps<00:03:03.200> are<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> huge<00:03:04.220> part<00:03:04.610> of

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
how it plays and maps are a huge part of

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.960 
how it plays and maps are a huge part of
how<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> game<00:03:07.010> plays<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:09.080> wasn't<00:03:09.970> crazy

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
how a game plays and I wasn't crazy

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.620 
how a game plays and I wasn't crazy
about<00:03:11.209> mono<00:03:11.570> warfare<00:03:11.930> 3<00:03:12.200> maps<00:03:12.410> this<00:03:13.400> map<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:13.880> a

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
about mono warfare 3 maps this map is a

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.140 
about mono warfare 3 maps this map is a
good<00:03:15.230> one<00:03:15.410> in<00:03:15.440> my<00:03:15.739> opinion<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.370> has<00:03:16.430> good

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
good one in my opinion it has good

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.020 
good one in my opinion it has good
colors<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.380> spawns<00:03:18.709> are<00:03:18.980> decent<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.790> it

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
colors and the spawns are decent and it

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.789 
colors and the spawns are decent and it
plays<00:03:20.420> well<00:03:21.910> but<00:03:22.910> there<00:03:23.269> was<00:03:23.390> just<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.470> many

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
that we're awful i mean like outpost and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.449 
that we're awful i mean like outpost and
downturn<00:03:29.030> where<00:03:30.130> everything<00:03:31.130> is<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.370> so

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
downturn where everything is just so

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.110 
downturn where everything is just so
bland<00:03:31.970> like<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:33.190> colors<00:03:34.190> are<00:03:34.340> all<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.880> same

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
bland like the colors are all the same

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.780 
bland like the colors are all the same
and<00:03:35.450> it's<00:03:35.540> just<00:03:35.750> awful<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:37.160> look<00:03:37.340> at<00:03:37.519> just

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
and it's just awful to look at just

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.600 
and it's just awful to look at just
their<00:03:38.000> eye<00:03:38.209> sores<00:03:39.130> there<00:03:40.130> are<00:03:40.250> just<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:40.549> many

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
their eye sores there are just so many

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.370 
their eye sores there are just so many
different<00:03:41.209> maps<00:03:41.570> like<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:41.930> like<00:03:42.110> i<00:03:42.230> would

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
different maps like that like i would

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.890 
different maps like that like i would
play<00:03:42.590> hanoi<00:03:43.010> over<00:03:43.850> those<00:03:44.030> maps<00:03:44.330> so<00:03:44.570> that's<00:03:44.720> how

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
play hanoi over those maps so that's how

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.310 
play hanoi over those maps so that's how
much<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.560> hated<00:03:46.160> them<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.900> then<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.019> get<00:03:48.170> the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
much I hated them and then you get the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.560 
much I hated them and then you get the
just<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.190> horrendous<00:03:49.519> spawns<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.360> things

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
just the horrendous spawns and things

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.780 
just the horrendous spawns and things
like<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.750> which<00:03:51.709> would<00:03:51.860> make<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.610> game

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
like that which would make the game

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.670 
like that which would make the game
frustrating<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.650> was<00:03:54.910> pretty<00:03:55.910> much

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
frustrating so that was pretty much

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.560 
frustrating so that was pretty much

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
worst gun in the game to just being

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.620 
worst gun in the game to just being
exactly<00:04:30.020> like<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.320> type<00:04:30.500> 95<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:32.330> was<00:04:32.449> kind

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
exactly like the type 95 that was kind

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.430 
exactly like the type 95 that was kind
of<00:04:32.660> frustrating<00:04:33.699> but<00:04:34.900> kind<00:04:35.900> of<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.080> other

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
of frustrating but kind of the other

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.670 
of frustrating but kind of the other
thing<00:04:36.830> was<00:04:36.979> just<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.580> support<00:04:38.440> not<00:04:39.440> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
thing was just the support not the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.340 
thing was just the support not the
people<00:04:40.310> running<00:04:40.669> support<00:04:41.270> but<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.930> support

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
people running support but the support

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.439 
people running support but the support
the<00:04:42.470> Infinity<00:04:43.100> Ward<00:04:43.340> gave<00:04:43.580> us<00:04:43.729> or<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.180> guess

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
the Infinity Ward gave us or I guess

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.870 
the Infinity Ward gave us or I guess
lack<00:04:44.720> thereof<00:04:45.310> like<00:04:46.310> you<00:04:46.460> think<00:04:46.669> of<00:04:46.789> when
