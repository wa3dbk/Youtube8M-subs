this<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.809> NRS<00:00:13.170> hydrolyzed<00:00:13.650> dry<00:00:13.889> bag<00:00:14.099> it's

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
this is the NRS hydrolyzed dry bag it's

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.010 
this is the NRS hydrolyzed dry bag it's
using<00:00:14.730> our<00:00:14.849> new<00:00:14.940> hydraulic<00:00:15.420> zip<00:00:15.809> closure

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
using our new hydraulic zip closure

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.260 
using our new hydraulic zip closure
system<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:17.010> hydraulic<00:00:17.369> drive<00:00:17.640> actually<00:00:18.029> has

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
system this hydraulic drive actually has

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.760 
system this hydraulic drive actually has
two<00:00:18.570> closure<00:00:18.900> types<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.650> your

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
two closure types so you have your

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.920 
two closure types so you have your
additional<00:00:20.220> roll<00:00:20.609> top<00:00:20.850> style<00:00:21.119> closure<00:00:21.390> with

security a little more peace of mind and
you're<00:00:39.809> also<00:00:39.930> kind<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.379> tightening<00:00:40.649> things<00:00:40.800> up

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you're also kind of tightening things up

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.380 
you're also kind of tightening things up
a<00:00:41.129> little<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.430> make<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> little<00:00:41.820> bit<00:00:42.090> nicer

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
a little bit make it a little bit nicer

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
package for your show we also include a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.690 
package for your show we also include a
small<00:00:44.820> d-ring<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:46.079> securing<00:00:46.920> these<00:00:47.039> dry<00:00:47.489> bags

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
small d-ring for securing these dry bags

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.029 
small d-ring for securing these dry bags
to<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:47.940> boat<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.899> convenience

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
to your boat just for your convenience

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.950 
to your boat just for your convenience
and<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.129> actually<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.489> these<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.940> two<00:00:51.480> versions

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and we actually do these in two versions

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
and we actually do these in two versions
this<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> round<00:00:53.219> bottom<00:00:53.489> style<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.059> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
this is the round bottom style if you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.689 
this is the round bottom style if you
can<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.190> grommeted<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:58.699> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
can see we also do a grommeted one so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.010 
can see we also do a grommeted one so
you<00:00:59.789> get<00:00:59.879> two<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.149> grommets<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.629> down<00:01:00.870> in

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you get two little grommets here down in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.170 
you get two little grommets here down in
the<00:01:01.079> corners<00:01:01.550> makes<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.640> little<00:01:02.789> bit<00:01:02.879> easier

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the corners makes a little bit easier

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
the corners makes a little bit easier
some<00:01:03.390> nice<00:01:03.539> secure<00:01:03.930> attachment<00:01:04.439> points<00:01:04.739> but

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
some nice secure attachment points but

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
some nice secure attachment points but
the<00:01:05.250> biggest<00:01:05.519> difference<00:01:05.820> between<00:01:06.360> these<00:01:06.479> two

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the biggest difference between these two

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840 
the biggest difference between these two
you'll<00:01:06.900> notice<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> pretty<00:01:08.640> flat

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you'll notice this one is pretty flat

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.440 
you'll notice this one is pretty flat
and<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.270> compare<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> round<00:01:10.049> style

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
and if you compare it to the round style

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.899 
and if you compare it to the round style
pretty<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.990> barrel<00:01:13.320> style<00:01:13.560> dry<00:01:14.189> bag<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
pretty much a barrel style dry bag in

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.760 
pretty much a barrel style dry bag in
particular<00:01:15.270> kayakers<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> like

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
particular kayakers are going to like

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.950 
particular kayakers are going to like
the<00:01:17.100> grommeted<00:01:17.580> style<00:01:17.909> hydraulic<00:01:18.479> dry<00:01:18.720> bag

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the grommeted style hydraulic dry bag

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.800 
the grommeted style hydraulic dry bag
with<00:01:19.619> its<00:01:19.799> flatter<00:01:20.070> profile<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
with its flatter profile it's going to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.999 
with its flatter profile it's going to
be<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.259> easier<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.680> far<00:01:22.890> as

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
be a little bit easier as far as

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.770 
be a little bit easier as far as
unloading<00:01:23.369> those<00:01:23.520> bags<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:24.210> their<00:01:24.330> boat<00:01:24.570> and

unloading those bags into their boat and
with<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> grommets<00:01:25.830> themselves<00:01:26.340> adding<00:01:26.670> some

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
with the grommets themselves adding some

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.740 
with the grommets themselves adding some

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
some more secure attachment points some

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.090 
some more secure attachment points some
of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> other<00:01:31.110> features<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.680> you'll<00:01:31.829> notice

of the other features that you'll notice

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
of the other features that you'll notice
on<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.369> bag<00:01:32.579> obviously<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> clear

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
on this bag obviously this is a clear

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
on this bag obviously this is a clear
urethane<00:01:34.829> window<00:01:35.280> right<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.610> makes<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
urethane window right here makes it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.910 
urethane window right here makes it
really<00:01:36.090> easy<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.479> peel<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.110> what's<00:01:37.350> what

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
really easy to peel and see what's what

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.289 
really easy to peel and see what's what
you're<00:01:38.040> looking<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:38.939> maybe<00:01:39.119> you're

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you're looking for you know maybe you're

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.580 
you're looking for you know maybe you're
trying<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> find<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:39.930> anchor<00:01:40.380> glove

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
trying to find that one anchor glove

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
trying to find that one anchor glove
because<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.890> never<00:01:41.009> stick<00:01:41.310> together<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
because I never stick together in the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.240 
because I never stick together in the
bag<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.930> will<00:01:43.350> find<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.829> pretty<00:01:44.040> easily
