00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
driving this tow truck now because the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
driving this tow truck now because the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
image is so pixelated I can't say for

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.149 
image is so pixelated I can't say for
100%<00:01:06.750> certain<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.409> Niko<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.010> gonna

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
100% certain this is Niko but I'm gonna

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.410 
100% certain this is Niko but I'm gonna
really<00:01:08.340> take<00:01:08.520> an<00:01:08.670> assumption<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.299> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
really take an assumption that it is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
really take an assumption that it is
just<00:01:09.960> because<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> facial<00:01:10.680> features<00:01:10.710> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just because of the facial features that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.440 
just because of the facial features that
you<00:01:11.220> guys<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.549> see<00:01:11.760> even<00:01:12.090> though<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.360> very

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you guys can see even though it is very

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
you guys can see even though it is very
pixelated<00:01:12.810> um<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.010> looks<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.310> he

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
pixelated um you know it looks like he
