00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.299 
this bridge here and I've always found
it<00:00:07.080> funny<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.620> second<00:00:08.130> time<00:00:08.250> going

it funny this is my second time going

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.900 
it funny this is my second time going
through<00:00:09.019> Titan<00:00:10.019> mode<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.559> it's<00:00:11.340> always<00:00:11.550> funny

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
through Titan mode and it's always funny

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.150 
through Titan mode and it's always funny
to<00:00:12.000> think<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:13.200> know<00:00:13.320> what<00:00:13.500> great<00:00:13.830> tests

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
to think that you know what great tests

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.490 
to think that you know what great tests
do<00:00:14.340> if<00:00:14.549> if<00:00:14.880> Vickers<00:00:15.299> didn't<00:00:15.630> decide<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.929> show

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
do if if Vickers didn't decide to show

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.019 
do if if Vickers didn't decide to show
up<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.890> test<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.279> his<00:00:17.369> wings<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.850> know

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
up here to test out his wings you know

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.670 
up here to test out his wings you know
there'd<00:00:18.539> be<00:00:18.630> no<00:00:18.779> way<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:18.990> him<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.410> across

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
there'd be no way for him to get across

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.269 
there'd be no way for him to get across
this<00:00:19.949> chasm<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:21.289> so<00:00:22.289> how<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.800> say<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
this chasm here so how I say it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.580 
this chasm here so how I say it
it's<00:00:23.910> nothing<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> fault<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> game

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it's nothing that I fault what the game

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.140 
it's nothing that I fault what the game
as<00:00:25.740> far<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> storyline<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.760> think<00:00:27.029> it's

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
as far as a storyline but I think it's

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.609 
as far as a storyline but I think it's
kind<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.630> convenient<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.500> occur

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
kind of convenient for that to occur

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.870 
kind of convenient for that to occur
this<00:00:28.949> event<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.279> forgive<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this event and you just forgive it that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.910 
this event and you just forgive it that
because<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.329> an<00:00:33.450> awesome<00:00:33.570> game<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.200> anyway

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
because it's an awesome game but anyway

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.840 
because it's an awesome game but anyway
so<00:00:34.980> we're<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.730> taking<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.149> very<00:00:37.850> long

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
so we're gonna be taking a very long

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
so we're gonna be taking a very long
detour<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:40.010> we're<00:00:41.010> gonna<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
detour because we're gonna have to a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
detour because we're gonna have to a
quarter<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.870> guy<00:00:43.020> swings<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.590> he's<00:00:43.680> not

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
quarter this guy swings but he's not

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.279 
quarter this guy swings but he's not
going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.190> giving<00:00:44.460> them<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.910> easily<00:00:45.289> so

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
going to be giving them up so easily so

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.229 
going to be giving them up so easily so
there's<00:00:46.440> gonna<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.739> pretty<00:00:47.579> fun<00:00:47.760> QuickTime

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
there's gonna be a pretty fun QuickTime

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.510 
there's gonna be a pretty fun QuickTime
sequence<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.500> bought<00:00:49.739> us<00:00:50.129> he's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
sequence to do with this bought us he's

QuickTime buttons to press and not press
but<00:01:05.460> move<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> analog<00:01:06.270> stick<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
but move the analog stick and if you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.770 
but move the analog stick and if you
succeed<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:09.119> those<00:01:09.270> two<00:01:09.510> button

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
succeed in the in those two button

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.410 
succeed in the in those two button
presses<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:11.159> you're<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.549> top<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.270> the

you're on top and you can only hit him
when<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.040> top<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.180> what's<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.600> on

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
when you're on top so what's going on

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.550 
when you're on top so what's going on
here<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> square<00:01:22.560> button<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:24.110> it's<00:01:25.110> he

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
here is the square button is the it's he

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.899 
here is the square button is the it's he
hits<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.920> right<00:01:26.189> hand<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
hits with the right hand and then the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.520 
hits with the right hand and then the
triangle<00:01:27.299> button<00:01:27.450> he<00:01:27.720> hits<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> left

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
triangle button he hits with the left

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
triangle button he hits with the left
hand<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.070> how<00:01:29.220> how<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.850> works<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
hand it's just how how it works out and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.170 
hand it's just how how it works out and
then<00:01:30.990> when<00:01:31.500> he<00:01:31.619> does<00:01:31.829> try<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.000> off

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
then when he does try to get you off

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.050 
then when he does try to get you off
center<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:34.350> move<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> analog<00:01:35.670> stick<00:01:35.880> back

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
center just move the analog stick back

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.910 
center just move the analog stick back
and<00:01:36.270> forth<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.290> sequence<00:01:37.530> here

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and forth and then this sequence here

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
and forth and then this sequence here
requires<00:01:38.220> another<00:01:38.689> analog<00:01:39.689> stick<00:01:39.990> rotation

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
requires another analog stick rotation

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.929 
requires another analog stick rotation
so<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.130> there's<00:01:41.400> three<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> them<00:01:41.820> in

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
so just I think there's three of them in

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.469 
so just I think there's three of them in
this<00:01:42.869> fight<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
this fight and this is just this is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.889 
this fight and this is just this is
