it's<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.340> difficult<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.780> we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it's going to be difficult but I know we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.760 
it's going to be difficult but I know we
can<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.469> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
can do it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.750 
can do it

blades<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.810> grass<00:01:16.340> but<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.490> did<00:01:18.229> first<00:01:19.229> we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
blades of grass but we did first we

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
blades of grass but we did first we
decided<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.220> wanted<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> count<00:01:20.880> 10<00:01:21.180> centimeter

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
decided we wanted to count 10 centimeter

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.770 
decided we wanted to count 10 centimeter
by<00:01:21.960> 10<00:01:21.990> centimeter<00:01:22.369> squares<00:01:23.390> which<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.570> my

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
by 10 centimeter squares which was my

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
by 10 centimeter squares which was my
suggestion<00:01:25.259> after<00:01:25.799> mr.<00:01:26.100> terrip<00:01:26.430> talked<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.939> us

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

suggestion after mr. terrip talked to us
about<00:01:27.299> sampling<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.710> our<00:01:28.890> government

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
about sampling and how our government

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.270 
about sampling and how our government
gets<00:01:29.579> population<00:01:30.270> numbers<00:01:30.710> then<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.950> measured

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
gets population numbers then we measured

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.520 
gets population numbers then we measured
the<00:01:32.400> squares<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.060> large<00:01:33.329> pieces<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.869> cardboard

the squares on large pieces of cardboard

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
the squares on large pieces of cardboard
and<00:01:34.799> cut<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:35.220> out<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.390> were<00:01:36.479> left<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and cut them out so we were left with a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.630 
and cut them out so we were left with a
piece<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> cardboard<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.130> had<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> 10

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
piece of cardboard that had a 10

that<00:01:41.000> was<00:01:42.000> mr.<00:01:42.270> terrip<00:01:42.570> suggestion<00:01:43.399> now<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that was mr. terrip suggestion now it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
that was mr. terrip suggestion now it
would<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.970> easy<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> toss<00:01:45.659> our<00:01:45.960> piece<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
would be easy to toss our piece of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
would be easy to toss our piece of
cardboard<00:01:46.950> around<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.430> field<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.970> collect
