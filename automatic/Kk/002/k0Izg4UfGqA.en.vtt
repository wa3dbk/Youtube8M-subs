00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.799
 Personal speech that another video in the blog 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:15.139
 beauty is how you can see the videos 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.060
 Now I'm very different in the ans are 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.340
 noticing we are more with a 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.120
 a bit more informative footprint 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.340
 so the more mathematical videos more 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.820
 analysis but in our view on the 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.550
 story is will be so sporadic times 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.739
 It's going to happen we have some 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.379
 other sessions we will give more 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.940
 importance and beauty as if I am seeing 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.640
 this video he made an overview of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.089
 information for you but it will not be 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.059
 about anp if beauty then is this year 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:50.120
 there are two events that happened 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.249
 here in Sao Paulo is in the capital wanting 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.269
 say metropolitan region of paulo 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:58.609

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.969
 next Saturday 23rd 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.519
 I'll be there at the pdc the alliance can 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.770
 have your booth there will have 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.320
 staff members from there and 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.210
 I 'll probably be there I also know 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.659
 some people who are probably going to 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.780
 I'll be with these people but you 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.530
 go if you want to know me 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.109
 only with me then it is if there's a five 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.200
 six people who want to talk about is the 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.600
 It's bad for the conversation there. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.789
 understand, I'll be there more or 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.859
 less than three hours after the 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.409
 afternoon and went check the anime friends 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.149
 So stay some friends of mine. 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.280
 So it was cool, I liked it a lot. 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.429
 meet the staff then if you want 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.789
 There's beauty now if you do not like it. 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:50.210
 of these events as it was a lot of people 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.490
 in that thing a little more is messy 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.850
 will have another event that will 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.710
 about manga is the name of the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.140
 event and flea market 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.439
 will be November 30th at 11 am 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.810
 11 11 I'll be there 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.810
 I really like these lectures. 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.130
 so I 'll be there too, I went out to see 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.800
 the talks finally 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.740
 then look at these events there is referred to 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.700
 one of the changes is from the videos there to 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.150
 you 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.480
 the last news is that I'm thinking 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.480
 seriously coming back and ate with another 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.519
 Channel that I speak of anp if I like 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.160
 a lot of other warrants I like a lot 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.040
 of other books and I can not put together 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.010
 It's still these things like that. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.200
 here is to talk only if the vamp 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.630
 understand then it's complicated to stay here 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.209
 trying to tell you about manga 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.370
 about book is because I'm going to talk too 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.260
 a very basic very superficial thing 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.720
 and I'm not really going to do what I 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.140
 I wanted to give a little of my opinion 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.360
 then that's it is also keep an eye 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.470
 there on the other channel I do not know if I'll do it 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.530
 another channel 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.700
 Yeah, but apparently I intend to use it. 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.459
 even my fsm pigeon that was meant 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.900
 actually brings forth manga just like me 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.390
 I also want to talk about books. 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.849
 I'll probably do another one too. 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.049
 I do not know if you want 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.510
 to know more 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.940
 and I'll leave my facebook down there 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.190
 in the description who you can follow me 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.010
 This is a warning that I will not add. 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.970
 nobody and I just do not go it was not that kind 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.940
 of a person but if you can continue to have it there 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.750
 Abin, you can follow me. 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.150
 so if you want to go out to news 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.680
 about this is the other and your work 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.060
 about the project I want to make speak 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.280
 about manga books or anyway it's a theme 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.530
 I do not need to talk like this. 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.319
 exactly from a place but it's not talking 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.750
 but - the market at last I really like 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.359
 of this subject so I 'm intending 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.130
 come back to talk about it soon 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.819
 but you 'll probably also stay for 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.190
 2014 is more then facebook for who 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.799
 You want to follow me, and I think it's this. 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.170
 I think these are the warnings until the 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.940
 next to the next video, follow the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.870
