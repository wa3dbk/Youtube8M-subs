that question you first must understand

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.359 
that question you first must understand
all<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.210> unique<00:00:15.619> characteristics<00:00:16.619> the

strengths and weaknesses of the type of

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.890 
strengths and weaknesses of the type of
tree<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.090> asking<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> question

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
tree that you are asking the question

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.939 
tree that you are asking the question
about<00:00:23.300> this<00:00:24.300> particular<00:00:24.810> tree<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.289> an<00:00:25.439> Italian

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
about this particular tree is an Italian

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.140 
about this particular tree is an Italian
stone<00:00:26.340> pine<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.830> very<00:00:28.830> large<00:00:29.130> fairly<00:00:29.849> old

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
stone pine it's a very large fairly old

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.060 
stone pine it's a very large fairly old
specimen<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.960> would<00:00:31.140> guess<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.529> tree<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> be

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
specimen I would guess this tree to be

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.350 
specimen I would guess this tree to be
60<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.730> 70<00:00:33.270> years<00:00:33.450> old<00:00:34.969> now

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
60 to 70 years old now

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.840 
60 to 70 years old now
the<00:00:36.570> Italian<00:00:37.020> stone<00:00:37.290> pine<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.700> those

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the Italian stone pine is one of those

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.900 
the Italian stone pine is one of those
trees<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:40.200> recognized<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.160> having<00:00:41.610> some

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
trees that is recognized for having some

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.840 
trees that is recognized for having some
inherent<00:00:42.690> weaknesses<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> fact

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
inherent weaknesses I know for a fact

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.590 
inherent weaknesses I know for a fact
that<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:46.110> type<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.620> tree<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.570> prone<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that this type of tree is prone to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.400 
that this type of tree is prone to
splitting<00:00:49.379> big<00:00:49.680> branches<00:00:50.690> but<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.170> for

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
splitting big branches but it can go for

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.020 
splitting big branches but it can go for
years<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> years<00:00:53.070> without<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.760> happening

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
years and years without that happening

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
years and years without that happening
so<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> look<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so what you have to look for are the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.959 
so what you have to look for are the
weaknesses<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> structure<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:59.550> also<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
weaknesses in the structure it's also a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
weaknesses in the structure it's also a
difficult<00:01:00.539> tree<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.559> correct

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
difficult tree to make the correct

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.509 
difficult tree to make the correct
decisions<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.989> because<00:01:03.989> all<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.010> foliage<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
decisions on because all the foliage is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.630 
decisions on because all the foliage is
way<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> very<00:01:06.900> ends<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:08.130> can't<00:01:08.400> just

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
way out on the very ends you can't just

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
way out on the very ends you can't just
stub<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.150> tree<00:01:09.450> back<00:01:09.689> there's<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> lot<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
stub this tree back there's a lot of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.940 
stub this tree back there's a lot of
dead<00:01:10.830> wood<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.560> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> look<00:01:13.860> at

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
dead wood up in here and if you look at

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
dead wood up in here and if you look at
the<00:01:14.070> main<00:01:14.310> crotch<00:01:14.760> system<00:01:15.270> right<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.530> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the main crotch system right here that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.460 
the main crotch system right here that
big<00:01:16.799> limb<00:01:17.040> off<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.470> that's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
big limb off to the right there that's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.940 
big limb off to the right there that's
not<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> best<00:01:20.520> attachment<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
not the best attachment so the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
not the best attachment so the
possibility<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.909> tree<00:01:24.150> splitting<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
possibility of this tree splitting and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.399 
possibility of this tree splitting and
going<00:01:25.140> into<00:01:25.409> two<00:01:25.590> directions<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:27.030> real

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
going into two directions is very real

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.149 
going into two directions is very real
so<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> do

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
so what do you do

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.359 
so what do you do
well<00:01:29.670> first<00:01:30.210> off<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:31.290> tree<00:01:31.680> ideally<00:01:32.130> should

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
well first off this tree ideally should

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.780 
well first off this tree ideally should
be<00:01:32.610> pruned<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> cooler<00:01:33.750> season<00:01:34.790> there's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
be pruned in the cooler season there's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.240 
be pruned in the cooler season there's
yet<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> couple<00:01:36.570> more<00:01:36.900> beautiful<00:01:37.500> examples<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
yet a couple more beautiful examples of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.910 
yet a couple more beautiful examples of

the Italian stone pine in Saratoga this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.440 
the Italian stone pine in Saratoga this
is<00:01:41.070> another<00:01:41.670> example<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.630> significant<00:01:43.560> old

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
is another example of a significant old

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.289 
is another example of a significant old
Italian<00:01:45.450> stone<00:01:45.780> pine<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:47.520> tree<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> almost<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.910 
Saratoga and as you can see this tree
has<00:01:58.920> had<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.520> few<00:01:59.939> big<00:02:00.299> failures<00:02:00.960> over<00:02:01.619> its<00:02:01.770> life

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
has had a few big failures over its life

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
has had a few big failures over its life
incredible<00:02:04.920> specimen<00:02:05.190> it's<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:06.210> sad<00:02:06.570> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
incredible specimen it's really sad that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.200 
incredible specimen it's really sad that
it's<00:02:07.160> reached<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.760> end<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:09.000> its<00:02:09.090> lifespan<00:02:11.210> and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
it's reached the end of its lifespan and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.500 
it's reached the end of its lifespan and
it<00:02:12.420> could<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.690> been<00:02:13.250> minimized<00:02:14.250> had<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.270> been

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
it could have been minimized had it been

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.200 
it could have been minimized had it been
looked<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:16.020> years<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.680> years<00:02:16.860> ago<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.210> some

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
looked at years and years ago and some

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.120 
looked at years and years ago and some
appropriate<00:02:18.870> weight<00:02:19.080> reduction<00:02:19.650> had<00:02:19.920> been

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
appropriate weight reduction had been

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.890 
appropriate weight reduction had been
performed<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.210> once<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.540> gets<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.870> a

the very ends it's difficult to do the

the very ends it's difficult to do the
weight<00:02:30.000> reduction<00:02:30.240> because<00:02:30.900> all<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.380> do

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
weight reduction because all you can do

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.950 
weight reduction because all you can do
is<00:02:31.620> take<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.830> few<00:02:32.100> limbs<00:02:32.400> off<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.720> can't

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
is take a few limbs off but you can't

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.320 
is take a few limbs off but you can't
reduce<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.130> overall<00:02:35.430> size<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.360> tree<00:02:38.330> this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
reduce the overall size of the tree this

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.390 
reduce the overall size of the tree this
is<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.540> massive<00:02:40.260> tree<00:02:40.530> with<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.770> trunk<00:02:41.160> diameter

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
is a massive tree with a trunk diameter

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.110 
is a massive tree with a trunk diameter
of<00:02:41.970> oh<00:02:42.800> it's<00:02:43.800> about<00:02:44.010> five<00:02:44.340> feet<00:02:44.640> at<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.940> base

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.010 
of oh it's about five feet at the base
and<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:48.140> just<00:02:49.140> amazing<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:51.120> used<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.660> spread

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
and it is just amazing it used to spread

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.470 
and it is just amazing it used to spread
widely<00:02:52.440> clear<00:02:53.220> over<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.700> right<00:02:53.910> there<00:02:54.240> but

widely clear over to the right there but

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.910 
widely clear over to the right there but

one by one the branches have been

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.540 
one by one the branches have been
breaking<00:02:56.490> off<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.590> now<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.650> majority<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.430> the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
now number five and five is a real small

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.510 
now number five and five is a real small
tree<00:05:11.139> that's<00:05:11.320> too<00:05:11.470> close<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.010> oak<00:05:12.130> so

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
tree that's too close to the oak so

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.270 
tree that's too close to the oak so
making<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.940> decision<00:05:13.389> here<00:05:13.539> is<00:05:13.570> really<00:05:13.930> tough

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
making the decision here is really tough

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.390 
making the decision here is really tough
frankly<00:05:15.750> there's<00:05:16.750> five<00:05:17.020> trees<00:05:17.380> here<00:05:17.710> if<00:05:17.979> they

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
frankly there's five trees here if they

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.390 
frankly there's five trees here if they
got<00:05:18.699> rid<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:18.970> one<00:05:19.030> two<00:05:19.449> four<00:05:19.990> five<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:21.070> just

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
got rid of one two four five and just

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.540 
got rid of one two four five and just
left<00:05:21.580> number<00:05:21.820> three<00:05:22.300> as<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:23.110> dominant<00:05:23.650> that

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
left number three as the dominant that

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.550 
left number three as the dominant that
would<00:05:24.729> probably<00:05:25.000> be<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.539> wise<00:05:25.900> decision

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
would probably be the wise decision

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.529 
would probably be the wise decision
because<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:26.949> have<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.220> look<00:05:27.400> at<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.729> whole

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
because you have to look at the whole

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.750 
because you have to look at the whole
environment<00:05:28.930> what<00:05:29.830> else<00:05:30.010> is<00:05:30.190> going<00:05:30.460> on<00:05:30.580> around

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
environment what else is going on around

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.300 
environment what else is going on around
you<00:05:31.240> we've<00:05:31.840> got<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.050> number<00:05:32.260> of<00:05:32.410> live<00:05:32.800> oaks<00:05:32.830> in

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
you we've got a number of live oaks in

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.270 
you we've got a number of live oaks in
the<00:05:33.400> back<00:05:33.580> litter<00:05:34.260> they're<00:05:35.260> fairly<00:05:35.500> large<00:05:35.800> but

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
the back litter they're fairly large but

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.750 
the back litter they're fairly large but
over<00:05:36.970> on<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.180> side<00:05:37.419> here<00:05:38.160> we've<00:05:39.160> got<00:05:39.340> a<00:05:39.400> lot<00:05:39.610> of

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
over on the side here we've got a lot of

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.670 
over on the side here we've got a lot of
younger<00:05:40.030> live<00:05:40.389> oaks<00:05:40.660> that<00:05:40.780> are<00:05:41.020> going<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.470> get

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
younger live oaks that are going to get

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.760 
younger live oaks that are going to get
significantly<00:05:42.580> larger<00:05:43.270> so<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.260> decision

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
significantly larger so the decision

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.480 
significantly larger so the decision
about<00:05:44.919> what<00:05:45.820> stays<00:05:46.419> and<00:05:46.449> what<00:05:46.870> goes<00:05:47.410> should<00:05:48.310> be

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
about what stays and what goes should be

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.330 
about what stays and what goes should be
made<00:05:48.669> early<00:05:49.479> rather<00:05:49.990> than<00:05:50.289> later<00:05:50.590> because<00:05:50.710> the

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
made early rather than later because the

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.550 
made early rather than later because the
competition<00:05:52.030> of<00:05:52.120> all<00:05:52.300> these<00:05:52.510> trees<00:05:52.840> will

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
competition of all these trees will

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.760 
competition of all these trees will
ultimately<00:05:54.159> decide<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.270> outcome<00:05:55.449> of<00:05:56.080> how

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
ultimately decide the outcome of how

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.510 
ultimately decide the outcome of how
this<00:05:57.039> area<00:05:57.610> evolves
