00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.100
 and constantin I hope you are very well 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.110
 quantum today I bring you three 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.150
 images that are from the boats the other 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.279
 day another image of the votes that came out 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.290
 puts us here that was let's say that the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.200
 first official image of boats that 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.450
 well I did not make video about that because 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.919
 obviously that day I had two exams and 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.810
 I did not have time to be so 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.780
 Excuse me but as you can see it 's a 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.329
 Pretty pretty good interface the boat 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.610
 As you can see it looks like main card and how 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.250
 that have a darker color or is a 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.929
 coffee very a very dark coffee 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.449
 in fact, he commented on twitterers 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.489
 developers that the boat right now 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.800
 it seems main card only because they are 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.899
 doing as tests then they say that 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.309
 maybe it's definitely not a makers 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.469
 but soon you will be well 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.480
 boat texture that you in the combo 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.100
 has like word hits up and save 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.589
 it's like the boat has more 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.540
 small details and it is clear that you can see that 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.640
 well that is a maker 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.660
 although good as you can see being 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.240
 on top of the boat 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.190
 we have two levers created from the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.470
 left and from the right one the two 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.270
 they are buttons rather they are buttons to go 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.880
 forward what I understand 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.380
 well twitter I do not know if it's 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.630
 wrong but progressed more secure and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.340
 I think he saw it really well, but 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.180
 if you press for example that of the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.830
 left you will go to the right and if 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.260
 pressed to the right you will go towards 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.500
 the left is like an oar it's like 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.270
 Row the prints from the left going 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.590
 to paddle on the left side and we 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.720
 had commented that these boats to 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.090
 need an oar and that's going to be like 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.430
 a shovel then I say if re more 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.310
 evidently from the left side 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.320
 the boat obviously by law of physics 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.630
 famous if this serves for the right 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.410
 because you're doing it by making him a 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.759
 push on the left side and if 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.410
 you do of the right obviously also 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.680
 the boat is going to go to the other side 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.140
 then more or less like this to go 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.850
 moving forward well you should go 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.149
 pressing 1 left 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.759
 to the right and let's say that the boat is 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.860
 would then go straight to use it not 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.920
 totally right but we could 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.750
 go then as more in front and not hearing 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.790
 not only do a side I think that 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.950
 This is going to be a very easy way to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.020
 shuffle the boats more than the pc you 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.430
 know that on the PC the boats or the xbox 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.300
 well I consider it a bit 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.670
 difficult to manage 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.040
 then it's going to be fine and then it 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.050
 star home smell sticks and good 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.330
 Well, it 's pretty ugly, so I have 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.040
 Many hopes but good is a year 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.769
 remarkable what you can see here in 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 this image first of all is that at 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.950
 look like we are in third person's 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.019
 front 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.310
 I'm not sure to give them, it could be that 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.950
 another person from another but is 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.800
 presented on your boat and I'm watching it or 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.090
 that this type has been put in third 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.640
 person to the color to the function that 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.799
 they added and you can see front what 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.150
 which would be very very very epic if you 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.489
 add because in fact in this other 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.920
 photo also looks like it's a 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.780
 little front but do not know it 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.519
 difficult to think that also a person 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.709
 from a button he took the photo as 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.000
 can see is how up it would be difficult 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.760
 that a person is the air 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.920
 to not have the interface of a boat like that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.200
 that it can not be that third 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.620
 person maybe not but we have good 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.210
 that see it and trade guys these boats 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.360
 since a few days ago they planned it 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.250
 so that they were boats for two people 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.840
 or animals as you can see here is the 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.490
 as it first prototype of 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.530
 double boats and as you can see they say 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.209
 that in fact the tweet said that because 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.340
 not that he does not know very well that he is 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.620
 there but like that with half of this 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.930
 there is no longer a pig and the style 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.510
 going through the pig because it looks ugly 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.820
 then after that they had this 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.310
 image that if only I think it is 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.530
 pretty pretty good 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.510
 maybe this is the final prototype of 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.170
 how will the function of the boats be 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.510
 for all these travelers or all 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.100
 that do not fit two passengers I think that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.900
 It gets pretty good as I say there 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.239
 yes on ivoox that someone reviews the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.700
 another apparently the votes are a little 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.450
 longer evidently for then that 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.060
 pan 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.769
 more people but yes, as they can 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.739
 see is pretty pretty good I'm 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.930
 well back and forth comes the little wolf 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.970
 and as I say there, it also seems that 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.669
 they are like the third person from the front 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.160
 and finally here we have another photo that 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.169
 the palmers tweet thorne and all the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.240
 says that the wolves do not like them 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.190
 the boats I do not know why maybe the 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.560
 next hit a wolf and it embittered 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.790
 of traction like joke this but it's 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.260
 another image that is pretty 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.690
 interesting how can you see there is 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.120
 You can put two animals in the 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.840
 boats 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.690
 apparently does not come out I do not know I do not understand 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.930
 Well, there is enough life, nothing more, guys 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.460
 This is the news today no 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.139
 they liked the truth that the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.139
 boats is not something that you want so much or 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.729
 so much emotion but then it is not something 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.919
 from the father that the best can 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.169
 Have fun for a while although good as you 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.810
 I say it's not so much that I add the 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.610
 skins or who was already the rector or who did not 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.610
 I knew about that big food bar
