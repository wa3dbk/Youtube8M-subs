we from above

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.380 
we from above
on<00:00:52.609> the<00:00:52.850> outflow

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.560 

since<00:00:58.930> we<00:00:59.170> work<00:00:59.350> in<00:00:59.560> just<00:00:59.770> one<00:00:59.980> I<00:01:00.420> ordered<00:01:01.420> this

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
since we work in just one I ordered this

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.890 
since we work in just one I ordered this
unit<00:01:02.140> with<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:04.199> light<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.790> stance<00:01:06.790> there<00:01:07.750> are

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
unit with the light and stance there are

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.430 
unit with the light and stance there are
critic<00:01:08.200> stands<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:10.090> are<00:01:10.120> critics<00:01:10.840> dance<00:01:11.080> I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
critic stands they are critics dance I

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.920 
critic stands they are critics dance I
can't<00:01:12.250> use<00:01:12.520> them<00:01:12.700> because<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.540> have<00:01:13.900> a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
can't use them because I have a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.580 
can't use them because I have a
thermostat<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:16.060> wall<00:01:16.180> there<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:17.350> gets

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
thermostat on the wall there that gets

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.040 
thermostat on the wall there that gets
in<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.860> way<00:01:18.010> I<00:01:18.040> want<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.370> try<00:01:18.580> to<00:01:18.640> raise<00:01:19.050> the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
in the way I want to try to raise the

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.090 
in the way I want to try to raise the
light<00:01:20.290> onto<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.830> stands<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:22.920> bummed<00:01:23.920> out

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
light onto the stands so bummed out

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.480 
light onto the stands so bummed out
about<00:01:24.160> that<00:01:24.640> but<00:01:24.910> it<00:01:25.420> is<00:01:25.540> what<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.810> is<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:27.130> just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
got the ninja three days ago so I have

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.969 
got the ninja three days ago so I have
nothing<00:01:30.010> in<00:01:30.100> there<00:01:30.280> but<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.490> sand<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.680> put<00:01:32.680> five

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979

things<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.040> can<00:01:48.070> get<00:01:48.310> some<00:01:49.649> Pinero<00:01:50.649> it's<00:01:51.130> just

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
things I can get some Pinero it's just

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.690 
things I can get some Pinero it's just
there<00:01:51.580> just<00:01:51.610> like<00:01:51.910> that

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.340 

this<00:01:59.299> is<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.539> view<00:01:59.960> from

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.950 

looking<00:02:06.159> at<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.430> outflow<00:02:06.820> hitting<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.750> top

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
looking at the outflow hitting the top

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:21.440 
looking at the outflow hitting the top
of<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.170> water

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.290 

our<00:02:22.080> next<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.600> reef<00:02:24.600> octopus<00:02:25.260> BH

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
our next to it I have a reef octopus BH

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.510 
our next to it I have a reef octopus BH
1000<00:02:27.300> hanging<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> back<00:02:28.620> protein<00:02:29.160> skimmer

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
1000 hanging on the back protein skimmer

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.380 
1000 hanging on the back protein skimmer
I<00:02:32.390> think<00:02:33.390> also<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:35.180> blue<00:02:36.180> design

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
I think also that this is a blue design

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.530 
I think also that this is a blue design
with<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:38.060> out<00:02:39.060> flow<00:02:39.560> into<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> cup<00:02:41.300> rather<00:02:42.300> than

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
with the out flow into a cup rather than

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.000 
with the out flow into a cup rather than
just<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> pipe<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:46.560> also<00:02:46.709> has<00:02:48.110> those<00:02:49.110> little

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
just the pipe it also has those little

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.780 
just the pipe it also has those little
Tom<00:02:51.550> pants

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.300 

seems<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.750> be<00:02:55.870> skimming<00:02:56.170> pretty<00:02:56.500> well<00:02:56.739> I<00:02:57.010> just

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
seems to be skimming pretty well I just

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.039 
seems to be skimming pretty well I just
cleaned<00:02:57.579> out<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.879> box<00:02:59.340> yesterday<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:01.049> it's

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
cleaned out the box yesterday and it's

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.369 
cleaned out the box yesterday and it's
job<00:03:04.019> they're<00:03:05.019> little<00:03:05.379> micro<00:03:05.709> bubbles<00:03:07.319> when<00:03:08.319> I

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
job they're little micro bubbles when I

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.860 
job they're little micro bubbles when I
first<00:03:08.680> got<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.219> the<00:03:09.879> micro<00:03:10.209> bubbles<00:03:10.359> were<00:03:10.629> just

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
first got it the micro bubbles were just

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.410 
first got it the micro bubbles were just
everywhere<00:03:11.349> it<00:03:11.769> was<00:03:11.950> really<00:03:12.939> really<00:03:13.090> bad

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
everywhere it was really really bad

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.440 
everywhere it was really really bad
but<00:03:14.099> after<00:03:15.099> a<00:03:15.129> couple<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.430> weeks<00:03:15.670> they<00:03:16.209> seemed

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
but after a couple of weeks they seemed

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.399 
but after a couple of weeks they seemed
to<00:03:16.599> settle<00:03:16.810> down<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:18.989> interestingly<00:03:19.989> enough

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
to settle down and interestingly enough

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.979 
to settle down and interestingly enough
I<00:03:21.010> didn't<00:03:21.489> get<00:03:21.639> a<00:03:21.670> lot<00:03:21.879> of<00:03:22.030> micro<00:03:22.299> bubbles<00:03:22.450> even

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
I didn't get a lot of micro bubbles even

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.470 
I didn't get a lot of micro bubbles even
from<00:03:23.139> day<00:03:23.319> one<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.060> hang<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.329> back

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
from day one on the hang on the back

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.800 
from day one on the hang on the back
refugium<00:03:26.459> war<00:03:27.459> that's<00:03:28.030> coming<00:03:28.120> out<00:03:28.450> like<00:03:28.629> that

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
refugium war that's coming out like that

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.500 
refugium war that's coming out like that
now<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:30.159> exactly<00:03:30.639> how<00:03:30.819> it<00:03:31.000> was<00:03:31.090> coming<00:03:31.389> out

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
now is exactly how it was coming out

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.250 
now is exactly how it was coming out
from<00:03:31.780> day<00:03:32.019> one<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:33.450> mean<00:03:34.450> there<00:03:34.659> are<00:03:34.840> some

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
from day one I mean there are some

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.559 
from day one I mean there are some
bubbles<00:03:38.010> inside<00:03:39.010> we<00:03:39.730> figured<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.269> know<00:03:40.329> just

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
bubbles inside we figured you know just

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.940 
bubbles inside we figured you know just
hanging<00:03:40.959> out<00:03:41.049> on<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.319> glass<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:43.359> such<00:03:45.120> what
