just<00:00:21.150> saw<00:00:21.390> me<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> cut<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.500> my<00:00:22.800> MF<00:00:23.400> t3<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
just saw me do a cut with my MF t3 that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.990 
just saw me do a cut with my MF t3 that
I<00:00:24.660> built<00:00:25.019> well<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:25.740> multifunction<00:00:26.580> table

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
I built well it's my multifunction table

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.839 
I built well it's my multifunction table
that's<00:00:27.240> basically<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:27.960> docking<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:29.400> same

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
that's basically for docking but same

well<00:00:42.739> one<00:00:43.739> fault<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> found<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
well one fault that I found with it is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
well one fault that I found with it is
that<00:00:45.629> towards<00:00:46.170> right<00:00:46.379> at<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> end<00:00:46.829> when<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that towards right at the end when you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.190 
that towards right at the end when you
finish<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> cut<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.020> little

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
finish the cut you get this little

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.319 
finish the cut you get this little
blowout<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> time<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.280> time<00:00:50.430> again<00:00:50.550> you'll

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
blowout do it time and time again you'll

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.939 
blowout do it time and time again you'll
see<00:00:51.510> there'll<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.899> fair<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> buildup<00:00:52.800> on

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
see there'll be a fair bit of buildup on

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.049 
see there'll be a fair bit of buildup on
the<00:00:53.010> track<00:00:53.280> down<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.770> sawdust<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.059> I

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the track down here of sawdust and I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.569 
the track down here of sawdust and I
thought<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> myself<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.770> think

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
thought to myself you know what I think

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
thought to myself you know what I think
I<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.969> fix<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.260> I've<00:01:01.440> come<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
I can fix that so I've come up with a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.250 
I can fix that so I've come up with a
little<00:01:02.100> system<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.210> work<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
little system and it will work with the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.070 
little system and it will work with the
conventional<00:01:04.739> MF<00:01:04.979> t3<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:06.119> you've<00:01:06.720> made<00:01:06.869> one

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
conventional MF t3 or if you've made one

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.730 
conventional MF t3 or if you've made one

stick<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.770> me<00:01:13.890> I'll<00:01:13.979> show<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.220> how<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
stick with me I'll show you how we do it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.370 
stick with me I'll show you how we do it
I<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.540> having<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.869> look<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> whole<00:01:16.350> thing

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
I was having a look at the whole thing

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.609 
I was having a look at the whole thing
and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.950> thought<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.430> down<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.619> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
and I thought you know down here I I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.859 
and I thought you know down here I I
think<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.430> could<00:01:20.700> utilize<00:01:21.240> something<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
think that I could utilize something to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.429 
think that I could utilize something to
hold<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:23.009> dust<00:01:23.670> collector<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.150> some<00:01:24.390> sort<00:01:24.720> now

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hold a dust collector of some sort now

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.920 
hold a dust collector of some sort now
it<00:01:25.740> could<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.580> situation<00:01:26.820> where<00:01:27.270> I've<00:01:27.540> got<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it could be a situation where I've got a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.460 
it could be a situation where I've got a
why<00:01:28.320> running<00:01:29.009> off<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.400> main<00:01:29.670> hose<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.470> to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
why running off my main hose here to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.240 
why running off my main hose here to
underneath<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:33.650> catching<00:01:34.650> something<00:01:35.009> there

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
underneath and catching something there

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.170 
underneath and catching something there
or<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.780> could<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.590> main<00:01:38.009> dust<00:01:38.759> extractor

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
or I could have my main dust extractor

it<00:04:14.970> will<00:04:15.060> work<00:04:15.270> on<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.510> standard<00:04:15.959> MF<00:04:16.200> t3<00:04:16.620> because

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
it will work on a standard MF t3 because

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.759 
it will work on a standard MF t3 because
I've<00:04:17.430> made<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:17.820> short<00:04:18.150> enough<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:19.200> be<00:04:19.350> able<00:04:19.530> to

this thing dropping and I have another
two<00:04:37.980> bolt<00:04:38.190> which<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.639> clamp<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.740> locks

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
two bolt which is the clamp that locks

two bolt which is the clamp that locks
it<00:04:40.860> onto<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> back<00:04:42.020> onto<00:04:43.020> this<00:04:43.110> track<00:04:43.350> here

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
it onto the back onto this track here

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.719 
it onto the back onto this track here
I've<00:04:44.550> got<00:04:44.760> a<00:04:44.790> 4<00:04:45.030> inch<00:04:45.150> port<00:04:45.419> here<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:46.610> come<00:04:47.610> right

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
I've got a 4 inch port here I come right

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.870 
I've got a 4 inch port here I come right
on<00:04:47.790> this<00:04:47.910> side<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:49.160> I'm<00:04:50.160> going<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.460> do<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.610> cut

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
on this side and I'm going to do a cut

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.430 
on this side and I'm going to do a cut
it's<00:04:51.090> important<00:04:51.510> that<00:04:51.540> this<00:04:51.780> can<00:04:51.960> still<00:04:52.169> swing

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
it's important that this can still swing

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.870 
it's important that this can still swing
up<00:04:52.560> out<00:04:53.550> of<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.729> way<00:04:54.320> which<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.470> can<00:04:55.880> that's

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
up out of the way which it can that's

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.330 
up out of the way which it can that's
why<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.210> port<00:04:57.660> has<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:58.050> be<00:04:58.229> there's<00:04:58.740> no<00:04:58.919> floor

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
why the port has to be there's no floor

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.810 
why the port has to be there's no floor
on<00:04:59.729> that<00:05:00.630> dust<00:05:00.930> port<00:05:01.200> just<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.340> little<00:05:02.550> bit<00:05:02.669> to

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
on that dust port just a little bit to

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.969 
on that dust port just a little bit to
hold<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.120> no<00:05:03.300> can't<00:05:03.840> foul<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.350> track<00:05:04.560> lifting

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
hold it no can't foul the track lifting

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.350 
hold it no can't foul the track lifting
