practicing endodontist in Louisville
Kentucky<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:05.009> we've<00:00:05.670> all<00:00:05.850> used<00:00:06.150> gates

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
Kentucky and we've all used gates

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.509 
Kentucky and we've all used gates
clintons<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.020> our<00:00:07.170> practices<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:08.189> years

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
clintons and our practices for years

clintons and our practices for years
here's<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.510> way<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.809> like<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.349> employ<00:00:10.650> them<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:10.950> my

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
here's a way I like to employ them in my

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.570 
here's a way I like to employ them in my
practice<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:12.650> we're<00:00:13.650> gonna<00:00:13.740> introduce<00:00:14.040> gates

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
practice now we're gonna introduce gates

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.910 
practice now we're gonna introduce gates
glidden<00:00:14.820> burns<00:00:15.540> into<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> tooth<00:00:16.260> here<00:00:16.560> we're

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
glidden burns into the tooth here we're

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.890 
glidden burns into the tooth here we're
gonna<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.130> using<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.520> densify<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.180> fare<00:00:18.449> gates

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
gonna be using to densify my fare gates

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.540 
gonna be using to densify my fare gates
glidden<00:00:19.050> burs<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.369> like

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
glidden burs and what what I really like

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.730 
glidden burs and what what I really like
about<00:00:20.580> these<00:00:21.270> birds<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.869> their<00:00:22.109> cutting

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
about these birds is their cutting

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.089 
about these birds is their cutting
efficiency<00:00:23.310> they're<00:00:23.670> very<00:00:24.000> easy<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.689> identify

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
efficiency they're very easy to identify

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.500 
efficiency they're very easy to identify
we<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.250> our<00:00:26.430> markings<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.300> two

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
we have our markings up here at two

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.519 
we have our markings up here at two
three<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.019> four

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
three and four

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.130 
three and four
and<00:00:28.619> that's<00:00:29.099> lets<00:00:29.460> us<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.760> size<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.689> even

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and that's lets us know the size so even

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.319 
and that's lets us know the size so even
though<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.250> your<00:00:32.430> slow<00:00:32.790> speed<00:00:33.059> latched

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
though it's in your slow speed latched

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.270 
though it's in your slow speed latched
attachment<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.559> still<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> color

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
attachment you can still see the color

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.670 
attachment you can still see the color
and<00:00:35.430> know<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.940> size<00:00:36.210> gates<00:00:37.170> glidden<00:00:37.380> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and know what size gates glidden you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.000 
and know what size gates glidden you
have<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.450> use<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.530> 32

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
have we are going to use the 32

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
millimeter length gates glidden in this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.680 
millimeter length gates glidden in this
tooth<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.980> our<00:00:44.340> measurement<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> 23<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
tooth because our measurement is 23 and

a<00:00:45.750> half<00:00:45.780> millimeters<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.489> want<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:48.329> able

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
a half millimeters and I want to be able

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.420 
a half millimeters and I want to be able
to<00:00:48.600> use<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.530> full<00:00:49.710> length<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> gates

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to use the full length of the gates

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.150 
to use the full length of the gates
glidden<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:51.600> also<00:00:51.750> come<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.289> 28<00:00:52.739> millimeter

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
glidden they also come in 28 millimeter

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
glidden they also come in 28 millimeter
length<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.940> shorter<00:00:54.210> teeth<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
length for shorter teeth but for this to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.510 
length for shorter teeth but for this to
thirty<00:00:55.739> two<00:00:55.890> millimeter<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.520> appropriate

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
thirty two millimeter is appropriate

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
thirty two millimeter is appropriate
this<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> number<00:01:00.059> two<00:01:00.239> gates<00:01:04.129> tissue<00:01:05.129> there

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this is a number two gates tissue there

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.969 
this is a number two gates tissue there
and<00:01:06.080> then<00:01:07.080> we'll<00:01:07.229> move<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> number<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and then we'll move to the number of

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
and then we'll move to the number of
three<00:01:08.159> gates<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> see<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> can

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
three gates and as you can see you can

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.330 
three gates and as you can see you can
see<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> white<00:01:10.260> right<00:01:11.250> there

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.420 

well<00:01:17.329> number<00:01:17.540> three<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.740> I'm<00:01:21.890> using<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:22.189> number

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
well number three and I'm using a number

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.389 
well number three and I'm using a number
four<00:01:22.670> gates<00:01:22.970> here<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.810> really<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:25.100> larger

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
four gates here and really the larger

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.200 
four gates here and really the larger
you<00:01:25.520> go<00:01:25.700> up<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:25.850> size<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:27.200> more<00:01:27.409> currently

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
you go up in size the more currently

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.429 
you go up in size the more currently
you're<00:01:29.210> gonna<00:01:29.360> use<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.020> you're<00:01:30.200> not<00:01:30.229> gonna

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
you're gonna use it so you're not gonna

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.300 
you're gonna use it so you're not gonna
go<00:01:30.619> as<00:01:30.740> far<00:01:30.950> into<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> canal<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:33.500> I'm<00:01:34.009> really

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
go as far into the canal and I'm really

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.910 
go as far into the canal and I'm really
cleaning<00:01:34.549> out<00:01:34.700> these<00:01:34.880> walls<00:01:35.649> making<00:01:36.649> sure

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
cleaning out these walls making sure

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:47.260 
cleaning out these walls making sure
that<00:01:37.130> there<00:01:37.310> are<00:01:37.399> no<00:01:37.869> pulp<00:01:38.869> horns<00:01:39.170> left<00:01:39.409> behind

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.999 

when<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.420> use<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.929> gates<00:01:49.229> glidden<00:01:49.439> burr<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
when we use a gates glidden burr and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.830 
when we use a gates glidden burr and
this<00:01:50.130> happens<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.609> a<00:01:50.700> number<00:01:50.909> two<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.689> use

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
this happens to be a number two we use

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.169 
this happens to be a number two we use
it<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.200> paintbrush<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.310> very<00:01:53.729> gentle

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
it like a paintbrush just a very gentle

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.209 
it like a paintbrush just a very gentle
motion<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.200> clean<00:01:55.409> off<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.560> sides<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
motion here to clean off the sides and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.050 
motion here to clean off the sides and
the<00:01:56.399> gates<00:01:56.579> glidden

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the gates glidden

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
the gates glidden
are<00:01:57.270> pretty<00:01:57.810> flexible<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.189> in

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
are pretty flexible as you get up in

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.949 
are pretty flexible as you get up in
size<00:01:59.549> they<00:01:59.789> get<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> little<00:02:00.149> bit<00:02:00.359> stiffer<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
size they get a little bit stiffer and

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.169 
size they get a little bit stiffer and
as<00:02:01.109> we<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.649> size<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.369> want<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> move<00:02:02.880> more

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
as we go up in size we want to move more

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.649 
as we go up in size we want to move more
Corona<00:02:03.600> Li<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.709> canal<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> nice

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
Corona Li and the canal but it is a nice

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.600 
Corona Li and the canal but it is a nice
way<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> clean<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.569> coronal<00:02:09.929> portion<00:02:10.379> of

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
way to clean out the coronal portion of

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.180 
way to clean out the coronal portion of
the<00:02:11.610> canal<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.299> you<00:02:12.440> never<00:02:13.440> want<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.739> force<00:02:14.010> it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the canal and you never want to force it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.130 
the canal and you never want to force it
again<00:02:14.549> it's<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.209> paintbrush<00:02:15.629> very

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
again it's just like a paintbrush very

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.920 
again it's just like a paintbrush very
gentle<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.190> smaller<00:02:17.519> sizes<00:02:17.819> have<00:02:18.330> more

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
gentle and the smaller sizes have more

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.720 
gentle and the smaller sizes have more
flexibility<00:02:19.590> now<00:02:20.040> we're<00:02:20.250> gonna<00:02:20.370> introduce

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
flexibility now we're gonna introduce

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.600 
flexibility now we're gonna introduce
the<00:02:21.329> gates<00:02:21.569> glidden<00:02:21.780> burr<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:22.890> opposed<00:02:23.430> to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the gates glidden burr but as opposed to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.030 
the gates glidden burr but as opposed to
the<00:02:23.700> previous<00:02:23.879> case<00:02:24.299> this<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.410> we're<00:02:25.950> gonna

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the previous case this one we're gonna

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.860 
the previous case this one we're gonna
stay<00:02:26.370> much<00:02:26.579> more<00:02:26.790> coronal<00:02:27.299> because<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
stay much more coronal because the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.020 
stay much more coronal because the
canals<00:02:28.140> are<00:02:28.319> tighter<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.860> much<00:02:29.640> more<00:02:29.849> die

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
canals are tighter and much more die

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.610 
canals are tighter and much more die
lacerated<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.810> we're<00:02:31.110> gonna<00:02:31.230> start<00:02:31.440> out<00:02:31.530> with

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
lacerated so we're gonna start out with

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.759 
lacerated so we're gonna start out with
a<00:02:31.680> number<00:02:31.769> two<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:33.180> number<00:02:33.209> two<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
a number two and the number two here and

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:42.270 
a number two and the number two here and
the<00:02:34.890> palo<00:02:35.129> canal<00:02:38.180> distal-buccal

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.420 

mesial-buccal

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.199 

and<00:02:46.030> no<00:02:46.360> no<00:02:46.750> pushing<00:02:47.200> at<00:02:47.290> all<00:02:47.409> just<00:02:47.890> again<00:02:48.459> very

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
and no no pushing at all just again very

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.429 
and no no pushing at all just again very
gently<00:02:49.540> like<00:02:49.689> a<00:02:49.750> paintbrush<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.290> could

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
gently like a paintbrush and you could

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.050 
gently like a paintbrush and you could
see<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:51.069> gaze<00:02:51.280> Clinton<00:02:51.810> flexing<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.790> number

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
see that gaze Clinton flexing to number

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.179 
see that gaze Clinton flexing to number
two<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:55.659> much<00:02:55.930> more<00:02:55.959> flexible<00:02:56.829> than<00:02:57.069> the

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
two so it's much more flexible than the

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.720 
two so it's much more flexible than the
larger<00:02:57.489> sizes<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:58.650> found<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.129> quality<00:03:00.280> of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
larger sizes I found that the quality of

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.880 
larger sizes I found that the quality of
gates<00:03:01.000> glidden's<00:03:01.480> from<00:03:01.750> DENTSPLY<00:03:02.170> my<00:03:02.439> fair<00:03:02.709> or

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
gates glidden's from DENTSPLY my fair or

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.039 
gates glidden's from DENTSPLY my fair or
superior<00:03:03.430> why<00:03:04.120> don't<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.420> try<00:03:04.629> them<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.900> see

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
superior why don't you try them and see

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.069 
superior why don't you try them and see
how<00:03:05.140> they<00:03:05.319> work<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.709> hands
