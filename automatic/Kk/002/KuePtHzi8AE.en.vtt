00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.420 

we<00:03:01.590> grabbed<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.800> double<00:03:02.130> stop<00:03:02.340> 12<00:03:02.670> fret<00:03:07.430> little

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
we grabbed a double stop 12 fret little

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.800 
we grabbed a double stop 12 fret little
simplistic<00:03:08.880> run<00:03:09.210> there<00:03:11.300> little<00:03:12.300> quarter<00:03:12.600> step

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
simplistic run there little quarter step

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.220 
simplistic run there little quarter step
in<00:03:13.640> hammer-on<00:03:14.640> pull-off<00:03:14.670> or<00:03:15.590> not<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:21.750> far<00:03:22.110> we

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
in hammer-on pull-off or not so far we

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:39.309 
in hammer-on pull-off or not so far we
have<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:32.150> double<00:03:33.150> stop<00:03:33.360> toggle<00:03:35.690> blues<00:03:36.690> Bend

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:04:05.039 

so<00:03:47.540> we<00:03:47.659> have<00:03:59.230> that<00:04:00.230> kind<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:01.180> punchy<00:04:02.260> sixth

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
so we have that kind of a punchy sixth

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:11.589 
so we have that kind of a punchy sixth
