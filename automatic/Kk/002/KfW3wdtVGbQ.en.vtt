00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:54.000

Hernfah:  Hey..hey

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.500
Nan:  I hate when girls are doing this. Really don't like it!

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.000
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.000
Hongyok:  Is she beautiful? 
Nan:  Hernfah..are you ready?

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:09.000
Hongyok: She's beautiful right? I can't control myself 
when I'm near her.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.000
Nan:  Hernfah..are you ready?
Hernfah:  Ready for what?

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.000
Nan:  Ready to leave with me

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:20.000
Hongyok: Do you wanna leave? 
Are you gonna leave?
Naen:  Here we go.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.000
Hongyok:  Right, just leave. 
Nan:  I'm leaving. How can I leave you!? 

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.000
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.000

Please excuse me!

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:51.000
Fans: [Cheering] 
(Because HF's holding Naen's hand and off the stage)
Hongyok:  I don't understand why he has to make his lip too red.

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:56.000
Nan:  Well, it's quite a long time that 
we haven't been alone.
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.000
Hongyok: You speak like there is no one's here!
Fans:  [laughing]

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:05.000
Nan:  We can imagine and see everyone here 
as those grasses in Savanna grassland. 

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:11.000
All grasses here and there.... Here and there...Here and there...

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:17.000
Look at that! Even the sky looks like our names 
(There were NHY LED signs hanging around 2nd floor)
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.000
Have you seen like what I saw? 
(Nan copied the accent of the famous narrator 
for leading actress in the Korean drama)

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:24.000
Nan: May I say frankly? I don't like this Korean (accent) 
Hongyok:  Hah??

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.000
Nan:  I'm not good at something's Korean style. 

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.000
Hongyok: Shall we move there.

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.000
Nan:  Won't you say something to me?

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:38.000
Hongyok: What do you want to hear?
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:45.000
Nan:  I want to hear anything that
comes from your heart.
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:49.000
Nan:  May I ask you? 
Are you cheering for boxing match?
Fans:  [laughing]

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:55.000
Nan:  Sorry, I just see there is a hairclip at your neck. 
Let's me move it out for you.
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.000
Hongyok: Should it be there? 
Nan:  Really!? 

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.000
Hongyok:  Well...I'm just confused what you...

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.000
Ah...Sorry. I'm sorry. 

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:21.000
You pulled out my hairclip. Could you put it back for me?

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.000
Nan:  OK
Hongyok:  I've just tried to respond to your gag, 
and then I forgot about it.

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.000
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:36.000
Hongyok: Thank you. 
I will remember this for my entire life.
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:44.000
Nan:  Wowww......she talked like I helped her 
to build a house or dig a pond! 

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:46.000
Will remember it for the entire life!

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.000
Hongyok:  Actually, it is already one year now.
Nan:  Uhm...

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:51.000
Hongyok:  We almost never apart from each other
Nan:  Uhm...

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:57.000
Hongyok:  But...very soon.. I'm going to faraway land.
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:00.000
Nan:  She brings a true story to talk on the stage.

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:03.000
She's going to S.Korea for a month.

00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:07.000
This would be the longest time we won't see 
and stay far from each other 

00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:11.000
Fans:  [Will you miss her?]
Nan:   It..it's fine.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:17.000
Hongyok: Right... It's fine...Remember what you said!!
Nan: They asked me 'Will I miss you'? 
I replied 'It's fine'

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:22.000
Hongyok:  Look!! Even P'Jean will miss me.
Will you miss me?
Jean:  I'll miss you.

00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:25.000
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:30.000
Nan:  Right..
Hongyok:  We lived together for 3 months,
24 hours a day
Nan:  I'll miss you!!

00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:34.000
Fans:  [Cheering]

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:39.000
Hongyok: Actually, I also have something to tell you.

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:46.000
Nan:   I want to stand here to try out how we will feel 
when we stay apart

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:48.000
Fans:  [Exciting] 
(Hongyok just fell into the gap between the main 
and the side stages)

00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.001
Nan:  Will you be able to survive safely to the end? 
Fans:  [laughing]

00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:53.000
Nan:  Oiii...just steal the scene when I try to
speak something sweet

00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.000
What you just saw is a gag she's prepared 
for quite a while.

00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:03.000
She's practiced to walk and fall into the gap. 
And now she really fell as she want.

00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:08.000
Right...there is a song that we want to give to you all

00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:12.000
Stand firmly, will you? That's all I ask
