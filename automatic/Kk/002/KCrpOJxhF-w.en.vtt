residential mixed use neighborhood

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.540 
residential mixed use neighborhood
I<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.590> Whitney<00:01:17.920> initially<00:01:18.430> you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
I think the Whitney initially you

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.810 
I think the Whitney initially you
symbolize<00:01:19.530> Detroit<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.310> abandonment

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
symbolize Detroit and the abandonment

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.900 
symbolize Detroit and the abandonment
that<00:01:22.120> happened<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.830> know<00:01:23.920> 20<00:01:24.250> 30<00:01:24.280> years<00:01:24.730> ago

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
that happened you know 20 30 years ago

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.420 
that happened you know 20 30 years ago
and<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.570> now<00:01:26.050> it<00:01:26.200> symbolizes<00:01:26.860> its<00:01:27.040> rebirth

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
and and now it symbolizes its rebirth

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.969 
and and now it symbolizes its rebirth
and<00:01:27.670> renovation<00:01:28.210> especially<00:01:28.750> in<00:01:29.020> realization

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
and renovation especially in realization

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.200 
and renovation especially in realization
in<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.250> area<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:32.110> going<00:01:32.500> from<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:33.210> dark

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
in that area it's going from a dark

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.260 
in that area it's going from a dark
building<00:01:34.479> to<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.960> building<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.440> will<00:01:35.590> be<00:01:35.710> live

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
building to a building that will be live

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.680 
building to a building that will be live
24/7<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.760> kind<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.030> emblem<00:01:43.300> is

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
24/7 I think it kind of emblem is

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.630 
24/7 I think it kind of emblem is
emblematic<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.500> entire<00:01:44.770> comeback<00:01:45.220> what

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
emblematic of the entire comeback what

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.330 
emblematic of the entire comeback what
you've<00:01:45.760> got<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.330> Detroit's<00:01:47.340> phenomenal

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
you've got is Detroit's phenomenal

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.960 
you've got is Detroit's phenomenal
architecture<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.420> grand<00:01:49.780> public<00:01:49.990> spaces

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.920 
architecture and and grand public spaces
on<00:01:51.970> showcase<00:01:52.510> in<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.720> building<00:01:52.990> like<00:01:53.140> today

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
on showcase in the building like today

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.360 
on showcase in the building like today
but<00:01:54.170> what's<00:01:54.380> more<00:01:54.530> exciting<00:01:54.980> is<00:01:55.100> how<00:01:55.220> we're

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
but what's more exciting is how we're

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.220 
but what's more exciting is how we're
reusing<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.940> in<00:01:56.090> some<00:01:56.540> respects<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.080> was

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
reusing it in some respects this was

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.050 
reusing it in some respects this was
always<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.590> building<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.250> was<00:01:58.370> more<00:01:58.850> dramatic

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
always a building that was more dramatic

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.840 
always a building that was more dramatic
and<00:01:59.540> more<00:02:00.050> important<00:02:00.650> than<00:02:00.890> its<00:02:01.070> reasonably

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
and more important than its reasonably

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.640 
and more important than its reasonably
prosaic<00:02:02.390> use<00:02:02.570> as<00:02:02.780> an<00:02:02.900> office<00:02:03.020> building<00:02:03.380> this

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
prosaic use as an office building this

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.470 
prosaic use as an office building this
wanted<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.160> be<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> big<00:02:04.520> public<00:02:04.850> space<00:02:05.060> this
