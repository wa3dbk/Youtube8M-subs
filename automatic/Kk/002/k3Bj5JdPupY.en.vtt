class in the entire game his gun fires

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.180 
class in the entire game his gun fires
an<00:05:11.030> extreme<00:05:11.510> amount<00:05:12.230> of<00:05:12.380> projectiles<00:05:12.950> in<00:05:13.130> a

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
an extreme amount of projectiles in a

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.250 
an extreme amount of projectiles in a
very<00:05:13.400> fast<00:05:13.700> manner<00:05:13.940> making<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.420> very<00:05:14.870> easy<00:05:14.990> to

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
very fast manner making it very easy to

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.990 
very fast manner making it very easy to
hit<00:05:15.440> somebody<00:05:15.650> even<00:05:15.950> if<00:05:16.190> your<00:05:16.310> aim<00:05:16.460> is<00:05:16.670> all

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
hit somebody even if your aim is all

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.640 
hit somebody even if your aim is all
over<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.720> damn<00:05:17.900> place<00:05:17.930> what's<00:05:18.320> most<00:05:18.500> likely

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
over the damn place what's most likely

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.090 
over the damn place what's most likely
it<00:05:19.370> is<00:05:19.660> but<00:05:20.660> his<00:05:21.140> gun<00:05:21.260> is<00:05:21.410> very<00:05:21.590> easy<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:21.890> use

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
it is but his gun is very easy to use

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.730 
it is but his gun is very easy to use
but<00:05:22.670> the<00:05:22.880> crux<00:05:23.210> of<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.420> weapon<00:05:23.870> is<00:05:24.020> that<00:05:24.560> it

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
but the crux of that weapon is that it

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.760 
but the crux of that weapon is that it
deals<00:05:24.980> an<00:05:25.310> extremely<00:05:26.240> low<00:05:26.540> amount<00:05:27.290> of<00:05:27.440> damage

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
deals an extremely low amount of damage

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.070 
deals an extremely low amount of damage
so<00:05:27.860> even<00:05:28.130> though<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:28.370> may<00:05:28.760> fire<00:05:29.150> you<00:05:29.990> know

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
so even though you may fire you know

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.570 
so even though you may fire you know
even<00:05:30.380> though<00:05:30.470> every<00:05:30.740> single<00:05:30.890> bullet<00:05:31.280> of<00:05:31.400> yours

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
even though every single bullet of yours

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.430 
even though every single bullet of yours
may<00:05:31.850> hit<00:05:32.060> your<00:05:32.150> target<00:05:32.570> you're<00:05:32.930> not<00:05:33.080> going<00:05:33.350> to

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
may hit your target you're not going to

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.800 
may hit your target you're not going to
take<00:05:33.560> them<00:05:33.800> down<00:05:33.830> his<00:05:34.190> gun<00:05:34.430> is<00:05:34.750> essentially<00:05:35.750> a

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
take them down his gun is essentially a

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.260 
take them down his gun is essentially a
suppression<00:05:36.560> weapon<00:05:37.160> it's<00:05:37.520> not<00:05:37.730> really<00:05:38.030> meant

no we're not I know you're used to just
looking<00:06:05.780> at<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> person<00:06:06.350> in<00:06:06.470> a<00:06:06.590> first-person

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
looking at a person in a first-person

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.610 
looking at a person in a first-person
shooter<00:06:07.610> and<00:06:07.640> them<00:06:07.940> dropping<00:06:08.510> dead<00:06:08.690> whether

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
shooter and them dropping dead whether

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.100 
shooter and them dropping dead whether
or<00:06:09.770> not<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:09.980> actually<00:06:10.130> pull<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.760> trigger

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
or not you actually pull the trigger

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.450 
or not you actually pull the trigger
unfortunately<00:06:12.110> that<00:06:12.320> is<00:06:12.470> not<00:06:12.800> the<00:06:12.860> case<00:06:13.130> when

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
unfortunately that is not the case when

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.550 
unfortunately that is not the case when
it<00:06:13.490> comes<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:14.030> plants<00:06:14.390> vs.<00:06:14.750> zombies<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.110> time<00:06:15.410> to

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
it comes to plants vs. zombies a time to

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.380 
it comes to plants vs. zombies a time to
kill<00:06:15.740> is<00:06:15.890> actually<00:06:16.610> pretty<00:06:16.850> long<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.240> guess

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
kill is actually pretty long I guess

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.720 
kill is actually pretty long I guess
that<00:06:17.540> would<00:06:17.660> equate<00:06:17.840> it<00:06:18.050> to<00:06:18.080> maybe<00:06:18.980> a<00:06:19.130> Halo

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 
that would equate it to maybe a Halo

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.490 
that would equate it to maybe a Halo
game<00:06:19.760> but<00:06:20.480> you<00:06:20.570> also<00:06:20.750> add<00:06:20.990> on<00:06:21.110> top<00:06:21.320> of<00:06:21.440> that

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
game but you also add on top of that

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.170 
game but you also add on top of that
actually<00:06:21.890> having<00:06:22.070> to<00:06:22.370> lead<00:06:22.610> your<00:06:22.820> bullet<00:06:23.060> to

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
actually having to lead your bullet to

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.090 
actually having to lead your bullet to
the<00:06:23.270> target<00:06:23.660> which<00:06:24.050> makes<00:06:24.320> it<00:06:24.530> that<00:06:24.830> much<00:06:25.040> more

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
the target which makes it that much more

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.910 
the target which makes it that much more
difficult<00:06:25.730> to<00:06:26.150> take<00:06:26.330> somebody<00:06:26.720> out<00:06:26.780> and<00:06:27.140> also

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
difficult to take somebody out and also

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.860 
difficult to take somebody out and also
if<00:06:28.160> you<00:06:28.430> actually<00:06:28.580> encounter<00:06:29.180> two<00:06:29.360> people<00:06:29.720> the

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
if you actually encounter two people the

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.660 
if you actually encounter two people the

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
chances of you surviving two people

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.700

attacking<00:06:32.090> you<00:06:32.180> at<00:06:32.330> once<00:06:32.540> is<00:06:32.720> pretty<00:06:33.500> damn

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
attacking you at once is pretty damn

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.920 
attacking you at once is pretty damn
slim<00:06:34.090> slimmer<00:06:35.090> than<00:06:35.270> you<00:06:35.420> getting<00:06:35.630> a<00:06:35.720> girl's
