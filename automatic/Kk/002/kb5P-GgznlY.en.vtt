00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.780
 Hey, everyone on the channel, I'm fine. 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.509
 testing one more type of marmorato 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.800
 marbled effect you have here in 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:24.980
 market of the part of artistic painting 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.099
 which is for making room decorations 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.070
 most exquisite rooms are 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:35.809
 products for decoration until the speedy 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.570
 already has a video of the dead sea 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:43.400
 except that from another manufacturer this is the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.340
 test of a manufacturer that happened here 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.360
 in black stream and wanted to test to see 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.360
 How does it work? 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:34.330
 here we are in the second coat of the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.989
 marbled to see how he is 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.670
 because the company is 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:48.660
 information that polishing is not 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.769
 made by a policewoman, but by the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.200
 stainless steel trowel which is 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.569
 Used to do it here in the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.299
 second hand 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:07.510
 I see that it is already giving an appearance 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:11.099
 more valued but there is still 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:16.629
 third of bad as the product yielded 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:20.410
 Quite a lot I'm going to give up the fourth hand 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:24.840
 to see how the process works is the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.840
 same wall has to okay but yada sanded 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.450
 taboo 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.840
 preferably the premium acrylic background 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.140
 the company has to use a first 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.010
 from what I saw the first is equivalent 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.050
 to a matte acrylic of any brand 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.379
 to be resistant to attraction that 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.840
 stainless steel trough goes in faith is 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.569
 a spatula take out all the powder 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.489
 a standard trowel a trowel 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.920
 stainless steel with rounded corners 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.569
 which is used to make the marble effect 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.569
 in any of them 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.230

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.709

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.000
