the principles I mean I'm a
defensive-minded<00:01:43.020> player<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> think

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
defensive-minded player and I think

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.700 
defensive-minded player and I think
that's<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.399> great<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:45.509> us<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:46.110> just

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that's going to be great for us to just

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.840 
that's going to be great for us to just
have<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.100> attention<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.430> detail<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
have more attention to detail the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
have more attention to detail the
defensive<00:01:48.270> end<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.840> offensively<00:01:49.229> we're

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
defensive end you know offensively we're

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
defensive end you know offensively we're
one<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> best<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.390> defense<00:01:51.840> will<00:01:51.960> be

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
one of the best you know defense will be

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
one of the best you know defense will be
I<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.530> takes<00:01:52.680> more<00:01:52.829> focus<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
I just think it takes more focus and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.859 
I just think it takes more focus and
energy<00:01:53.610> from<00:01:53.970> us<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
energy from us because we have the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.719 
energy from us because we have the
talent<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.680> effective<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> defensive

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
talent to be effective on the defensive

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.280 
talent to be effective on the defensive
end<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.079> bit<00:01:58.170> more

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
end so you know just a little bit more

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.850 
end so you know just a little bit more
attention<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.619> detail

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
attention to detail

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.380 
attention to detail
deal<00:02:00.070> out<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.400> change<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.790> system<00:02:01.150> change

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
deal out of the change in system change

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
of terminology things event as a player

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.860 
of terminology things event as a player
how<00:02:03.610> much<00:02:03.850> um<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:05.530> don't<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.820> mean<00:02:07.330> any<00:02:07.600> time<00:02:07.750> you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
how much um I don't I mean any time you

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.240 
how much um I don't I mean any time you
have<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.020> new<00:02:08.140> coach<00:02:08.289> it's<00:02:08.649> it's<00:02:08.860> going<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.100> be<00:02:09.220> a

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
have a new coach it's it's going to be a

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.950 
have a new coach it's it's going to be a
different<00:02:09.429> situation<00:02:09.700> but<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.330> think<00:02:10.600> with<00:02:10.780> the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
different situation but I think with the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.510 
different situation but I think with the
you<00:02:11.410> know<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.620> team<00:02:11.830> we<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.490> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.250 
you know the team we have and the
veterans<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.480> think<00:02:13.570> we'll<00:02:13.870> pick<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.080> up

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
veterans have I think we'll pick it up

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.530 
veterans have I think we'll pick it up
fast<00:02:14.560> like<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.640> said<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> Deacons<00:02:16.450> of
