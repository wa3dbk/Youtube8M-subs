than<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.140> am<00:00:49.289> probably<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.960> when<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.079> get

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
than I am probably and when you get

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.900 
than I am probably and when you get
close<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> does<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.280> come<00:00:53.460> back<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
close it does that and come back it's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.720 
close it does that and come back it's
picking<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> refresh<00:00:54.960> rate<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> an

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
picking up the refresh rate it's a an

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
picking up the refresh rate it's a an
old<00:00:56.940> CRT<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.719> anyways<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.800> start

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
old CRT so anyways let's go get start

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.670 
old CRT so anyways let's go get start

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
forth everything on the unit does work

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.039 
forth everything on the unit does work
we<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.250> key<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> different<00:01:57.270> different

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
we can key to the different different

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.359 
we can key to the different different
inputs<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:58.829> let's<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> input<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
inputs here let's go to input a and

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.410 
inputs here let's go to input a and
nothing's<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> change<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.090> because

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
nothing's going to change really because

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.560 
nothing's going to change really because
it's<00:02:03.899> all<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> same<00:02:04.259> input<00:02:04.790> but<00:02:05.790> let's<00:02:06.000> freeze

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
it's all the same input but let's freeze

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.820 
it's all the same input but let's freeze
here<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.819> frozen<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.569> image<00:02:09.929> up<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
here so we frozen that image up and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.960 
here so we frozen that image up and
we're<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.190> come<00:02:11.400> over<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.849> we're

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
we're going to come over here and we're

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.850 
we're going to come over here and we're
going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> select<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.599> secondary<00:02:13.110> scene

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
going to select a secondary scene

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.550 
going to select a secondary scene
with<00:02:14.760> our<00:02:14.910> PTZ<00:02:15.480> camera<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.170> see<00:02:16.290> the

with our PTZ camera so you can see the
secondary<00:02:16.980> scenes<00:02:17.370> up<00:02:17.700> we've<00:02:17.970> moved<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
secondary scenes up we've moved the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.320 
secondary scenes up we've moved the
camera<00:02:18.780> there's<00:02:19.080> your<00:02:19.290> still<00:02:19.530> your<00:02:19.890> image

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
that image is still frozen we'll hit the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.600 
that image is still frozen we'll hit the
Go<00:02:23.220> button<00:02:23.300> next<00:02:24.300> images<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:25.100> we<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.280> freeze

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
Go button next images up we can freeze

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.230 
Go button next images up we can freeze
that<00:02:26.790> image<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.760> take<00:02:29.760> control<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
that image and we can take control the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.880 
that image and we can take control the
camera<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.740> we<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:32.010> zoom<00:02:32.220> out<00:02:32.900> see<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.710> hard

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
camera and we can zoom out see it's hard

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.470 
camera and we can zoom out see it's hard
to<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.280> without<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.610> dedicated<00:02:35.880> source

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
to do this without a dedicated source

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.510 
to do this without a dedicated source
monitor<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.140> camera<00:02:38.630> that's<00:02:39.630> me<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:41.340> can

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
monitor for the camera that's me we can

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.940 
monitor for the camera that's me we can
roll<00:02:41.730> over<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.300> now<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.200> am<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
roll over and now there I am up on the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.230 
roll over and now there I am up on the
stage<00:02:44.160> controlling<00:02:44.700> everything<00:02:45.000> from<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
stage controlling everything from the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.950 
stage controlling everything from the
control<00:02:45.570> booth

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
control booth

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.380 
control booth
so<00:02:46.440> everything<00:02:47.340> does<00:02:47.580> work<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.240> a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
so everything does work on it it's a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.510 
so everything does work on it it's a
good<00:02:48.570> little<00:02:48.840> mixer<00:02:49.220> don't<00:02:50.220> have<00:02:50.370> any

problems<00:02:50.940> with<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.709> hopefully<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.950> will

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
problems with it and hopefully it will

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.230 
problems with it and hopefully it will
find<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> new<00:02:53.340> home<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.760> somebody<00:02:54.030> will<00:02:54.120> have
