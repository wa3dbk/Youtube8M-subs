 Halo is spring is coming 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.310

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.649

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.929
 Spring because it is very warm and warm 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.670
 I'm so sunny outside 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.769

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.039

 up and beauty on spring 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.039
 how my make-up changes so much 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.810
 just when it becomes springlike and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.220
 I have my favorites just like that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.410
 I'll pick you out for you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 I would now like to show in mine 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.430
 very often use face and in which I 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 have a lot of joy just when it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.030
 is sunny and warm outside and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.680
 I say with it goes straight much 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.110
 fun with the video I had by the way 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.579
 also bock my passion favorites for 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.590
 to show you the spring time so 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.700
 if you also feel like it then 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.320
 write me the million in the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.390
 comments then I can so as 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.010
 do next video what do I do with 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.629
 I think I start with my eyes 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.329
 because I have three products namely 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.770
 I want to show you I stand in the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.829
 Spring totally on a relatively decent 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.930
 eye make-up which looks very fresh and 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.180
 a few, of course, but also one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.890
 little color and what is special 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.780
 especially when it comes to the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 fresh just seconds, this is really 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.350
 beautiful awake and bright and fresh looks 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.150
 I can give you a white kajal 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.799
 recommend for the waterline and me 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.600
 finally got a customer of the weser very much 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.030
 well I like had you also still 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 asked your recommendations and you have 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.710
 written down to me that the katri school 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.869
 kajal in the fairway 40 white very good 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 he is really good because of times 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.130
 really nice i do not like that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.020
 you 're on the waterline that long 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.670
 Basin must always get one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.680
 place in my whole vein in the eye 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.720
 and then weird out sick 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.280
 and that's why I think that 's very good 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.140
 because a very good color donation have 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 has and the tool simply its effect 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 That I take my eyes awake 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.380
 and looks bright and bright 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.950
 I think that makes my big 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.079
 difference 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.490
 and he is so kind of color 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.259
 I also really like to do that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.860
 Actually, spring players only really 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.270
 then use in spring and summer 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 I also like a turquoise 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.829
 kajal and that is also from patrice too 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.789
 from this cult series 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:12.150
 that's the color 180 before it was pure and that 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.239
 is a real turquoise blue would 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.480
 I say that is easy for the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.950
 waterline really cool so downright 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.599
 blue eyes I find that fits perfectly 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.950
 that's just kind of like that 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.300
 I personally tropical look, the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.950
 do not describe that is just beautiful 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.569
 such a bit of color we have 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.160
 what I do with it I make me 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.260
 either called into the waterline 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.459
 is it a bit more subtle or something 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.590
 I've already done that to myself 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.140
 just to draw a line 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.030
 as above the eyelash wreath above that 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.950
 I also think it's totally cool to apply 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.420
 and that I also like to like it is like that 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.620
 a bit in browns lures him 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.480
 sometimes also the eyes 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.510
 Either I 'm actually changing 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.120
 always so golden between soprano 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.099
 tones or hold more light as I 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.569
 today have on the whole moving 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.760
 lid and if i make you my eyes 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.950
 so he up in those spatial tones or 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.510
 I am using brown shades very much 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.060
 Everyone likes this eyeshadow 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.180
 Manhattan is a multi effect of one 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.290
 and mono a cello and that's the color 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.220
 92 kufra cucino this is a light brown 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.540
 with its light copper impact 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.159
 shimmers very beautiful so is really 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.560
 a shimmer that fits very well too 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.150
 blue eyes I think like him simply 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.010
 I really like it because he is super good too 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.890
 easily blinding and for the neat 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.330
 today he is just perfect for son 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.190
 believing 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.050
 a believing make up easy one can 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.880
 In addition, watch out for a thing 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.950
 especially in spring and summer 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.350
 on cream fast I love 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.030
 just have creamy rouge because of me 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.740
 find just in summer and spring 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.780
 it always does not have to be so dull and 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.400
 hardened face but look 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.440
 it may quietly shimmer a bit like that 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
 Of course a bit of shine does not shine 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.340
 somehow totally finished or shiny 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.320
 Something like that but your skin can do it 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.670
 a little bit yes i'm just one 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.160
 a little fresher if you like that 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.710
 bit dewey and shiny simple 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.120
 And that's where I like climate protection 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.680
 I especially like having one here 3 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.950
 brought the actually use 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.959
 constantly two are from maybelline jade 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.130
 I think that's exactly like green touch 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.350
 I already have meat for you 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.000
 shown several times once I have the 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.670
 color only two and then I still have 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.380
 the color I think that is the 04 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.290
 I think there are only these 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.850
 two colors are basically very much 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.130
 like that one is a bit more 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.390
 he's a little bit pitty pink 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.710
 I think there really is only this 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.050
 I still have two colors 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.250
 I have not seen any others but I like them 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.690
 I wish very much from the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.240
 consistency and durability as well 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.500
 today I wear the number 0 2 at 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.390
 I do not know if that's the cheeks 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.490
 Camera performs so well but the 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.580
 just make a totally nice fresh 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.050
 So take care of natural healthy days 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.810
 bit the shiny a bit 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.400
 and that 's just creamy yes 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.620
 the skin just makes the rays so beautiful 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.060
 and I think that's so fresh 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.340
 can be done with the finger like 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.300
 said superreich blending there needs 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.650
 you do not care much 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.390
 So I 'm really just looking at it now 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.500
 very easy on even blinded that 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.330
 no more with a brush or something 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.430
 not really easy and easy 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.050
 she has really nice long and long lasting 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.300
 that I also thinks it's quite good 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.130
 a plastic of essens and i know 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.620
 not to what extent it still exists 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:17.419
 I received sometimes as a trial 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.000
 that looks like this is the color 0 30 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.880
 miss piggy so also a beautiful 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.160
 Cute sound and I like it totally 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.390
 especially for the summer especially here 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.150
 but not so good 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.570
 blind 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.800
 the gossip press is out of may because 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.910
 he is really a bit heavy 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.570
 you have to blindfold a bit 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.530
 watch out 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.660
 he is also much stronger 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.230
 I also like pigmented him very much 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.850
 with pleasure 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.290
 he is a bit cheaper and but 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.150
 As I said I do not know how far it 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.410
 that gives what you can do but also 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.480
 you can just cream yourself 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.980
 blanches themselves make me linked 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.690
 you have a video and the po box 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.000
 I write this to you too 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.050
 how to get as well as the products 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.820
 can then misuse then can namely 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.710
 just in the lip pen and a 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.150
 little bit of his foundation that 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.180
 just mix together and then you have 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.590
 also one of your own cream blanches 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.030
 or do I continue with one 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.370
 product for the bank which I also great 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.740
 great is the benefit team 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.060
 this is the only high end product 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.920
 where I would say that would be me 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.740
 always follow suit if that all 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.530
 although nobody understands it all goes 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.990
 that costs about 30 euros I have 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.520
 invested at that time and I regret it 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.620
 I have not regretted it for a day 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.600
 I think this product is so great that is 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.580
 a highlight there for the cheeks so for 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.230
 the cheekbones, so to speak, I am 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.900
 sometimes for the eyebrow 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.830
 and for my eyes, vegetarians inside 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.620
 is just as good 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.630
 Yes, I just like it a lot 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.010
 little glory places as I said off to 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.600
 see and there I think is highlighter 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.820
 especially in spring and in summer 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.130
 very important and as I said it is indeed 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.320
 expensive but i can recommend you 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.390
 he is just creamy and not 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.250
 Puttrich what I'm good for 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.620
 just a radiant thing for that 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.480
 day and then I have last year 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.550
 still my favorite lipstick for 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.310
 the spring that I chose 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.650
 patrice's is 950 color 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.510
 princess peach from the ultimate canaria 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.600
 that's exactly what I am today 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.530
 wear a beautiful cheesy tone 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.450
 So you see, my favorite color is 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.790
 totally for spring and summer on everyone 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.990
 If that happens, I think so 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.880
 I like the color 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.640
 I really like it 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.360
 orange tones that sound a bit too 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.200
 Neon colors are a bit more 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.840
 bangs because we have a recommendation 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.520
 even more closeness and heavy orange color 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.020
 then let me know that for you 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.510
 lips because I 'm always there on the 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.130
 But I'm looking for the one here already 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.460
 really special so I like that 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.570
 are also like pink again 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.460
 the sound just light up for the 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.930
 spring when liked as s-video 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.490
 friends then still like to give me now 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.080
 a thumbs up and leave me 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.790
 Do you know if you are the fashion favorite for 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.290
 would like to see spring as well 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.000

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.470
