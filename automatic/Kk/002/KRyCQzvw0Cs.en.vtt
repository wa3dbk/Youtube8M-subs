channel<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.640> rods<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.060> usually<00:02:03.390> put

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
channel so with my rods I usually put

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
channel so with my rods I usually put
them<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.350> way

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
them in this way

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.110 
them in this way
believe<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.370> or<00:02:06.490> not<00:02:06.580> they're<00:02:06.790> pretty<00:02:06.970> much

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
believe it or not they're pretty much

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.330 
believe it or not they're pretty much
out<00:02:07.300> of<00:02:07.330> your<00:02:07.480> way<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.630> put<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.190> handles<00:02:09.190> of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
out of your way you put the handles of

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.240 
out of your way you put the handles of
the<00:02:09.369> reels<00:02:09.670> in<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.170> usually<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.740> take<00:02:12.100> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the reels in and I usually I take the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.360 
the reels in and I usually I take the
hooks<00:02:12.840> after<00:02:13.840> I'm<00:02:13.990> an<00:02:14.140> especially<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.920> take<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
hooks after I'm an especially I take the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.880 
hooks after I'm an especially I take the
hooks<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.790> hook<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.120> hooks<00:02:16.300> up<00:02:17.050> farther<00:02:17.500> so

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
hooks and I hook the hooks up farther so

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.230 
hooks and I hook the hooks up farther so
they're<00:02:18.040> not<00:02:18.160> right<00:02:18.610> along<00:02:18.880> your<00:02:19.060> side

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
they're not right along your side

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.670 
they're not right along your side
because<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> they<00:02:20.080> can<00:02:20.230> hook<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
because the they can hook you on the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.890 
because the they can hook you on the
side<00:02:20.890> I've<00:02:21.070> had<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.340> happen<00:02:21.430> before<00:02:21.900> doesn't

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
side I've had it happen before doesn't

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.790 
side I've had it happen before doesn't
feel<00:02:23.020> too<00:02:23.200> good<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.630> then<00:02:25.840> there's<00:02:26.380> anything

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
feel too good so then there's anything

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.520 
feel too good so then there's anything
else<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.070> need<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.310> put<00:02:27.490> back<00:02:27.640> here<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:29.170> that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
else I need to put back here I do that

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.450 
else I need to put back here I do that
and<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.570> usually<00:02:31.720> put<00:02:32.050> my<00:02:32.220> keys<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.430> my

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
and then I usually put my keys in my

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.460 
and then I usually put my keys in my
wallet<00:02:33.820> up<00:02:34.060> here<00:02:34.270> once<00:02:34.540> again<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:35.020> lot<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
wallet up here once again a lot of the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.810 
wallet up here once again a lot of the
cheaper<00:02:35.770> kayaks<00:02:36.130> are<00:02:36.280> going<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.520> have<00:02:36.640> this

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
cheaper kayaks are going to have this

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.000 
cheaper kayaks are going to have this
but<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.360> made<00:02:37.990> sure<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.200> bought<00:02:38.500> one<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.830> had<00:02:38.980> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
but I made sure I bought one that had a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.440 
but I made sure I bought one that had a
couple<00:02:39.310> features<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.850> really<00:02:40.090> wanted<00:02:40.330> to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
couple features that I really wanted to

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.910 
couple features that I really wanted to
have<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.800> I'll<00:02:41.920> usually<00:02:42.070> put<00:02:42.430> my<00:02:43.320> my<00:02:44.320> keys<00:02:44.560> and

my wallet in there at least if not some
other<00:02:50.170> stuff<00:02:50.530> too<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:52.090> basically<00:02:52.480> I'm<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.750> my

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930

kayak<00:02:53.170> now<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.830> I've<00:02:53.920> been<00:02:54.040> paddling<00:02:54.250> for<00:02:54.640> a

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
kayak now and I've been paddling for a

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.490 
kayak now and I've been paddling for a
little<00:02:54.910> bit<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:55.810> good<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.020> get<00:02:56.200> set<00:02:56.470> up

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
little bit so it's good to get set up

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.400 
little bit so it's good to get set up
now<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.480> out<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.750> place<00:02:58.990> where<00:02:59.170> I'm<00:02:59.260> out<00:02:59.350> of

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
now that out in a place where I'm out of

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.949 
now that out in a place where I'm out of
the<00:02:59.560> current<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:01.209> what<00:03:01.360> I'll<00:03:01.450> do<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.630> stick<00:03:01.930> my

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
the current so what I'll do is stick my

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.770 
the current so what I'll do is stick my
warm<00:03:02.290> binder<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:03.730> underneath<00:03:04.270> there<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.690> you

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
warm binder up underneath there and you

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.500 
warm binder up underneath there and you
see<00:03:04.959> I<00:03:04.990> can<00:03:05.050> tuck<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.560> right<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.770> there

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
see I can tuck it right in there

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.640 
see I can tuck it right in there
every<00:03:07.510> kayak<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:07.930> going<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.140> be<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> little<00:03:08.470> bit

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
every kayak is going to be a little bit

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.990 
every kayak is going to be a little bit
different<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.220> got<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:09.580> kind<00:03:09.820> of<00:03:09.880> use

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
different so you got it just kind of use

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.210 
different so you got it just kind of use
your<00:03:10.180> best<00:03:10.330> judgment<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.870> get<00:03:10.989> used<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.410> what

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
your best judgment and get used to what

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.060 
your best judgment and get used to what
you're<00:03:12.400> doing<00:03:12.430> now<00:03:13.709> usually<00:03:14.709> one<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.890> these

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
you're doing now usually one of these

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.470 
you're doing now usually one of these
rods<00:03:15.340> will<00:03:15.610> always<00:03:15.880> be<00:03:16.060> facing<00:03:16.300> forward

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
rods will always be facing forward

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.420 
rods will always be facing forward
because<00:03:16.959> I'm<00:03:17.110> pretty<00:03:17.620> much<00:03:17.830> always<00:03:18.040> fishing

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
because I'm pretty much always fishing

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.229 
because I'm pretty much always fishing

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.960 
when I'm kayaking
I<00:03:19.390> hardly<00:03:20.350> ever<00:03:20.500> have<00:03:20.860> both<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.430> rods<00:03:21.610> tucked

I hardly ever have both the rods tucked
up<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.320> use<00:03:23.560> this<00:03:23.769> net<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.130> grab<00:03:24.489> anything<00:03:24.820> I
