00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
but for me I don't I don't work by

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.890 
but for me I don't I don't work by

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
paintbrush I suppose this is an analogy

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.640 
paintbrush I suppose this is an analogy
the<00:00:27.520> teams<00:00:28.520> of<00:00:29.090> programmers<00:00:29.690> that<00:00:29.990> over<00:00:30.140> 20

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
the teams of programmers that over 20

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.530 
the teams of programmers that over 20
years<00:00:30.680> of<00:00:31.070> written<00:00:31.460> software<00:00:31.970> that<00:00:32.150> I<00:00:32.239> needed

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
years of written software that I needed

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.160 
years of written software that I needed
to<00:00:32.660> use<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:34.330> millions<00:00:35.330> of<00:00:35.540> lines<00:00:35.720> of<00:00:35.870> code

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
to use the millions of lines of code

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.840 
to use the millions of lines of code
that<00:00:36.470> needed<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.800> be<00:00:36.890> produced<00:00:37.400> and<00:00:37.640> tested

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
that needed to be produced and tested

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.549 
that needed to be produced and tested
the<00:00:38.949> the<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.400> mass<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.269> Technology<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.379> human

the the the mass of Technology and human
ingenuity<00:00:45.580> coalescing<00:00:46.580> into<00:00:46.790> this<00:00:47.110> this

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
ingenuity coalescing into this this

00:00:48.110 --> 00:01:08.190

point<00:00:49.900> ok<00:00:50.900> let's<00:00:51.530> let's<00:00:52.159> go<00:00:55.750> ok<00:00:56.750> so<00:00:56.809> we<00:00:56.989> wonder

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.340 

so<00:01:08.799> so<00:01:09.310> basically<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:11.080> live<00:01:11.259> in<00:01:11.380> an<00:01:11.500> age<00:01:11.650> where

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so so basically we live in an age where

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.980 
so so basically we live in an age where
computational<00:01:14.350> power<00:01:15.060> has<00:01:16.060> overtaken<00:01:16.689> the

computational power has overtaken the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.050 
computational power has overtaken the

don't<00:01:19.119> know<00:01:19.299> how<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.540> feel<00:01:19.990> about<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.350> you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
don't know how you feel about it you

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.999 
don't know how you feel about it you
know<00:01:20.680> but<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.950> reality<00:01:20.979> is<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:23.619> our

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
know but the reality is that in our

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.399 
know but the reality is that in our
daily<00:01:24.280> lives<00:01:24.759> in<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.420> use<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.600> Google<00:01:25.960> in<00:01:26.320> the

daily lives in the use of Google in the

mathematical<00:01:29.440> algorithms<00:01:29.979> in<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
mathematical algorithms in the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.840 
mathematical algorithms in the
background<00:01:30.610> are<00:01:30.729> influencing<00:01:31.539> your<00:01:31.780> behavior

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
background are influencing your behavior

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.710 
background are influencing your behavior
much<00:01:33.850> more<00:01:34.149> than<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.530> imagine<00:01:35.789> so<00:01:36.789> I'll<00:01:37.060> move

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
much more than you imagine so I'll move

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.350 
much more than you imagine so I'll move
on<00:01:37.899> to<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.520> we're<00:01:39.759> controlled<00:01:40.210> by

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
on to this so we're controlled by

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.200 
on to this so we're controlled by
algorithms<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:41.319> this<00:01:42.300> is<00:01:43.300> an<00:01:44.140> odd<00:01:44.289> piece<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
algorithms so this is an odd piece that

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.719 
algorithms so this is an odd piece that
a<00:01:46.240> few<00:01:46.509> days<00:01:47.350> ago<00:01:47.740> went<00:01:48.130> viral<00:01:48.369> on<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
a few days ago went viral on the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.249 
a few days ago went viral on the
Internet<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.299> was<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.479> complete<00:01:49.810> shock<00:01:49.840> that

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
Internet it was a complete shock that

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.190 
Internet it was a complete shock that
was<00:01:50.409> blogged<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.850> suddenly<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.869> whole<00:01:52.990> thing

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
was blogged and suddenly the whole thing

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.949 
was blogged and suddenly the whole thing
went<00:01:53.380> absolutely<00:01:53.679> crazy<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:55.030> this<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.899> a

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
went absolutely crazy and so this is a

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.830 
went absolutely crazy and so this is a
piece<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:56.950> mathematics<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.209> way<00:01:58.479> it

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
piece of mathematics and and in a way it

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.930 
piece of mathematics and and in a way it
represents<00:01:59.500> this<00:02:00.220> moment<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.299> human<00:02:01.509> history

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
represents this moment in human history

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.520 
represents this moment in human history
this<00:02:03.940> art<00:02:04.209> piece<00:02:04.509> is<00:02:04.720> like<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.409> a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
this art piece is like a it's a

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:15.050 
this art piece is like a it's a
welcoming<00:02:06.330> message<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.080> pie<00:02:11.290> generation

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.910 

what's<00:02:15.660> your<00:02:15.810> interpretation<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.770> ma'am

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
what's your interpretation of it ma'am

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.110 
what's your interpretation of it ma'am
what<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.190> think<00:02:17.400> when<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.580> see<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.819> what

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
what do you think when you see that what

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.820 
what do you think when you see that what
do<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.270> think

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.960 

the<00:02:24.670> way<00:02:24.820> it's<00:02:25.240> been<00:02:25.480> talking<00:02:25.720> about<00:02:25.810> rather

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.210 

and<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.690> actually<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.290> piece<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> art<00:02:34.800> isn't

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
and so actually a piece of art isn't

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.740 
and so actually a piece of art isn't
Maya<00:02:35.370> by<00:02:35.550> single<00:02:35.940> artist<00:02:36.300> but<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:36.660> a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
Maya by single artist but it's a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.120 
Maya by single artist but it's a
collaboration<00:02:37.260> between<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.770> whole<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.070> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
collaboration between a whole of the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.640 
collaboration between a whole of the
people<00:02:38.490> with<00:02:39.240> amazing<00:02:39.720> disciplines<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.620> know

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.240 

so<00:02:46.650> basically<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:49.350> damien<00:02:49.800> hirst<00:02:49.980> over

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
so basically that damien hirst over

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.800 
so basically that damien hirst over
there<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> cow<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:53.100> formaldehyde<00:02:53.660> I

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.570 

can't<00:02:57.810> quite<00:02:58.260> see<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.770> algorithm<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.430> that

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
can't quite see the algorithm in that

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.740 
can't quite see the algorithm in that
piece<00:02:59.790> at<00:03:00.090> all<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:03.030> think<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.480> main

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
piece at all and I think the main

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.750 
piece at all and I think the main
algorithm<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.620> damien<00:03:04.980> hirst<00:03:05.160> managed<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
algorithm that damien hirst managed to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.820 
algorithm that damien hirst managed to
play<00:03:05.970> was<00:03:08.420> financial<00:03:09.420> markets<00:03:09.870> actually<00:03:10.620> he's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
play was financial markets actually he's

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.670 
play was financial markets actually he's
more<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.250> financial<00:03:11.490> genius<00:03:12.030> than<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:15.680> cow

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
more of a financial genius than a cow

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.670 
more of a financial genius than a cow
genius

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
genius

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.810 
genius
there's<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.740> massive<00:03:20.010> debate<00:03:20.370> around<00:03:20.670> this

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820

is the birth this piece is called

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.370 
is the birth this piece is called
rejuvenation<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.450> about<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.080> birth<00:03:43.410> of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
rejuvenation and it's about the birth of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.790 
rejuvenation and it's about the birth of
generation<00:03:46.380> PI<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:49.410> death<00:03:49.620> of
