I<00:00:46.129> can<00:00:46.730> tell<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.030> right<00:00:47.300> away<00:00:47.449> that<00:00:47.660> rage

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
I can tell you right away that rage

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.590 
I can tell you right away that rage
spells<00:00:48.710> are<00:00:48.920> going<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.250> become<00:00:49.370> critical<00:00:50.210> that

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
spells are going to become critical that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.960 
spells are going to become critical that
extra<00:00:51.170> speed<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:52.129> going<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.550> be<00:00:52.640> super

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
extra speed is going to be super

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.640 
extra speed is going to be super
important<00:00:53.540> especially<00:00:53.720> for<00:00:54.110> balloon

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
important especially for balloon

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.340 
important especially for balloon
attackers<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.760> get<00:00:56.000> those<00:00:56.239> balloons<00:00:56.690> back<00:00:57.050> in

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
attackers to get those balloons back in

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.590 
attackers to get those balloons back in
and<00:00:57.559> on<00:00:57.890> top<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.430> air<00:00:58.729> sweeper<00:00:59.120> before

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
and on top of that air sweeper before

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.229 
and on top of that air sweeper before
they<00:01:00.050> get<00:01:00.170> taken<00:01:00.409> out<00:01:00.589> by<00:01:00.650> other<00:01:01.010> defenses<00:01:01.640> so

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
they get taken out by other defenses so

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.399 
they get taken out by other defenses so
now<00:01:02.420> we're<00:01:02.600> going<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:02.780> take<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.989> look<00:01:03.199> at<00:01:03.379> a

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
now we're going to take a look at a

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.649 
now we're going to take a look at a
hypothetical<00:01:04.159> attack<00:01:04.519> we've<00:01:04.760> got<00:01:04.940> balloons<00:01:05.300> &amp;

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
hypothetical attack we've got balloons &amp;

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.289 
hypothetical attack we've got balloons &amp;
Dragons<00:01:06.229> moving<00:01:06.620> in<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.820> can<00:01:07.970> see<00:01:08.270> that

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
Dragons moving in and you can see that

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:09.850 
Dragons moving in and you can see that
they<00:01:08.630> are<00:01:08.659> out<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.200> range<00:01:09.440> of<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.710> air

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
they are out of the range of the air

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.250 
they are out of the range of the air
sweeper<00:01:10.280> now<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.580> can<00:01:11.000> see<00:01:11.479> which<00:01:12.020> direction

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
sweeper now we can see which direction

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.410 
sweeper now we can see which direction
the<00:01:12.710> air<00:01:12.860> sweeper<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.370> facing<00:01:13.850> before<00:01:14.270> we

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
the air sweeper is facing before we

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420 
the air sweeper is facing before we
attack<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.080> that<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:15.680> definitely<00:01:15.710> an

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
attack so that is definitely an

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.640 
attack so that is definitely an
advantage<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.270> attacker<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:18.229> can<00:01:18.380> assume

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
advantage to the attacker you can assume

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.370 
advantage to the attacker you can assume
there's<00:01:18.890> about<00:01:19.220> 60<00:01:19.909> degrees<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.780> left<00:01:20.900> to

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
there's about 60 degrees to the left to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.080 
there's about 60 degrees to the left to
the<00:01:21.409> right<00:01:21.500> of<00:01:21.830> wherever<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:22.310> nozzle<00:01:22.940> is

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
the right of wherever that nozzle is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.600 
the right of wherever that nozzle is
facing<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:23.720> now<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.140> know<00:01:24.320> 60<00:01:24.860> degrees<00:01:25.190> is<00:01:25.369> kind

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
facing and now I know 60 degrees is kind

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.460 
facing and now I know 60 degrees is kind
of<00:01:25.729> nebulous<00:01:25.850> but<00:01:26.330> it'll<00:01:26.900> be<00:01:27.050> one<00:01:27.260> of<00:01:27.350> those

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
of nebulous but it'll be one of those

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.200 
of nebulous but it'll be one of those
things<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:27.860> we<00:01:28.070> will<00:01:28.220> learn<00:01:28.370> over<00:01:28.700> time<00:01:28.730> just

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
things that we will learn over time just

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.940 
things that we will learn over time just
like<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.540> know<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.990> range<00:01:30.260> of<00:01:30.410> our<00:01:30.530> rage

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
like we know the range of our rage

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.220 
like we know the range of our rage
spells<00:01:31.370> heal<00:01:31.640> spells<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.210> jump<00:01:32.450> smells<00:01:32.750> so

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
spells heal spells and jump smells so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.080 
spells heal spells and jump smells so
this<00:01:33.410> attack<00:01:33.770> began<00:01:34.130> by<00:01:34.400> taking<00:01:34.610> out<00:01:34.940> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
this attack began by taking out the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.210 
this attack began by taking out the
lower<00:01:35.300> air<00:01:35.810> defenses<00:01:36.350> now<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:36.920> come<00:01:37.190> the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
lower air defenses now here come the

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.520 
lower air defenses now here come the
Dragons<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.420> we<00:01:38.570> will<00:01:38.690> get<00:01:38.900> into<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.320> air

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
Dragons so we will get into the air

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.789 
Dragons so we will get into the air
scenario

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.380 

still<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.979> activating<00:01:47.640> their<00:01:47.819> super<00:01:48.179> now

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
still not activating their super now

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.419 
still not activating their super now
there<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.259> goes<00:01:49.530> its<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.039> grab<00:01:50.250> those

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
there it goes its going to grab those

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.940 
there it goes its going to grab those
dragons<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> push<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.539> power<00:01:51.840> cord<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.590> mean

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
dragons and push that power cord I mean

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.380 
dragons and push that power cord I mean
at<00:01:53.069> first<00:01:53.280> glance<00:01:53.609> it<00:01:53.880> doesn't<00:01:54.240> seem<00:01:54.359> like

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
at first glance it doesn't seem like

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
at first glance it doesn't seem like
that<00:01:54.569> big<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> deal<00:01:55.289> i<00:01:55.350> mean<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.709> doesn't<00:01:56.009> do

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that big of a deal i mean it doesn't do

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
that big of a deal i mean it doesn't do
any<00:01:56.429> damage<00:01:56.789> just<00:01:57.450> kind<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> fans<00:01:58.049> them<00:01:58.319> in<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
any damage just kind of fans them in the

to make a big difference in an attack

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.759 
to make a big difference in an attack
and<00:02:12.000> finally<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> attacker<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:13.260> drop<00:02:13.620> the

and<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.530> see<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.829> took<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> long<00:02:17.400> time<00:02:17.459> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
and you can see it took a long time to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.420 
and you can see it took a long time to

arrow right there in the difference is

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.680 
arrow right there in the difference is

attack a one-star attitude start now

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.289

we're<00:02:27.959> going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.200> move<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.530> another

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
but facing ground and expose so the

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.490 
but facing ground and expose so the
units<00:02:33.819> will<00:02:33.909> be<00:02:33.970> able<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.329> get<00:02:34.480> in<00:02:34.659> further<00:02:35.019> but

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
units will be able to get in further but

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.140 
units will be able to get in further but
what<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.709> want<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.099> take<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> closer<00:02:36.579> look<00:02:36.790> at

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
what I want to take a closer look at

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.300 
what I want to take a closer look at
here<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.780> remember<00:02:38.349> when<00:02:38.560> we<00:02:38.709> were<00:02:38.829> setting<00:02:39.099> up

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
here is remember when we were setting up

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.190 
here is remember when we were setting up
the<00:02:39.459> air<00:02:39.610> sweeper<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.689> settings

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
the air sweeper that the settings

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.490 
the air sweeper that the settings
covered<00:02:41.709> about<00:02:42.299> 120<00:02:43.299> degrees<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.959> coverage

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
covered about 120 degrees of coverage

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.740 
covered about 120 degrees of coverage
but<00:02:44.950> you'll<00:02:45.099> notice<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.610> plastic<00:02:46.239> air<00:02:46.480> that

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
but you'll notice the plastic air that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.950 
but you'll notice the plastic air that
comes<00:02:46.900> out<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.530> much<00:02:47.860> smaller<00:02:48.340> than

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
comes out is much smaller than

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.990 
comes out is much smaller than
so<00:02:50.320> finally<00:02:50.710> what<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.010> does<00:02:51.310> know<00:02:51.520> if<00:02:51.700> you

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
so finally what it does know if you

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.540 
so finally what it does know if you
right<00:02:54.000> there<00:02:54.270> much<00:02:54.959> less<00:02:55.290> than<00:02:55.440> 120<00:02:55.860> even<00:02:56.340> less

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
right there much less than 120 even less

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.059 
right there much less than 120 even less
than<00:02:56.760> 90<00:02:57.120> degrees<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.380> such<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.590> small

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
than 90 degrees so with such a small

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.430 
than 90 degrees so with such a small
area<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.940> air<00:03:00.090> sweeper<00:03:00.599> effects<00:03:00.989> at<00:03:01.230> any

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
area that the air sweeper effects at any

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.309 
area that the air sweeper effects at any
given<00:03:01.980> time<00:03:02.599> distracting<00:03:03.599> an<00:03:03.720> air<00:03:03.900> sweeper

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
given time distracting an air sweeper

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.280 
given time distracting an air sweeper
might<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> key<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.340> offense<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.140> like

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
might be a key to offense now just like

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.050 
might be a key to offense now just like
in<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> first<00:03:07.830> attack<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.340> attacker<00:03:08.430> takes

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
in the first attack the attacker takes

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.520 
in the first attack the attacker takes
out<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.270> second<00:03:09.870> air<00:03:09.959> defense<00:03:10.290> with

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
out that second air defense with

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.650 
out that second air defense with
lightning<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.370> let's<00:03:11.550> watch<00:03:11.790> closely<00:03:12.270> as

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
lightning but let's watch closely as

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.330 
lightning but let's watch closely as
these<00:03:12.870> dragons<00:03:13.350> are<00:03:13.500> again<00:03:13.739> deployed<00:03:14.130> at<00:03:14.280> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
these dragons are again deployed at the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.850 
these dragons are again deployed at the
bottom<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.940> screen<00:03:15.150> lower<00:03:15.900> right<00:03:16.260> there

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
bottom of the screen lower right there

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.790 
bottom of the screen lower right there
it<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.130> air<00:03:17.550> sweeper<00:03:18.060> blasts<00:03:18.690> air<00:03:18.870> at<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.440> one

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
it is air sweeper blasts air at that one

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.460 
it is air sweeper blasts air at that one
dragon<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.940> pushes<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.540> just<00:03:21.989> out<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.349> its

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
dragon but it pushes it just out of its

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.340 
dragon but it pushes it just out of its
range<00:03:22.739> right<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.480> will<00:03:24.750> cause<00:03:25.050> the

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
range right here and that will cause the

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.620 
range right here and that will cause the
air<00:03:25.470> sweeper<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.010> retarget<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.970> another

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
air sweeper to retarget on another

air sweeper to retarget on another
dragon<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.709> distracting<00:03:29.580> an<00:03:29.670> air<00:03:29.819> sweeper<00:03:30.209> is

dragon so distracting an air sweeper is

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.570 
dragon so distracting an air sweeper is
not<00:03:30.540> going<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.959> be<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.110> simple<00:03:31.650> task<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:32.250> is

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
not going to be a simple task it is

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.130 
not going to be a simple task it is
definitely<00:03:32.880> going<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.480> take<00:03:33.690> some<00:03:33.870> practice

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
definitely going to take some practice

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.590 
definitely going to take some practice
to<00:03:34.530> figure<00:03:34.830> out<00:03:34.980> exactly<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.700> best<00:03:36.000> methods
