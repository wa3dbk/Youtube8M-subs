00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
works and the USDA has been trying to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
works and the USDA has been trying to
get<00:00:29.820> kids<00:00:30.029> into<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> game<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:31.050> long<00:00:31.170> time

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
get kids into the game for a long time

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.560 
get kids into the game for a long time
but<00:00:32.220> you<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.520> kids<00:00:32.850> are<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.180> successful

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
but you know kids are not successful

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.270 
but you know kids are not successful
when<00:00:33.990> they<00:00:34.140> put<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:34.590> real<00:00:34.770> court<00:00:35.100> but

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
when they put it on the real court but

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.920 
when they put it on the real court but
big<00:00:35.460> rackets<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.120> they're<00:00:36.300> little

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
big rackets when they're little

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
big rackets when they're little
so<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.740> quick<00:00:38.010> start<00:00:38.220> tennis<00:00:38.670> well<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.240> think

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so this quick start tennis well I think

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.530 
so this quick start tennis well I think
enable<00:00:40.170> two<00:00:40.320> kids<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:41.790> give<00:00:42.270> kids<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
enable two kids to give kids the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.750 
enable two kids to give kids the
opportunity<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.500> successful<00:00:44.070> from<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
opportunity to be successful from the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.520 
opportunity to be successful from the
get-go<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.540> hopefully<00:00:46.080> will<00:00:46.200> keep<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.470> in

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
get-go and hopefully will keep them in

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
get-go and hopefully will keep them in
the<00:00:46.650> game<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.310> really<00:00:47.550> does<00:00:47.850> make<00:00:48.090> sense

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the game so it really does make sense

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.210

on an oversized court basically what it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.120 
on an oversized court basically what it

looks like to real to small kids so we
played<00:00:59.310> with<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.490> big<00:00:59.670> racket<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.180> couldn't

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
hold the racket with one hand barely put

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.640 
hold the racket with one hand barely put
in<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.220> foreign<00:01:02.610> 200<00:01:03.060> back<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.600> okay<00:01:03.900> then

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
in a foreign 200 back and was okay then

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
in a foreign 200 back and was okay then
that<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.189> high<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.030> far<00:01:06.299> away<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that was so high it was so far away it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
that was so high it was so far away it
was<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> child<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.250> technique<00:01:08.609> goes<00:01:08.820> out

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
was a child and the technique goes out

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.069 
was a child and the technique goes out
the<00:01:09.119> window<00:01:09.149> because<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.869> trying<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
the window because you just trying to

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.660 
the window because you just trying to
voice<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.500> big<00:01:10.710> thing<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.340> sure<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
voice this big thing and make sure that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.539 
voice this big thing and make sure that
the<00:01:11.789> ball<00:01:11.969> can<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.179> over<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.539> net<00:01:12.719> so<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:14.130> makes

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the ball can go over the net so it makes

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.099 
the ball can go over the net so it makes
sense<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.179> many<00:01:15.240> levels<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.079> think

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
sense on so many levels and I think

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.929 
sense on so many levels and I think
it'll<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.500> great<00:01:16.619> because<00:01:16.859> kids<00:01:17.250> will<00:01:17.460> be

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it'll be great because kids will be

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
it'll be great because kids will be
successful<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.200> first<00:01:19.530> are

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
successful when they first are

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.240 
successful when they first are
introduced<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.280> game

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
introduced to the game

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.310 
introduced to the game
then<00:01:21.400> don't<00:01:21.550> stay<00:01:21.820> with<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.360> tennis<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.290> a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.840 
then don't stay with it and tennis is a

to try the game in the first place but

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.140 
to try the game in the first place but
then<00:01:45.100> because<00:01:45.430> they're<00:01:45.760> not<00:01:45.940> successful

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
then because they're not successful

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.670 
then because they're not successful
they're<00:01:46.750> not<00:01:46.840> going<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.020> stay<00:01:47.229> with<00:01:47.410> it<00:01:47.440> you

it's<00:01:55.450> impossible<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.380> think<00:01:56.649> with<00:01:56.800> star

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
it's impossible so I think with star

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.730 
it's impossible so I think with star

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
game because they're playing not because

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600

drawer<00:02:35.280> one<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.790> back<00:02:35.910> ends<00:02:36.240> as<00:02:36.330> well

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
drawer one and it back ends as well

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.790 
drawer one and it back ends as well

yeah<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.590> mean<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.070> started<00:02:53.310> with

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
yeah and you know I mean I started with

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.070 
yeah and you know I mean I started with
a<00:02:53.610> two<00:02:53.790> hundred<00:02:53.880> bike<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.510> switched<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.870> one

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
a two hundred bike and I switched to one

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.410 
a two hundred bike and I switched to one
anyone<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.590> was<00:02:55.709> nine<00:02:55.890> years<00:02:56.010> old<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.640> it

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
anyone that was nine years old and it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.880 
anyone that was nine years old and it
was<00:02:57.450> difficult<00:02:57.780> back<00:02:58.110> because<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.590> mean<00:02:58.770> there

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
was difficult back because I mean there

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.470 
was difficult back because I mean there
was<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.010> certain<00:02:59.340> slightly<00:02:59.760> smaller<00:03:00.030> racket

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
was a certain slightly smaller racket

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.060 
was a certain slightly smaller racket
but<00:03:00.660> still<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.020> was<00:03:01.110> way<00:03:01.260> too<00:03:01.320> big<00:03:01.650> for<00:03:01.680> one

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
but still it was way too big for one

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.510 
but still it was way too big for one
handsome<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:03.209> one<00:03:03.360> hand<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.660> wasn't<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.050> good

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
handsome the one hand it wasn't so good

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.360 
handsome the one hand it wasn't so good
and<00:03:05.690> now<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.720> think<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.380> will<00:03:07.560> see<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> lot<00:03:08.160> more

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
and now I think you will see a lot more

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.370 
and now I think you will see a lot more
variety<00:03:08.520> better<00:03:09.330> technique<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.080> better

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
variety better technique and better
