00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
lined up right there

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.469 
lined up right there
there<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.350> times<00:01:46.680> I've<00:01:47.009> read<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:48.360> work

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
there are times I've read this can work

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.030 
there are times I've read this can work
itself<00:01:48.869> loose<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
itself loose a little bit and then the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590 
itself loose a little bit and then the
contacts<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> inside<00:01:50.820> don't<00:01:51.270> work<00:01:51.420> too

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
contacts on the inside don't work too

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.359 
contacts on the inside don't work too
well<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.590> important<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.189> make

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
well so it's important that you make

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.940 
well so it's important that you make
sure<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.649> all<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
sure that you have that in there all the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.510 
sure that you have that in there all the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
way and completely lined up so then

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
way and completely lined up so then
there's<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.540> switch<00:02:01.250> yep<00:02:02.250> three<00:02:02.850> LEDs<00:02:03.240> all

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
there's the on switch yep three LEDs all

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.760 
there's the on switch yep three LEDs all

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
in the a to bracket so let's go outside

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.020 
in the a to bracket so let's go outside
and<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:48.519> install<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.750> handle<00:02:52.049> okay<00:02:54.030> so

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
and I will install the handle okay so

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.970 
and I will install the handle okay so
I'm<00:02:55.150> going<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.390> start<00:02:55.569> off<00:02:55.660> with<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.930> b2<00:02:56.470> bracket

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
I'm going to start off with a b2 bracket

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.210 
I'm going to start off with a b2 bracket
and<00:02:58.110> I'm<00:02:59.110> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.350> put<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.830> somewhere<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.160> the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
and I'm going to put it somewhere in the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.809 
and I'm going to put it somewhere in the
center<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.850> as<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.959> rotate<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:02.530> around<00:03:02.819> you

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
center and as you rotate this around you

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.199 
center and as you rotate this around you
can<00:03:04.000> feel<00:03:04.420> where<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.110> bites<00:03:05.380> in<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.670> I

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
can feel where I just like bites in so I

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.699 
can feel where I just like bites in so I
could<00:03:07.540> probably<00:03:07.690> get<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> tape<00:03:08.110> measurer<00:03:08.470> but

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
could probably get a tape measurer but

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.850 
could probably get a tape measurer but
that's<00:03:09.580> just<00:03:09.700> my<00:03:09.880> quick<00:03:10.060> way<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.360> measuring

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that's just my quick way of measuring

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.949 
that's just my quick way of measuring
use<00:03:11.860> my<00:03:12.010> finger<00:03:12.250> there<00:03:12.400> get<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.819> guide<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.780> I'm

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
use my finger there get a guide so I'm

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.250 
use my finger there get a guide so I'm
pretty<00:03:14.110> well<00:03:14.319> centered<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.010> then<00:03:15.850> this<00:03:16.260> b1

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
pretty well centered and then this b1

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.979 
pretty well centered and then this b1
bracket<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:19.150> can<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.510> where<00:03:19.690> these<00:03:19.810> little

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
bracket you can see where these little

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.490 
bracket you can see where these little
clips<00:03:20.380> go<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.769> back<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:22.989> pushes

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
clips go in the back and that pushes

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.699 
clips go in the back and that pushes
down<00:03:23.680> on<00:03:23.739> there<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.840> there<00:03:25.989> is<00:03:26.109> room<00:03:26.260> for<00:03:26.380> two

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
down on there so there is room for two

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.930 
down on there so there is room for two
screws<00:03:27.160> underneath<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.890> just<00:03:30.790> have<00:03:30.910> a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
screws underneath and I just have a

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.690 
screws underneath and I just have a
little<00:03:31.150> tray<00:03:31.359> here<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:32.680> two<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.430> silver

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
little tray here with two of the silver

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:44.010 
little tray here with two of the silver
screws<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.650> those<00:03:35.980> go<00:03:36.430> on<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.350> bottom

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
the screws turned a little too hard for

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.250 
the screws turned a little too hard for
that<00:04:43.060> small<00:04:43.270> scooter<00:04:43.630> or<00:04:43.720> something<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.080> little

more<00:04:44.350> torque<00:04:44.620> with<00:04:44.770> this<00:04:44.920> so<00:04:45.730> I<00:04:46.090> use<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:46.720> I

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
more torque with this so I use this I

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.630 
more torque with this so I use this I
finish<00:04:47.140> tighten<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:47.500> up<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:48.160> now<00:04:48.280> I'm<00:04:48.430> ready
