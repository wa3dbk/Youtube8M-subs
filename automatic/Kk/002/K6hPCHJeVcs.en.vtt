00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.539
 Well, here I am making a new 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.370
 test in this case I do not know if today 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:24.390
 I will see it coming out I tackled it 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.600
 of the tube this little one that is in the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.270
 end of the oven 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.270
 it's for the steam gas outlet 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.270
 and so that it also has a small shot 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:44.579
 what is the thermometer is about 225 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.760
 degrees more or less 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.860
 and what we are doing is a cake 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.150
 coconut 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.150
 I do not know if it is observed 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.329
 with my reflection, it's a bit difficult 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:06.460
 but it's been half an hour since 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:09.580
 that we have put it and it is another way 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.090
 to cook in this oven 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.310
 it even gets to tarnish the camera is 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.659
 with 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:24.700
 with water that is to say the bain- marie 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:27.509
 and the way to know the needle be in 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.509
 the skewers 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.960
 click 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.960
 and if it comes out dry 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.280
 is that it is ready after half an hour 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.010
 and this is another way of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.860
 cook in this oven as always 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.820
 I leave a little more I like a little 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.850
 toast 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.150
 Well, here it is already 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.750
 the coconut cake or cheated on husband as 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.750
 I call him 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.250
 and just let it cool 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.540
 put it in the fridge and it is preferable 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.750
 eat it a little cold but already each 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.980
 to your taste 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.790
 Well, here we continue with the oven 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.000
 220 degrees I have been a few minutes ago 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.000
 muffin 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.240
 and this 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.200
 it is the result 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.060
 besides these muffins 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.060
 also the coconut cake 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.920
 and a heavy one that I've also done in the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.390
 interval today touches pastry another day 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.709
 touch the other thing and then a little bit more 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.569
 late 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.260
 we will also make a little meat 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:59.880
 Well, I'm going to put 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.220
 another tray of muffins 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.220
 we give it more or less 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.970
 about 12 minutes 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.540
 and about 220 degrees or so 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.540
 It is so difficult 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.580
 it has not gone up quite 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.600
 it also influences a lot what is the 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.550
 yeast flour 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.140
 because there have been times that despite 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.600
 here the eggs mostly eggs 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.080
 be fresh these eggs we are 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.840
 taking from our hen 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.750
 and they are responding enough but only 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.670
 that one of the condiments of falle 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.340
 'the cupcake' does not rise 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.090
 very good because we continue with the tests 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.090
 with the oven
