00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.150
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to a 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.640
 new video I have android in this new 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.650
 video I will show you a small boxing 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.969
 and a small review of a product that 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.880
 it has come to me today from the power bank is 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.550
 a company that distributes batteries 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.460
 external for mobile when we are in 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.590
 case of trouble when we have battery 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.710
 our mobile is just finishing this 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.500
 way we can enjoy our 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.419
 mobile phone having good battery 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.510
 so let's make a small 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:40.030
 unboxing with a boxing something like that by the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.030
 style is not very complicated either 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.000
 of what the box brings in itself 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.630
 company is called as I said before 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.630
 power band 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.980
 I'm going to open the box 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.559
 I have removed all the plastics and 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.200
 that to see if everything was fine everything 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.300
 it was all right and well then that we 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.540
 will bring the whole box the external battery 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.920
 the external battery is 2600 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.840
 milliamps and I believe that today 2600 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.140
 milliamps to charge our battery 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.320
 completely it 's pretty good 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.790
 and it offers us a 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.630
 an autonomy of one thousand charges throughout 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.500
 of bone what the battery holds 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.479
 loads and so that to load it I am still 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.520
 I have not fully charged but there 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.350
 that when it arrives we have to load it 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.380
 before loading our device 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.450
 mobile and it takes I think I read by pages 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.240
 of internet about three hours or so for 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.369
 fully charged we have to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.000
 understand that they are two thousand 600 thousand 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:54.830
 empires and my battery of bq aquarius 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.060
 It has a battery of 2200 milliamps or 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.790
 be that I have an excess of one milliamp for 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.690
 load another mobile device 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:13.190
 well we have here the battery with 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:15.430
 a mini usb port and a usb 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.790
 and also brings this here to be able 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:24.530
 hook to the mobile and also a cable 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.190
 that goes from usb to micro sd and vice versa 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.190
 to remove this 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.720
 and finally brings us some instructions 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.660
 where they answer questions 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.990
 frequent as they can be when 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.580
 we know that the battery of the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.840
 external battery is charged 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.090
 completely and we can use it well 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.550
 Well, I'll show you how it works 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.720
 It does not have much complication for 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.190
 remove this from here 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.500
 and nothing then connect in usb to the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.390
 external battery this to charge the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.970
 mobile and then I'll show you how 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.680
 charge the battery itself because 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.330
 obviously you have to charge this battery 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.200
 as well 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.200
 we connect it to the mobile and we'll see what 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.069
 it's loading 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.819
 to focus the camera a bit 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.060
 it's loading and as we can see 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.040
 or can teach now how to load the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.739
 external battery or to the computer to 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.970
 our computer or an adapter 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.970
 I bring you here 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.250
 of current 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.730
 the stream obviously and the only thing 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.920
 this is offered by a normal charger 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:01.850
 that we connect I will teach and 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:07.300
 we connect the usb to the current or 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.300
 the adapter and this to the external battery 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.240
 to see if I can connect it 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.820
 and this to the battery and so we can 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:22.090
 load from if we do not have a computer what 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.310
 we can load from the current and 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.310
 good for the computer because obviously 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.729
 the same we connect the micro usb to 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.930
 microusb port the external battery and I 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.930
 I go here to see 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.759
 today here he will show us what moments 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.660
 Let's see 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.520
 and we will see that it is lit by the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.160
 from behind a light of red color and this 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.720
 tells us that the battery is being 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.230
 loading and it's not loaded yet 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.260
 completely and when the battery is 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.340
 fully charged will be the 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.490
 led light in blue 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:16.380
 well, nothing meant that it has 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:20.580
 cost 19 euros 17 euros with 80 or more or 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:23.189
 less with shipping costs and is included 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.960
 and nothing I leave the link of the page in
