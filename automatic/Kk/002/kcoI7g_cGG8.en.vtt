okay<00:00:00.900> I've<00:00:01.110> never<00:00:01.380> done<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.010> type<00:00:02.280> of

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:02.750 
okay I've never done this type of

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.230 
okay I've never done this type of
project<00:00:03.750> before<00:00:03.899> I'm<00:00:04.200> building<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.620> dovetail

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
project before I'm building a dovetail

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.849 
project before I'm building a dovetail
log<00:00:06.240> cabin<00:00:06.750> sauna<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.440> I've<00:00:07.529> done<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> little

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
log cabin sauna so I've done a little

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:28.630 
log cabin sauna so I've done a little
experiment<00:00:08.580> which<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.849> trial<00:00:09.330> notch

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.319 

dovetail<00:00:29.640> notch<00:00:31.040> but<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> locking

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
dovetail notch but it's got a locking

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.170 
dovetail notch but it's got a locking
feature<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:35.309> what's<00:00:35.460> called<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.850> locked

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
feature so what's called a locked

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.130 
feature so what's called a locked
dovetail<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.550> it's<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> beautiful

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
dovetail and it's a really a beautiful

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
dovetail and it's a really a beautiful
notch<00:00:40.530> I've<00:00:40.860> never<00:00:41.070> done<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.340> before<00:00:41.520> but

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
notch I've never done one before but

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
notch I've never done one before but
I've<00:00:42.210> started<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.930> learn<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.559> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
I've started to learn how to do it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.310 
I've started to learn how to do it
anyway<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.730> got<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> lock<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> key<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
anyway it's got a lock and a key and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
anyway it's got a lock and a key and
this<00:00:46.829> design<00:00:47.190> says<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.670> everything<00:00:48.239> will

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this design says that everything will

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.260 
this design says that everything will
drain<00:00:48.690> away<00:00:49.190> any<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.579> water<00:00:50.850> anything

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
drain away any kind of water anything

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
drain away any kind of water anything
drains<00:00:51.660> away<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> notch<00:00:53.010> it's

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
drains away and out of the notch it's

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.450 
drains away and out of the notch it's
all<00:00:53.489> slant<00:00:54.110> slanted<00:00:55.110> down<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.829> it's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
all slant slanted down this way it's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.970 
all slant slanted down this way it's
slanted<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.270> way<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.750> any<00:00:58.230> water<00:00:58.559> or

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
slanted down this way so any water or

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
slanted down this way so any water or
moisture<00:00:59.250> gets<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.120> always<00:01:00.329> flow

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
moisture gets in here will always flow

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:16.760 
moisture gets in here will always flow
out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> notch<00:01:15.170> getting<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.259> little<00:01:16.470> better

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
out of the notch getting a little better

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.929 
out of the notch getting a little better
at<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.749 

notice<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.680> lock<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.220> key<00:01:23.430> fit

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
notice this one the lock and key fit

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.460 
notice this one the lock and key fit
pretty<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:25.159> whereas<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.520> over<00:01:26.700> here

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
pretty well whereas the one over here

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
pretty well whereas the one over here
they<00:01:28.470> left<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:28.920> space<00:01:29.100> their<00:01:29.759> feature

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
they left some space their feature

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.719 
they left some space their feature
actually<00:01:30.990> keeps<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.619> log<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.250> moving<00:01:32.460> in

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
actually keeps that log from moving in

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.899 
actually keeps that log from moving in
any<00:01:32.970> direction<00:01:33.619> for<00:01:34.619> example<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:35.220> lock<00:01:35.460> here

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
any direction for example this lock here

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.990 
any direction for example this lock here
cannot<00:01:36.509> move<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.110> way<00:01:37.490> because<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.790> law

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
cannot move this way because of this law

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.330 
cannot move this way because of this law
keeping<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> from<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.380> way<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:41.189> also

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
keeping it from going that way it also

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.920 
keeping it from going that way it also
can't<00:01:41.820> move<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.360> way

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
can't move this way

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.490 
can't move this way
because<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.479> block<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> dovetail<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
because this block in the dovetail is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.010 
because this block in the dovetail is
keeping<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.950> from<00:01:47.159> moving<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:48.329> lock<00:01:48.600> here

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
keeping it from moving this lock here

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.840 
keeping it from moving this lock here
cannot<00:01:49.829> move<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.399> way<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.930> block

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
cannot move this way because this block

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
cannot move this way because this block
gets<00:01:53.850> narrower<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.840> gets<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.409> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
gets narrower as it gets in there so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:08.430 
gets narrower as it gets in there so
this<00:01:56.250> law<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> can't<00:01:56.700> move<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.210> way

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.430 

this<00:02:09.440> lock<00:02:09.679> fits<00:02:09.979> here<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.900> the<00:02:11.900> design<00:02:12.260> like

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
this lock fits here and the design like

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.640 
this lock fits here and the design like
I<00:02:12.560> said<00:02:13.150> keeps<00:02:14.150> water<00:02:14.480> always<00:02:14.810> moving<00:02:15.410> away

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
I said keeps water always moving away

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.860 
I said keeps water always moving away
from<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.430> room<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.910> building<00:02:17.330> see<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.630> comes

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
from the room the building see it comes

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.589 
from the room the building see it comes
it<00:02:18.050> will<00:02:18.110> come<00:02:18.319> down<00:02:18.349> here<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.550> this<00:02:19.760> safe

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
it will come down here and this safe

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.140 
it will come down here and this safe
here<00:02:20.930> will<00:02:21.110> not<00:02:21.290> allow<00:02:21.620> water<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.670> come<00:02:22.940> back

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
here will not allow water to come back

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:35.039 
here will not allow water to come back
into<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.569> cabin<00:02:23.959> it's<00:02:24.380> always<00:02:24.680> running<00:02:24.920> out

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.319 

there<00:02:36.580> that's<00:02:37.580> what<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> coroner<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.180> going

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
there that's what the coroner is going

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.530 
there that's what the coroner is going
to<00:02:38.390> look<00:02:38.540> like<00:02:40.630> locked<00:02:41.630> dovetail
