mechanic and gravity day wasting title

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.750 
mechanic and gravity day wasting title
yeah<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.440> working<00:00:37.649> title<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.430> much

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
yeah it's a working title but it's much

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060 
yeah it's a working title but it's much
better<00:00:38.940> than<00:00:39.120> project<00:00:39.390> gravity<00:00:40.079> make<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> case

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
better than project gravity make a case

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.970 
better than project gravity make a case
um<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.850> gravity<00:00:42.690> days<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.230> sort<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> wake<00:00:43.770> up

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
um in gravity days you sort of wake up

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.709 
um in gravity days you sort of wake up
with<00:00:44.190> amnesia<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.940> don't<00:00:45.120> remember<00:00:45.270> anything

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
with amnesia you don't remember anything

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
with amnesia you don't remember anything
you<00:00:46.260> come<00:00:46.469> across<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.950> black<00:00:47.250> cat<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.730> see

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you come across that black cat you see

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.700 
you come across that black cat you see
in<00:00:48.030> everything<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.989> teaches<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
in everything and it teaches you how to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.369 
in everything and it teaches you how to
completely<00:00:50.280> shift<00:00:50.670> gravity<00:00:51.329> two<00:00:52.020> different

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
completely shift gravity two different

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.130 
completely shift gravity two different
walls<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> insane<00:00:53.520> yeah<00:00:54.059> yeah<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.930> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
walls this is insane yeah yeah this is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
walls this is insane yeah yeah this is
the<00:00:55.320> sort<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.680> thing<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.949> Vita<00:00:56.340> really

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the sort of thing that Vita really

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.200 
the sort of thing that Vita really
brings<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> table<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.870> can't<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.530> this

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
brings to the table you can't do this

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.110 
brings to the table you can't do this
scale<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.480> game<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> 3d<00:01:02.190> s<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.850> don't

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
scale of game on a 3d s you just don't

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.620 
scale of game on a 3d s you just don't
have<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> hardware<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.519> um<00:01:05.630> so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
have the hardware there to do it um so

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.350 
have the hardware there to do it um so
in<00:01:06.750> any<00:01:06.900> case<00:01:06.960> yeah<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.909> shift<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
in any case yeah so you to shift the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
in any case yeah so you to shift the
gravity<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.960> use<00:01:10.080> either<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> gyroscope

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
gravity you can use either the gyroscope

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
gravity you can use either the gyroscope
or<00:01:11.310> aim<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.180> analog<00:01:12.420> stick<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
or aim with the right analog stick and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.780 
or aim with the right analog stick and
press<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:13.799> other<00:01:13.950> button<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.760> will

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
press some other button and it will

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
press some other button and it will
shift<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> gravity<00:01:15.869> completely<00:01:16.439> touchscreen

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
shift the gravity completely touchscreen

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.730 
shift the gravity completely touchscreen
to<00:01:17.310> run<00:01:17.520> um<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.780> that's<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.320> thing<00:01:19.350> i

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
to run um you know that's the thing i

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
to run um you know that's the thing i
don't<00:01:19.979> think<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.580> used<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.360> i'm<00:01:21.509> sure

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
don't think it actually used to i'm sure

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
don't think it actually used to i'm sure

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
touch screen though oh I know but notice

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.630 
touch screen though oh I know but notice
it's<00:01:23.880> always<00:01:24.150> since<00:01:24.299> yeah<00:01:24.509> yeah<00:01:25.310> from<00:01:26.310> what

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
I've been seeing of the e3 gameplay no

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.310 
I've been seeing of the e3 gameplay no
it<00:01:29.850> does<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.210> support<00:01:30.540> touch<00:01:30.840> screen<00:01:31.110> for

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it does not support touch screen for

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
it does not support touch screen for
that<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.740> God<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.340> game<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.329> looks

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.740 
that but God that game you know looks
great<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.710> looks<00:01:34.740> awesome<00:01:35.159> guys<00:01:35.630> better<00:01:36.630> if

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
great that looks awesome guys better if

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.060 
great that looks awesome guys better if
they<00:01:36.869> were<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> title<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
they were like a title on it in that

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249 
they were like a title on it in that
montage<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:39.030> didn't<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.540> titles<00:01:39.930> yeah

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
montage they didn't have any titles yeah

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
montage they didn't have any titles yeah
it's<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.680> many<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.920> montage<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.490> coming<00:01:41.729> out

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's so many you montage is coming out
