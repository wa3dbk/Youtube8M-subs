00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.879
 and good this time we are going to show 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.610
 how to use automotive paste and how 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:13.180
 repair a wooden armchair or how 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.580
 reigned we took some pasta 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.540
 We imbue in a glass or in a 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.720
 flat surface as a blotter there is 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.720
 blue 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.620
 we mix it has to be very good 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.120
 mixed if not it will not get well 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.120
 and when sanding 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.680
 is going to stick a lot waste are addicted 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 and there will not be the right thing 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.380
 have to mix well well well very 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.380
 all right 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.210
 there must be a uniform color 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.910
 may see 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.910
 we are talking 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.240
 this color has to be left 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.240
 My way 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.600
 once we have so we see the hole 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.600
 that we are going to fill in that is this 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.630
 we put it we press well 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.979
 pressed 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.030
 where is it good we give a milestone like that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.400
 uniform 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.890
 so that it is smooth 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.160
 like these that has previously 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.160
 resonate 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.830
 they are completely smooth and they are already 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.830
 far away 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.340
 can be linked with leagues like those 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.930
 they are here they are from mid 20 and at the end 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.810
 it is given with a 320 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.640
 the pasta we use is of high quality 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.290
 automotive we do not use resonator to 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:58.770
 wood as it falls off easily or if 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.450
 one buries the nail cds postilla 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.140
 so that our jobs are 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.140
 professionals
