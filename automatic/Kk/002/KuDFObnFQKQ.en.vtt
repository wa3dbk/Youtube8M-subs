 guys too much at first 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.250
 hour it seems that there are not many people 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.320
 guys so let's take advantage for 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.320
 avoid as if that here six years 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.370
 I hope that 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.580
 with any of you 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.500
 I know that many of you could not 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.410
 attend the game the day so I wanted to 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.450
 share my experience with you what 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.190
 First, all these seats that 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.620
 you are seeing empty will be the tournaments 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.030
 of call of duty from lol and I was impressed 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.130
 very much because one of the days we went 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.140
 very soon to see just this 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.720
 how it was empty and then how it was filled 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.310
 it was something really impressive we did 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.770
 very much the crazy as there was nobody 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.450
 Well, people did not look at it badly or not 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.430
 nothing was happening, everything was fine, right 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.530
 sir light this light has all the flow 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.860
 there was a musician in that place who was 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.560
 let's go awesome and look at the piece 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.320
 of contrast this mid-morning I was 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.020
 already like that, and then even more 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.240
 later there were more people like I tell you I do not know 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.009
 It was crazy, there were people sitting 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.840
 on the ground but awesome the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.970
 contrast of seeing everything empty at first 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.220
 hour and here then I also dancing 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.119
 because what was said, nobody looked at us 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.039
 bad was fun besides all this of 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.569
 the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.769
 with courses the tournaments and all that had 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.439
 a lot but a lot of things to 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.569
 play call of duty remove for a lot 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.010
 of things to prove that one of them already 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.049
 you know I was waiting for her very much 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.129
 and how we really liked that 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.900
 there were so many things to play 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.700
 We were giving a lot but 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.609
 many laps walks we look 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.859
 absolutely everything trying to look for the 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.260
 most epic gameplay of kahlo critics not 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.239
 was going to be maybe from minecraft you think 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.150
 no guys the most epic gameplay of 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.340
 gamers was not minecraft either 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.439
 the minecraft zone was very good and 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.030
 tell you that not everything was fun and 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.590
 laughs when looking for the gameplay 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.049
 more epic because we face 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.609
 some of our most feared enemies 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.819
 that is, it may seem silly but 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.590
 we meet the incredible dubstep 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.329
 whenever he told us not to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.549
 we were prepared I was very afraid 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.799
 that is to say, that cat has something 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.109
 hidden there is planning to master the 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.000
 world like the giant kripper lord 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.500
 there was a giant clipper head and 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.810
 also an uncomfortable sofa the sofa 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.970
 uncomfortable eye huh with him because he can be 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.710
 something very very dangerous or is how you 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.260
 you feel there has no support 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.540
 I feel bad but I did not have any more 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.370
 more enemies and now I do hope that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.530
 you are ready for the best gameplay 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.270
 of every gym gamer on the site where 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.870
 We were more time playing even with 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.870
 subscribers 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.430
 yes yes yes yes I know that is what you are 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.930
 watching is a foosball boy is a game 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.670
 that does not go out of fashion I've played 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.530
 very much to a table football there was an area 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.940
 all full of foosballs and we were 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.120
 playing but a lot of time with 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.190
 subscribers and it was crazy I had it 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.290
 it's super super good guys it's like 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.700
 I went back all my childhood because I 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.720
 agreement to play a lot of table football 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.580
 when I was little 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.620
 sure someone has believed it 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.660
 truth the table football is very good guys 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.910
 but what I was waiting for from 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.260
 event and what I liked the most about playing 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.090
 truth was goal 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.340
 I went back to the people who invented the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.860
 English like me a great game guys 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.720
 They really wanted to try and I 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.550
 he liked it a lot as he was given a gift 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.750
 bracelets with the function that will touch you 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.000
 during the game during the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.100
 demonstration obviously you could not 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.320
 record absolutely nothing but I would 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.810
 I had a great time and I assure you guys 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.190
 that if it continues like this forward because 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.580
 is a game that is still in development 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.710
 I think it will be a good good game over 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.140
 past bone of gameplay graphics 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.400
