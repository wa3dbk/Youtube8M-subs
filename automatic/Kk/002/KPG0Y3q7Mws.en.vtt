00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.980
 very good to everyone what happens this time 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.680
 we are in minecraft in version 1.4 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.289
 point 6 and good as you know they have 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.800
 brought the fireworks in this 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.600
 version 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.150
 Well I wanted to teach a tutorial 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.610
 about creating a reston system 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.860
 fireworks system 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.160
 automatic as you see here are grab 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.960
 the fireworks or street too 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.820
 as they coogan that is one of those that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.840
 more to the gentleman also a little to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.840
 handle a bit with this 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.899
 we'll try it anyway how it's been 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.350
 I have done some tests and for the moment 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:44.879
 what has worked for me and good 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.879
 this is the final result 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.390
 but with many 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.280
 with much more 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.600
 toys obviously later what 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.890
 we will try with many more toys 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 this would be a good result 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.750
 and good if you have given all 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.920
 toys have not yet been exhausted 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.920
 today good this yes 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.350
 I'm going to do one more test 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.320
 and well let's explain how it has 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.450
 done all this I will not create any 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.670
 platform or anything good first thing 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.830
 we need redstone a torch 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.050
 redstone a repeater 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.260
 and a dispenser and a block of 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.260
 stone or stone example 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.860
 and well let's place 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.240
 the dispensers 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.670
 by way of 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.380
 sauteed not only not one but we're not going to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.140
 put four good let's make a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.830
 example with two or we're not going to do it with 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.830
 four also 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.670
 carefully pointed not only we have here 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.020
 next with the we are going to repeat 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.440
 the reston repeaters right behind 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.550
 of each block we are going to draw one of each 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.960
 one and we're going to put them together like this 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.960
 we are going to make a little way here 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.030
 do a little puts here 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.129
 let's do it a little closer 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.069
 we put here another repeater the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.069
 We are going to put redstone here 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.470
 a torch 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.420
 and here rest here we are going to place over 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.420
 a block 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.470
 if a blogger 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.820
 and then we will place a 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.120
 lever that we can find it too 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.120
 here 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.500
 well this will make the circuit 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.500
 activate 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.769
 and that the dispensers are in their 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.769
 its content d 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.300
 it's like here you see here keep casting 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.860
 fireworks I hope we're going 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.030
 to catch them 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.400
 a great 2007 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.400
 let's try them even if it's here 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.760
 and to say good let's try the ones to see 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.760
 How are you 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.940
 and good as you see they go out fires 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.560
 artificial of all 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.989
 now they are not going to continue anymore because 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.430
 are left but it already exploded up 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.000
 and good guys I hope that I have 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.190
 liked the video if they do not understand anything 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.660
 If you do not have something, you can ask 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.430
 the comments and I think it's been 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.430
 pretty clear pretty simple 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.030
 so that this can serve you well then 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.000
 I do not know to decorate a server in the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.550
 broadsword putting him more time than he 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.770
 make more time delaying this 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.960
 and well I'm here coming out in your 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.140
 server in your house where you want 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.760
 put it every so often and well this is 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.990
 one of the thousand ways that there are of 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.450
 do what 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.670
 there are many more ways to do it 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.140
 but well this is a pretty good and 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.560
