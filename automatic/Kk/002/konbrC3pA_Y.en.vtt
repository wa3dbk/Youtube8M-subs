hello guys today we're going to make a

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.920 
hello guys today we're going to make a
quick<00:00:03.000> tutorial<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:04.009> how<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.040> make<00:00:05.850> an<00:00:06.450> alpha

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
quick tutorial on how to make an alpha

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.270 
quick tutorial on how to make an alpha
for<00:00:07.200> sculpting<00:00:07.620> using<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.610> 3d<00:00:08.849> mesh<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.780> this

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
for sculpting using a 3d mesh so this

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.649 
for sculpting using a 3d mesh so this
character<00:00:11.280> has<00:00:11.459> just<00:00:11.490> started<00:00:12.059> working<00:00:12.329> on

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:12.659 
character has just started working on

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:17.060 
character has just started working on
like<00:00:13.199> lately<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.509> if<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.959> can<00:00:16.139> see<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:16.950> on

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
like lately and if you can see here on

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.050 
like lately and if you can see here on
the<00:00:17.190> chest<00:00:17.520> he<00:00:17.790> has<00:00:17.940> an<00:00:18.060> insignia<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.930> I

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
the chest he has an insignia that I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.190 
the chest he has an insignia that I
created<00:00:21.060> using<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.600> technique

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
created using this technique

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.840 
created using this technique
let<00:00:22.290> me<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.590> hide<00:00:22.800> his<00:00:23.010> sub<00:00:23.310> tool<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> can

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
let me just hide his sub tool so you can

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.630 
let me just hide his sub tool so you can
see<00:00:24.030> it<00:00:24.120> and<00:00:24.560> as<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.190> a<00:00:26.310> fairly

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
see it and as you can see it's a fairly

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.000 
see it and as you can see it's a fairly
simple<00:00:27.030> thing<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:28.500> pretty<00:00:28.770> useful

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
simple thing but it's pretty useful

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.700 
simple thing but it's pretty useful
because<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.940> usually<00:00:30.780> if<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.289> sculpt

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
because in usually if you have to sculpt

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.349 
because in usually if you have to sculpt
this<00:00:32.039> kind<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.340> thing<00:00:32.579> manually<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.239> will

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
this kind of thing manually it will

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:35.930 
this kind of thing manually it will
probably<00:00:33.780> take<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> lot<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.199> time<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.039> might

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
probably take a lot of time and might

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.540 
probably take a lot of time and might
not<00:00:36.059> look<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.510> good<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.980> other<00:00:38.100> thing<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
not look as good and the other thing is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.569 
not look as good and the other thing is
that<00:00:38.789> you<00:00:39.449> can<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:40.019> project<00:00:40.679> this<00:00:41.249> shape

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that you can just project this shape

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.119 
that you can just project this shape
anywhere<00:00:42.539> you<00:00:42.659> want<00:00:42.929> and<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.499> will<00:00:43.620> conform

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
anywhere you want and it will conform

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.360 
anywhere you want and it will conform
around<00:00:44.429> the<00:00:44.789> shape<00:00:45.089> of<00:00:45.479> the<00:00:45.929> body<00:00:46.409> which<00:00:47.339> is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
around the shape of the body which is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.569 
around the shape of the body which is
pretty<00:00:47.789> cool<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.960> what<00:00:49.710> we're<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
pretty cool so what we're going to do to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.399 
pretty cool so what we're going to do to
create<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.379> go<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> any<00:00:53.069> 3d<00:00:53.929> app<00:00:54.929> that<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
create is is go to any 3d app that you

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.290 
create is is go to any 3d app that you
want<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.920> use<00:00:56.069> and<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.489> three<00:00:56.789> Maxima

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
want to use and there are three Maxima

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.160 
want to use and there are three Maxima
or<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.109> case<00:00:58.350> blender<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.839> just<00:01:00.839> create

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
or in this case blender and just create

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.750 
or in this case blender and just create
the<00:01:01.889> raw<00:01:02.069> shape<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.950> of<00:01:04.950> the<00:01:05.250> well<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the raw shape of the of the well of the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.440 
the raw shape of the of the well of the
shape<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.920> create<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.450> uses

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
shape that you want to create and uses

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.380 
shape that you want to create and uses
the<00:01:09.570> Alpha<00:01:09.980> so<00:01:10.980> in<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.910> we<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the Alpha so in here and we have this

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.680 
the Alpha so in here and we have this
insignia<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.170> has<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> slight<00:01:14.490> height<00:01:15.420> as

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
insignia which has a slight height as

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.410 
insignia which has a slight height as
you<00:01:15.870> can<00:01:16.050> see<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.680> flat<00:01:17.420> that's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you can see it's not flat that's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.810 
you can see it's not flat that's
important

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
important

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.890 
important
and<00:01:20.770> basically<00:01:21.770> all<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.280> did<00:01:22.430> was<00:01:23.330> create<00:01:23.780> a

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
and basically all I did was create a

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.780 
and basically all I did was create a
plane<00:01:25.960> let<00:01:26.960> me<00:01:27.110> just<00:01:27.380> rotate<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:29.650> then

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
plane let me just rotate this and then

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.460 
plane let me just rotate this and then
expand<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.910> so<00:01:32.120> he<00:01:32.240> has<00:01:32.450> more<00:01:32.960> or<00:01:33.110> less<00:01:33.229> the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
expand it so he has more or less the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.120 
expand it so he has more or less the
same<00:01:33.740> size<00:01:33.800> as<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:35.240> other<00:01:35.810> shape<00:01:36.740> around<00:01:36.890> it

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
same size as the other shape around it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.910 
same size as the other shape around it
just<00:01:37.190> let<00:01:37.550> me<00:01:37.640> move<00:01:37.790> move<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.180> backwards<00:01:38.920> and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
just let me move move it backwards and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.460 
just let me move move it backwards and
as<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.460> can<00:01:40.700> see<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:43.340> idea<00:01:43.610> here<00:01:44.060> is<00:01:44.180> to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
as you can see the idea here is to

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.640 
as you can see the idea here is to
project<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.040> detail<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:47.030> insignia<00:01:47.690> onto

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
project the detail of the insignia onto

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.499 
project the detail of the insignia onto
this<00:01:48.860> plane<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:49.670> just<00:01:49.880> going<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.150> select

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
this plane so I'm just going to select

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.520 
this plane so I'm just going to select
the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.490 
the
the<00:01:51.890> plane<00:01:52.190> hit<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.210> hum<00:01:53.720> wraps<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.350> we

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
the plane hit you and hum wraps so we

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.450 
the plane hit you and hum wraps so we
can<00:01:54.740> have<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.460> bees<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:57.130> that's<00:01:58.130> pretty<00:01:58.370> much

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
can have you bees and that's pretty much

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.610 
can have you bees and that's pretty much
all<00:01:58.730> we<00:01:58.790> need<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.330> we're<00:01:59.540> going<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.900> export<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
all we need so we're going to export the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.550 
all we need so we're going to export the
insignia<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.430> then<00:02:02.390> we're<00:02:02.600> going<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.900> export

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
insignia and then we're going to export

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.590 
insignia and then we're going to export
the<00:02:03.740> plane<00:02:04.040> separately<00:02:04.729> we're<00:02:05.210> going<00:02:05.450> to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
the plane separately we're going to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.270 
the plane separately we're going to
protect<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.080> detail<00:02:06.410> from<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.830> insignia

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
protect the detail from the insignia

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.300 
protect the detail from the insignia
into<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.880> plane<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.709> create<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.740> texture<00:02:10.160> mat

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
into the plane and create a texture mat

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.030 
into the plane and create a texture mat
which<00:02:10.640> we'll<00:02:10.880> be<00:02:10.910> using<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.840> store<00:02:12.380> Hellfire

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
which we'll be using a store Hellfire

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.830 
which we'll be using a store Hellfire
for<00:02:13.250> sculpting<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.870> for<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:17.240> process<00:02:17.540> I'm

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
for sculpting so for this process I'm

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.250 
for sculpting so for this process I'm
going<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.140> use<00:02:19.100> X<00:02:19.760> normal<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.540> bake<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.959> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
going to use X normal to bake the the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.800 
going to use X normal to bake the the
map<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:22.340> let<00:02:22.610> me<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.850> go<00:02:23.060> back<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.360> my<00:02:23.480> desktop

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
map so let me just go back to my desktop

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.650 
map so let me just go back to my desktop
and<00:02:24.050> here<00:02:24.260> have<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.560> X<00:02:25.070> normal<00:02:25.540> what<00:02:26.540> we're

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
and here have a X normal what we're

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.300 
and here have a X normal what we're
going<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.020> do<00:02:27.320> is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.670 

at<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.120> high-definition<00:02:32.780> meshes<00:02:33.530> I'm

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
at to the high-definition meshes I'm

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.440 
at to the high-definition meshes I'm
going<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.040> add<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.430> well<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:34.849> call<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.209> star

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
going to add the well I call it star

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.990 
going to add the well I call it star
here<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:35.989> it's<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.379> insignia<00:02:36.650> creative<00:02:37.400> and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
here but it's the insignia creative and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.150 
here but it's the insignia creative and
this<00:02:38.660> one<00:02:38.870> doesn't<00:02:39.110> really<00:02:39.379> need<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.650> have<00:02:39.950> any

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
this one doesn't really need to have any

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.150 
this one doesn't really need to have any
UVs<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:42.050> we're<00:02:42.290> going<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.010> low

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
UVs and then we're going to on the low

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160 
UVs and then we're going to on the low
definition<00:02:43.370> measures<00:02:44.000> we're<00:02:44.180> going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.810> add

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
definition measures we're going to add

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.320 
definition measures we're going to add
the<00:02:45.410> plane<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:46.550> we're<00:02:46.670> going<00:02:46.849> to<00:02:46.970> be

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
the plane that we're going to be

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.130 
the plane that we're going to be
projecting<00:02:48.080> this<00:02:48.260> detail<00:02:48.709> onto<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.540> now<00:02:50.840> when

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
projecting this detail onto so now when

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.650 
projecting this detail onto so now when
we<00:02:51.170> go<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.530> baking<00:02:52.280> options<00:02:52.670> what<00:02:53.209> we're<00:02:53.420> going

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
we go to baking options what we're going

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.259 
we go to baking options what we're going
to<00:02:53.690> bake<00:02:53.959> is<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> height<00:02:54.530> map<00:02:54.970> we<00:02:55.970> don't<00:02:56.150> really

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
to bake is a height map we don't really

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.210 
to bake is a height map we don't really
need<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.540> change<00:02:56.930> any<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.650> settings<00:02:57.680> here

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
need to change any of the settings here

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.550 
need to change any of the settings here
just<00:02:58.489> leave<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.790> as<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.330> but<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> one<00:03:00.379> thing

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
just leave it as it is but the one thing

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.080 
just leave it as it is but the one thing
we're<00:03:00.709> going<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.950> change<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.760> edge

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
we're going to change is the edge

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.330 
we're going to change is the edge
padding<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.959> padding<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
padding and the padding is like a

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.930 
padding and the padding is like a
bleeding<00:03:04.940> effect<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.569> lives<00:03:06.110> on<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.410> size<00:03:06.650> of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
bleeding effect it lives on the size of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.059 
bleeding effect it lives on the size of
for<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.060> UVs<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:09.530> don't<00:03:09.709> really<00:03:09.829> need

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
for the UVs and we don't really need

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.640 
for the UVs and we don't really need
this<00:03:10.310> for<00:03:11.150> what<00:03:11.510> we're<00:03:11.660> going<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.900> do<00:03:12.049> now<00:03:12.260> so

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
this for what we're going to do now so

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.819 
this for what we're going to do now so
the<00:03:13.400> default<00:03:13.549> is<00:03:14.000> 16<00:03:14.569> I'm<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.470> set<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.799> to

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
the default is 16 I'm going to set it to

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.280 
the default is 16 I'm going to set it to
zero<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.519> just<00:03:17.390> going<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.720> go<00:03:17.840> ahead<00:03:18.110> and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
zero and just going to go ahead and

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.979 
zero and just going to go ahead and
click<00:03:18.500> on<00:03:18.620> generate<00:03:18.980> maps<00:03:19.599> so<00:03:20.599> now<00:03:20.750> it's

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
click on generate maps so now it's

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.949 
click on generate maps so now it's
generating<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.130> it's<00:03:23.120> going<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.450> pop<00:03:23.599> up<00:03:23.720> with

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
generating and it's going to pop up with

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.930 
generating and it's going to pop up with
this<00:03:24.110> little<00:03:24.650> menu<00:03:24.920> here<00:03:25.370> where<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:25.700> can

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
this little menu here where you can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.360 
this little menu here where you can
change<00:03:26.239> some<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.930> settings<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.829> DEP

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
change some of the settings of the DEP

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.670 
change some of the settings of the DEP
and<00:03:28.610> so<00:03:28.790> on<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.140> want<00:03:30.319> to<00:03:30.380> play<00:03:30.560> around

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
and so on if you want to play around

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.670 
and so on if you want to play around
with<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.069> go<00:03:31.280> ahead<00:03:31.310> in<00:03:31.819> my<00:03:32.299> case<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.750> just<00:03:33.500> use

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
with it go ahead in my case I just use

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.620 
with it go ahead in my case I just use
the<00:03:33.829> default<00:03:34.190> then<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.549> change<00:03:35.030> anything<00:03:35.299> so

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
the default then you change anything so

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.050 
the default then you change anything so
it's<00:03:36.380> just<00:03:36.560> close<00:03:36.829> this<00:03:36.980> window<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.760> let<00:03:37.970> it

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
it's just close this window and let it

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.199 
it's just close this window and let it
finish<00:03:38.239> timing<00:03:38.690> making<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.319> map<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.400> this<00:03:41.030> is

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
finish timing making the map so this is

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.440 
finish timing making the map so this is
basically<00:03:41.750> what<00:03:42.739> we<00:03:42.769> get<00:03:43.100> as<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.970> can<00:03:44.120> see<00:03:44.299> it

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
basically what we get as you can see it

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.020 
basically what we get as you can see it
looks<00:03:44.569> pretty<00:03:44.720> good

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
looks pretty good

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.880 
looks pretty good
and<00:03:46.210> now<00:03:46.690> we're<00:03:46.840> going<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.200> go<00:03:47.320> back<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.590> see

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
and now we're going to go back to see

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.100 
and now we're going to go back to see
bridge<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.370> keep<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.000> girl<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.720> I'm<00:03:49.900> just

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
bridge and keep it a girl so I'm just

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.710 
bridge and keep it a girl so I'm just
going<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.700> move<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:51.970> back<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:52.510> some

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
going to move to the back I have some

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.630 
going to move to the back I have some
space<00:03:52.960> here

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
space here

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.640 
space here
and<00:03:54.850> I'm<00:03:55.510> going<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.750> use<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.050> standard<00:03:56.290> brush

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
and I'm going to use the standard brush

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.820 
and I'm going to use the standard brush
set<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.550> drag<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.120> wreck<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:59.080> going<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.650> go<00:03:59.770> to

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
set to drag the wreck and going to go to

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.450 
set to drag the wreck and going to go to
alpha<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:00.880> import<00:04:01.630> these<00:04:02.260> alpha<00:04:02.950> just<00:04:03.280> baked

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
alpha and import these alpha just baked

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.890 
alpha and import these alpha just baked
so<00:04:04.240> let's<00:04:05.080> go<00:04:05.260> here<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:05.980> Center<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:07.920> drag<00:04:08.920> away

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
so let's go here to Center and drag away

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.540 
so let's go here to Center and drag away
alright<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.260> as<00:04:11.770> you<00:04:11.800> can<00:04:12.070> see<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.280> looks

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
alright so as you can see it looks

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.450 
alright so as you can see it looks
pretty<00:04:12.790> good<00:04:13.300> already<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.920> think<00:04:14.920> they<00:04:15.070> see

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
pretty good already I think they see

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.759 
pretty good already I think they see
intensity<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.120> shoot<00:04:17.019> high<00:04:17.230> for<00:04:17.560> what<00:04:17.680> I'm

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
intensity is shoot high for what I'm

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.759 
intensity is shoot high for what I'm
trying<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.160> achieve<00:04:18.519> so<00:04:18.820> let<00:04:19.030> me<00:04:19.709> make<00:04:20.709> this

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
trying to achieve so let me make this

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.380 
trying to achieve so let me make this
smaller<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.930> drag<00:04:22.930> out<00:04:23.140> alright<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:24.430> here<00:04:25.270> we

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
smaller and drag out alright so here we

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.810 
smaller and drag out alright so here we
have<00:04:25.570> doesn't<00:04:26.470> look<00:04:26.590> quite<00:04:26.710> as<00:04:26.919> good<00:04:27.010> because

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
have doesn't look quite as good because

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.360 
have doesn't look quite as good because
I<00:04:28.120> made<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.480> guy<00:04:28.660> quickly<00:04:29.140> but<00:04:29.980> we<00:04:30.190> have<00:04:30.340> a

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
I made this guy quickly but we have a

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.060 
I made this guy quickly but we have a
pretty<00:04:30.640> good<00:04:30.730> base<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.390> work<00:04:31.570> here<00:04:31.950> there<00:04:32.950> is

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
pretty good base to work here there is

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.180 
pretty good base to work here there is
one<00:04:33.280> problem<00:04:33.550> though<00:04:33.880> as<00:04:34.090> you<00:04:34.240> can<00:04:34.450> see<00:04:35.190> these

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
one problem though as you can see these

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.700 
one problem though as you can see these
centre<00:04:36.669> areas<00:04:37.090> more<00:04:37.390> defined<00:04:37.840> but<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.590> has<00:04:38.680> a

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
centre areas more defined but it has a

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.010 
centre areas more defined but it has a
foul<00:04:39.100> off<00:04:39.310> towards<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.030> edges<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.750> shape

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
foul off towards the edges of the shape

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.860 
foul off towards the edges of the shape
this<00:04:41.800> is<00:04:41.919> because<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.580> shape<00:04:43.030> of<00:04:43.270> this

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
this is because of the shape of this

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.060 
this is because of the shape of this
brush<00:04:44.140> as<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:44.530> can<00:04:44.710> see<00:04:45.240> if<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.450> just<00:04:47.070> disable

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
brush as you can see if I just disable

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.090 
brush as you can see if I just disable
this<00:04:48.190> quickly<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.760> make<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.090> stroke<00:04:50.100> you'll

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
this quickly and make a stroke you'll

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.070 
this quickly and make a stroke you'll
notice<00:04:51.430> that<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.730> stroke<00:04:52.060> also<00:04:52.330> has<00:04:52.720> a

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
notice that the stroke also has a

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.230 
notice that the stroke also has a
fall-off<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.650> have<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:54.010> more<00:04:54.610> height<00:04:55.030> on

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
fall-off you have that more height on

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.200 
fall-off you have that more height on
the<00:04:55.419> center<00:04:55.870> and<00:04:55.900> then<00:04:56.140> a<00:04:56.950> fall<00:04:57.700> off<00:04:57.880> to<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
the center and then a fall off to the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.510 
the center and then a fall off to the
sides<00:04:58.480> so<00:04:58.720> what<00:04:59.050> we're<00:04:59.200> going<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.500> do<00:04:59.800> is<00:05:00.100> to

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
sides so what we're going to do is to

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.990 
sides so what we're going to do is to
modify<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:01.890> brush<00:05:02.890> so<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.460> doesn't<00:05:03.820> have

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
modify the brush so you doesn't have

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.409 
modify the brush so you doesn't have
that<00:05:04.210> and<00:05:04.419> it's<00:05:04.750> an<00:05:04.870> even<00:05:05.229> surface<00:05:05.440> all<00:05:05.950> around

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
that and it's an even surface all around

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.130 
that and it's an even surface all around
so<00:05:07.419> for<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.780> we<00:05:07.930> just<00:05:07.960> go<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.350> brush<00:05:08.790> curve

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
so for that we just go to brush curve

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.440 
so for that we just go to brush curve
edit<00:05:11.140> curve<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.820> then<00:05:12.820> here<00:05:13.090> we<00:05:13.180> have<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
edit curve and then here we have the

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.300 
edit curve and then here we have the
curve<00:05:13.690> we're<00:05:14.020> going<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.380> just<00:05:14.620> grab<00:05:15.130> this

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
curve we're going to just grab this

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.310 
curve we're going to just grab this
little<00:05:15.640> guy<00:05:15.790> move<00:05:16.570> it<00:05:16.690> all<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.020> way<00:05:17.169> up<00:05:17.290> here

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
little guy move it all the way up here

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.340 
little guy move it all the way up here
so<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:18.130> it's<00:05:18.280> surface<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.940> top<00:05:19.350> is

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
so that it's surface the top is

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.620 
so that it's surface the top is
completely<00:05:20.590> flat<00:05:21.390> so<00:05:22.390> now<00:05:22.540> if<00:05:22.780> I<00:05:23.140> just<00:05:24.600> make<00:05:25.600> a

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
completely flat so now if I just make a

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.930 
completely flat so now if I just make a
stroke<00:05:26.169> it's<00:05:26.590> going<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.979> be<00:05:27.100> flat<00:05:27.280> which<00:05:27.729> is

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
stroke it's going to be flat which is

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.240 
stroke it's going to be flat which is
not<00:05:28.390> going<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.720> look<00:05:28.870> good<00:05:29.020> here<00:05:29.410> but<00:05:29.620> tells<00:05:30.100> a

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
not going to look good here but tells a

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.030 
not going to look good here but tells a
mother<00:05:30.840> so<00:05:31.840> set<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.200> back<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.350> drag<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.800> rack

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
mother so set it back to drag the rack

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.469 
mother so set it back to drag the rack
he<00:05:33.880> never<00:05:34.140> all-powerful<00:05:35.140> map<00:05:35.530> again<00:05:35.890> and<00:05:36.479> when

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
he never all-powerful map again and when

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.750 
he never all-powerful map again and when
we<00:05:37.510> drag<00:05:37.930> you're<00:05:38.680> going<00:05:38.950> to<00:05:39.070> notice<00:05:39.400> that<00:05:39.430> he

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
we drag you're going to notice that he

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.870 
we drag you're going to notice that he
has<00:05:39.940> the<00:05:40.090> same<00:05:40.390> height<00:05:40.630> all<00:05:40.900> around<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:42.340> it

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
has the same height all around and it

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.740 
has the same height all around and it
looks<00:05:43.030> much<00:05:43.330> better

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
looks much better

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.070 
looks much better
so<00:05:44.110> now<00:05:44.320> wenches

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
so now wenches

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.980 
so now wenches
smooth<00:05:46.979> out<00:05:47.099> these<00:05:47.370> edges<00:05:47.610> here<00:05:47.849> a<00:05:49.400> little<00:05:50.400> bit

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
smooth out these edges here a little bit

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.210 
smooth out these edges here a little bit
and<00:05:51.990> there<00:05:52.740> we<00:05:52.830> go

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
and there we go

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.480 
and there we go
we<00:05:53.789> have<00:05:53.970> a<00:05:54.000> fairly<00:05:54.690> complex<00:05:55.099> shape<00:05:56.099> that<00:05:56.400> we

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
we have a fairly complex shape that we

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.899 
we have a fairly complex shape that we
just<00:05:56.759> sculpted<00:05:57.210> on<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.449> a<00:05:57.479> match<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.789> as<00:05:59.789> you

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
just sculpted on to a match and as you

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.550 
just sculpted on to a match and as you
can<00:06:00.030> see<00:06:00.180> it<00:06:00.240> was<00:06:00.360> pretty<00:06:00.419> easy<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.930> do<00:06:01.080> pray

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
can see it was pretty easy to do pray

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.149 
can see it was pretty easy to do pray
quick<00:06:02.099> and<00:06:02.400> of<00:06:03.120> course<00:06:03.360> it<00:06:03.659> will<00:06:03.750> project<00:06:04.159> on

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
quick and of course it will project on

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:11.680 
quick and of course it will project on
any<00:06:06.590> angle<00:06:08.750> anywhere<00:06:09.750> you<00:06:09.870> want<00:06:10.110> it<00:06:10.229> and<00:06:10.530> it's

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
any angle anywhere you want it and it's

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.619 
any angle anywhere you want it and it's
going<00:06:12.690> to<00:06:12.870> work<00:06:13.080> so<00:06:13.729> yeah<00:06:14.729> that's<00:06:15.210> pretty<00:06:15.479> much

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629 
going to work so yeah that's pretty much

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.309 
going to work so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:06:15.720> hope<00:06:16.460> that<00:06:17.460> was<00:06:17.849> useful<00:06:18.030> and<00:06:18.449> thank<00:06:19.259> you
