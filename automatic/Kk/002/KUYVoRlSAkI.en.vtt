really change and they become a bit

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.090 
really change and they become a bit

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
predictable so it looks like we'll have

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.510 
predictable so it looks like we'll have
to<00:03:05.340> wait<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.640> next<00:03:06.000> bar<00:03:06.150> filled<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.690> and

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
to wait to the next bar filled up and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.920 
to wait to the next bar filled up and
until<00:03:08.520> then<00:03:08.730> we'll<00:03:09.090> have<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.360> keep<00:03:09.480> wondering

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
until then we'll have to keep wondering

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.840 
until then we'll have to keep wondering
but<00:03:10.230> i'll<00:03:10.350> keep<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.650> guys<00:03:10.770> updated<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.550> thanks
