i have a magic card Alakazam and i
actually<00:00:24.660> didn't<00:00:25.050> think<00:00:25.230> they<00:00:25.470> were<00:00:25.560> both

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
actually didn't think they were both

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.070 
actually didn't think they were both
released<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.939> lick<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.449> oh<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.720> at<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
released or like lick in oh you at the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.240 
released or like lick in oh you at the
same<00:00:28.199> time<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.529> i<00:00:28.590> guess<00:00:28.740> they<00:00:28.890> were<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
same time but i guess they were and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.759 
same time but i guess they were and
stuff<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.480> anyway<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.230> leave<00:00:31.410> off<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.650> T

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.900 
than I think set up entry hazards and
dies<00:00:42.300> Soho<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.489> stealth

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
dies Soho I think I just go for stealth

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.360 
dies Soho I think I just go for stealth
Iraq<00:00:45.059> Syria<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> don't<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> use

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
Iraq Syria and really I don't have a use

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
Iraq Syria and really I don't have a use
for<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.670> thing<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:48.930> whatever

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
for this thing so I was like whatever

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
for this thing so I was like whatever
but<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.219> he<00:00:50.370> switched<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.760> goes<00:00:50.910> into<00:00:50.940> T

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
but you know he switched out goes into T

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.060 
but you know he switched out goes into T
tar<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.870> thinking<00:00:52.050> he<00:00:52.350> might<00:00:52.500> superpower

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
tar I was thinking he might superpower

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369 
tar I was thinking he might superpower
or<00:00:53.219> something<00:00:53.730> weird<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.329> die<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.870> but

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
or something weird or die don't know but

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.869 
or something weird or die don't know but
yeah<00:00:55.530> he<00:00:55.710> does<00:00:55.860> superpower<00:00:56.280> ago<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
yeah he does superpower ago I go and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.380 
yeah he does superpower ago I go and
wrote<00:00:57.149> him<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.570> some<00:00:57.840> strange<00:00:58.109> reason<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
wrote him for some strange reason and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.709 
wrote him for some strange reason and
yeah<00:01:00.390> whatever<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.590> uh<00:01:02.280> super<00:01:03.210> power<00:01:03.390> losses

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
yeah whatever so uh super power losses

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230 
yeah whatever so uh super power losses
defenses<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.439> stiff<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.580> I'm<00:01:05.760> thinking<00:01:06.150> our

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
defenses and stiff and I'm thinking our

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.210 
defenses and stiff and I'm thinking our
I<00:01:06.299> he'll<00:01:06.540> probably<00:01:06.780> switch<00:01:07.170> maybe<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.979> he'll

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
I he'll probably switch maybe or he'll

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.440 
I he'll probably switch maybe or he'll
just<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.700> stealth<00:01:08.970> rocks<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.330> something

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
just go for stealth rocks or something

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.899 
just go for stealth rocks or something
and<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.680> volts<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.040> guess<00:01:11.729> he<00:01:11.850> just

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
and so I just volts which guess he just

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
and so I just volts which guess he just
stays<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.229> switch<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> my

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

this team I was thinking all right I can
just<00:01:22.710> go<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:22.979> toxic<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.610> he<00:01:23.700> goes<00:01:23.850> into

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
just go for toxic if he goes into

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.310 
just go for toxic if he goes into
excadrill<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.930> his<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:26.220> his<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.990> gliscor<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.140> can

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
excadrill or his or his a gliscor I can

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.520 
excadrill or his or his a gliscor I can
take<00:01:28.890> her<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.280> pretty<00:01:29.820> easily<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.360> stuff<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
take her them pretty easily and stuff so

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.039 
take her them pretty easily and stuff so
i<00:01:31.560> go<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> taxi<00:01:32.189> goes<00:01:32.430> into<00:01:32.610> Rotom<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.119> i

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
i go for the taxi goes into Rotom and i

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.920 
i go for the taxi goes into Rotom and i
go<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.590> toxic<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.820> hits<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> he's<00:01:36.540> poison

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.060 
was thinking he'd sword dance so I went
for<00:02:38.730> Fire<00:02:39.000> Blast<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.510> he<00:02:39.840> goes<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.709> earthquake

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
you know I go for pursuit and Draco does

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.070

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
 all and yeah that latias is going

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.050 
 all and yeah that latias is going
to<00:03:49.230> die<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.769> horrible<00:03:50.010> painful<00:03:50.280> death<00:03:50.640> now

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
to die a horrible painful death now

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.520 
to die a horrible painful death now
turns<00:03:51.390> out<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.630> he<00:03:51.840> has<00:03:51.930> leftovers<00:03:52.440> and

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
turns out that he has leftovers and

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.130 
turns out that he has leftovers and
recover<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:54.150> guess<00:03:54.330> he<00:03:54.450> was<00:03:54.570> hoping<00:03:54.900> that

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
recover and I guess he was hoping that

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.650 
recover and I guess he was hoping that
with<00:03:55.680> both<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.010> those<00:03:56.280> together<00:03:56.549> he<00:03:57.150> will<00:03:57.360> you

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
with both of those together he will you

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.320 
with both of those together he will you
know<00:03:57.780> live<00:03:58.110> pursuits<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:58.980> uh<00:03:59.180> sandstorms<00:04:00.180> up

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
know live pursuits but uh sandstorms up

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.720 
know live pursuits but uh sandstorms up
so<00:04:00.540> he's<00:04:00.660> actually<00:04:00.810> gonna<00:04:01.049> go<00:04:01.200> under<00:04:01.730> fifty

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
so he's actually gonna go under fifty

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.560 
so he's actually gonna go under fifty
percent<00:04:03.000> at<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.570> end<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.810> turn<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:05.390> yeah<00:04:06.390> he's

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
guess he rockslides predicting that

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.500 
guess he rockslides predicting that
which<00:04:48.750> was<00:04:48.930> good<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.530> I<00:04:50.250> i<00:04:50.880> don't<00:04:51.150> know<00:04:51.240> why<00:04:51.480> i
