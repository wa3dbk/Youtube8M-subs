00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
bit I don't use it often now I wouldn't

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.590 
bit I don't use it often now I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:11.019> use<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.470> like<00:04:11.970> on<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.030> weekly

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
recommend you use it like on a weekly

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.190 
recommend you use it like on a weekly
basis<00:04:14.019> or<00:04:14.140> anything<00:04:14.440> like<00:04:14.470> that<00:04:14.620> but<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:16.090> use<00:04:16.930> it

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
basis or anything like that but I use it

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.250 
basis or anything like that but I use it
maybe<00:04:17.950> once<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.459> month<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:19.060> use<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.330> as<00:04:19.690> like

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
maybe once a month and I use it as like

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.330 
maybe once a month and I use it as like
a<00:04:20.290> clarifying<00:04:21.070> shampoo<00:04:21.990> so<00:04:22.990> what<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.800> does<00:04:24.010> is

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
a clarifying shampoo so what it does is

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.780 
a clarifying shampoo so what it does is
it

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
it

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.970 
it
helps<00:04:25.270> remove<00:04:25.600> all<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.020> build<00:04:26.200> for<00:04:26.560> your<00:04:26.770> hair

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.060 
helps remove all the build for your hair

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
conditioners what they do is they create

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.020

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
to see their full potential because you

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.430

you need to take vitamins you know
that's<00:06:30.640> just<00:06:30.880> my<00:06:31.030> personal<00:06:31.480> opinion<00:06:31.600> I've

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
that's just my personal opinion I've

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.250 
that's just my personal opinion I've
noticed<00:06:32.620> a<00:06:32.710> change<00:06:33.270> like<00:06:34.270> I<00:06:34.390> said<00:06:34.450> in<00:06:34.810> my<00:06:34.840> hair

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
noticed a change like I said in my hair

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.990 
noticed a change like I said in my hair
it's<00:06:35.500> grown

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
it's grown

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.580 
it's grown
lot<00:06:36.090> faster<00:06:36.660> I<00:06:37.620> think<00:06:38.430> I<00:06:38.670> dyed<00:06:39.360> it<00:06:39.390> maybe<00:06:39.840> it's

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
lot faster I think I dyed it maybe it's

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.670 
lot faster I think I dyed it maybe it's
been<00:06:41.390> maybe<00:06:42.390> a<00:06:42.510> little<00:06:42.750> less<00:06:42.960> than<00:06:43.200> a<00:06:43.290> year<00:06:43.500> now

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
been maybe a little less than a year now

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.320 
been maybe a little less than a year now
and<00:06:44.070> I<00:06:44.670> have<00:06:45.350> maybe<00:06:46.400> that<00:06:47.400> much<00:06:47.670> new<00:06:47.940> new

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
and I have maybe that much new new

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.920 
and I have maybe that much new new
growth<00:06:48.920> so<00:06:49.920> it's<00:06:50.070> about<00:06:50.190> like<00:06:50.550> they're<00:06:51.060> so

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
growth so it's about like they're so

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.050 
growth so it's about like they're so
it's<00:06:52.170> grown<00:06:53.090> fairly<00:06:54.090> quickly<00:06:54.450> so<00:06:55.010> this<00:06:56.010> is<00:06:56.220> all

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
it's grown fairly quickly so this is all

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.500 
it's grown fairly quickly so this is all
this<00:06:57.780> would<00:06:58.080> be<00:06:58.230> new<00:06:58.470> growth<00:06:58.740> here<00:06:58.980> so<00:06:59.790> I<00:07:00.210> mean

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
this would be new growth here so I mean

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.110 
this would be new growth here so I mean
just<00:07:00.750> as<00:07:00.960> a<00:07:00.990> result<00:07:01.410> of<00:07:01.560> me<00:07:01.770> taking<00:07:02.310> better

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
just as a result of me taking better

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.170 
just as a result of me taking better
care<00:07:03.240> of<00:07:03.480> myself<00:07:03.780> so<00:07:04.350> that<00:07:04.380> that<00:07:05.220> does<00:07:05.550> play<00:07:05.880> an

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
care of myself so that that does play an

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.880 
care of myself so that that does play an
important<00:07:06.750> role<00:07:06.780> if<00:07:07.110> you're<00:07:07.320> not<00:07:07.530> eating

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:07.890
