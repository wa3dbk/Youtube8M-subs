00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
quick link here that is going to go

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.439 
quick link here that is going to go

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and hitting somebody in the head because

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
and hitting somebody in the head because
that<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.960> hurt<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.489> caught

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
that would hurt because if you caught

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.490

yourself<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.570> even<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> being

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
yourself with this even with it being

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.770 
yourself with this even with it being
padded<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.520> still<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> most<00:00:45.570> pleasant

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.799 
padded it still is not the most pleasant
sensation<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.980> anyway<00:00:47.460> use<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:48.539> own<00:00:48.690> risk

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
here we want an

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.380 
here we want an
they're<00:02:09.650> little<00:02:10.190> not<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> reason<00:02:11.120> that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
they're little not and the reason that

they're little not and the reason that
we<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.630> this<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.980> actually<00:02:13.550> will<00:02:13.730> help

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
we do this is that it actually will help

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
to catch the wind and so by catching the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.880 
to catch the wind and so by catching the
wind<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.240> will<00:02:17.300> help<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.630> billow<00:02:17.990> open<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.650> so

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
wind it will help it billow open and so

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.380 
wind it will help it billow open and so
I'm<00:02:19.160> trying<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.460> work<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.880> tag<00:02:20.090> here

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
we go I've got my little knot in here

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.330 
we go I've got my little knot in here
and<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.110> see<00:02:30.350> how<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.500> creates<00:02:30.860> sort<00:02:31.250> of

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
and so you see how that creates sort of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.950 
and so you see how that creates sort of
like<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.550> little<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.120> can<00:02:32.270> catch<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.660> wind<00:02:32.780> so

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
like a little it can catch the wind so

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.300 
like a little it can catch the wind so
it's<00:02:33.080> creating<00:02:33.380> like<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> little<00:02:33.800> mini<00:02:33.980> sail

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
it's creating like a little mini sail

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.740 
it's creating like a little mini sail
and<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.990> is<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.410> here<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.860> your<00:02:37.070> completed

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
and so that is it here is your completed

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.740 
and so that is it here is your completed
void<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:40.100> will<00:02:40.490> probably<00:02:40.910> show<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.480> this

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
void and I will probably show you this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.550 
void and I will probably show you this
puppy<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.260> action<00:02:42.650> here<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.040> another<00:02:43.250> video<00:02:43.610> so
