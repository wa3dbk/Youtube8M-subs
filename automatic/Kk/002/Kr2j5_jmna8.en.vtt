00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
basically the guitars ability to stay in

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.130 
basically the guitars ability to stay in
tune<00:00:20.670> regardless<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.570> fret<00:00:21.840> you're<00:00:22.020> on

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.410 
tune regardless of what fret you're on
for<00:00:22.470> example<00:00:22.920> if<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.550> intonation<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.240> off

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
for example if your intonation is off

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.870 
for example if your intonation is off

and sounds fine it's in tune everything

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.730 
and sounds fine it's in tune everything
sounds<00:00:30.000> good<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.900> then<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.109> go<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> play<00:00:31.590> that

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
sounds good but then you go to play that

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.080 
sounds good but then you go to play that
same<00:00:32.070> ecord<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:34.710> end<00:00:34.890> up

to make it sharp or flat now if you find
out<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.170> adjusting<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.880> not

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
out that adjusting that is just not

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.760 
out that adjusting that is just not
doing<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.630> trick<00:02:21.870> another<00:02:22.350> thing<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
doing the trick another thing that you

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.310 
doing the trick another thing that you
can<00:02:22.860> do<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.400> adjust<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:24.060> trust<00:02:24.390> rod<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.990> if

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
can do is adjust the trust rod and if

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.660 
can do is adjust the trust rod and if
you<00:02:25.440> don't<00:02:25.620> know<00:02:25.710> how<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.830> access<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> truss

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
you don't know how to access the truss

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.360 
you don't know how to access the truss
rod<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.180> your<00:02:27.540> guitar<00:02:27.870> most<00:02:28.830> likely<00:02:29.100> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
rod on your guitar most likely you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.830 
rod on your guitar most likely you
probably<00:02:29.730> shouldn't<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.210> adjusting<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.750> in

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
probably shouldn't be adjusting it in

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.660 
probably shouldn't be adjusting it in
the<00:02:30.900> first<00:02:31.110> place<00:02:31.230> what<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> truss<00:02:31.920> rod<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.400> is

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the first place what the truss rod is is

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.790 
the first place what the truss rod is is
a<00:02:33.000> little<00:02:33.240> rub<00:02:33.420> that's<00:02:33.690> inside<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.290> net<00:02:34.470> here

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
a little rub that's inside the net here

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.130 
a little rub that's inside the net here
basically<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.700> rod<00:02:35.850> adjusts<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.420> arc<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
basically the rod adjusts the arc of the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.720 
basically the rod adjusts the arc of the
neck<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.920> only<00:02:38.040> does<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.310> adjust<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
neck and not only does it adjust the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
neck and not only does it adjust the
intonation<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.510> will<00:02:39.600> also<00:02:39.720> adjust<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
intonation but it will also adjust the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.450 
intonation but it will also adjust the
action<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.130> don't<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
action and if you don't know what the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.360 
action and if you don't know what the
action<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.420> action<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> guitar<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.470> how

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
action is the action on a guitar is how

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.460 
action is the action on a guitar is how
far<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.910> string<00:02:45.210> is<00:02:45.240> from<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> fret<00:02:46.050> as<00:02:46.260> it

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
far the string is from the fret as it

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.260 
far the string is from the fret as it
goes<00:02:46.620> down<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.950> board<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.730> if<00:02:48.150> you're

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
goes down the board so if you're

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.120 
goes down the board so if you're
straying<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.140> right<00:02:49.860> where<00:02:50.040> you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
straying you know is right where you

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.590 
straying you know is right where you
want<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:50.550> at<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:50.970> side<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.390> board

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
want it to be at one side of the board

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.030 
want it to be at one side of the board
but<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:52.170> high<00:02:52.350> at<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> other<00:02:52.770> side

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
but it's really high at the other side

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.130 
but it's really high at the other side
of<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.220> board<00:02:53.460> then<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.600> means<00:02:54.750> your<00:02:54.960> truss

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
of the board then that means your truss

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.380 
of the board then that means your truss
rod<00:02:55.380> also<00:02:56.220> needs<00:02:56.430> adjusting<00:02:56.850> for<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.120> reason

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
rod also needs adjusting for that reason

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.850 
rod also needs adjusting for that reason
as<00:02:57.690> well<00:02:57.720> there's<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.260> lot<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.440> different

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
as well there's a lot of different

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.230 
as well there's a lot of different
adjustments<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.430> can<00:02:59.490> obviously<00:02:59.670> do<00:03:00.120> when

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
adjustments you can obviously do when

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.660 
adjustments you can obviously do when
they<00:03:00.300> get<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.510> her<00:03:00.630> between<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.770> bridge<00:03:02.070> you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
they get to her between the bridge you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.610 
they get to her between the bridge you
can<00:03:02.700> change<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.330> nut<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:04.050> change<00:03:04.350> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
can change the nut you can change the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.650 
can change the nut you can change the
height<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.070> can<00:03:05.100> change<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:06.090> truss<00:03:06.360> rod

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
height you can change the truss rod

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.450 
height you can change the truss rod
everything<00:03:07.470> plays<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.740> role<00:03:07.980> which<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.310> why<00:03:08.430> I

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
everything plays a role which is why I

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.730
