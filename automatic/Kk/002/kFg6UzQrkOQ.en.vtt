 the moment of transition price or at the moment

 permission to submit offers because

 often transition prices happen at midnight 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.340
 robots have an autostart timer which 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.600
 allows him to apply in any 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.579
 time to within a fraction of a second 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.579
 many are interested in what happens to 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.129
 digitally signed the robot will be 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.559
 pick up the tcp that is loaded into 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.550
 system you can also participate in 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.219
 bid remotely 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.260
 load facet and robot mustache to remote 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.270
 server 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.190
 functionality aussi choice 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.190
 electronic trading platforms 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.330
 automatic time synchronization 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.880
 server and trading start time 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.180
 setting the timer for automatic 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.180
 on and off 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.380
 high speed filing 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.750
 cygnett 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.520
 and the ability to log all 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.289
 operations what problems solves aussi 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.119
 the biggest problem with participating in 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.119
 bid it sync time 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.070
 server and computer time is needed here 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.649
 accuracy to milliseconds as if 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.630
 send a request before the start of trading 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.520
 bidder or electronic 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.229
 marketplace can its just 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.750
 delete or ignore 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.600
 and if you submit an application later then bidding 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.970
 will probably be lost by hand 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.450
 it's almost unreal with a robot 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.720
 aussi 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.909
 this is all doable another problem for 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.860
 bidders are conditions when 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.049
 you can only send an application 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.340
 when the bidding is started and the price of the lot 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.860
 appears on the site 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.869
 sometimes you need to send an application 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.900
 press the button that appears only 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.920
 with the start of trading in this situation, the robot 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.410
 mustache will also work better man yet 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.720
 one common problem when 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.519
 when submitting an application is required to press 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.220
 a few buttons or load 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.910
 documents and this problem is a robot mustache 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.310
 decides safely 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.079
 err is human 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.540
 solves problems related to human 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:39.100
 the factor namely errors are not 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.110
 punctuality emotions and stuff 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.270
 speed capabilities sometimes send 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.670
 application for public bidding to a certain 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.400
 the time with millisecond accuracy is extremely 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.680
 it's hard to win the auction 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.660
 hands if the price is actively changing in 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.240
 last minute is unrealistic 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.910
 the robot does an excellent job with this 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.920
 challenge rusi can participate in 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.060
 auctions both for promotion and for 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.580
 price reduction 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.740
 it automatically puts the best price in 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.080
 auction and interrupts the previous 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.360
 maximum or minimum price for 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.260
 predetermined value and for several 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.110
 milliseconds 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.870
 you can specify a step in the robot 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.820
 prices and the lowest price which are lower 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.510
 you are not interested to participate in this 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.940
 auction 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.430
 if the price at auction reaches 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.340
 the value you specify the robot will stop 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.440
 submit applications 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.390
 Aussi generates applications with speed 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.110
 limited only by the speed of your 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.690
 internet connection and your computer 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.030
 aussi works on more than 45 trading 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.040
 venues and if you wish he can 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.890
 be adapted to any other 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.480
 pad 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.550
 the auction robot a mustache went full 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.430
 comprehensive testing and good 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.110
 established itself among users 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.580
 company investment clients 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.680
 trading technologies

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.959
 winning bidding aussi
