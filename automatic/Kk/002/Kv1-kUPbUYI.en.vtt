draw the design six loops around the
ring<00:00:59.769> let's<00:01:00.769> speed<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.129> up<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:10.660> here's<00:01:11.660> our

sixth loop and I'm going to stop when my

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.350 
sixth loop and I'm going to stop when my
triangle<00:01:15.259> meets<00:01:15.470> back<00:01:15.800> up<00:01:16.180> with<00:01:17.180> that
