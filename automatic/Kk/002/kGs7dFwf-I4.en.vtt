00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello girls then I say that's it 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.130
 it's been a very long time since I chatted 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.240
 videos 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.160
 I was pretty busy these last 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.219
 time but I decided to start over 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.599
 in post I hope you will like it then 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.030
 today I introduced you to my 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.000
 skin routine of the moment must know that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.000
 I have skin rather mixed to fat 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.750
 the products that I presented the ne 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.869
 not necessarily the type of my 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.430
 skin varies depending on the time of the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.820
 heat of pollution but also 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.150
 stress that plays a lot 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.430
 so first of all in the morning I shave 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.030
 in the shower with fresh water or under 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.640
 the tap then I spray on my 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.890
 face the Aven thermal spring which is 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.980
 really very good 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.899
 soothing antilles 80 all you 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.290
 wanted it here it calms ceasing 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:00.750
 someone by robin and from the top to the water 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:04.019
 tap I also had a small model 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.250
 that I carry when I travel but 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.039
 the big model I'm me same time 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.520
 then I let act and I dry my 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:18.799
 skin by dabbing with sopalin then 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.880
 after either I use a day care 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:28.200
 it's dull game of cheddar magor it's 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.770
 sensible mattify sebo regulator what to say 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.170
 of this cream then frankly I 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.470
 game but I know that my skin is bri - with 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.049
 but it does not last all day 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.000
 time go finally she finally I thought 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.489
 that she was going to matify actually 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.420
 but I was a little disappointed when 

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:53.270
 I do not even think of buying it back 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.079
 that's otherwise boily you miss a little bit 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.569
 they do not mark the zones of 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.729
 drought 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.810
 but here I do not know if he redeemed me 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.979
 will have bought it because the only 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.530
 disadvantage is that this surface the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.349
 room the first hours okay we do not 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.760
 laugh not too much but after that the end of 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:15.480

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.060
 mixed that on ben it moisturizes enough 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.190
 well good after I proceed 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.579
 imperfections gpat finally his cut 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.250
 not hide a lot but for a 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:44.579
 good looks with hydration 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:48.329
 frankly that then here I am 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.040
 makeup and its attractions in the evening in 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.910
 coming back what I'm doing is the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.290
 removing makeup maybe crucial me I 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.599
 make-up remover with micellar water 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.019
 the creator line h two days h2o de 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.380
 bioderma so what about this 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.380
 wonder 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.120
 ld matic perfectly well and does not leave 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.830
 not dry skin 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.780
 it is suitable for the face and eyes 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.890
 is very economical frankly a 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.880
 bottle like that it lasts me six months 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.110
 knowing that I really make up all 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.610
 the days all the face 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.550
 and sometimes I use to clean 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.350
 also my face then it is that he 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.350
 exists a small in means and in large 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.820
 model where I have the big format 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.260
 the ex torlot of two also for less 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.210
 20 euros the two bottles 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:45.250
 it's really worth it 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:48.640
 push them in then I use the gel 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.330
 cleaner from home avesnes to clean 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.730
 my pocket I put ten films to pau then 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:00.400
 I lathered and then rinsed 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.470
 more sets of this gel is that it 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.090
 suitable for dry skin also 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.450
 than at headquarters for us against haters for 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.770
 a problem it takes field what is 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.590
 very well frankly uses any 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.970
 year all care and all year 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.769
 it lasts quite a long time so I know that 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.440
 they released a larger format that 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.210
 go even more the cost the price less 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:31.600
 of red wine takes and frankly she 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:35.440
 is published then I use horrible 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:40.390
 so to hydrate but I use the 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.220
 clinic at the anti- pocket battle anti 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.060
 dark circles 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.350
 so I say there is a version 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.240
 rich also for it really takes 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.510
 very dry when very dry eyes to 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.350
 outline for me the essence she 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.820
 will leave the eyes because 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.730
 to avoid the formation of small 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.310
 wrinkles had dehydration and 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.950
 frankly it is fine you are the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.460
 represent very long my little one 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.960
 small grain of crem is enough for both 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.610
 eyes 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.850
 frankly good after the price is not 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.390
 given I think the in-between 30,57 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.890
 euros for fifteen thousand liters it's not 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.860
 given but not frankly it's worth the 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.210
 I am completely satisfied 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.120
 I have not tested the rich version yet 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.410
 but I hope to test soon 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:32.330
 when I'm done I'm here next 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.250
 I took then I apply I receive my 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.800
 anti-blemish moisturizer or 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.610
 global our modern standards of charlie 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.520
 sheen then this one she is really 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.740
 top 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:51.050
 it's very unhealthy is coming under 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:56.720
 bottle shape like that a little one 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.550
 pressurization enough she idrac enough 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.970
 good I knew in the end 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.060
 but it does not dry out either 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:08.150
 light imperfections ask when I 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.480
 think about it I consult myself injecting I 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.710
 not seen the difference otherwise we tightens 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.120
 the pores is a beautiful skin 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.520
 frankly I really see the 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.080
 difference the next day compared to 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.360
 other creams and frankly it's a 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.880
 product that I will redeem 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.000
 obligatorily I think it costs 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.710
 in all 2 15 euros from 10 to 15 euros in 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.720
 function of pharmacies 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.500
 for 50 liters here it is worth it is the 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.240
 kick then to finish two to three 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.170
 times a week at home uses 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.950
 exfoliating is the viking press control 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:47.670
 from neutrogena with green tea from 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.810
 cucumbers that will soothe the skin without 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.850
 to frankly dry 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.260
 she's worth it also had not 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.880
 dear I remember how much I 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.570
 do but it's a price of 38 in front of the 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.880
 shot was expensive 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.500
 it is frankly effective 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.880
 distress the skin i see you want my 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.680
 for her and cleanse purify l 2 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.960
 frankly the feat and the 4 steps of the 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.010
 all this is not the skin of the plates of 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.210
 drought exeter after after me 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.150
 I do not use every day because 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.400
 for you I already use the gel 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.870
 cleanser 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.550
 hardly do both at the same time 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.840
