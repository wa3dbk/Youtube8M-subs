00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:08.719
 I arrived not welcome on a map a 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.550
 so much special of the first data station 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:18.360
 mining left them 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.360
 and nothing came the map but if we go down 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.440
 we will see a successful for 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.440
 we can 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.570
 when we see it 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.440
 as their masters 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:41.309
 it's about respecting your base 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.309
 only light of the buses 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:51.610
 with your face and know like that like this like that 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.800
 so so so 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.800
 I need the rest like this 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.339
 and the rest here does not get you and 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.380
 well and that's it now let's go this we put 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.399
 tnt 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.399
 here here 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.160
 and others like that is 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.030
 pumas espeta let's keep hitting 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.950
 boats 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.649
 and not two 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.710
 it was like this is a pretty simple cannon of 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.710
 do 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:37.830
 with enough loads you have all this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.830
 1234 of them 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.540
 and then you can change for example I'm going 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.190
 to put only this if you want me to go 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.180
 for more work to tighten a bit 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.180
 I think it does not claim anything 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.830
 now what is one because we are going 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.190

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.190

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.530

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.530
 is going to happen but well let's make another 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.020
