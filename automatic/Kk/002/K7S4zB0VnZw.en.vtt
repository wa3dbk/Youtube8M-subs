00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 So let's go to the kitchen again. 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.230
 well the recipe I brought today is a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.300
 team in a way that I love and everyone 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.460
 I at home love when I do 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.230
 you can choose to make the same dough 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.490
 and fry the kibbles but I prefer to do 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.710
 in the oven because I think it's more 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.350
 where you can put the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.020
 stuffing without this as you will see 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.850
 I like to put mozzarella curd 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 and it gets really good 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 so if you want to know how I do it 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.560
 my way club is just to continue 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.560
 watching the video 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.899
 You'll need a pound of meat. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.899
 ground 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.510
 I used ground duckling 300 grams 400 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 grams of wheat for hydrated kibble 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.379
 then just choose well you have to leave 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.829
 he was very squeezing it in his hand 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.930
 until it's okay to kim a large onion 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:00.289
 finely chopped parsley to give a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:04.290
 nice mint taste is indispensable 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:08.030
 which gives all the ground in the business on 1 lemon 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.310
 and supreme dinho at 6pm in the mass 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 arab pepper august 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.110
 thyme August and salt also August and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 Now let's see how good it is to prepare 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.880
 I start with the ground meat and I mix it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.409
 or by incorporating wheat into the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.150
 I'm slowly putting meat in 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.979
 little by little there is only and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.750
 kneading manual work even 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.079
 people knead until they incorporate everything 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.079
 OK 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.030
 knead knead knead knead 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.619
 put all the wheat I come with the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.840
 other ingredients may add to the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.270
 all at once and then it's just and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.189
 kneading to incorporate everything and letting 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.469
 everything with a good taste then any 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.569
 onion playing the mint parsley 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:57.179
 Pepper the lemon salt all there and then it is 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.009
 only people knead very well enjoyed 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.670
 to discard all the anger of the husband of the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.039
 sister's brother's boyfriend tells everything about 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.530
 kibe meat that will work then 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:12.120
 mass to put together all the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.280
 ingredients and made it just comes with 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.930
 a form using this which was quite 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.810
 but as you can see already 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.670
 It's a poor road and I'm going to train. 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.799
 background make a layer on the bottom that the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.440
 basis of our team then focus the entire 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.110
 bottom of the baking sheet so you can 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.900
 with the filling is how you can see already 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.700
 It's all forradinho I come with a 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.709
 you use your own 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.060
 preference can use catupiry and finally 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.310
 as you wish 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.319
 spread all the curd over this 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.959
 the basis of meat that we did in the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.579
 the form 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.829
 after that it was spreading well there it is 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.680
 cool it 's right there to be able to 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.079
 pieces have richness in the middle I come 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.540
 with a few slices of mozzarella cheese 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.250
 but you can use feta cheese dish 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.090
 finally it goes out of your pocket 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.489
 preference and done this is only to close with 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.870
 another layer of meat looks like it is 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.940
 a stuffed cake 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.160
 then puts it slowly spreading 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.400
 be careful not to over 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.269
 curd to be cute then 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.099
 spreads all the ground meat on top and 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.720
 is almost ready to go to the oven 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.040
 My folks are very fast on this recipe. 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.840
 and it's delicious 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.250
 I think that this primordial step you 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.139
 wait a little butter or 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.209
 margarine over the top not to 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.769
 dry the meat for your club does not 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.630
 it is very dry which is the mirror quite 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.519
 butter and over 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.799
 if you want and you can put a 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.660
 little sesame I like to put the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.060
 which is more Arabic 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.380
 and then just run into the oven and come down 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.960
 in the oven for about 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.810
 only half an hour 40 minutes until the meat 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.420
 is browned well as sardines and 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.760
 ready time to take out the oven like you 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.110
 You can see he's already cooking and 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.900
 delicious 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.700
 just cut or if you do not want to cut 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.710
 Also that has left the cut visits 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.060
 No problem, I like to cut them. 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.750
 diagonal because I think it gets 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.190
 The more expensive Arabic is ready, this is the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.620
 Today's income I hope you have 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.780
