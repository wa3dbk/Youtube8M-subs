00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
logic now the other thing i wanted to

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.050 
logic now the other thing i wanted to
mention<00:02:14.319> second<00:02:14.950> half<00:02:15.099> of<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.580> they

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
mention second half of this is that they

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.280 
mention second half of this is that they
also<00:02:16.300> announced<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:17.710> season<00:02:18.160> pass<00:02:18.430> dlc

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.330 
also announced the season pass dlc
pricing<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.410> all<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.650> stuff

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
pricing and all that stuff

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.059 
pricing and all that stuff
and<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.750> know<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.110> guess<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.500> comparison<00:02:24.980> that

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
and you know I guess the comparison that

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.369 
and you know I guess the comparison that
I<00:02:25.129> really<00:02:25.670> want<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.879> make<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.989> dlc

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
I really want to make is that the dlc

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.500 
I really want to make is that the dlc
for<00:02:27.530> Gears<00:02:27.739> of<00:02:27.830> War<00:02:27.920> 3<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.190> believe<00:02:28.459> was<00:02:28.640> 4000

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
for Gears of War 3 I believe was 4000

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.949 
for Gears of War 3 I believe was 4000
microsoft<00:02:29.629> points<00:02:30.379> its<00:02:31.250> bands<00:02:31.730> six<00:02:32.480> months

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
microsoft points its bands six months

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.140 
microsoft points its bands six months
and<00:02:33.140> had<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:33.800> four<00:02:34.099> installments<00:02:34.819> right<00:02:34.970> I

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
and had but four installments right I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.110 
and had but four installments right I
think<00:02:35.390> that's<00:02:35.540> right<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.220> there<00:02:37.220> was<00:02:37.340> like<00:02:37.580> 15

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
think that's right and there was like 15

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.180 
think that's right and there was like 15
new<00:02:38.360> maps<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:38.959> total<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.530> don't<00:02:39.830> know<00:02:39.920> if<00:02:40.040> that

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
new maps and total I don't know if that

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.460 
new maps and total I don't know if that
was<00:02:40.910> also<00:02:41.239> including<00:02:41.690> like<00:02:41.870> clock<00:02:42.110> tower<00:02:42.349> and

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
was also including like clock tower and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.479 
was also including like clock tower and
the<00:02:42.500> ones<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.769> came<00:02:42.950> out<00:02:43.099> with<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.310> first

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
the ones that came out with the first

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.550 
the ones that came out with the first
one<00:02:43.760> but<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.420> had<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> lot<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.750> new<00:02:44.930> maps<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.410> lot

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
one but we had a lot of new maps a lot

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.119 
one but we had a lot of new maps a lot
of<00:02:45.680> new<00:02:45.739> content<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.489> this<00:02:47.209> this<00:02:47.629> one<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.129> less

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
of new content and this this one is less

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.410 
of new content and this this one is less
than<00:02:49.280> half<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.489> price<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.910> get<00:02:50.030> 1600

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
than half the price you get 1600

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.570 
than half the price you get 1600
microsoft<00:02:50.720> points<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.500> don't<00:02:52.340> know<00:02:52.400> if<00:02:52.459> that's

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
microsoft points I don't know if that's

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.600 
microsoft points I don't know if that's
half<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.790> price<00:02:53.090> have<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.510> cost<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.610> 1600

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
half the price have to cost so 1600

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.350 
half the price have to cost so 1600
microsoft<00:02:55.700> points<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:58.250> has<00:02:58.430> less<00:02:58.819> content

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
microsoft points and it has less content

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.170 
microsoft points and it has less content
so<00:02:59.599> i<00:02:59.870> guess<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.890> is<00:03:00.920> fair<00:03:01.489> based<00:03:01.790> off<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
so i guess that is fair based off of the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.199 
so i guess that is fair based off of the
pricing<00:03:02.660> than<00:03:02.750> behalf<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.380> but<00:03:04.190> i<00:03:04.940> mean

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
pricing than behalf of this but i mean

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.360 
pricing than behalf of this but i mean
overall<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.410> glance<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.920> seems<00:03:06.950> kind<00:03:07.340> of

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
overall for at a glance it seems kind of

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.069 
overall for at a glance it seems kind of
underwhelming<00:03:07.879> to<00:03:08.269> me<00:03:08.390> that's<00:03:08.540> my<00:03:08.660> initial

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
underwhelming to me that's my initial

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.470 
underwhelming to me that's my initial
feeling<00:03:09.440> about<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.709> but<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.250> think<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:10.970> think

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
feeling about it but I think it's think

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.210 
feeling about it but I think it's think
it<00:03:11.569> could<00:03:11.750> be<00:03:11.840> pretty<00:03:11.989> good<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.470> have<00:03:12.620> six<00:03:13.069> new

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
it could be pretty good you have six new

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.550 
it could be pretty good you have six new
maps<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:15.019> then<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:15.920> have<00:03:16.810> five<00:03:17.810> new<00:03:18.170> weapon

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
maps and then you have five new weapon

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.890 
maps and then you have five new weapon
skins<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.160> four<00:03:19.459> new<00:03:19.790> armor<00:03:20.209> skins<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.660> believe

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
skins and four new armor skins I believe

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.170 
skins and four new armor skins I believe
that<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.349> what<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:22.310> coming<00:03:22.670> with<00:03:22.879> that<00:03:23.000> and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
that is what is coming with that and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.059 
that is what is coming with that and
then<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.360> also<00:03:23.569> have<00:03:23.780> two<00:03:24.319> new<00:03:24.530> game<00:03:24.799> modes

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
then you also have two new game modes

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.300 
then you also have two new game modes
now<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.700> am<00:03:26.269> really<00:03:26.660> racking<00:03:27.139> my<00:03:27.350> brain<00:03:27.739> on<00:03:28.010> what

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
now I am really racking my brain on what

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.640 
now I am really racking my brain on what
these<00:03:28.519> new<00:03:28.700> game<00:03:28.940> modes<00:03:29.180> can<00:03:29.269> be<00:03:29.420> or<00:03:29.780> will<00:03:30.440> be

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
these new game modes can be or will be

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.280 
these new game modes can be or will be
and<00:03:31.120> here's<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.209> point<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.600> really<00:03:32.959> want<00:03:33.200> to

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
and here's a point I really want to

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.420 
and here's a point I really want to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.789 
stress with a lot of guys and I'm
probably<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.299> minority<00:03:35.420> here<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.739> you

rehashed<00:03:41.150> game<00:03:41.690> type<00:03:41.959> when<00:03:42.650> they<00:03:42.799> say<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.069> new

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
rehashed game type when they say to new

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.599 
rehashed game type when they say to new
game<00:03:44.209> modes<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.109> me<00:03:45.489> correlates<00:03:46.489> to

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
game modes that to me correlates to

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.280 
game modes that to me correlates to
being<00:03:47.030> something<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.750> very<00:03:47.810> original

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
being something that is very original

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.740 
being something that is very original
and<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:49.130> feel<00:03:49.370> like<00:03:49.400> Gears<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:49.819> War<00:03:49.940> when<00:03:50.630> it

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
and I feel like Gears of War when it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.500 
and I feel like Gears of War when it
first<00:03:51.019> launched<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.680> even<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.970> second<00:03:53.359> title

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
first launched and even the second title

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.789 
first launched and even the second title
had<00:03:53.810> some<00:03:54.019> very<00:03:54.290> original<00:03:54.799> game<00:03:55.340> types<00:03:55.609> and

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
had some very original game types and

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.860 
had some very original game types and
since<00:03:57.799> then<00:03:58.099> when<00:03:58.880> they<00:03:59.000> talk<00:03:59.209> about<00:03:59.239> new<00:03:59.660> game

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870

since then when they talk about new game
types<00:04:00.169> to<00:04:00.560> me<00:04:00.739> it's<00:04:00.919> just<00:04:01.130> rehash<00:04:01.700> stuff<00:04:02.090> that

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
new so that is like my expectation when

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.550 
new so that is like my expectation when
they<00:04:42.180> say<00:04:42.390> that<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.960> hope<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.380> does<00:04:43.530> not

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
they say that and I hope it does not

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.260 
they say that and I hope it does not
include<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.310> execution<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:44.970> hope<00:04:45.060> they're<00:04:45.240> not

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
include the execution I hope they're not

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.790 
include the execution I hope they're not
counting<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.230> total<00:04:46.350> i<00:04:46.530> guess<00:04:46.710> would

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
counting that so in total i guess would

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.950 
counting that so in total i guess would
be<00:04:46.880> three<00:04:47.880> game<00:04:48.150> types<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.750> will<00:04:48.870> be

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
be three game types that will be

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.740 
be three game types that will be
introduced<00:04:49.440> in<00:04:49.590> dlc<00:04:50.100> but<00:04:50.940> that<00:04:51.420> is<00:04:51.570> the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
introduced in dlc but that is the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.050 
introduced in dlc but that is the
biggest<00:04:51.990> thing<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.680> i<00:04:53.220> think<00:04:53.520> probably

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
biggest thing that i think probably

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.910 
biggest thing that i think probably
status<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:54.720> i<00:04:54.810> are<00:04:54.990> going<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.290> hammer<00:04:55.560> on<00:04:55.710> on

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
status and i are going to hammer on on

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.770 
status and i are going to hammer on on
