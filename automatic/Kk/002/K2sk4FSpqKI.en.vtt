it's going to be my second man and I'm
getting<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.540> basically<00:03:47.140> what<00:03:47.530> I'm

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
getting to that basically what I'm

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.710 
getting to that basically what I'm
working<00:03:47.770> on<00:03:48.010> is<00:03:48.070> bossing<00:03:48.850> on<00:03:49.030> two<00:03:49.270> characters

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
working on is bossing on two characters

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.800 
working on is bossing on two characters
so<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.170> can<00:03:50.470> generate<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.920> lot<00:03:51.130> of<00:03:51.160> money<00:03:51.280> because

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
so I can generate a lot of money because

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.270 
so I can generate a lot of money because
you<00:03:52.810> sell<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.350> boss<00:03:53.500> drops<00:03:53.770> you<00:03:53.950> get<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.130> lot<00:03:54.250> of

you sell the boss drops you get a lot of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.920 
you sell the boss drops you get a lot of
money<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:54.700> yeah<00:03:55.120> that's<00:03:55.239> what<00:03:55.450> my<00:03:55.480> current
