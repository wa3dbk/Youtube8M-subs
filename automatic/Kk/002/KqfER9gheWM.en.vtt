00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
well it's called no L because it doesn't

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
well it's called no L because it doesn't
have<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.770> L<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> name<00:00:44.760> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.090> came<00:00:45.300> to

like I'm not sure that I accomplished
that<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> no<00:00:53.640> L<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:55.110> has

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that but there is no L in it and it has

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.020 
that but there is no L in it and it has
a<00:00:55.289> little<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.860> Christmas<00:00:56.129> touch<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
a little bit of Christmas touch to it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.770 
a little bit of Christmas touch to it
but<00:00:57.870> yeah<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.789> came<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.149> well

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
but yeah that's how that came about well

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.840 
but yeah that's how that came about well
I<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> idea<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:02.010> off<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:07.850> okay

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
I got the idea right off when you okay

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.800 
I got the idea right off when you okay
so<00:01:08.909> tell<00:01:09.390> us<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.430> constructed<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> well<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so tell us how you constructed it well a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.830 
so tell us how you constructed it well a
couple<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> parts<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.909> machine<00:01:15.479> or

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
couple of the parts here are machine or

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
couple of the parts here are machine or
paper<00:01:16.470> pieced<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
paper pieced and then because I'm a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
paper pieced and then because I'm a
little<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:18.780> afraid<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> curved<00:01:19.590> piecing<00:01:20.070> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
little bit afraid of curved piecing I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.160 
little bit afraid of curved piecing I
actually<00:01:20.400> appliquéd<00:01:21.119> these<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.960> went

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
actually appliquéd these all went

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
actually appliquéd these all went
together<00:01:22.400> just<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.970> top<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> other

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
together just one on top of the other

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.969 
together just one on top of the other
and<00:01:24.659> then<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.780> actually<00:01:25.080> applicated<00:01:25.860> these

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and then I actually applicated these

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.370 
and then I actually applicated these
sections<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> background<00:01:27.360> fabric<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
sections on to the background fabric and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
sections on to the background fabric and
you<00:01:28.829> did<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.340> couching<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.060> something<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you did a lot of couching of something I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990 
you did a lot of couching of something I
did<00:01:30.689> yeah<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
did yeah I like to do that this is a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
did yeah I like to do that this is a
chronic<00:01:33.570> chronic<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.619> actually<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
chronic chronic it's actually a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.600 
chronic chronic it's actually a
needlepoint<00:01:35.600> thread<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.680> couched<00:01:37.950> down

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
needlepoint thread that I couched down

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149 
needlepoint thread that I couched down
I<00:01:38.640> believe<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.659> either<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.290> by<00:01:40.380> machine<00:01:40.860> or

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I believe I either do it by machine or

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.310 
I believe I either do it by machine or
by<00:01:41.220> hand<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.240> think<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.540> did<00:01:42.689> both<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.020> those<00:01:43.110> by

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
by hand I think I did both of those by

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.569 
by hand I think I did both of those by
machine<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.979> depending<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
machine just depending on the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.679 
machine just depending on the
application<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.689> other<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.140> black<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
application the other the black is a

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.530 
application the other the black is a
crochet<00:01:48.689> cotton<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.000> noticed<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
crochet cotton and and I noticed that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.569 
crochet cotton and and I noticed that
you<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.320> thread<00:01:52.649> pretty<00:01:53.040> well<00:01:53.280> on

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you can see the thread pretty well on

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.710 
went one way and one went another way
which<00:03:17.770> was<00:03:17.980> fine<00:03:18.250> when<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:18.910> was<00:03:19.150> head<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.510> top

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
which was fine when I was head the top

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.360 
which was fine when I was head the top
but<00:03:19.930> then<00:03:20.050> when<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.260> started<00:03:20.590> quilting<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:21.130> that

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
but then when I started quilting it that

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.160 
but then when I started quilting it that
sort<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:21.760> showed<00:03:22.000> up<00:03:22.240> so<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.540> actually<00:03:22.750> had<00:03:23.050> to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
sort of showed up so I actually had to

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.530 
sort of showed up so I actually had to
go<00:03:23.290> back<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.709> block<00:03:24.370> individually<00:03:25.330> these

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
go back and block individually these

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.080 
go back and block individually these
letters<00:03:26.050> like<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.800> put<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.459> my<00:03:27.640> table<00:03:27.850> and

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
letters like I put it on my table and

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.640 
letters like I put it on my table and
wet<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.480> down<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.870> just<00:03:28.900> block<00:03:29.350> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
wet it down and just block the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.199 
wet it down and just block the
individual<00:03:30.220> letters<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.120> would

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
individual letters so that that would

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.940 
individual letters so that that would
all<00:03:31.390> stay<00:03:31.630> straight<00:03:31.990> okay<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.680> know<00:03:32.920> that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
all stay straight okay you know that
