00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
where the water that comes in would

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.300 
where the water that comes in would
drain<00:00:23.970> out<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.539> they're<00:00:25.320> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.650> deep<00:00:25.859> it's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
drain out but they're kind of deep it's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.240

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
really got a deep sidewall on it so it's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.060 
really got a deep sidewall on it so it's
kind<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.699> being<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:31.070> convertible

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

take<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> top<00:00:34.590> down<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.700> still<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
take the top down but it's still the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.200 
take the top down but it's still the
same<00:00:36.300> depth<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> regular<00:00:38.190> sit<00:00:39.030> in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
same depth as just like a regular sit in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.590 
same depth as just like a regular sit in
kayak<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> most<00:00:40.739> part<00:00:41.040> some<00:00:41.390> but<00:00:42.390> that's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
kayak for the most part some but that's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.250 
kayak for the most part some but that's
it<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:43.649> waiting<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.660> weather<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.020> clear

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it I'm waiting for the weather to clear

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020 
it I'm waiting for the weather to clear
up<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.039> take<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> lake

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
up so I can go take it out on the lake

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.060 
up so I can go take it out on the lake
and<00:00:48.239> try<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> fish<00:00:49.350> finder<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.890> have

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and try out the fish finder I do have

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
and try out the fish finder I do have
the<00:00:50.250> anchor<00:00:51.059> trolley<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.570> need<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> put<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the anchor trolley that I need to put on

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.310 
the anchor trolley that I need to put on
over<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.969> and<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.059> couple<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.449> decals<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
over here and a couple of decals just to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.720 
over here and a couple of decals just to
personalize<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
personalize it but I think it's going to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.750 
personalize it but I think it's going to
be<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> good<00:00:57.030> little<00:00:57.270> boat<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:58.370> just<00:00:59.370> wanted<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
be a good little boat I just wanted to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.349 
be a good little boat I just wanted to
show<00:01:00.140> if<00:01:01.140> you're<00:01:01.320> trying<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> troll<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
show if you're trying to troll this is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.330 
show if you're trying to troll this is
an<00:01:03.480> ultra<00:01:03.840> light<00:01:04.049> pole<00:01:07.939> it'll<00:01:08.939> fit<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:10.340> think

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
an ultra light pole it'll fit I think

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.590 
an ultra light pole it'll fit I think
it'd<00:01:11.490> probably<00:01:11.729> work<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.450> other

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it'd probably work in other

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.649 
it'd probably work in other
configurations<00:01:13.590> too<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:16.729> this<00:01:17.729> does<00:01:18.450> have

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
configurations too but this does have

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:28.520 
configurations too but this does have
like<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.140> guard<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:27.229> anyways<00:01:28.229> that's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
like a little guard there anyways that's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.390 
like a little guard there anyways that's
my<00:01:28.619> that's<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.430> rig<00:01:31.040> wouldn't<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.340> able

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
my that's my rig wouldn't really be able

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.200 
my that's my rig wouldn't really be able
to<00:01:32.549> see

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
to see

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.510 
the compass I figure I'm going to use
that<00:01:37.990> one<00:01:38.230> for<00:01:38.260> when<00:01:38.740> I'm<00:01:38.890> paddling<00:01:39.280> to

another location and I'll use these two

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.250 
another location and I'll use these two
for<00:01:41.710> my<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:43.000> take<00:01:43.210> three<00:01:43.510> poles<00:01:43.750> with<00:01:44.050> me
