00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.040

 beautiful paris and have us there 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.599
 finally the new ricoh looked at this time 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.520
 we were able to test the game longer 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.680
 to see the rpg aspect 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.300
 more about that and what 's for individual 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.779
 stacks tells you now game 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.970
 designer julien garrett i a thing the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.160
 we're here on the retro press tour 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.660
 Show paris today is like that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.480
 gameplay changed between the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.469
 individual specifications 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.450
 Specifications are simply the ones 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.290
 Development of the vehicles we are in 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.300
 have a game 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
 every vehicle has up to five 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.280
 different levels of development 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 the first is street the streets 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.550
 Specification is the reason 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.829
 Specification and perfect for 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.590
 road racing times is very suitable 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.660
 fast and has a good driving behavior 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.000
 the second specification we have 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.949
 the dirt there you get in new york 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.229
 and it allows you out of the tracks and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.960
 often German drivers the third 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.549
 Specification can be found in Miami in the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.860
 it's all about performance 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.409
 it's extremely extravagant it's about 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.700
 big spoiler and a lot of power 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.619
 the top speed is 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.939
 Unbelievable but the driving behavior is 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.850
 when something inaccurate 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.770
 the fourth specification will raid 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.049
 called and that is my favorite 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.150
 it's all offroad received no 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.009
 dÃ¶rr tracks just drive off and everyone 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.100
 centimeters of the map we discover for 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.689
 you have designed the last one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.360
 Specification we have here in paris 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.700
 first show is called circus here 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.790
 it's about the ideal line to exact 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.950
 So if you are a phase nation fan 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.939
 are this development is the best for 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.530
 challenge you every event and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.960
 every mission to the goal will reward you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.570
 not only with experience and money 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.100
 but also with performance parts and 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.040
 as I have said many times 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.170
 I have every car 91 piece puzzle 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.680
 eleven parts of which are performance parts 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.500
 are 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.060
 These are things you gain upgraded 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.520
 or in challenge 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.209
 to have the best car out there and 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.440
 that is the meaning behind the rpg thoughts 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.819
 the time you play with 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.250
 it can actually happen 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.620
 on a self to a car on the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.599
 to get maximum level and at all 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.380
 It will be about 20 missions 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.390
 take hours 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.640
 but if you still have the skills to do it all 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.590
 find collectibles and the others 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.440
 Events makes you have more and more 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.880
 invest time and that is only now 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.310
 pulled on a car 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.620
 a car is like a character a rpg 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.980
 you can also upgrade other cars and 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.730
 there you can then 40 50 60 100 hours 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.739
 spend 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.390
 Do you have a passion for driving and driving ? 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.319

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.319

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.810
 The new work crew is supposed to be in the third 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.250
 quarterly 2014 will appear and will us 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.900
