00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
been started about three months but in

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.629 
been started about three months but in
this<00:00:09.570> position<00:00:10.019> because<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.230> has<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> flat<00:00:10.590> tire

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
this position because it has a flat tire

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.680 
this position because it has a flat tire
but<00:00:11.639> I'm<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> limpid<00:00:12.059> down<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> low<00:00:12.480> lame

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
but I'm a limpid down to the low lame

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.060 
but I'm a limpid down to the low lame
because<00:00:12.960> it's<00:00:13.200> kind<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.469> out<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.040> public

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
because it's kind of out here in public

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.259 
because it's kind of out here in public
and<00:00:14.429> someone<00:00:14.670> could<00:00:14.759> put<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> battery<00:00:15.030> and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
and someone could put a battery and

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.090 
and someone could put a battery and
still<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.289> put<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.470> truck<00:00:16.650> battery<00:00:17.010> in

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
still it I just put the truck battery in

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.980 
still it I just put the truck battery in
it<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.400> we're<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> start<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.720> hasn't

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
it and we're going to start it hasn't

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.980 
it and we're going to start it hasn't
been<00:00:19.050> started<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.619> three<00:00:20.130> months<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.990> probably

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
been started in three months so probably

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
been started in three months so probably
going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> conk<00:00:22.439> out<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.980> couple<00:00:23.160> times<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.670> think

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
going to conk out a couple times I think

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.730 
going to conk out a couple times I think
I'll<00:00:24.510> probably<00:00:24.779> should<00:00:25.050> drain<00:00:25.320> all<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.500> gas

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I'll probably should drain all the gas

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.490 
I'll probably should drain all the gas
out<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:27.150> let<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.359> burn<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.920> not<00:00:28.920> too<00:00:29.130> old

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
out of it or let it burn it not too old

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.090 
out of it or let it burn it not too old
