the hid side these heads of lettuce are

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.330 
the hid side these heads of lettuce are
21<00:00:26.430> days<00:00:26.640> old<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.240> far<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.810> they're<00:00:28.650> growing

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
21 days old so far and they're growing

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.220 
21 days old so far and they're growing
quite<00:00:29.550> nicely<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.300> pretty<00:00:30.510> happy<00:00:30.840> with<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
quite nicely and pretty happy with the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.370 
quite nicely and pretty happy with the
progress<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.859> far<00:00:32.510> this<00:00:33.510> side<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> chamber

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
progress so far this side of the chamber

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.450 
progress so far this side of the chamber
is<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.649> 81<00:00:35.100> degrees

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
is at 81 degrees

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.549 
is at 81 degrees
it<00:00:35.850> went<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.300> 1<00:00:36.510> degrees<00:00:36.870> since<00:00:37.140> I've<00:00:37.260> had<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it went up 1 degrees since I've had the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.340 
it went up 1 degrees since I've had the
fans<00:00:37.800> off<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:39.120> between<00:00:39.510> 5<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.200> 6

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
fans off but it's between 5 and 6

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.220 
fans off but it's between 5 and 6
degrees<00:00:40.829> hotter<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> HID<00:00:42.540> lights<00:00:42.899> than

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
degrees hotter with the HID lights than

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.770 
degrees hotter with the HID lights than
the<00:00:43.350> LED<00:00:43.710> lights<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.270> lettuce<00:00:45.270> doesn't<00:00:45.629> like

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the LED lights and lettuce doesn't like

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
the LED lights and lettuce doesn't like
heat<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.070> something<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> I'm

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
heat so it's something that I'm

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.490 
heat so it's something that I'm
constantly<00:00:48.180> battling<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.170> keep<00:00:49.410> cool

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
constantly battling with to keep cool

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.630 
constantly battling with to keep cool
and<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.280> plants<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.449> LED<00:00:54.960> side

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
and here are the plants on the LED side

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.889 
and here are the plants on the LED side
also<00:00:56.989> 21<00:00:57.989> days<00:00:58.230> old<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.690> progressing<00:01:00.690> quite

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
also 21 days old and progressing quite

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.600 
also 21 days old and progressing quite
nicely<00:01:03.170> just<00:01:04.170> back<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.549> you

nicely just back up a little bit so you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.039 
nicely just back up a little bit so you
could<00:01:05.909> take<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> look<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> plants

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
could take a look at all the plants

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.090 
could take a look at all the plants
these<00:01:07.799> plants<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> bottom<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:10.100> Adrianna

real<00:01:44.310> quick<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.149> energy<00:01:45.630> usage<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.470> far<00:01:47.780> so

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
real quick is the energy usage so far so

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.679 
real quick is the energy usage so far so
far<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.770> LEDs<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.640> used<00:01:50.939> two<00:01:51.180> dollars<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
far the LEDs have used two dollars and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the camera up this way let's take a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.410 
the camera up this way let's take a
second<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.770> show<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.729> other<00:02:05.850> thing<00:02:06.210> about

second to show you one other thing about

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.229 
second to show you one other thing about
the<00:02:06.840> HID<00:02:07.290> lights<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.099> don't<00:02:08.879> want<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> have

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the HID lights that I don't want to have

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.430 
the HID lights that I don't want to have
to<00:02:09.390> deal<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.720> anymore

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to deal with anymore

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.830 
to deal with anymore
excited<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.370> LEDs<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.060> work<00:02:12.240> out<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.690> that

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
excited for the LEDs to work out so that

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.680 
excited for the LEDs to work out so that
I<00:02:12.870> don't<00:02:12.990> have<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.590> are<00:02:14.370> these<00:02:14.580> big<00:02:15.060> ballasts

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
I don't have to are these big ballasts

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.740 
I don't have to are these big ballasts
just<00:02:16.110> these<00:02:16.320> are<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:17.670> giant<00:02:17.850> batteries<00:02:18.450> and

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
just these are like giant batteries and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.350 
just these are like giant batteries and
they<00:02:19.440> hold<00:02:19.860> an<00:02:20.010> electrical<00:02:20.490> charge<00:02:20.700> even<00:02:21.000> when

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
they hold an electrical charge even when

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.870 
they hold an electrical charge even when
they're<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:21.570> plugged<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.250> would<00:02:23.670> rather

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
they're not plugged in so I would rather
