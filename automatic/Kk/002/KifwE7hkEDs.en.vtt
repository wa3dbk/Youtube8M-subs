run eight miles per hour now he's did

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.600 
run eight miles per hour now he's did
some<00:02:08.280> research<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.830> chickens<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:11.430> run

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
some research and chickens can run

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.540 
some research and chickens can run
faster<00:02:12.000> Nate<00:02:12.180> miles<00:02:12.390> per<00:02:12.600> hour<00:02:12.950> house<00:02:13.950> like

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
faster Nate miles per hour house like

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.400 
faster Nate miles per hour house like
mouses

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
mouses

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.470 
mouses
like<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:16.460> know<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.640> think<00:02:16.940> mouse<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.270> really

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
like you know you think mouse is really

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.420 
like you know you think mouse is really
fast<00:02:17.750> but<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.650> only<00:02:18.800> because<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.070> accelerate

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
fast but it's only because I accelerate

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.610 
fast but it's only because I accelerate
so<00:02:19.790> fast<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.540> ran<00:02:20.750> 100<00:02:21.110> meter<00:02:21.260> racing

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
so fast but if you ran 100 meter racing

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.530 
so fast but if you ran 100 meter racing
it's<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.800> mouse<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.880> would<00:02:23.000> absolutely<00:02:23.210> rape

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
it's a mouse you would absolutely rape

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.620 
it's a mouse you would absolutely rape
it<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.240> run<00:02:26.390> about<00:02:28.030> 10<00:02:29.030> miles<00:02:29.240> per<00:02:29.420> hour

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
it then you run about 10 miles per hour

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.250 
it then you run about 10 miles per hour
and<00:02:29.870> then<00:02:30.410> pigs<00:02:30.920> run<00:02:31.760> about<00:02:32.030> 17<00:02:32.810> kilometers

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
and then pigs run about 17 kilometers

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.860 
and then pigs run about 17 kilometers
per<00:02:33.290> hour<00:02:33.470> which<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:33.920> about<00:02:34.600> 11<00:02:35.600> miles<00:02:35.750> per

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
per hour which is about 11 miles per

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.220 
per hour which is about 11 miles per
hour<00:02:36.020> something<00:02:36.230> like<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.500> but<00:02:37.250> now<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.230> see

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
hour something like that but now I see

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.710 
hour something like that but now I see
this<00:02:39.860> game<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.280> saying<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:41.150> van<00:02:41.420> buiten

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
this game is saying that van buiten

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.250 
this game is saying that van buiten
couldn't<00:02:42.590> outrun<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.430> chicken<00:02:44.260> basically

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
couldn't outrun a a chicken basically

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.170 
couldn't outrun a a chicken basically
and<00:02:45.470> Philippe<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.790> rest<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.030> those<00:02:47.090> guys

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and Philippe and the rest of those guys

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.970 
and Philippe and the rest of those guys
and<00:02:47.450> co-pays<00:02:47.900> would<00:02:48.050> be<00:02:48.170> about<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.560> same<00:02:48.680> pace

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
and co-pays would be about the same pace

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.790 
and co-pays would be about the same pace
of<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.340> chicken<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.330> race<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.620> just

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
of the chicken in a race that is just

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.580 
of the chicken in a race that is just
ridiculous<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.700> by<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:53.720> video<00:02:54.080> give<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.500> a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
ridiculous so by this video give it a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.450 
ridiculous so by this video give it a
like<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:56.450> really<00:02:56.750> shouldn't<00:02:56.990> be<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.470> larger

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
like it really shouldn't be this larger

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.090 
like it really shouldn't be this larger
