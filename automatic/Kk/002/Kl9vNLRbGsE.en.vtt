00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
game starts out on a ship so the ships

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
game starts out on a ship so the ships
toss<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.900> side<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.229> side<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.490> overall

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
toss in side to side and the overall

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.609 
toss in side to side and the overall
movement<00:01:39.509> speed<00:01:39.750> has<00:01:39.900> slowed<00:01:40.110> down<00:01:40.259> because

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
movement speed has slowed down because

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
movement speed has slowed down because
of<00:01:40.829> some<00:01:41.130> water<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> then

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
of some water that you're in and then

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.060 
of some water that you're in and then
also<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.259> fact<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.619> there's<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> low

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
also the fact that there's a low

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
also the fact that there's a low
framerate<00:01:44.369> by<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> time<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> got<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
framerate by the time I got to the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.740 
framerate by the time I got to the
island<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:47.880> feeling<00:01:48.119> genuinely

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
island I was I was feeling genuinely

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.039 
island I was I was feeling genuinely
nauseous<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.720> watching

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
nauseous it was it was like watching

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.319 
nauseous it was it was like watching
some<00:01:52.470> kind<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.130> pregnancy<00:01:53.520> video<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
some kind of you know pregnancy video I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.170 
some kind of you know pregnancy video I
just<00:01:54.600> by<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.170> point<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.920> almost<00:01:56.520> ready<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
just by that point I was almost ready to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.630 
just by that point I was almost ready to
put<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> game<00:01:57.869> down<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.110> continued<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
put the game down I continued on I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.240 
put the game down I continued on I
tripped<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.630> honestly<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.799> those<00:02:01.920> people

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
tripped on but honestly for those people

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.010 
tripped on but honestly for those people
who<00:02:02.340> are<00:02:02.430> frame<00:02:02.729> rate<00:02:03.000> susceptible<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:03.840> who

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
who are frame rate susceptible or who

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.539 
who are frame rate susceptible or who
have<00:02:04.140> issues<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.560> frame<00:02:04.920> rate<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.310> would

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
have issues with frame rate I would

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880 
have issues with frame rate I would
highly<00:02:06.119> suggest<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.840> steam<00:02:07.110> purchase<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.710> this

I said you have the quests that are I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.500 
I said you have the quests that are I
feel<00:02:21.140> far<00:02:21.560> more<00:02:21.950> tied<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.360> actual

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
feel far more tied in with the actual

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.830 
feel far more tied in with the actual
story<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.440> how<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:24.890> do<00:02:25.250> things<00:02:25.490> like<00:02:25.790> at<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
story and how you do things like at the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.810 
story and how you do things like at the
starting<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.290> think<00:02:27.320> it's<00:02:27.650> level<00:02:27.980> 2<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.460> put<00:02:28.700> up

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
starting I think it's level 2 you put up

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.290 
starting I think it's level 2 you put up
fences<00:02:29.360> later<00:02:30.020> on<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.470> defend<00:02:30.920> areas<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.700> felt

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
fences later on you defend areas it felt

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.570 
fences later on you defend areas it felt
it<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.620> felt<00:02:33.800> like<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> quests<00:02:34.460> were

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
it just it felt like the quests were

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000 
it just it felt like the quests were
tied<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:34.910> with<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.180> game<00:02:35.390> in<00:02:36.350> in<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.800> more

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
tied in with the game in in a more

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.580 
tied in with the game in in a more
detailed<00:02:37.640> way<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.420> really<00:02:38.930> did<00:02:39.110> enjoy<00:02:39.260> that

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
detailed way and I really did enjoy that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.990 
detailed way and I really did enjoy that
and<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.220> don't<00:02:40.280> know<00:02:40.460> if<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.610> was<00:02:40.700> just<00:02:40.850> my

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and I don't know if it was just my

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.610 
and I don't know if it was just my
character<00:02:41.360> though<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.900> swear<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> God<00:02:42.410> I

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
character though but I swear to God I

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.870 
character though but I swear to God I
felt<00:02:42.800> like<00:02:42.950> my<00:02:43.070> character<00:02:43.400> was<00:02:43.460> giving<00:02:43.760> birth

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
felt like my character was giving birth

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.800 
felt like my character was giving birth
it<00:02:44.180> was<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:44.990> difficult<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:46.210> attack<00:02:47.210> and<00:02:47.540> fight

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
it was so difficult to attack and fight

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.650 
it was so difficult to attack and fight
and<00:02:48.020> defend<00:02:48.470> against<00:02:48.920> characters<00:02:49.820> or<00:02:50.330> against

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
and defend against characters or against

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.900 
and defend against characters or against
the<00:02:50.720> enemy<00:02:51.080> without<00:02:51.800> running<00:02:52.160> out<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.370> stamina

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
the enemy without running out of stamina

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.660 
the enemy without running out of stamina
so<00:02:53.330> quickly<00:02:53.960> and<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.710> was<00:02:54.800> just<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.100> oh<00:02:55.280> my

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
so quickly and it was just like oh my

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.490 
so quickly and it was just like oh my
god<00:02:56.210> it<00:02:56.540> was<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:56.660> running<00:02:57.170> through<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
god it was like running through the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.250 
god it was like running through the
level<00:02:57.830> with<00:02:57.980> weights<00:02:58.280> on<00:02:58.490> your<00:02:58.520> legs<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.780> was

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
level with weights on your legs it was

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.200 
level with weights on your legs it was
and<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:00.950> think<00:03:01.250> that's<00:03:01.400> also<00:03:01.580> tied<00:03:01.910> into<00:03:02.120> that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
and I think that's also tied into that

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.090 
and I think that's also tied into that
framerate<00:03:02.540> issue<00:03:02.870> where<00:03:03.290> everything<00:03:04.070> just

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
framerate issue where everything just

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.400 
framerate issue where everything just
feels<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.730> little<00:03:04.760> weightier<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.540> little<00:03:05.990> slower

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
feels a little weightier a little slower

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.730 
feels a little weightier a little slower
and<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:07.360> installed<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.540> as<00:03:08.690> well<00:03:09.260> as<00:03:09.410> played<00:03:09.620> it

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
and I installed it as well as played it

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.170 
and I installed it as well as played it
off<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.980> disk<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.370> both<00:03:10.520> had<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.820> same<00:03:10.850> issue

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
off the disk and both had the same issue

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.940 
off the disk and both had the same issue
it<00:03:11.900> was<00:03:12.020> cool<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.380> they<00:03:12.470> had<00:03:12.590> some<00:03:12.800> new

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
it was cool that they had some new

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.130 
it was cool that they had some new

new ways to handle them also ignore the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.160 
new ways to handle them also ignore the
first<00:03:28.880> level<00:03:29.180> where<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.450> game<00:03:29.600> tries<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.990> take

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
gameplay but I think a rental is usually

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.220 
gameplay but I think a rental is usually
a<00:06:22.669> better<00:06:22.850> idea<00:06:23.360> when<00:06:23.540> it<00:06:23.660> comes<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.050> game

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
a better idea when it comes to a game

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.010 
a better idea when it comes to a game
like<00:06:24.470> this<00:06:24.800> I<00:06:25.280> would<00:06:26.060> suggest<00:06:26.270> wait<00:06:26.750> for<00:06:26.960> a

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020
