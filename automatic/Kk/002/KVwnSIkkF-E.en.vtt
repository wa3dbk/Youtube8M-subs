00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.680
 yes hello people 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.450
 This video is about the one addressed is one of 15 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.200
 and although I've ever brought a video out but now just stop again 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.259
 to bring out more current 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.469
 Parnell - cheerful too 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.669
 As I said the iPhone 5 will be a team September release on the 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.619
 thirtieth of september 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.449
 and yes we imagined you get for example then the garden or too 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.810
 Stop right in October 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.189
 Picture of his hand 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.689
 the new display 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.250
 that will either be 4 inches tall or at least three grief 7 inches and from 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.840
 a hd resolution of a thousand many sandstone 27 g 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.760
 added should then come a new processor 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.500
 which is already installed on the iPad 2 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.380
 namely the a5 dual-core processors 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.400
 for more power 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.050
 then of course it makes sense to the memory again 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.970
 enlarge 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.820
 and the unit should run with a gigabyte of memory so twice as 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.740
 much like the iPhone 4 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.880
 fourth for the iPhone 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.320
 by the way, he still only displays three Core 5 inches from the display 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.900
 beside 3000 to Dirk 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.570
 then all come with the retina display 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.820
 Yes, then Mr. Dopingfalle is said to have new camera income as well very 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 probably 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.620
 but then you have to look 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.950
 the video recording will remain the first 27 g 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.320
 like the iPhone 4 or on 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.280
 whether you can now record on full-hd, such as Samsung Galaxy s2 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.720
 on the land Konter but the new operating system 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.790
 that comes there was just then it was because it was very likely that 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.909
 the iPhone 5 then he would have released on the 30 Santander 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.210
 That's why it's your own 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.300
 and then come again to the video recording 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.770
 if the then really without template recording Fulda the video footage 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.170
 would wrap up 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.530
 if we are very very useful also 64 gigabytes of memory so festival speakers 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.500
 to do one 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.420
 The NDR info warehouse record Spree percent of the face already very very much 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.730
 Memory way 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.120
 Reasons if you have already two games standards is often and then 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.259
 he already takes 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.059
 No, and Ringier far away 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.959
 so 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.959
 it's very much in storage by 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.249
 and that's why he turns down Feix 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.879
 will wrap up a full hd video recording 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.229
 then they also need to increase the disk space 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.229
 Paisley is definitely more likely to expand that 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.249
 then the iPhone will get 5 natural black 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.199
 and also in white and the percent white role he will probably be something 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199
 come out later than the iPhone 5 in black 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.359
 yes then there's still a percent of a thing to give such an adapter 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.789
 for the HDMI output 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.039
 Leon you have to look again so if you have them before Ali 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.789
 Would take video recordings 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.709
 then we also have such a HDMI output 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.230
 or necessary because then you can et geet net dÃ©ck be the full hd videos 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.979
 look at five or the TV 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:03.409
 the coat persisted / yes that was then a video several hours has fallen 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.809
 Dittmann Dornburg we were looking for a channel already alerted to the 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:07.239
 next time
