turbo<00:01:12.650> which<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.159> don't<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.729> why<00:01:14.909> they<00:01:15.119> did

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
turbo which is I don't know why they did

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.730 
turbo which is I don't know why they did
that<00:01:15.299> maybe<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.350> case<00:01:16.470> they're<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that maybe just in case they're on a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.910 
that maybe just in case they're on a
ball-bearing<00:01:16.950> turbos<00:01:17.220> later<00:01:17.869> anyway<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
ball-bearing turbos later anyway and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.830 
ball-bearing turbos later anyway and
they<00:01:20.100> sent<00:01:20.369> us<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:23.009> drain<00:01:23.460> bung<00:01:25.640> is

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
they sent us this and this drain bung is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
they sent us this and this drain bung is
one<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.380> looks<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.400> designed<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
one that I looks like it's designed to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.410 
one that I looks like it's designed to
not<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.869> welded<00:01:31.759> like<00:01:32.960> we<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:35.420> this

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
not have to be welded like we have this

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.830 
not have to be welded like we have this
piece<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.520> rubber<00:01:38.759> washer<00:01:39.360> here

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
piece and a little rubber washer here

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.870 
piece and a little rubber washer here
and<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> nut<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.759> rubber

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and we have a nut with a little rubber

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.460 
and we have a nut with a little rubber
washer<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.630> looks<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.350> want

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
washer so it looks like they just want

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.039 
washer so it looks like they just want
us<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> drill<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> hole<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.520> our<00:01:44.640> pan<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.240> then

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
us to drill a hole in our pan and then

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.109 
us to drill a hole in our pan and then
put<00:01:49.049> these<00:01:49.229> together<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> nice<00:01:50.520> real<00:01:50.880> tight

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
put these together get a nice real tight

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.810 
put these together get a nice real tight
seal<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.220> weld

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
seal on it so we don't have to like weld

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.440 
seal on it so we don't have to like weld
it<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.590> tap<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.829> or<00:01:56.040> anything<00:01:56.280> which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.240> pretty
