00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
within the next booster set we could be

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.880 
within the next booster set we could be
getting<00:00:21.890> three<00:00:22.520> completely<00:00:23.180> different

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
getting three completely different

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.830 
getting three completely different
potentially<00:00:24.890> tier<00:00:25.190> one<00:00:25.460> decks<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.060> that

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
potentially tier one decks and that

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.630 
potentially tier one decks and that
doesn't<00:00:27.170> happen<00:00:27.260> very<00:00:27.410> often<00:00:27.740> in<00:00:28.010> fact<00:00:28.040> I<00:00:28.430> kind

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
doesn't happen very often in fact I kind

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.370 
doesn't happen very often in fact I kind
of<00:00:28.820> struggle<00:00:29.240> to<00:00:29.390> think<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.840> any<00:00:30.080> other

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
of struggle to think of any other

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.440 
of struggle to think of any other
example<00:00:30.980> outside<00:00:31.430> of<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:31.640> one<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:32.000> I<00:00:32.090> really

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
example outside of this one and I really

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.690 
example outside of this one and I really
couldn't<00:00:32.689> come<00:00:33.170> up<00:00:33.320> with<00:00:33.440> one<00:00:33.500> but<00:00:34.370> when<00:00:34.400> you

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
couldn't come up with one but when you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.610 
couldn't come up with one but when you
combine<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:35.150> with<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.540> pool<00:00:35.840> of<00:00:36.080> what<00:00:36.290> maybe

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
combine that with the pool of what maybe

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.250 
combine that with the pool of what maybe
eight<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.400> ten<00:00:37.760> high<00:00:38.150> competitive<00:00:38.780> level

yang zine can actually incorporate skill
drain<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.500> thought<00:02:18.920> about<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.310> was<00:02:19.430> like

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
drain and I thought about and I was like

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.910 
drain and I thought about and I was like
why<00:02:20.150> not<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.420> mean<00:02:20.780> all<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.260> monsters<00:02:21.650> trigger

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
why not I mean all the monsters trigger

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.740 
why not I mean all the monsters trigger
when<00:02:22.190> they<00:02:22.280> hit<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.490> graveyard<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.209> obviously

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
when they hit the graveyard so obviously

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.510 
when they hit the graveyard so obviously
there's<00:02:23.959> no<00:02:24.020> conflict<00:02:24.410> there<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.040> then

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
there's no conflict there and then

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.340 
there's no conflict there and then
they're<00:02:25.790> added<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.600> know<00:02:26.630> boost<00:02:26.990> effects

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
they're added you know boost effects

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.900 
they're added you know boost effects
that<00:02:27.470> they<00:02:27.620> get<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.800> synchro<00:02:28.340> monsters<00:02:28.760> that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
that they get to synchro monsters that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.070 
that they get to synchro monsters that
are<00:02:28.970> summoned<00:02:29.390> when<00:02:29.540> they're<00:02:29.690> used<00:02:29.900> as

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
are summoned when they're used as

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.770 
are summoned when they're used as
materials<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.880> isn't<00:02:32.090> negated<00:02:32.660> by

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
materials you know that isn't negated by

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.750 
materials you know that isn't negated by
skill<00:02:33.080> drain<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.530> obviously<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.310> know<00:02:34.400> green

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
skill drain so obviously you know green

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.970 
skill drain so obviously you know green
light<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.450> hell<00:02:36.200> are<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.470> doing<00:02:36.709> want<00:02:36.890> to

light on that hell are you doing want to

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.740 
light on that hell are you doing want to
step<00:02:37.160> deeper<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:37.880> like<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.420> synchro

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
step deeper and it's like if you synchro

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.479 
step deeper and it's like if you synchro
summon<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.050> monster<00:02:39.140> using<00:02:39.590> bixie<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.130> mean

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
summon the monster using bixie I mean

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.160 
summon the monster using bixie I mean
the<00:02:40.610> monsters<00:02:40.970> not<00:02:41.150> even<00:02:41.360> affected<00:02:41.780> by<00:02:41.870> skill

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
the monsters not even affected by skill

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.570 
the monsters not even affected by skill
drain<00:02:42.350> at<00:02:42.500> all<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:42.770> it's<00:02:42.920> like<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.160> can<00:02:43.340> still

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
about that now I do understand that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.600 
about that now I do understand that
obviously<00:02:48.170> skill<00:02:48.560> drain<00:02:48.830> you're<00:02:49.250> gonna<00:02:49.400> lose

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
they do have the unlimited pot of

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.460 
they do have the unlimited pot of
avarice<00:05:26.180> for<00:05:26.630> their<00:05:26.720> art<00:05:26.870> types<00:05:27.110> so<00:05:27.229> it's<00:05:27.349> like

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
avarice for their art types so it's like

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.529 
avarice for their art types so it's like

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
if you need to see go for the beaters

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.870 
if you need to see go for the beaters
and<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:30.080> know<00:05:30.200> you<00:05:30.260> fall<00:05:30.620> into<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:31.310> warning<00:05:31.760> or

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
and you know you fall into a warning or

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.190 
and you know you fall into a warning or
something<00:05:31.910> like<00:05:32.270> that<00:05:32.330> you're<00:05:32.780> really<00:05:32.990> going

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
something like that you're really going

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.170 
something like that you're really going
to<00:05:33.260> be<00:05:33.380> able<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.650> recover<00:05:33.950> ever<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:34.550> nicely<00:05:34.760> so

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
to be able to recover ever so nicely so

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.270 
to be able to recover ever so nicely so
I<00:05:35.389> think<00:05:35.720> that<00:05:35.960> it<00:05:36.169> balances<00:05:36.320> out<00:05:36.710> again<00:05:37.130> I

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
I think that it balances out again I

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.159 
I think that it balances out again I
think<00:05:37.700> that<00:05:37.910> it's<00:05:38.180> a<00:05:38.330> legitimate<00:05:38.780> option

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
think that it's a legitimate option

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.800 
think that it's a legitimate option
because<00:05:39.770> I<00:05:40.099> look<00:05:40.520> at<00:05:40.700> decks<00:05:40.970> like<00:05:41.180> hat<00:05:41.479> and

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
because I look at decks like hat and

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.350 
because I look at decks like hat and
sylvans<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:42.650> infernity<00:05:42.979> and<00:05:43.430> it's<00:05:43.550> like<00:05:43.789> okay

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
sylvans and infernity and it's like okay

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.080 
sylvans and infernity and it's like okay
if<00:05:44.930> I<00:05:45.050> flip<00:05:45.260> over<00:05:45.530> skill<00:05:45.770> drain<00:05:46.010> the<00:05:46.760> fuck<00:05:46.940> are

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
if I flip over skill drain the fuck are

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.490 
if I flip over skill drain the fuck are
you<00:05:47.180> gonna<00:05:47.300> do<00:05:47.539> you<00:05:47.810> not<00:05:47.960> I<00:05:47.990> mean<00:05:48.139> like<00:05:48.349> you

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500
