00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.250
 ghostly so to speak 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.510

 quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.780
 because someone 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.780
 miner 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.080

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.220

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.680

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:24.870
 good deeds do not think probably maybe 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:27.390

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.700

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.920
 it does not guarantee so I think 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:43.610

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:48.180
