seeing such a large fo be in a halo game
it<00:00:20.820> might<00:00:20.910> look<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.180> little<00:00:21.300> bit<00:00:21.449> strange<00:00:21.890> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
it might look a little bit strange you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.990 
it might look a little bit strange you
also<00:00:23.010> might<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.369> seeing<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:23.760> bit<00:00:23.850> of

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
also might be seeing a little bit of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
also might be seeing a little bit of
stuttering<00:00:24.390> lag<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:24.990> halo<00:00:25.230> 2<00:00:25.410> recording

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
stuttering lag in the halo 2 recording

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.650 
stuttering lag in the halo 2 recording
the<00:00:26.279> x3<00:00:26.609> doesn't<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:26.970> play<00:00:27.119> very<00:00:27.390> nicely

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the x3 doesn't really play very nicely

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
the x3 doesn't really play very nicely
halo<00:00:28.050> 2<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.380> makes<00:00:28.560> aiming<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.130> bit

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
halo 2 it makes aiming a little bit

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.060 
halo 2 it makes aiming a little bit
awkward<00:00:29.730> kind<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.119> stutters<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.750> there

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
awkward kind of stutters here and there

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.440 
awkward kind of stutters here and there
so<00:00:32.070> no<00:00:32.219> that's<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.820> compatibility<00:00:33.390> issue

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
so no that's just a compatibility issue

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
so no that's just a compatibility issue
between<00:00:33.809> my<00:00:34.140> recording<00:00:34.590> program<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.070> halo<00:00:35.370> 2

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

pretty faithful recreation of halo 2's
lockout<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.840> surprisingly<00:01:21.840> enough<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
lockout and surprisingly enough this

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
lockout and surprisingly enough this
does<00:01:22.560> actually<00:01:22.830> work<00:01:23.040> very<00:01:23.549> well<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.880> killing

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
does actually work very well for killing

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
does actually work very well for killing
floor<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.840> wouldn't<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> would<00:01:25.409> work

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
floor you wouldn't think it would work

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649 
floor you wouldn't think it would work
very<00:01:25.770> well<00:01:26.009> normally<00:01:26.670> multiplayer<00:01:27.090> maps<00:01:27.330> kind

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
very well normally multiplayer maps kind

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
very well normally multiplayer maps kind
of<00:01:27.720> feel<00:01:28.640> normally<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.909> don't<00:01:30.060> really

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
of feel normally they just don't really

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.480 
of feel normally they just don't really
work<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.869> game<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.590> sort<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.189> based

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
work for a game that's sort of way based

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.880 
work for a game that's sort of way based
like<00:01:32.700> killing<00:01:33.030> floor<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.930> lockouts<00:01:34.650> case

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
like killing floor but in lockouts case

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.590 
like killing floor but in lockouts case
it<00:01:35.070> does<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.670> he<00:01:35.939> turned<00:01:36.240> down<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it does very well he turned down the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120 
it does very well he turned down the
gravity<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:38.009> no

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
gravity just a little bit there's no

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.950 
gravity just a little bit there's no
fall<00:01:38.369> damage<00:01:38.700> there's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.299> lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> ways<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> get

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
fall damage there's a lot of ways to get

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
fall damage there's a lot of ways to get
around<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.320> map<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> ways<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.159> get

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
around this map a lot of ways to get

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.450 
around this map a lot of ways to get
away<00:01:41.490> from<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.970> specimens<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.159> overall<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
away from the specimens and overall the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.770 
away from the specimens and overall the
playstyle<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.970> actually<00:01:45.119> works<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:45.570> well

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
playstyle just actually works very well

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.770 
playstyle just actually works very well
and<00:01:46.170> an<00:01:46.890> interesting<00:01:47.130> fact<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.850> day<00:01:47.880> since

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and an interesting fact of the day since

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
and an interesting fact of the day since
killing<00:01:49.200> floor<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.409> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.619> based<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> mod

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
killing floor was kind of based on a mod

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
killing floor was kind of based on a mod
from<00:01:51.060> an<00:01:51.210> engine<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.720> 2004<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
from an engine from 2004 which is the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460 
from an engine from 2004 which is the
same<00:01:53.189> year<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> halo<00:01:53.790> 2<00:01:54.000> came<00:01:54.180> out<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.570> almost

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
same year the halo 2 came out I almost

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
same year the halo 2 came out I almost
want<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> say<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.280> halo<00:01:56.460> 2<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.149> advanced

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
want to say that halo 2 is more advanced

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.780 
want to say that halo 2 is more advanced
graphically<00:01:58.200> than<00:01:58.380> killing<00:01:59.040> 4<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.369> which<00:01:59.759> is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
graphically than killing 4 is which is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.270 
graphically than killing 4 is which is
really<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.479> odd<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:01.320> yeah

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
really really odd to think about yeah

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
really really odd to think about yeah
very<00:02:02.520> faithful<00:02:02.969> recreation<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.509> skybox<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
very faithful recreation the skybox a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200 
very faithful recreation the skybox a
little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:05.040> bit<00:02:05.310> different<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:05.939> in

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
little bit a little bit different but in

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.999 
little bit a little bit different but in
general<00:02:06.630> did<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.439> pretty<00:02:07.590> damn<00:02:07.770> good<00:02:07.829> job

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
general did a pretty damn good job

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.760 
general did a pretty damn good job
whoever<00:02:08.369> made<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.539> applaud<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
whoever made this so I applaud you and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.790 
whoever made this so I applaud you and
there's<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> end<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> video
