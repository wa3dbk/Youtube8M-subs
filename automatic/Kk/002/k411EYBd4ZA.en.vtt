00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
step forward we are really developing

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.520 
step forward we are really developing
ways<00:00:10.790> to<00:00:10.850> approach<00:00:11.660> the<00:00:11.930> six<00:00:12.139> scale<00:00:12.290> stuff

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
ways to approach the six scale stuff

ways to approach the six scale stuff
that<00:00:12.769> we<00:00:12.889> had<00:00:12.980> never<00:00:13.130> really<00:00:13.490> thought<00:00:13.670> we<00:00:13.849> were

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
that we had never really thought we were

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.220 
that we had never really thought we were
going<00:00:14.059> to<00:00:14.120> get<00:00:14.210> into<00:00:14.480> when<00:00:14.960> we<00:00:15.080> originally

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
going to get into when we originally

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.080 
going to get into when we originally
started<00:00:15.530> this<00:00:15.800> process<00:00:16.009> we're<00:00:16.759> going<00:00:16.939> to<00:00:17.000> be

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
started this process we're going to be

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.400 
started this process we're going to be
hitting<00:00:17.270> a<00:00:17.360> lot<00:00:17.480> of<00:00:17.660> other<00:00:17.779> characters<00:00:18.230> that<00:00:18.349> I

hitting a lot of other characters that I
don't<00:00:18.619> think<00:00:18.770> people<00:00:18.920> are<00:00:19.099> expecting<00:00:19.550> us<00:00:19.670> to

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
don't think people are expecting us to

sort of the end result this piece has
got<00:00:53.300> articulation<00:00:54.260> galore<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:55.340> can<00:00:55.520> pose<00:00:55.789> it

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
got articulation galore you can pose it

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.000 
got articulation galore you can pose it
in<00:00:56.239> all<00:00:56.539> manner<00:00:56.989> of<00:00:57.140> action<00:00:57.620> poses<00:00:57.829> that

in all manner of action poses that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.069 
in all manner of action poses that
actually<00:00:58.460> kind<00:00:58.610> of<00:00:58.640> make<00:00:58.879> sense<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.570> look

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
actually kind of make sense and look

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.299 
actually kind of make sense and look
like<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:00.440> character<00:01:00.770> has<00:01:00.920> some<00:01:01.100> real

what we saw in the clone wars animated
series<00:01:06.500> showing<00:01:07.369> him<00:01:07.580> as<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.759> very<00:01:08.000> lethal<00:01:08.360> very

quick fast chiller droid which is
exactly<00:01:11.390> what<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.560> for<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.770> robot<00:01:13.250> that

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520

is essentially it was almost a prop in
the<00:01:16.939> real<00:01:17.119> film<00:01:17.390> we've<00:01:18.049> taken<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.680> put<00:01:19.159> as

when I saw the designs for our legendary
skill<00:05:50.280> bust<00:05:50.610> range<00:05:50.970> I<00:05:51.300> was<00:05:51.930> a<00:05:51.960> skeptic<00:05:52.229> Tom

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
skill bust range I was a skeptic Tom

skill bust range I was a skeptic Tom
tasked<00:05:53.819> us<00:05:53.909> with<00:05:53.970> a<00:05:54.150> challenge<00:05:54.599> of<00:05:54.810> coming<00:05:55.259> up

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
tasked us with a challenge of coming up

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.770 
tasked us with a challenge of coming up
with<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.680> new<00:05:55.979> style<00:05:56.340> of<00:05:56.490> bust<00:05:56.729> basically<00:05:57.330> what

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
with a new style of bust basically what

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.950 
with a new style of bust basically what
is<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.310> sort<00:05:59.310> of<00:05:59.520> magic<00:06:00.180> of<00:06:00.330> that<00:06:00.509> scale<00:06:00.840> of

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
is the sort of magic of that scale of

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.680 
is the sort of magic of that scale of
format<00:06:01.349> breaks<00:06:02.280> the<00:06:02.460> traditional<00:06:03.090> bust<00:06:03.330> mold

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
format breaks the traditional bust mold

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.050 
format breaks the traditional bust mold
and<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.800> still<00:06:05.129> retains<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.789> sort<00:06:06.000> of

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
and it still retains the sort of

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.730 
and it still retains the sort of
expectation<00:06:06.659> of<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:06.810> bust<00:06:07.020> we<00:06:07.440> went<00:06:07.590> through

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
expectation of the bust we went through

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.439 
expectation of the bust we went through
several<00:06:08.039> variations<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.849> finally<00:06:09.240> came<00:06:09.419> up

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
several variations and finally came up

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.740 
several variations and finally came up
with<00:06:09.599> just<00:06:09.990> this<00:06:10.319> awesome<00:06:11.599> variation<00:06:12.599> on

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
with just this awesome variation on

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.050 
with just this awesome variation on
busts<00:06:13.289> were<00:06:13.560> it's<00:06:13.770> we're<00:06:13.949> using<00:06:14.220> the<00:06:14.490> cloak<00:06:14.819> as

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
busts were it's we're using the cloak as

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.790 
busts were it's we're using the cloak as
the<00:06:15.360> support<00:06:15.720> mechanism<00:06:16.259> and<00:06:16.440> a<00:06:16.500> design

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
the support mechanism and a design

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.860 
the support mechanism and a design
mechanism<00:06:17.430> and<00:06:17.580> it's<00:06:17.970> cut<00:06:18.210> in<00:06:18.240> such<00:06:18.569> a<00:06:18.599> way

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
mechanism and it's cut in such a way

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.450 
mechanism and it's cut in such a way
that<00:06:18.900> if<00:06:19.169> you<00:06:19.259> look<00:06:19.409> at<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.860> almost<00:06:20.069> looks

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
that if you look at it it almost looks

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.830 
that if you look at it it almost looks
like<00:06:20.550> it<00:06:20.759> shouldn't<00:06:20.970> balance<00:06:21.419> it<00:06:21.630> almost

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
like it shouldn't balance it almost

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.360 
like it shouldn't balance it almost
looks<00:06:22.199> like<00:06:22.349> it<00:06:22.470> shouldn't<00:06:22.740> be<00:06:22.830> supported

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
looks like it shouldn't be supported

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.189 
looks like it shouldn't be supported
because<00:06:23.759> the<00:06:24.090> cloak<00:06:24.360> gets<00:06:24.630> really<00:06:24.900> thin<00:06:25.169> and

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
because the cloak gets really thin and

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.740 
because the cloak gets really thin and
the<00:06:25.650> bust<00:06:25.919> and<00:06:26.099> the<00:06:26.220> shoulders<00:06:26.610> are<00:06:26.849> larger<00:06:27.630> up

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
the bust and the shoulders are larger up

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.149 
the bust and the shoulders are larger up
on<00:06:27.930> top<00:06:28.110> and<00:06:28.319> it<00:06:28.409> almost<00:06:28.560> looks<00:06:28.860> like<00:06:29.009> it's

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
on top and it almost looks like it's

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:30.770 
on top and it almost looks like it's
defying<00:06:29.490> gravity<00:06:30.000> it's<00:06:30.180> definitely<00:06:30.360> got<00:06:30.659> more

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
defying gravity it's definitely got more

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.960 
defying gravity it's definitely got more
body<00:06:31.050> and<00:06:31.319> shape<00:06:31.530> to<00:06:31.770> it<00:06:31.800> but<00:06:32.520> it<00:06:32.610> was<00:06:32.699> a<00:06:32.729> little

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
body and shape to it but it was a little

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.029 
body and shape to it but it was a little
bit<00:06:33.240> you<00:06:33.930> know<00:06:33.960> design<00:06:34.380> there's<00:06:34.770> a<00:06:34.860> lot<00:06:34.889> of

bit you know design there's a lot of

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.490 
bit you know design there's a lot of
style<00:06:35.370> in<00:06:35.639> that<00:06:36.030> then<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:37.139> piece<00:06:37.319> was
