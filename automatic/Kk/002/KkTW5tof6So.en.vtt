so<00:00:04.580> in<00:00:04.670> this<00:00:04.790> video<00:00:05.000> I'm<00:00:05.240> going<00:00:05.359> to<00:00:05.420> walk

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:05.479 
so in this video I'm going to walk

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:08.790 
so in this video I'm going to walk
through<00:00:05.930> the<00:00:06.080> dynamic<00:00:06.680> re<00:00:07.009> size<00:00:07.340> of<00:00:07.760> a<00:00:08.120> VHDX

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 
through the dynamic re size of a VHDX

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.990 
through the dynamic re size of a VHDX
virtual<00:00:09.800> hard<00:00:10.040> drive<00:00:10.190> that's<00:00:10.429> connected<00:00:10.969> to

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
virtual hard drive that's connected to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.080 
virtual hard drive that's connected to
the<00:00:11.300> scuzzy<00:00:11.630> bus<00:00:11.860> so<00:00:12.860> demonstrate<00:00:13.519> this<00:00:13.700> all<00:00:14.030> I

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
the scuzzy bus so demonstrate this all I

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.370 
the scuzzy bus so demonstrate this all I
have<00:00:14.480> is<00:00:14.780> a<00:00:15.200> basic<00:00:15.620> virtual<00:00:16.010> machine<00:00:17.080> of<00:00:18.080> a<00:00:18.199> win

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
have is a basic virtual machine of a win

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.040 
have is a basic virtual machine of a win
eight<00:00:18.529> and<00:00:18.769> it's<00:00:19.070> non<00:00:19.220> domain<00:00:19.550> joined<00:00:19.960> if<00:00:20.960> I

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
eight and it's non domain joined if I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.739 
eight and it's non domain joined if I
look<00:00:21.230> at<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:21.380> settings<00:00:21.829> I<00:00:22.189> have<00:00:22.489> a<00:00:23.119> single

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:23.749 
look at the settings I have a single

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.599 
look at the settings I have a single
disk<00:00:24.019> connected<00:00:24.409> to<00:00:24.679> discuss<00:00:24.980> you<00:00:25.130> control<00:00:25.429> us

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
disk connected to discuss you control us

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.489 
disk connected to discuss you control us
there<00:00:25.819> is<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:25.909> requirement<00:00:26.329> it<00:00:26.929> has<00:00:27.109> to<00:00:27.259> be<00:00:27.349> the

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.499 
there is a requirement it has to be the

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.200 
there is a requirement it has to be the
HDX<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.099> it<00:00:28.249> has<00:00:28.429> to<00:00:28.579> be<00:00:28.669> connected<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.060> the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
HDX and it has to be connected to the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.040 
HDX and it has to be connected to the
scuzzy<00:00:29.539> controller

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
scuzzy controller

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.499 
scuzzy controller
it<00:00:30.499> cannot<00:00:30.710> be<00:00:30.769> VHD<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:31.789> cannot<00:00:31.999> be<00:00:32.149> connected

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
it cannot be VHD it cannot be connected

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.619 
it cannot be VHD it cannot be connected
to<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.720> IDE<00:00:33.020> controller<00:00:34.269> so<00:00:35.269> right<00:00:35.420> now<00:00:35.570> this

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
to the IDE controller so right now this

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.259 
to the IDE controller so right now this
is<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.809> 60<00:00:36.199> gigabyte<00:00:36.590> disk<00:00:36.859> and<00:00:37.190> inside<00:00:38.090> the

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
is a 60 gigabyte disk and inside the

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.209 
is a 60 gigabyte disk and inside the
operating<00:00:38.660> system<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.440> can<00:00:39.710> see<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.269> 60<00:00:41.269> gig<00:00:41.420> disk

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
operating system I can see a 60 gig disk

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.590 
operating system I can see a 60 gig disk
now<00:00:43.219> without<00:00:43.550> turning<00:00:44.030> this<00:00:44.120> virtual<00:00:44.570> machine

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
now without turning this virtual machine

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.900 
now without turning this virtual machine
off<00:00:45.079> I<00:00:45.620> can<00:00:45.949> actually<00:00:46.070> go<00:00:46.340> in<00:00:46.489> for<00:00:46.699> example

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
off I can actually go in for example

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.430 
off I can actually go in for example
into<00:00:47.449> edit<00:00:47.899> disk

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
into edit disk

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.069 
into edit disk
I<00:00:49.809> can<00:00:50.809> select<00:00:50.989> disk<00:00:51.379> I<00:00:51.500> wanna<00:00:51.649> modify<00:00:53.019> so<00:00:54.019> I

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
I can select disk I wanna modify so I

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.369 
I can select disk I wanna modify so I
select<00:00:54.440> its<00:00:54.710> drive<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.769> can<00:00:57.949> say<00:00:58.160> I<00:00:58.429> want<00:00:58.640> to

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
select its drive and I can say I want to

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.459 
select its drive and I can say I want to
expand<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:00.440> drive<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:02.109> let's<00:01:03.109> say<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:03.289> make

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
expand that drive and let's say I make

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.840 
expand that drive and let's say I make
you<00:01:03.649> 80<00:01:03.920> gigabytes<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:06.070> finish<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:07.760> is

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
you 80 gigabytes and finish so this is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.450 
you 80 gigabytes and finish so this is
now<00:01:07.970> extending<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:08.690> VHDX<00:01:09.350> file<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.220> while

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
now extending that VHDX file and while

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.860 
now extending that VHDX file and while
I'm<00:01:10.580> now<00:01:10.760> I'll<00:01:10.880> see<00:01:11.120> within<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.480> operating

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
I'm now I'll see within the operating

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.920 
I'm now I'll see within the operating
system<00:01:13.000> is<00:01:14.000> now<00:01:14.270> there's<00:01:14.480> an<00:01:14.570> unallocated

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
system is now there's an unallocated

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.190 
system is now there's an unallocated
space<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:17.270> would<00:01:17.450> then<00:01:17.510> have<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.810> use<00:01:18.020> that

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
space and I would then have to use that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.150 
space and I would then have to use that
IVA<00:01:18.440> creating<00:01:19.010> a<00:01:19.190> new<00:01:19.400> volume<00:01:19.640> or<00:01:20.060> for<00:01:20.810> example

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
IVA creating a new volume or for example

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.760 
IVA creating a new volume or for example
extending<00:01:22.160> this<00:01:22.640> existing<00:01:23.210> volume<00:01:23.650> so<00:01:24.650> if<00:01:24.710> I

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
extending this existing volume so if I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.450 
extending this existing volume so if I
say<00:01:24.920> extend<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:27.290> maybe<00:01:27.500> I'll<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:27.830> extend<00:01:28.100> it

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
say extend and maybe I'll just extend it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.590 
say extend and maybe I'll just extend it
out<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:29.530> some<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.650> it<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:33.350> take<00:01:33.590> half<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.010> it<00:01:34.600> now

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
out to some of it so take half of it now

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.290 
out to some of it so take half of it now
I<00:01:35.630> want<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:35.960> shrink<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.590> volume<00:01:37.030> like<00:01:38.030> once

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
I want to shrink a volume like once

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.300 
I want to shrink a volume like once
again<00:01:38.600> go<00:01:38.900> back<00:01:39.110> into<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.920> edit<00:01:40.250> disk<00:01:42.310> select

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
again go back into that edit disk select

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.850 
again go back into that edit disk select
the<00:01:43.550> same<00:01:43.760> disk<00:01:44.030> again

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.860 

and<00:01:49.730> this<00:01:49.850> have<00:01:50.000> noses<00:01:50.180> give<00:01:50.420> me<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.570> shrink

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
and this have noses give me a shrink

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.840 
and this have noses give me a shrink
option<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.770> visa<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.130> giving<00:01:52.370> me<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.580> shrink

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
option the visa is giving me the shrink

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.220 
option the visa is giving me the shrink
operation<00:01:53.240> as<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.420> quickly<00:01:53.660> looked<00:01:53.990> at<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
operation as it quickly looked at the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.200 
operation as it quickly looked at the
disk<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:55.340> could<00:01:55.460> actually<00:01:55.640> see<00:01:56.060> we'll

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
disk and it could actually see we'll

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.330 
disk and it could actually see we'll
look<00:01:56.360> there<00:01:56.630> some<00:01:56.900> allocated<00:01:57.740> space

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
look there some allocated space

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.490 
look there some allocated space
I<00:01:58.370> can<00:01:58.850> only<00:01:58.910> shrink<00:01:59.360> this<00:01:59.660> down<00:01:59.720> to<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.350> man

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
I can only shrink this down to the man

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.490 
I can only shrink this down to the man
of<00:02:00.650> unallocated<00:02:01.160> space<00:02:01.550> that's<00:02:01.970> available

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
of unallocated space that's available

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.660 
of unallocated space that's available
this<00:02:03.500> time<00:02:03.710> they're<00:02:03.830> saying<00:02:04.040> well<00:02:04.160> yeah<00:02:04.400> you

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
this time they're saying well yeah you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.370 
this time they're saying well yeah you
could<00:02:04.880> shrink<00:02:05.120> it<00:02:05.360> or<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.600> could<00:02:05.750> grow<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.110> and

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
could shrink it or you could grow it and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.540 
could shrink it or you could grow it and
the<00:02:07.310> most<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:07.790> can<00:02:07.970> shrink<00:02:08.210> it<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.440> down<00:02:10.340> to

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
the most you can shrink it to is down to

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.670 
the most you can shrink it to is down to
70<00:02:10.940> gigabytes<00:02:11.510> because<00:02:12.020> it's<00:02:12.260> Nasik<00:02:12.590> you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
70 gigabytes because it's Nasik you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.120 
70 gigabytes because it's Nasik you
drive<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.730> there's<00:02:13.880> 10<00:02:14.150> gigs<00:02:14.420> spell

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
drive and there's 10 gigs spell

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.170 
drive and there's 10 gigs spell
so<00:02:16.130> there's<00:02:16.310> shrink<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.700> down<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.940> would<00:02:17.000> make

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
so there's shrink it down it would make

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.720 
so there's shrink it down it would make
it<00:02:17.330> disappear<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:19.130> look<00:02:19.400> at<00:02:19.610> that

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
it disappear I can look at that

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.680 
it disappear I can look at that
information<00:02:20.090> through<00:02:20.810> PowerShell<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.450> can

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
information through PowerShell so I can

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.130 
information through PowerShell so I can
actually<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.500> git<00:02:25.010> VHD<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.959> one<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
actually do a git VHD and one of the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.449 
actually do a git VHD and one of the
things<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.500> will<00:02:27.620> actually<00:02:27.860> show<00:02:28.100> me<00:02:28.280> is

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
things that will actually show me is

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.390 
things that will actually show me is
that<00:02:28.640> minimum<00:02:29.030> size<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:31.010> it's<00:02:31.100> actually<00:02:31.310> gonna

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
that minimum size so it's actually gonna

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.210 
that minimum size so it's actually gonna
show<00:02:31.730> me<00:02:31.910> what<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:32.510> shrink<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.990> by<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:34.040> also

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
show me what I can shrink it by it also

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.920 
show me what I can shrink it by it also
shows<00:02:34.550> me<00:02:34.580> what<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.330> currently<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.900> configured

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
shows me what it currently is configured

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.490 
shows me what it currently is configured
as<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.810> maybe<00:02:38.990> this<00:02:39.080> isn't<00:02:39.380> quite

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
as and that maybe this isn't quite

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.170 
as and that maybe this isn't quite
always<00:02:40.400> we're<00:02:40.550> normally<00:02:40.820> we're<00:02:40.940> looking

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
always we're normally we're looking

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.880 
always we're normally we're looking
gigabytes<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.260> numbers<00:02:42.530> look<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.709> little

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
gigabytes so the numbers look a little

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.540 
gigabytes so the numbers look a little
bit<00:02:42.980> differently

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
bit differently

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.070 
bit differently
I<00:02:43.580> see<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.390> amount<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.600> disk<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.930> actually

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
I see the amount of disk is actually

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.500 
I see the amount of disk is actually
using<00:02:45.790> from<00:02:46.790> here<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.390> could<00:02:47.780> also<00:02:48.260> shrink<00:02:48.770> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
using from here I could also shrink it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.050 
using from here I could also shrink it
so<00:02:50.510> notice<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.930> can<00:02:50.990> do<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> resize<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.910> I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
so notice I can do a resize and just I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.810 
so notice I can do a resize and just I
can<00:02:53.300> specify<00:02:53.510> bytes<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.410> could<00:02:55.100> actually<00:02:55.190> say

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
can specify bytes I could actually say

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.070 
can specify bytes I could actually say
size<00:02:56.300> bytes<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.769> give<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.160> specific<00:02:58.459> size<00:02:59.120> or

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
size bytes to give it a specific size or

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.870 
size bytes to give it a specific size or
I<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.590> say<00:03:00.739> well<00:03:00.860> it'll<00:03:01.010> shrink<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.459> as<00:03:01.580> much

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
I can say well it'll shrink it as much

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.509 
I can say well it'll shrink it as much
as<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.060> possibly<00:03:02.570> can<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:04.130> I'll<00:03:04.190> run<00:03:04.310> that

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
as you possibly can so I'll run that

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.150 
as you possibly can so I'll run that
command<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.180> if<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.930> jump<00:03:06.170> back<00:03:06.260> inside<00:03:06.980> the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
command and if I jump back inside the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.680 
command and if I jump back inside the
operating<00:03:07.550> system<00:03:08.380> once<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.530> refreshes<00:03:13.690> there

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
operating system once it refreshes there

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.020 
operating system once it refreshes there
we<00:03:14.780> go<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.170> now<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:16.010> see<00:03:16.100> it's<00:03:16.220> gone<00:03:16.340> if<00:03:16.610> I

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
we go and now you can see it's gone if I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.820 
we go and now you can see it's gone if I
wanted<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.360> shrink<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.840> further<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.530> would<00:03:18.620> have

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
wanted to shrink it further I would have

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.610 
wanted to shrink it further I would have
to<00:03:18.980> first<00:03:19.250> make<00:03:19.790> more<00:03:20.269> space<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.930> allocated

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
to first make more space and allocated

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.400 
to first make more space and allocated
so<00:03:22.280> I'd<00:03:22.340> have<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.580> go<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.970> say<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.810> shrink<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
so I'd have to go in say to shrink the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.259 
so I'd have to go in say to shrink the
actual<00:03:24.739> volume<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.340> checking<00:03:25.610> how<00:03:25.850> much<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.150> can

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
actual volume is checking how much I can

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.330 
actual volume is checking how much I can
shrink<00:03:26.420> this<00:03:26.570> volume<00:03:26.959> by<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.130> will<00:03:28.220> look

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
shrink this volume by so it will look

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.009 
shrink this volume by so it will look
let's<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.640> try<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.030> shrink<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.450> by<00:03:31.780> 20<00:03:32.780> gigs

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
let's just try and shrink it by 20 gigs

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.930 
let's just try and shrink it by 20 gigs
it's<00:03:33.890> now<00:03:34.070> I'll<00:03:34.280> see<00:03:34.489> there<00:03:34.640> should<00:03:34.820> be

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
it's now I'll see there should be

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.410 
it's now I'll see there should be
another<00:03:35.360> 20<00:03:35.870> gigs<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.320> allocated<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.670> then<00:03:38.390> I

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
another 20 gigs and allocated and then I

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.680 
another 20 gigs and allocated and then I
could<00:03:38.600> go<00:03:38.780> back<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:40.130> if<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.060> do<00:03:41.120> might<00:03:41.420> get

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
could go back and if I do might get

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.759 
could go back and if I do might get
again<00:03:43.690> notice<00:03:44.690> it's<00:03:44.810> now<00:03:44.930> say<00:03:45.110> well<00:03:45.260> now<00:03:45.470> this

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
again notice it's now say well now this

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.580 
again notice it's now say well now this
is<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.100> minimum<00:03:46.400> size<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:47.900> could<00:03:48.170> shrink<00:03:48.380> it

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
is the minimum size so I could shrink it

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.900 
is the minimum size so I could shrink it
again<00:03:51.130> move<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.340> down

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
again move that down

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.180 
again move that down
I<00:03:52.940> want<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:53.930> skin<00:03:54.080> when<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.260> go<00:03:54.410> inside<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.769> OS

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
I want to skin when I go inside the OS

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.000 
I want to skin when I go inside the OS
once<00:03:55.459> this<00:03:55.670> refresh<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.299> its<00:03:57.170> neck<00:03:57.380> on<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:57.920> it's

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
once this refresh is its neck on so it's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.100 
once this refresh is its neck on so it's
dynamic<00:03:58.310> resize<00:03:58.640> very<00:03:59.270> very<00:03:59.450> easy<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.930> use
