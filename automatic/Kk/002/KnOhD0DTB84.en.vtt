down right there on a mic stand and then

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.890 
down right there on a mic stand and then
since<00:04:13.520> it<00:04:13.640> weighs<00:04:13.850> so<00:04:14.120> much<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:14.480> it<00:04:14.540> tips<00:04:14.780> the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.480 
I have a penny board on one of the feet
to<00:04:20.390> counteract<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.989> weight<00:04:21.020> so<00:04:21.590> it's<00:04:22.160> crazy

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
to counteract the weight so it's crazy

lighter<00:04:24.320> so<00:04:24.440> my<00:04:25.400> penny<00:04:25.640> board<00:04:25.880> can<00:04:26.120> stay<00:04:26.360> in

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
lighter so my penny board can stay in

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.120 
lighter so my penny board can stay in
