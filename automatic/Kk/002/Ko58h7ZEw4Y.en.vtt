00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.910
 hi musicophiles today we propose a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:23.610
 very particular pedal is the petra of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:25.320
 clara effects the petra as we have 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.329
 said is a pedal produced by effects of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.160
 clara thank maximum pastors for 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.290
 having provided us with this specimen for the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.510
 our video review is a pedal 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.210
 very special because it is based on a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.609
 phase rather a visa phase as it is said 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.000
 just above the power LED though 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.949
 also incorporates another very feature 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.679
 interesting that is that of a gate that 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.050
 allows us this sms coming 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.329
 quoted precisely above that allows us 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.559
 to have really special sounds 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.890
 as you have already heard 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.859
 in the introduction is definitely between the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.289
 noise is the handsome casino appraiser 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.890
 from the instance the air wants to go a little 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.409
 out of the ordinary but also with some 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.590
 almost synthesizer sound for 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.300
 some verses that maybe combined with others 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 modulation or environment pedals 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.160
 can really reach the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.290
 very very particular sounds and 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.150
 usable within a band 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.150
 well what to say let's hear it 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.619
 well 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.709
 all 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.159
 Go 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.310
 Well 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.180
 community 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.680
 the control of this penalty is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.590
 relatively simple we have a tone 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.090
 we have a general volume a switch of 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.360
 clipping that allows us to choose 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.840
 between a normal mode and more 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.100
 the base dough is open on the pedal 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.100
 is a main mode instead more 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.740
 saturated and compressed and then we have that 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.370
 relative to the gate that inserts on 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.470
 both modes this gate that gives 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.030
 this decisive dynamic cut there 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.239
 precisely allows these sounds a little 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.620
 crazy with whom surely the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.620
 fun guaranteed 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.539
 Now 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.180
 we found the tone control 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.770
 particularly effective because it works 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.960
 where the guitarist frequencies that 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.850
 that is, they live on the medium-high when the 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.070
 tone is completely closed the sound 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.140
 continues to pierce the mix is ​​not too much 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.310
 plugged in when it is completely open 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.310
 does not become annoying 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.430
 one of the most interesting things about 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.110
 this pedal will surely feel like 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.569
 behaves with overdrive buster 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.610
 distortions previously placed in 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.650
 effects chain we have in fact now a 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.819
 feel how it behaves with a truth 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.819
 it is transparent put before 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.629
 all 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.629
 here 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.760
 no 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.040
 but 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.870
 at this point I would say we can 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.730
 also a little fun with this gate 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.050
 let's add a little of her or rather a little 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.050
 of analog echo 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.120
 okay 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.610
 we conclude the review of the petra of 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.740
 clara effects pointing out that the 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.319
 Obviously percent pedal percent made 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.120
 in italy also hand made 

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.130
 the aesthetics is realized but not the pedals 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.599
 each specimen is painted with colors 

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.330
 different so you can choose 

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:05.580
 the one you like best and is a pedal 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.599
 obviously with selected components ed 

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.520
 ecru by pass 

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:10.229
 I hope you enjoyed this too 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.270
 review is as usual there 

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:14.270
 we find it on music of dot com
