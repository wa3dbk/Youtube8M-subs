00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.459
 failure to make my defense what a 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.840
 salvage from you would really be a little bit 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:28.440
 well maybe another happy score 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.110

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.450
 to put on 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.120

 IKEA is quite top- notch and street through it 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:38.270
 in the middle I would also just take my lap 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:42.290

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.590
 same as five 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.600
 I can still just win this 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.520
 Why do I need to score once and 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.490

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.500
 or ten minutes to go and I have 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.530

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.940
 give away more or give her a few again 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.610
 minutes directly 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.990
 this is going quite well and it is now 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.180

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.989
 five six wounded 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.270
 this was really a could so some people 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.160
 competitions that ever and play with feet 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.110
 and now I can go again with fresh courage 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.690
 in the following matches 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.660
 well i am curious what we found is us 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.050

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.550
 minbar am sima and glasses for further 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.390
 it is actually quite easy with me that 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.300
 three evenings are actually okay well you will 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.820
 luckily you see that a lot 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.790
 30th minute if I win this match 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.580
 will be very nice then I have one 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.580
 super starts in the vision here too because 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.950
 yes the way by kaboem penalty 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.920
 yes yes yes that was clearly the city 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.770
 well in the top right of course and again 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.100
 exactly in the green bar hopefully 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.100
 City 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.880
 no why where do you keep it with the keeper 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.800
 shit balls wit well it's russians now 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.900
 ketnet so I missed that penalty kick 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.610
 would luckily just have a zero for that 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.320
 and of course I hope I have that 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.330
 can hold on to the lead because then 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.290
 I just this episode twice 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.180
 won 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.910

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.130
 not true and he scores him 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.990
 no this tastes like everyone else has 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.180
 if I score deep in the tens 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.520
 I still stood before me that 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.050
 is not the case and I am back 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.970
 right now I have to go in again 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.669
 extra confirmed because I like myself now 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.130

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.810
 unfortunately not in him 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.419
 acquisition again yes look here 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.150
 Theology on bicycles should be anyway 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.150
 score not happen I 2 penalties 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.200
 in the shine is up through the middle 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.669
 and accidents is yes he is still sitting now 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.550
 20 minutes to go 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.320
 this should just succeed oh no no no 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.030
 no no no 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.960
 it was also a nice action mine 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:18.300
 ego again right knock on corrado 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.820
 yes that was my chance in the no so not 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.729
 1 or 1 on the keeper he missed like me 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.340
 cinema or I won anyway it is 2 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.970
 2 just one so unfortunately I no longer have 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.120
 can win 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.490
 So after recap, now four points in the vision 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.169
 4 and I still have eight games to go 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.820
 it goes pretty well and so far 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.160
 I also think that promotion needs to be done 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.720
 succeed and I have eight of the leather and 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.940
 half a thousand king that is decent 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.950
 what and of course you can go there again 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.000
 a fun player or play several fun 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.310
 for sorting out 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.229
 just let me know in the 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.450
 responses and the best response 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.220

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.120

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.160
 thumbs' up 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.710
 and of course the lock is you leave 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.780
 blowing it is over so that 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.249
 that private I just like I can with immediately 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:10.019
