00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Tonight we show that values 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.240
 Communication is always essential 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.890
 role in corporate communications 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 plays and that applies to the design of the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.870
 internally as well as externally 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.870
 communication 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.730
 So far , no experience could 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.140
 in the field swords communication 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.300
 that's why I'm so excited 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 Today we have the book today 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.680
 Smart targeting before that the strategies 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.480
 the values ​​of communication are explained and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.500
 methodically I will become today 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 evening talk about the topic as 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 registered brands company values 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
 can transport 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.760
 Today we will be the event of the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.190
 company short cuts about a live video 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.840
 webcast tolerate the advantage that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 all participants without installation 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.670
 to make and participate 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670
 can 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.039
 the guests are welcome 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.810
 methods directly on you and you 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.569
 Apply company and test 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.729
 playfully explore 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.079
 top athlete got used to me 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.450
 now immediately struck when I 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.420
 did not suspect that this 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.509
 bandwidth to values ​​not active and the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.530
 accuracy 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.850
 So I think it's a total for 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.780
 target groups and for your own 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.630
 Companies 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.310
 So I think you can already do that 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.979
 I can imagine that 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:55.280
 in my business consulting too 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.479
 but also integrate these brands 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.459
 Legal things when you play the game 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.780
 not busy and sometimes too 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.599
 see what you sign up for because brands 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.560
 you can actually quite interesting 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.229
 our engineering specialists from 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.229
 shortcuts today show augmented reality 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.789
 Application at the 3d worlds over mobile 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.789
 devices merge with reality 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.450
 this tool is certainly 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.450
 I like it so far as source of inspiration 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.870
 I am very good because you are relatively random 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.099
 can produce controlled forms 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.380
 Now we know where we are going 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:46.099
 need someone to find us that 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:48.060
 works the connections the 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.910
 was produced 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.410
 interesting i would like your event 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.330
 recommend simply for the reason 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.860
 because a lot of sympathetic people with 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.480
 a very profound one 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.340
 Background knowledge lectures here 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.080
