00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.869
 correct answer 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.900
 but I only need to emphasize my 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.660
 attention to the car as soon as everything 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.150
 It falls into place the same 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.949

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.219
 The first public debut of the sedan and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.350
 b8 wagon was held in 2014 on 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.660
 October Motor Show in Paris and in November 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.250
 Europeans could already buy new items 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.720
 the car is built on modular 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.819
 mqb platform 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.259
 which has previously managed at 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.690
 debut models like 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.580
 volkswagen golf seventh generation skoda 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.890

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.740
 compared to its predecessor new 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.479
 passat has gotten lower and lighter by whole 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.369
 eighty five kilogram volume 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.110
 luggage compartment also inspires 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.630
 respect 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.459
 586 liters in a sedan and a wagon 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.470
 more from 650 to 1700 80 liters instead 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.360
 new volkswagen passat eighth 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.940
 generation turned out to be defiant 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.280
 and aggressive not devoid of swift 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.500
 lines take a look just find slightly 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.739
 narrowed crystal lights 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.910
 car as if to challenge the driver 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:54.399
 and a new chrome grille 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.470
 underlines kids and swift image 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.020

 even with great desire you are not in a hurry 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.369
 the car looks expensive and solid 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.470
 frankly if jewelery cut 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.509
 exterior does not cause new models 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.519
 no doubt new would be 8 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.850
 really painted a clean slate 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.370
 then inside 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.970
 familiar vag 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.080
 besides the unusual futuristic 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.210
 visual design 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.610
 They say the digital panel is very convenient 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.980
 need help navigator dials 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.660
 complete highline 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.360
 the digital panel is already available in the vase of that 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.310
 do not have to pay anything in 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.520
 the rest of the interior is new 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.730

 its entire length is now in two parts and 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.690
 divide three horizontal stripes 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.260
 made in the style of the front grille 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.050
 radiator behind them are hidden air ducts and 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.630
 this is probably the only fresh 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.890
 designer touch also we see 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.870

 excellent instrument ergonomics pleasant 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.020
 By touch soft plastic and comfortable 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.660
 the seats 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.390
 create a car almost home comfort 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.250
 in fact, this is how it should be 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.190
 volkswagen das auto 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.220
 as for modern options, that is, b 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.750
 the eighth car and small truck 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.060
 I will not list everything just that 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.130
 advanced systems such as assistant 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.980
 lane assist lane assist 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.440

 dynamic light assist will be available for 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.549
 customers so turn around and 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.950
 spend money where 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.799
 can not be said about the choice of power 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.350
 there are only 3 aggregates to choose from and 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.750
 everything is interesting 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.000
 petrol versions are another bad 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.970
 the news is that the supply of new 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.890
 volkswagen passat b8 in the station wagon 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.110
 with beloved Belarusians diesel 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.390
 We are not planning a country for us 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.430
 Why so now we will take an interest in 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.450
 representative of the Belarusian dealer 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.910
 possibly 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.980
 a bunch of diesel and wagon will appear on 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.720
 our market, but those who wish will have to 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.640
 wait a little bit we are considering 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.910
 possibility of delivery model is presented 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.560
 three engines at the moment 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.990
 power starts 125 strength 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.800
 ends with 180 forces we think that 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.940
 dynamic characteristics of the supplied 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.770
 engines in principle will block 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.170
 needs of most potential 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.610
 owners of this car program 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.740
 sales can be submitted 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.700
 two-liter engine with different 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.840
 force levels are also possible 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.400
 presentation of a two-liter diesel 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.250
 engine also with varying degrees 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.770
 forces will traditionally be available 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.890
 three trim basic trendline 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.020
 average grade comfortline and so 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.390
 say down the highline ruler if 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.910
 talk about trim then uniqueness 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.490
 proposals for the passat model is 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.370
 that client can any 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.840
 complete set pick up any 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.380
 order picking 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.630
 Ordered with additional options in 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.569
 principle trendline equipment can be 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.639
 optional equipment 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.060
 catch up in before picking comfortline 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.770
 comfort to high line and so on difference 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.539
 can only be in the details in the finish 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.599
 interior in appearance 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:06.560
 if you compare the new model with 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.840
 the previous generation b7 you can 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.289
 say that new model in dollar 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.629
 terms became cheaper by about 45 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.479
 thousand dollars who will see the main 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:21.220
 competitor of the new b 8 in Belarusian 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.220
 the market if you look 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.900
 comparison of this model of this model on 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.180
 European market 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.740
 European journalists, they are 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:36.610
 compare the model passat b8 with cars 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.669
 premium segment and that's basically 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.250
 absolutely justified so we think 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.320
 what are the competitors of the car passat b8 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.940
 there will be cars from luxury 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.120
 the segments are usually German 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.120
 manufacturers 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.379
 know new passat good let my 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.259
 look with the release of a new generation he 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:04.960
 forever lost people's status but it 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:07.840
 only positively affect the image itself 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.539
 models personally, I am not in favor of 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.030
 circle of friends over and over again to remember 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:15.400
 reliable foreign cars from the nineties and 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:18.189
 praise their former reliability and 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.129
 low-cost service progress is not worth it 

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:24.460
 on the spot in Europe the wind has long blown 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:26.889
 change and it is good that even sometimes it 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.650
 breath is felt and it seems to me 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:32.080
 It is high time to understand and accept 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.479
 rejoice for those who can ride 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.419
 let not on this but new car 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:42.210
 thereby making the first step towards 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:42.210
 important change in your life
