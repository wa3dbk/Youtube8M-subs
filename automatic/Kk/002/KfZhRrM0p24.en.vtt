00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.259
 warning have been met 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.720
 prophecies that appear in the bible 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.840
 regarding the final time some 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.940
 skeptics say no others by faith 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.490
 blind in its various religions or 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.920
 philosophies believe yes but do not know 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.830
 they really can not prove it but 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.450
 effectively several biblical prophecies 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.030
 that tell us about this era have been 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.760
 already fulfilled and there are data 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.340
 to confirm the signals in progress 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.159
 there are references in various passages 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.679
 of the bible that are quite clear and 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.359
 precise to describe the events that 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.219
 they were to be the prelude to the 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.649
 arrival of a new stage for the 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.870
 humanity a stage marked by great 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.629
 events in all orders to 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 world level and while he is sitting in the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.449
 Mount of Olives the disciples are 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.579
 They approached part saying tell us when 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.549
 will these things be and what signal will there be 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.949
 your coming and the end of the century 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:04.070
 answering Jesus said to them look that 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.490
 nobody cheat you because many will come in 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.880
 my name saying I am the Christ and already 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.329
 much 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.270
 deceive and hear of wars and rumors 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.909
 of wars see what you do not turvey because 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.549
 it is necessary that all this happens 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.890
 but it is not yet the end because it 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.280
 will raise nation against nation and kingdom 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.369
 against kingdom and there will be plagues and famines and 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.560
 earthquakes in different places and everything 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:36.380
 this will be the beginning of pateo mateo 24 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.810
 18 in the Aramaic vernacular language as 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.909
 in the Hebrew there are twists of the language 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.030
 that being translated literally 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.479
 they change the meaning of that expression in 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.490
 the 1st century after the crucifixion 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.349
 many expected Jesus to return to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.689
 end of that same century 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:56.360
 Simon Pedro considered by many as 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.750
 the prince of the apostles had very 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.909
 clear the meaning of this expression 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.220
 so he explains to those who believed 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.429
 that Jesus was going to return before the end 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.920
 from that first century most loved ones do not 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.680
 ignore this that for the Lord one day is 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.780
 like a thousand years and a thousand years as a day to 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.600
 prevent his disciples from arriving 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.220
 of false christs and prophets jesus leave 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.590
 glimpse that his return would be in 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.620
 spirit thing that clarifies even more about 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.680
 verses later on then yes 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.230
 some will say look here is the christ 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.200
 or look there is not believe it 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.450
 24-23 we can then ensure in accordance 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.520
 to this that the presence of Christ in the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.910
 earth at the end of time 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.920
 it would not be material but spiritual physics 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.080
 subtle elevated 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.060
 later the period is described 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.550
 that was going to anticipate the opening of 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.190
 third time and with the sixth seal 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.170
 the references that we will give from here in 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.600
 forward they were extracted from the

 many nations and places on the globe will go 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.360
 turkey greece 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.970
 Algiers Japan and South America have suffered 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.160
 repeated and massive destructions 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.940
 caused by earthquakes 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.540
 Lisbon was destroyed in 1755 by a 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:15.860
 earthquake that caused the death of 60 000 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:19.130
 people in 1812 the earthquake of madrid ' 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.980
 altered the course of the Mississippi river rumors 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.020
 of war could be said after 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.300
 know the extent of destruction of 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.040
 that would be able to achieve being 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.980
 human during the two wars 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.810
 world wars that the continuous wars that 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.510
 they spread throughout the planet to 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.240
 from the invention of the weapons of 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.000
 fire in the 15th century were really 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.220
 rumors of the genocidal wars that 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.860
 they would arrive after the 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.620
 denominated wars of the 30 years of 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.500
 100 years of the great European north of 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.050
 Crimea of the 7 weeks civil war 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.180
 both in the Ottoman Empire and in the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.150
 USA and many more 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.760
 so mournful testimony of it nation 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.820
 against the nation the experts say that with 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.100
 the invasion of Russia by Napoleon in 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.140
 1812 began a new way of entering into 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.680
 war no longer for religious reasons 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.080
 between the small cities state but 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.440
 for economic secular reasons and 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.330
 politicians among great nations the 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.000
 Franco-Prussian war 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.130
 Russian-Japanese and several more all of them 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.020
 they were the prelude to a new era for 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.270
 humanity and they ended up has already 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.550
 started that time in the first war 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.860
 world a conflagration of a 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.060
 magnitude as I had never seen the 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.190
 humanity but 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.889
 was overcome by the errors of the 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.290
 Second World War continues with this 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.480
 analysis in the following video of a 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.400
 series of current studies that we 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.490
 will transport to events 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.230
