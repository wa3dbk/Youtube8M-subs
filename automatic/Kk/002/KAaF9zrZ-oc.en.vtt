00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 is 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.540
 I present a new edition of colors 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 of the museum strong a model that already came out 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.619
 in the summer of 2013 and that has taken a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.380
 reissue of colors for Christmas 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.780
 with important functional changes what 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 more important is the back of the glove is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 a back more armed than the muxa 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 air we try to make a glove with the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.980
 same characteristics but with two 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.970
 different levels of armed so that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.640
 adapt to the needs of all 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.079
 goalkeepers the back area in latex is 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.730
 the main element and is divided into 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.930
 two segments one segment for the area 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 of the knuckles that is the one that is going to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.829
 provide that extra armed and a second 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.269
 latex segment for all fingers 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 principals to work in a manner 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.539
 in a united way that is to say that as the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.100
 movements that we are going to do in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.989
 goal where the heel van all to the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.050
 Once a single piece of latex covers 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.850
 the entire area of the fingers for the rest 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.450
 on the back in the area between the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.430
 fingers of the hand and the base of the back of the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.409
 textile is the mp efe a textile that already 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.820
 we premiered in the previous muse and that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.900
 characterized by having a level of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.070
 medium armed and above all a 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.490
 internal perspiration of the glove 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.490
 perfect 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.700
 if we're going to do the palm zone 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.840
 the most important element with a glove 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.760
 since it is the one that stands between 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.400
 our hand and the ball we meet 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.130
 with the current latex or a maximum latex 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.870
 Adhesion in water is a latex breeding grip 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.220
 to which the level of 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.350
 pores therefore the more for the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.150
 we have more water sun we will see when 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.369
 we contacted a wet ball and less 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.630
 risk there will be aquaplaning the cut 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.979
 chosen is a cut that we already come 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.720
 using in several models of moussa 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.220
 it's a hybrid cut where we 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.200
 we find with rolfi less than two 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.700
 lateral and negative cut on the fingers 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.619
 The two laterals are the ones that 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.910
 Strength the blocking and fingers 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.590
 the central ones that should have more 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.110
 sensitivity to lock the ball and that 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.660
 do not miss us 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.430
 in the area between the fingers of the mtc 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.560
 as we have done previously and we 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.030
 we found with a wrap on the finger 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.110
 thumb to protect this finger that 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.210
 works normally 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.440
 independent another characteristic of 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.150
 our high-end gloves that also 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.220
 is present in this model is the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.280
 traditional articulation between 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.140
 wristband and palm 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.459
 and we ended up talking about a very element 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.970
 important in all gloves as is 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.590
 the wrist and the closure 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.600
 as we have used the previous ones 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.220
 muse models in this collection of chr 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.540
 for Christmas we also find ourselves with 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.340
 an element that is painted here in 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.930
 black color and it costs more to see what it is 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.280
 a piece of latex that will bind the area 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.930
 of the glove body with the area of 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.660
 wristband in such a way that we are going to 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.070
 to create a total union between the 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.590
 glove that we do not see it as two pieces 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.760
 independent but as a whole 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.770
 we pick up the glove inside too 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.270
 we noticed the gel that is in the area of 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.440
 fingertips and also at the base 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.630
 of the palm that will allow us to have 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.400
 a sensation similar to that of the duo but 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.110
 without increasing the thickness of the palm 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 once we put the glove we found 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.260
 with a classic wristband with two 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.319
 velcro fixings one in the area 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.150
 posterior and in the anterior area and a 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.840
 classic closing strip that closes towards 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.840
 the area outside 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.830
 plus
