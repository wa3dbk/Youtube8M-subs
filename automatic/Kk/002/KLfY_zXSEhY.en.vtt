between these two devices well I do hit
that<00:00:34.490> thumbs<00:00:34.640> up<00:00:34.850> on<00:00:35.030> let's<00:00:35.480> find<00:00:35.600> out<00:00:35.810> in<00:00:35.960> this

at<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.820> dimensions<00:00:38.300> initially<00:00:38.840> at<00:00:39.079> the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
at the dimensions initially at the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.200 
at the dimensions initially at the
iPhone<00:00:39.530> 5s<00:00:39.770> is<00:00:40.190> quite<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.670> bit<00:00:40.880> smaller<00:00:41.000> than

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
iPhone 5s is quite a bit smaller than

iPhone 5s is quite a bit smaller than
the<00:00:41.450> HTC<00:00:42.079> One<00:00:42.350> 13<00:00:43.070> point<00:00:43.280> 6<00:00:43.340> millimeters<00:00:43.940> in

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
the HTC One 13 point 6 millimeters in

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.550 
the HTC One 13 point 6 millimeters in
terms<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.360> height<00:00:44.600> nine<00:00:45.020> point<00:00:45.380> six

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
terms of height nine point six

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.620 
terms of height nine point six
millimeters<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.280> terms<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.610> width<00:00:46.850> one<00:00:47.420> point

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
millimeters in terms of width one point

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.479 
millimeters in terms of width one point
seven<00:00:47.840> millimeters<00:00:48.440> in<00:00:48.620> terms<00:00:48.950> of<00:00:49.070> thickness

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
seven millimeters in terms of thickness

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.700 
seven millimeters in terms of thickness
as<00:00:49.640> well<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.210> overall<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.780> very<00:00:50.810> compact<00:00:51.500> device

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
as well so overall a very compact device

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.860 
as well so overall a very compact device
compared<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.310> the<00:00:52.399> HTC<00:00:52.820> One<00:00:53.210> but<00:00:53.720> that's

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
compared to the HTC One but that's

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.630 
compared to the HTC One but that's
because<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.230> HTC<00:00:54.739> one<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.040> does<00:00:55.190> have<00:00:55.399> a

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
because the HTC one that does have a

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.360 
because the HTC one that does have a
larger<00:00:56.030> screen<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.329> 4.7<00:00:57.260> inch<00:00:57.380> screen<00:00:57.680> versus<00:00:58.340> a

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
larger screen a 4.7 inch screen versus a

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.000 
larger screen a 4.7 inch screen versus a
four-inch<00:00:58.970> screen<00:00:59.149> which<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.600> iphone<00:01:00.079> 5s<00:01:00.770> has

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
four-inch screen which the iphone 5s has

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.620 
four-inch screen which the iphone 5s has
so<00:01:01.550> that's<00:01:01.730> going<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.940> mean<00:01:02.030> that<00:01:02.090> that<00:01:02.480> the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
so that's going to mean that that the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.060 
so that's going to mean that that the
HTC<00:01:03.170> one<00:01:03.290> you've<00:01:03.410> got<00:01:03.470> a<00:01:03.590> lot<00:01:03.739> more<00:01:03.770> real

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
HTC one you've got a lot more real

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.889 
HTC one you've got a lot more real
estate<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.939> screen<00:01:05.210> but<00:01:05.569> that's<00:01:05.749> at<00:01:05.869> the

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
estate on that screen but that's at the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.200 
estate on that screen but that's at the
expense<00:01:06.350> of<00:01:06.469> the<00:01:07.009> larger<00:01:07.340> size<00:01:07.609> and<00:01:07.880> thumbs

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
expense of the larger size and thumbs

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.020 
expense of the larger size and thumbs
resolution<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.869> HTC<00:01:09.439> One<00:01:09.679> has<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.340> full<00:01:10.609> HD

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.459 
resolution the HTC One has a full HD
screen<00:01:11.329> so<00:01:11.479> you've<00:01:11.600> got<00:01:11.630> 1920<00:01:12.469> x<00:01:12.950> 1080<00:01:13.960> 468<00:01:14.960> ppi

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
screen so you've got 1920 x 1080 468 ppi

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.289 
screen so you've got 1920 x 1080 468 ppi

out there if not the highest PPI and in

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.059 
out there if not the highest PPI and in
comparison<00:01:20.329> that<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.689> iphone<00:01:21.079> 5s<00:01:21.619> has<00:01:21.829> the

comparison that the iphone 5s has the

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.879 
comparison that the iphone 5s has the
same<00:01:22.429> resolution<00:01:22.759> as<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.450> iphone<00:01:23.899> 5<00:01:24.229> which<00:01:24.859> is

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
same resolution as the iphone 5 which is

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:29.679 
same resolution as the iphone 5 which is
a<00:01:25.100> 1<00:01:25.520> 1<00:01:25.700> 36<00:01:26.450> x<00:01:26.959> 640<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:27.859> smaller<00:01:28.310> than<00:01:28.520> 720p<00:01:29.389> even

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
a 1 1 36 x 640 so smaller than 720p even

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.279 
a 1 1 36 x 640 so smaller than 720p even
and<00:01:29.840> that's<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.529> 326<00:01:31.520> ppi<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.630> HTC<00:01:33.139> one

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
and that's the 326 ppi so the HTC one

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.690 
and that's the 326 ppi so the HTC one
that<00:01:33.439> definitely<00:01:33.649> has<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> big<00:01:34.159> advantage<00:01:34.249> here

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
that definitely has a big advantage here

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.940 
that definitely has a big advantage here

cube<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.480> verizon's<00:03:11.930> now<00:03:12.320> neither<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.770> these

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
cube I verizon's now neither of these

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.350 
cube I verizon's now neither of these
have<00:03:13.160> expandable<00:03:13.610> storage<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.180> that's

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
have expandable storage so that's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.030 
have expandable storage so that's
something<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.720> bear<00:03:14.959> in<00:03:14.990> mind<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.950> are

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
something to bear in mind that you are

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.020 
something to bear in mind that you are
not<00:03:16.190> going<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:16.490> able<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.670> expand<00:03:16.940> your

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
not going to be able to expand your

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.280 
not going to be able to expand your
storage<00:03:17.180> later<00:03:17.450> on<00:03:17.660> now<00:03:17.930> looking<00:03:18.140> at<00:03:18.230> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
storage later on now looking at the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.690 
storage later on now looking at the
cameras<00:03:18.709> this<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:18.980> quite<00:03:19.160> interesting<00:03:19.190> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
cameras this is quite interesting the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.910 
cameras this is quite interesting the
HTC<00:03:20.209> One<00:03:20.450> at<00:03:20.630> they<00:03:20.750> went<00:03:21.019> for<00:03:21.320> something<00:03:21.560> a

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
HTC One at they went for something a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.800 
HTC One at they went for something a
little<00:03:22.040> bit<00:03:22.370> different<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:22.880> 4<00:03:23.180> megapixels

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
little bit different so 4 megapixels

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.509 
little bit different so 4 megapixels
you've<00:03:24.050> got<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.350> here<00:03:24.590> but<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.830> ultra<00:03:25.160> pixels

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
you've got on here but the ultra pixels

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.000 
you've got on here but the ultra pixels
so<00:03:25.910> much<00:03:26.120> larger<00:03:26.630> than<00:03:26.810> normal<00:03:27.320> pictures<00:03:27.860> are

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
so much larger than normal pictures are

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.120 
so much larger than normal pictures are
there<00:03:28.280> 2<00:03:28.580> microns<00:03:29.090> per<00:03:29.209> pixel<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.140> HTC<00:03:30.920> One

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
there 2 microns per pixel on the HTC One

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.490 
there 2 microns per pixel on the HTC One
here<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:31.970> are<00:03:32.180> quite<00:03:32.450> nice<00:03:32.630> in<00:03:32.870> low-light<00:03:33.350> one

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
here so are quite nice in low-light one

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.900 
here so are quite nice in low-light one
of<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.709> best<00:03:33.950> low-light<00:03:34.310> performers<00:03:34.760> out

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
of the best low-light performers out

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.330 
of the best low-light performers out
there<00:03:34.970> at<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.239> moment<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.900> iphone<00:03:36.260> 5s<00:03:36.860> has

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
there at the moment the iphone 5s has

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.430 
there at the moment the iphone 5s has
also<00:03:37.730> gone<00:03:38.060> along<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:38.660> path<00:03:38.930> but<00:03:39.140> not<00:03:39.320> all

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
also gone along this path but not all

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.020 
also gone along this path but not all
the<00:03:39.590> way<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:39.739> you've<00:03:39.920> got<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.190> megapixel<00:03:40.550> camera

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
the way so you've got a megapixel camera

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.490 
the way so you've got a megapixel camera
so<00:03:41.450> instead<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:41.750> going<00:03:41.900> for<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.200> high<00:03:42.350> megapixel

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
so instead of going for a high megapixel

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.740 
so instead of going for a high megapixel
camera<00:03:43.040> they<00:03:43.160> stuck<00:03:43.400> with<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.640> same<00:03:43.670> but<00:03:44.390> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
camera they stuck with the same but the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.190 
camera they stuck with the same but the
pixels<00:03:45.170> are<00:03:45.350> larger<00:03:45.790> 1.5<00:03:46.790> micron<00:03:47.299> sir<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:47.959> i'm

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
pixels are larger 1.5 micron sir so i'm

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.470 
pixels are larger 1.5 micron sir so i'm
not<00:03:48.350> as<00:03:48.500> much<00:03:48.680> as<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.980> HTC<00:03:49.489> one<00:03:49.730> but<00:03:50.269> still

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
not as much as the HTC one but still

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.390 
not as much as the HTC one but still
larger<00:03:50.959> it'd<00:03:51.080> be<00:03:51.200> nice<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.410> see<00:03:51.680> these<00:03:51.830> side<00:03:52.370> by

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
larger it'd be nice to see these side by

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.550 
larger it'd be nice to see these side by
side<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:53.360> see<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.660> comparison<00:03:53.959> in<00:03:54.290> terms<00:03:54.320> of

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
side to see the comparison in terms of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.960 
side to see the comparison in terms of
low<00:03:54.739> light<00:03:54.950> especially<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.670> see<00:03:55.820> what

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
low light especially to see what

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.270 
low light especially to see what
difference<00:03:56.360> will<00:03:56.840> be<00:03:57.080> between<00:03:57.320> these<00:03:57.650> two<00:03:57.860> now

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
difference will be between these two now

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.670 
difference will be between these two now
in<00:03:58.400> terms<00:03:58.549> of<00:03:58.700> video<00:03:58.940> both<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.330> these<00:03:59.450> have

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
in terms of video both of these have

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.800 
in terms of video both of these have
1080p<00:04:00.680> at<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.980> frames<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.340> second<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:02.150> HTC<00:04:02.660> One

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
1080p at a frames a second the HTC One

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.170 
1080p at a frames a second the HTC One
has<00:04:02.989> 720p<00:04:03.680> at<00:04:03.860> 60<00:04:04.130> frames<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.459> second<00:04:04.790> but<00:04:05.120> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
has 720p at 60 frames a second but the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.340 
has 720p at 60 frames a second but the
iphone<00:04:05.510> 5s<00:04:05.930> has<00:04:06.380> 720p<00:04:07.660> 124<00:04:08.660> seconds<00:04:09.110> so<00:04:09.200> that's

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
iphone 5s has 720p 124 seconds so that's

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.570 
iphone 5s has 720p 124 seconds so that's
really<00:04:09.500> really<00:04:09.799> great<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.070> see<00:04:10.190> him<00:04:10.220> for<00:04:10.459> slow

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230
