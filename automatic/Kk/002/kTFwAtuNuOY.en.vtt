another scientist this is ruffini's
corpuscle<00:00:10.790> ruffini's<00:00:11.790> corpuscle<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.450> you

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
corpuscle ruffini's corpuscle and you

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.419 
corpuscle ruffini's corpuscle and you
may<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.780> actually<00:00:12.960> seen<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.500> by<00:00:14.009> another

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
may have actually seen this by another

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.450 
may have actually seen this by another
term<00:00:15.030> ruffini's<00:00:15.750> ending<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.410> another<00:00:16.680> phrase

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
term ruffini's ending is another phrase

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.269 
term ruffini's ending is another phrase
they<00:00:17.820> use<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.650> mechanoreceptor<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
they use for this mechanoreceptor and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
they use for this mechanoreceptor and
the<00:00:20.400> idea<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.060> if<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.630> some

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the idea is that if we have some

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.859 
the idea is that if we have some
external<00:00:22.320> stimulus<00:00:22.949> again<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:24.119> guy<00:00:24.390> poking

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
external stimulus again this guy poking

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.769 
external stimulus again this guy poking
us<00:00:25.170> all<00:00:25.560> over<00:00:25.890> again<00:00:26.359> generating<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.480> force

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
us all over again generating this force

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.960 
us all over again generating this force
that<00:00:27.990> goes<00:00:28.109> deep<00:00:28.470> within<00:00:28.680> our<00:00:28.890> skin<00:00:29.160> ruffini's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that goes deep within our skin ruffini's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
that goes deep within our skin ruffini's
corpuscle<00:00:30.420> which<00:00:30.840> looks<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.679> guy

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
corpuscle which looks like this guy

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.350 
corpuscle which looks like this guy
right<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.219> will<00:00:32.369> perceive<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.239> it's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
right here will perceive it and it's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.510 
right here will perceive it and it's
very<00:00:33.630> interesting<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.320> there<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.340> no

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
very interesting because there are no

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760 
very interesting because there are no
discs<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.239> rings<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.290> had<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
discs or rings like we had with the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.740 
discs or rings like we had with the
other<00:00:37.800> corpuscles<00:00:38.670> instead<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.719> can

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
other corpuscles instead what you can

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
other corpuscles instead what you can
kind<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.110> clearly<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.950> right<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.430> this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
kind of clearly see right here and this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.060 
kind of clearly see right here and this
is<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.850> beautiful<00:00:42.480> there's<00:00:42.719> an<00:00:42.870> actual<00:00:43.200> nerve

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
is so beautiful there's an actual nerve

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.830 
is so beautiful there's an actual nerve
fiber<00:00:44.460> right<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.120> I'll<00:00:45.180> outline<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
fiber right here and I'll outline it so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.270 
fiber right here and I'll outline it so
that<00:00:45.989> thing<00:00:46.410> right<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.070> kind<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that thing right here that's kind of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.700 
that thing right here that's kind of
being<00:00:47.579> cast<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:49.050> that's<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.530> nerve

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
being cast this way that's the nerve

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.959 
being cast this way that's the nerve
fiber<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.489> our<00:00:50.820> half<00:00:51.329> errant<00:00:52.969> nerve

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
fiber this is our half errant nerve

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
fiber this is our half errant nerve
fiber<00:00:54.270> right<00:00:54.510> here<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.989> remember<00:00:55.079> what

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
fiber right here do you remember what

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.880 
fiber right here do you remember what
type<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.719> think<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.960> heard<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.320> say<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
type it is I think I heard you say a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
type it is I think I heard you say a
beta<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.059> absolutely<00:01:00.329> right<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.930> this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
beta so you're absolutely right so this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
beta so you're absolutely right so this
is<00:01:01.079> our<00:01:01.230> afferent<00:01:01.800> nerve<00:01:01.980> fiber<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.640> actually

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
is our afferent nerve fiber and actually

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.950 
is our afferent nerve fiber and actually
this<00:01:03.570> guy<00:01:03.899> sort<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> branches<00:01:05.369> into<00:01:05.960> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this guy sort of branches into the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980 
this guy sort of branches into the
corpuscle<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.799> ruffini's<00:01:08.570> corpuscle<00:01:09.570> right

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
corpuscle so ruffini's corpuscle right

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
corpuscle so ruffini's corpuscle right
here<00:01:10.200> has<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> whole<00:01:10.740> bunch<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.130> afferent<00:01:11.700> nerve

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
here has a whole bunch of afferent nerve

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.700 
here has a whole bunch of afferent nerve
fiber<00:01:11.939> branches<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.530> didn't

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
fiber branches in it but I didn't

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080 
fiber branches in it but I didn't
highlight<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.159> whole<00:01:14.280> thing<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:14.939> else

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
highlight the whole thing here what else

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.850 
highlight the whole thing here what else
do<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.360> hanging<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.140> well<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
do we have hanging out up here well the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
do we have hanging out up here well the
other<00:01:17.009> thing<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.369> we've<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.880> sort<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
other thing that we've got sort of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.499 
other thing that we've got sort of
coding<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.460> collagen<00:01:20.460> collagen<00:01:21.119> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
coding this is collagen collagen you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.240 
coding this is collagen collagen you
might<00:01:21.659> remember<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> structural<00:01:23.040> protein

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
might remember is a structural protein

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
might remember is a structural protein
so<00:01:23.670> I'll<00:01:23.759> draw<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.210> all<00:01:24.390> around<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so I'll draw just all around there and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630 
so I'll draw just all around there and
I'll<00:01:24.990> label<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.460> there's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
I'll label it right here so there's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.090 
I'll label it right here so there's
collagen<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.990> collagen<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.770> which

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
collagen right here collagen like which

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
collagen right here collagen like which
you<00:01:29.220> might<00:01:29.340> remember<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.060> dermis<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you might remember from the dermis and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.270 
you might remember from the dermis and
so<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.320> happen<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.100> we

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so what will happen is that if we

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.520 
so what will happen is that if we
stretch<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.180> skin<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.320> this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
stretch the skin up here with this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
stretch the skin up here with this
external<00:01:35.280> stimulus<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.119> stretch<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.600> hard

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
external stimulus and we stretch it hard

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.740 
external stimulus and we stretch it hard
and<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.680> generate<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.369> force<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.570> goes

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and we generate this force that goes

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
and we generate this force that goes
deep<00:01:40.170> into<00:01:40.439> our<00:01:40.560> skin<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.280> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.790> hits

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
deep into our skin and kind of hits

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
deep into our skin and kind of hits
ruffini's<00:01:42.570> ending<00:01:43.049> right<00:01:43.229> here<00:01:43.290> it'll<00:01:44.009> cause

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
ruffini's ending right here it'll cause

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
ruffini's ending right here it'll cause
the<00:01:44.420> collagen<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> shift<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.470> be

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the collagen here to shift and be

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.980 
the collagen here to shift and be
perturbed<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.210> might<00:01:48.420> notice<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
perturbed and as you might notice the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.410 
perturbed and as you might notice the
collagen<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.619> very<00:01:49.829> intimately<00:01:50.460> connected<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
collagen is very intimately connected to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.990 
collagen is very intimately connected to
the<00:01:51.869> nerve<00:01:52.079> fiber<00:01:52.409> branches<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the nerve fiber branches here and as the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.440 
the nerve fiber branches here and as the
collagen<00:01:54.570> shifts<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.890> opens<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.520> ion<00:01:56.909> channels

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
collagen shifts it opens up ion channels

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.929 
collagen shifts it opens up ion channels
on<00:01:57.689> these<00:01:58.409> nerve<00:01:58.710> branches<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.670> allow

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
on these nerve branches that allow

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.330 
on these nerve branches that allow
sodium<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.469> hanging<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
sodium that's kind of hanging out in the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.660 
sodium that's kind of hanging out in the
extracellular<00:02:02.790> matrix<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.930> sneak<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.890> it'll

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
extracellular matrix to sneak in it'll

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.969 
extracellular matrix to sneak in it'll
sneak<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.380> along<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
sneak in and then kind of go along this

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.430 
sneak in and then kind of go along this
afferent<00:02:08.489> nerve<00:02:08.640> fiber<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:09.810> generate<00:02:10.289> an

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
afferent nerve fiber to generate an

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.680 
afferent nerve fiber to generate an
action<00:02:10.619> potential<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.430> move<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
action potential and move on to the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
action potential and move on to the
central<00:02:13.020> nervous<00:02:13.050> system

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
central nervous system

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
central nervous system
and<00:02:13.890> that's<00:02:14.250> really<00:02:14.460> interesting<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:15.120> as

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and that's really interesting because as

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.990 
and that's really interesting because as
long<00:02:16.050> as<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.440> stretch<00:02:16.920> or<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> stimulus<00:02:17.820> is

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
long as this stretch or the stimulus is

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.990 
long as this stretch or the stimulus is
being<00:02:18.270> applied<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.500> our<00:02:19.530> skin<00:02:20.310> we're<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.880> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
being applied to our skin we're going to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.240 
being applied to our skin we're going to
have<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.420> collagen<00:02:22.140> being<00:02:22.440> stretched<00:02:22.950> and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
have the collagen being stretched and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.940 
have the collagen being stretched and
pushed<00:02:23.610> out<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.060> way<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.810> allow<00:02:24.900> sodium<00:02:25.500> or

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
pushed out of the way to allow sodium or

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.640 
pushed out of the way to allow sodium or
other<00:02:26.130> ions<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.790> enter<00:02:27.360> into<00:02:27.810> our<00:02:28.020> afferent

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
other ions to enter into our afferent

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.260 
other ions to enter into our afferent
nerve<00:02:28.830> fiber<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.850> might<00:02:30.150> have

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
nerve fiber and so you might have

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.320 
nerve fiber and so you might have
guessed<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.620> those

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
guessed this is going to be one of those

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.180 
guessed this is going to be one of those
receptors<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.660> respond<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.530> sustained

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
receptors that respond to sustained

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.960 
receptors that respond to sustained
touch<00:02:35.960> sustained<00:02:36.960> touch<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.370> trick<00:02:38.670> here

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
touch sustained touch but the trick here

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.880 
touch sustained touch but the trick here
is<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.900> depends<00:02:40.440> heavily<00:02:40.620> on

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
is because this depends heavily on

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.250 
is because this depends heavily on
collagen<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.670> got<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.940> think<00:02:42.090> what<00:02:42.810> part<00:02:43.140> of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
collagen you got to think what part of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.370 
collagen you got to think what part of
our<00:02:43.410> skin<00:02:43.710> has<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:44.190> most<00:02:44.490> amount<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.940> collagen

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
our skin has the most amount of collagen

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.930 
our skin has the most amount of collagen
well<00:02:46.380> we're<00:02:46.860> gonna<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.250> go<00:02:47.370> pretty<00:02:47.640> deep

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
well we're gonna have to go pretty deep

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.690 
well we're gonna have to go pretty deep
for<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.420> because<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.770> part<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.310> our<00:02:50.370> skin

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
for that because the part of our skin

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.300 
for that because the part of our skin
that<00:02:50.880> has<00:02:51.060> collagen<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.780> dermis<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.890> it'll

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
that has collagen is the dermis so it'll

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.560 
that has collagen is the dermis so it'll
be<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.820> dermis

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
be the dermis

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.950 
be the dermis
but<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.440> dermis<00:02:56.340> has<00:02:56.490> two<00:02:56.790> layers<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
but the dermis has two layers and the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.810 
but the dermis has two layers and the
part<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.590> dermis<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.040> has<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.520> most

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
part of the dermis that has the most

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.410 
part of the dermis that has the most
collagen<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.310> reticular<00:03:02.310> dermis<00:03:02.580> so

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
collagen is the reticular dermis so

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.270 
collagen is the reticular dermis so
that's<00:03:03.600> how<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:03.960> reason<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.410> out<00:03:04.590> it's

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
that's how you can reason that out it's

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.670 
that's how you can reason that out it's
sustained<00:03:05.820> touch<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.420> causes<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.050> collagen

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
sustained touch that causes the collagen

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.590 
sustained touch that causes the collagen
to<00:03:07.830> move<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.310> allow<00:03:08.520> sodium<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.120> keep<00:03:09.390> on

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
to move and allow sodium to keep on

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.110 
to move and allow sodium to keep on
entering<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.980> where<00:03:11.490> do<00:03:11.610> we<00:03:11.730> have<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
entering and so where do we have the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
entering and so where do we have the
most<00:03:12.240> collagen<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.140> reticular<00:03:13.830> dermis<00:03:13.860> and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
most collagen the reticular dermis and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.330 
most collagen the reticular dermis and
that's<00:03:14.610> pretty<00:03:15.120> deep<00:03:15.710> awesome<00:03:16.710> now<00:03:17.130> let's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
that's pretty deep awesome now let's

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.520 
that's pretty deep awesome now let's
move<00:03:17.460> on<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.850> last<00:03:18.000> Meccano<00:03:18.480> receptor<00:03:18.990> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
move on to the last Meccano receptor the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.230 
move on to the last Meccano receptor the
last<00:03:19.740> mechanoreceptor<00:03:20.640> we're<00:03:20.790> going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.030> talk

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
last mechanoreceptor we're going to talk

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.460 
last mechanoreceptor we're going to talk
about<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.810> called<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.770> hair<00:03:23.580> follicle<00:03:24.470> receptor

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
about is called a hair follicle receptor

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.330 
about is called a hair follicle receptor
a<00:03:25.500> hair<00:03:26.220> follicle<00:03:27.260> receptor<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.440> I'm<00:03:28.590> hoping

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
a hair follicle receptor and I'm hoping

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.830 
a hair follicle receptor and I'm hoping
there<00:03:29.520> are<00:03:29.550> some<00:03:29.640> neurons<00:03:30.240> firing<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.780> your

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
there are some neurons firing in your

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.420 
there are some neurons firing in your
brain<00:03:30.959> right<00:03:31.380> now<00:03:31.440> about<00:03:31.800> this<00:03:31.980> because<00:03:32.160> we

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
brain right now about this because we

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.300 
brain right now about this because we
talked<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.880> little<00:03:33.000> earlier<00:03:33.300> about<00:03:33.570> a

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
talked a little earlier about a

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.790 
talked a little earlier about a
non-hairy<00:03:35.390> receptor<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.630> now<00:03:37.260> we're<00:03:37.470> talking

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
non-hairy receptor and now we're talking

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.500 
non-hairy receptor and now we're talking
specifically<00:03:38.250> about<00:03:38.400> hair<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.330> should

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
specifically about hair so this should

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.290 
specifically about hair so this should
be<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.630> callback<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.350> hairy

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
be a callback to the hairy

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.760 
be a callback to the hairy
mechanoreceptor<00:03:42.300> that'll<00:03:42.540> close<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.440> story

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
mechanoreceptor that'll close that story

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.960 
mechanoreceptor that'll close that story
that<00:03:44.010> we<00:03:44.100> talked<00:03:44.370> about<00:03:44.520> at<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> beginning

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
that we talked about at the beginning

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.760 
that we talked about at the beginning
and<00:03:45.360> likewise<00:03:46.050> I'm<00:03:46.230> gonna<00:03:46.350> draw<00:03:46.590> this

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
and likewise I'm gonna draw this

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.850 
and likewise I'm gonna draw this
stimulus<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.310> little<00:03:47.550> differently<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.270> this

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
stimulus a little differently this this

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.960 
stimulus a little differently this this
perturbation<00:03:49.860> right<00:03:50.490> here<00:03:50.790> will<00:03:50.940> be

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
perturbation right here will be

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.610 
perturbation right here will be
something<00:03:51.240> like<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.230> will<00:03:52.350> draw<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
something like this and I will draw the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.960 
something like this and I will draw the
nail<00:03:52.890> if<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.940> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
nail if this is going to be like a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.720 
nail if this is going to be like a
finger<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.570> it's<00:03:55.170> kind<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.740> initiating<00:03:56.700> a

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
finger and it's kind of initiating a

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.670 
finger and it's kind of initiating a
force<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.180> direction<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.990> if<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.500> is

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
force in that direction and if this is

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.770 
force in that direction and if this is
over<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.310> part<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.820> skin<00:04:00.030> that's<00:04:00.180> relatively

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
over a part of skin that's relatively

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.320 
over a part of skin that's relatively
hairy<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.380> there<00:04:01.800> was<00:04:01.920> hair<00:04:02.310> here<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.030> hair

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
hairy and there was hair here the hair

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.520 
hairy and there was hair here the hair
will<00:04:03.600> be<00:04:03.750> deflected

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
will be deflected

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.210 
will be deflected
so<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.520> deflected<00:04:06.180> hair<00:04:06.650> very<00:04:07.650> beautiful

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
so that is deflected hair very beautiful

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.910 
so that is deflected hair very beautiful
shaft<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.090> hair<00:04:09.300> right<00:04:09.450> here<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:10.380> goes<00:04:10.590> deep

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
shaft of hair right here that goes deep

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.340 
shaft of hair right here that goes deep
into<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.580> skin<00:04:11.790> right<00:04:12.060> because<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.840> remember

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
into the skin right because you remember

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.020 
into the skin right because you remember
that<00:04:13.920> hair<00:04:14.489> protrudes<00:04:15.209> from<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.380> follicle<00:04:17.030> okay

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
that hair protrudes from a follicle okay

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.789 
that hair protrudes from a follicle okay
so<00:04:18.450> there's<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.840> hair<00:04:18.989> shaft<00:04:19.290> that<00:04:19.530> goes<00:04:19.650> at

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
so there's the hair shaft that goes at

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.710 
so there's the hair shaft that goes at
the<00:04:19.890> bottom<00:04:20.220> here<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.609> I'll<00:04:21.000> draw<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.510> little

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
the bottom here and I'll draw a little

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.780 
the bottom here and I'll draw a little
follicle<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:22.620> kind<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.860> nests<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.610> right

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
follicle that kind of nests it right

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.200 
follicle that kind of nests it right
here

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
here

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.520 
here
so<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.050> kind<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.260> goes<00:04:25.380> like<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.979> right<00:04:26.340> here

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
so it kind of goes like this right here

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.740 
so it kind of goes like this right here
and<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.070> goes<00:04:28.250> in<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.490> back<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.570> comes

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
and that goes in the back and that comes

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.450 
and that goes in the back and that comes
out<00:04:29.840> in<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.020> front<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:31.040> interesting

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
out in the front and the interesting

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.980 
out in the front and the interesting
thing<00:04:31.640> about<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:31.970> hair<00:04:32.150> follicle<00:04:32.660> is<00:04:32.780> that

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
thing about the hair follicle is that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.890 
thing about the hair follicle is that
there<00:04:33.500> is<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.800> nerve<00:04:34.370> fiber<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:35.330> actually

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
there is a nerve fiber that is actually

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.580 
there is a nerve fiber that is actually
wrapped<00:04:36.320> around<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.910> part<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.750> hair<00:04:39.410> that

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
wrapped around the part of the hair that

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.710 
wrapped around the part of the hair that
sits<00:04:39.980> in<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.250> follicle<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.270> sure<00:04:41.690> enough

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
sits in the follicle and sure enough

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.080 
sits in the follicle and sure enough
this<00:04:42.170> is<00:04:42.350> an<00:04:42.470> afferent<00:04:43.040> nerve<00:04:43.310> fiber<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.940> a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
this is an afferent nerve fiber and a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.180 
this is an afferent nerve fiber and a
beta<00:04:44.390> nerve<00:04:44.930> fiber<00:04:45.230> and<00:04:45.530> what<00:04:45.950> you'll<00:04:46.160> notice

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
beta nerve fiber and what you'll notice

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.150 
beta nerve fiber and what you'll notice
is<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.670> when<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.210> hair<00:04:47.600> is<00:04:47.630> deflected<00:04:48.590> that

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
is that when the hair is deflected that

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.600 
is that when the hair is deflected that
allows<00:04:49.880> for<00:04:50.390> ions<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.440> leak<00:04:51.710> into<00:04:52.040> this

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
allows for ions to leak into this

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.690 
allows for ions to leak into this
afferent<00:04:53.270> nerve<00:04:53.540> kind<00:04:54.230> of<00:04:54.290> where<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:55.130> hair

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
afferent nerve kind of where the hair

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.460 
afferent nerve kind of where the hair
and<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.210> nerve<00:04:56.450> are<00:04:56.660> interfacing<00:04:57.230> and<00:04:57.380> what

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
and the nerve are interfacing and what

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.070 
and the nerve are interfacing and what
it<00:04:57.560> leaks<00:04:57.860> in<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.190> kind<00:04:58.730> of<00:04:58.850> enters<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.660> you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
it leaks in it kind of enters and you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.260 
it leaks in it kind of enters and you
know<00:05:00.200> goes<00:05:00.590> along<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.460> length<00:05:01.669> of<00:05:01.820> this<00:05:02.000> nerve

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
know goes along the length of this nerve

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.540 
know goes along the length of this nerve
and<00:05:02.510> goes<00:05:02.720> down<00:05:02.930> here<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:03.500> that<00:05:03.620> generates<00:05:04.400> an

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
and goes down here and that generates an

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.909 
and goes down here and that generates an
action<00:05:04.970> potential<00:05:05.570> which<00:05:05.720> can<00:05:05.750> then<00:05:06.110> convey<00:05:06.890> a

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
action potential which can then convey a

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.950 
action potential which can then convey a
signal<00:05:07.430> to<00:05:07.640> our<00:05:07.760> central<00:05:08.150> nervous<00:05:08.330> system<00:05:08.810> and

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
signal to our central nervous system and

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.040 
signal to our central nervous system and
so<00:05:09.080> this<00:05:09.380> all<00:05:09.560> started<00:05:09.740> from<00:05:10.580> hair<00:05:11.050> deflection

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
so this all started from hair deflection

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.650 
so this all started from hair deflection
hair<00:05:12.710> deflection<00:05:13.400> was<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.700> impetus<00:05:14.090> for<00:05:14.300> this

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
hair deflection was the impetus for this

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:32.990 
hair deflection was the impetus for this
signal<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.710> occur

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.990 

and<00:05:34.000> so<00:05:34.539> this<00:05:35.229> is<00:05:35.440> going<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.800> be<00:05:35.979> used<00:05:36.370> to

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
and so this is going to be used to

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.570 
and so this is going to be used to
perceive<00:05:37.449> light<00:05:37.960> touch<00:05:38.500> because<00:05:39.370> we're<00:05:39.490> not

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
perceive light touch because we're not

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.100 
perceive light touch because we're not
even<00:05:39.879> touching<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.330> skin<00:05:40.599> right<00:05:40.810> here<00:05:40.870> we're

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
even touching the skin right here we're

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.930 
even touching the skin right here we're
actually<00:05:41.229> just<00:05:41.500> touching<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:41.949> hair<00:05:42.220> so<00:05:42.789> it's

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
actually just touching the hair so it's

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.369 
actually just touching the hair so it's
light<00:05:43.240> touch<00:05:44.020> on<00:05:45.060> hairy<00:05:46.060> skin<00:05:46.659> it's<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.139> light

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.379 
light touch on hairy skin it's a light

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.770 
light touch on hairy skin it's a light
touch<00:05:47.710> on<00:05:47.919> hairy<00:05:48.220> skin<00:05:48.580> because<00:05:48.909> our<00:05:49.060> hairs

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
touch on hairy skin because our hairs

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.710 
touch on hairy skin because our hairs
are<00:05:50.080> being<00:05:50.319> deflected<00:05:50.830> as<00:05:51.280> we<00:05:52.000> perceive<00:05:52.479> the

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
are being deflected as we perceive the

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.080 
are being deflected as we perceive the
stimulus<00:05:53.199> and<00:05:53.470> while<00:05:54.009> the<00:05:54.159> hair<00:05:54.400> kind<00:05:54.639> of<00:05:54.789> runs

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
stimulus and while the hair kind of runs

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.300 
stimulus and while the hair kind of runs
many<00:05:55.449> layers<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:56.050> skin<00:05:56.289> remember<00:05:57.009> that<00:05:57.159> the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
many layers of skin remember that the

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.570 
many layers of skin remember that the
follicle<00:05:57.879> itself<00:05:58.060> this<00:05:59.050> guy<00:05:59.289> sits<00:05:59.860> anchored

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
follicle itself this guy sits anchored

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.689 
follicle itself this guy sits anchored
in<00:06:00.789> the<00:06:01.319> reticular<00:06:02.319> dermis<00:06:02.379> it<00:06:03.190> sits<00:06:03.460> in<00:06:03.610> the

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
in the reticular dermis it sits in the

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.189 
in the reticular dermis it sits in the
reticular<00:06:04.240> dermis<00:06:04.270> and<00:06:04.780> so<00:06:04.870> that's<00:06:05.050> the

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
reticular dermis and so that's the

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.309 
reticular dermis and so that's the
location<00:06:05.830> we<00:06:06.270> subscribe<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.569> hair<00:06:07.810> follicle

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
location we subscribe the hair follicle

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.740 
location we subscribe the hair follicle
receptor<00:06:08.830> to<00:06:09.009> and<00:06:09.250> lastly<00:06:09.909> as<00:06:10.150> long<00:06:10.360> as<00:06:10.539> we're

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
receptor to and lastly as long as we're

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.050 
receptor to and lastly as long as we're
kind<00:06:11.199> of<00:06:11.319> pushing<00:06:11.860> along<00:06:12.129> right<00:06:12.430> here<00:06:12.460> what

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
kind of pushing along right here what

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.240 
kind of pushing along right here what
will<00:06:13.150> happen<00:06:13.539> is<00:06:13.659> that<00:06:13.690> the<00:06:14.319> sodium<00:06:14.800> will<00:06:14.949> leak

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
will happen is that the sodium will leak

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.330 
will happen is that the sodium will leak
in<00:06:15.520> so<00:06:16.330> long<00:06:16.629> as<00:06:16.840> there's<00:06:17.259> an<00:06:17.530> active<00:06:17.979> space

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
in so long as there's an active space

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.640 
in so long as there's an active space
that's<00:06:18.669> present<00:06:19.120> but<00:06:19.509> because<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.080> reticular

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
that's present but because the reticular

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.399 
that's present but because the reticular
dermis<00:06:20.680> is<00:06:21.280> a<00:06:21.669> place<00:06:22.000> of<00:06:22.180> such<00:06:22.389> thick<00:06:22.960> dense

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
dermis is a place of such thick dense

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.700 
dermis is a place of such thick dense
connective<00:06:23.650> tissue<00:06:24.129> if<00:06:24.520> we<00:06:25.270> push<00:06:25.930> the<00:06:26.469> hair

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
connective tissue if we push the hair

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.409 
connective tissue if we push the hair
shaft<00:06:27.009> and<00:06:27.219> make<00:06:27.400> an<00:06:27.849> opening<00:06:28.210> right<00:06:28.360> here

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
shaft and make an opening right here

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.020 
shaft and make an opening right here
remember<00:06:29.349> that<00:06:29.379> there's<00:06:29.710> a<00:06:29.770> ton<00:06:30.159> of<00:06:30.190> collagen

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
remember that there's a ton of collagen

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.240 
remember that there's a ton of collagen
kind<00:06:31.330> of<00:06:31.419> sitting<00:06:31.780> around<00:06:31.900> that<00:06:32.680> can<00:06:32.830> come<00:06:33.099> and

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
kind of sitting around that can come and

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.939 
kind of sitting around that can come and
fill<00:06:33.849> the<00:06:34.090> gap<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:34.630> just<00:06:34.659> block<00:06:35.229> it<00:06:35.259> so<00:06:35.500> sodium

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
fill the gap and just block it so sodium

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.800 
fill the gap and just block it so sodium
could<00:06:36.279> not<00:06:36.430> enter<00:06:36.789> so<00:06:37.270> what<00:06:37.419> does<00:06:37.509> that<00:06:37.539> mean

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
could not enter so what does that mean

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.029 
could not enter so what does that mean
this<00:06:38.740> implies<00:06:39.190> then<00:06:39.550> that<00:06:40.000> we<00:06:40.150> need

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
this implies then that we need

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.850 
this implies then that we need
constantly<00:06:42.039> changing<00:06:42.969> stimuli<00:06:43.569> in<00:06:44.050> order<00:06:44.680> to

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
constantly changing stimuli in order to

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.490 
constantly changing stimuli in order to
have<00:06:45.190> a<00:06:45.610> signal<00:06:46.270> be<00:06:46.389> generated<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:47.229> so<00:06:47.349> this

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
have a signal be generated and so this

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.459 
have a signal be generated and so this
is<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:47.830> third<00:06:48.219> of<00:06:48.430> three<00:06:49.469> mechanoreceptors

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:50.469 
is the third of three mechanoreceptors

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:52.830 
is the third of three mechanoreceptors
that<00:06:50.949> requires<00:06:51.419> constantly<00:06:52.419> changing

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
that requires constantly changing

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.260 
that requires constantly changing
stimuli<00:06:53.169> so<00:06:53.860> that<00:06:54.039> the<00:06:54.250> hair<00:06:54.520> shaft<00:06:54.819> can

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
stimuli so that the hair shaft can

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.779 
stimuli so that the hair shaft can
constantly<00:06:55.900> be<00:06:56.050> opening<00:06:56.830> up<00:06:56.949> a<00:06:57.250> gap<00:06:57.550> for

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
constantly be opening up a gap for

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.760 
constantly be opening up a gap for
sodium<00:06:58.210> to<00:06:58.330> enter<00:06:58.360> and<00:06:58.840> it<00:06:58.990> has<00:06:59.169> to<00:06:59.349> do<00:06:59.529> so

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
sodium to enter and it has to do so

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.939 
sodium to enter and it has to do so
around<00:07:00.370> so<00:07:00.819> much<00:07:01.029> collagen<00:07:01.659> that'll<00:07:02.229> plug<00:07:02.650> the

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:02.949 
around so much collagen that'll plug the

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:04.950 
around so much collagen that'll plug the
opening<00:07:03.370> if<00:07:03.490> we<00:07:03.879> just<00:07:04.120> have<00:07:04.300> the<00:07:04.449> hair<00:07:04.659> held

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
opening if we just have the hair held

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.779 
opening if we just have the hair held
deflected<00:07:05.740> that's<00:07:06.039> the<00:07:06.129> whole<00:07:06.279> point<00:07:06.460> of<00:07:06.610> why

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
deflected that's the whole point of why

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:09.209 
deflected that's the whole point of why
you<00:07:07.300> don't<00:07:07.419> notice<00:07:07.690> a<00:07:07.990> hairband<00:07:08.560> that<00:07:08.800> you

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:09.219 
you don't notice a hairband that you

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:10.769 
you don't notice a hairband that you
might<00:07:09.370> be<00:07:09.520> wearing<00:07:09.759> over<00:07:10.120> a<00:07:10.150> long<00:07:10.419> period<00:07:10.750> of

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:10.779 
might be wearing over a long period of

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:11.580 
might be wearing over a long period of
time<00:07:10.870> because<00:07:11.139> that's<00:07:11.229> definitely

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
time because that's definitely

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.490 
time because that's definitely
deflecting<00:07:12.520> your<00:07:12.550> hair<00:07:12.940> but<00:07:13.629> over<00:07:14.020> time<00:07:14.199> it's

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500 
deflecting your hair but over time it's

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.219 
deflecting your hair but over time it's
as<00:07:14.650> noticeable<00:07:15.639> as<00:07:15.879> a<00:07:15.940> smooth<00:07:16.330> cotton<00:07:16.840> t-shirt

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.170 
as noticeable as a smooth cotton t-shirt
it's<00:07:17.500> there<00:07:18.039> but<00:07:18.250> you're<00:07:18.400> not<00:07:18.430> constantly

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
it's there but you're not constantly

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.089 
it's there but you're not constantly
detecting<00:07:19.870> it<00:07:19.990> and<00:07:20.199> it's<00:07:20.560> important<00:07:21.009> to

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:21.099 
detecting it and it's important to

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:23.580 
detecting it and it's important to
emphasize<00:07:21.219> that<00:07:21.759> this<00:07:21.879> is<00:07:21.940> a<00:07:22.240> very<00:07:22.659> essential

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590
