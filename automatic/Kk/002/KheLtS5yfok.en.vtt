I<00:02:39.970> went<00:02:40.660> for<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> shade<00:02:41.200> in<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.130> buff<00:02:42.310> which<00:02:43.150> I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
I went for the shade in the buff which I

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.750 
I went for the shade in the buff which I
would<00:02:43.690> say<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.080> little<00:02:44.830> bit<00:02:44.950> darker<00:02:45.519> than<00:02:45.640> my

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
would say is a little bit darker than my

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.280 
would say is a little bit darker than my
skin<00:02:45.790> tone<00:02:46.030> I'm<00:02:46.269> actually<00:02:46.420> wearing<00:02:46.780> gradual

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
skin tone I'm actually wearing gradual

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.020 
skin tone I'm actually wearing gradual
tan<00:02:47.470> around<00:02:47.680> my<00:02:47.769> face<00:02:47.950> right<00:02:48.190> now<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
tan around my face right now so it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.059 
tan around my face right now so it
matches<00:02:49.209> now<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> little<00:02:50.920> bit

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
matches now but it is a little bit

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.410 
matches now but it is a little bit
darker<00:02:51.400> than<00:02:51.519> my<00:02:51.640> skin<00:02:51.910> tone<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.209> probably

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
darker than my skin tone I probably

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.559 
darker than my skin tone I probably
could<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:52.989> gone<00:02:53.140> up<00:02:53.440> shade<00:02:53.799> but<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:55.420> know

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
could have gone up shade but you know

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.530 
could have gone up shade but you know
it's<00:02:55.720> some<00:02:56.470> summer<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.730> UK<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:58.269> going<00:02:58.450> on

stippling brush to apply that and
because<00:04:32.650> again<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:33.130> can't<00:04:33.310> really<00:04:33.550> work<00:04:33.790> this

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
because again you can't really work this

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.040 
because again you can't really work this
into<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.300> skinning<00:04:34.600> because<00:04:34.750> it's<00:04:34.870> quite<00:04:35.020> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
into the skinning because it's quite a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.830 
into the skinning because it's quite a
warm<00:04:35.380> color<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:36.340> really<00:04:36.370> don't<00:04:36.760> want<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.360> be

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
warm color you really don't want to be

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.360 
warm color you really don't want to be
overloading<00:04:38.560> your<00:04:38.680> skin<00:04:38.890> with<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.280> want

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
overloading your skin with that you want

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.890 
overloading your skin with that you want
it<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.580> look<00:04:39.700> quite<00:04:39.940> natural<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.540> this<00:04:40.660> buff

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
it to look quite natural so this buff

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.590 
it to look quite natural so this buff
sitting<00:04:41.170> really<00:04:41.320> nicely<00:04:41.650> bronzer<00:04:42.640> I<00:04:42.910> got<00:04:43.360> in

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
sitting really nicely bronzer I got in

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.420 
sitting really nicely bronzer I got in
South<00:04:44.050> Beach<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:44.950> is<00:04:45.100> going<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.310> be<00:04:45.400> a

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
South Beach and this is going to be a

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.220 
South Beach and this is going to be a
bronze<00:04:45.640> so<00:04:45.850> that's<00:04:46.030> more<00:04:46.360> suited<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.930> my<00:04:47.020> skin

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
bronze so that's more suited to my skin

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.930 
bronze so that's more suited to my skin
when<00:04:47.320> I've<00:04:47.410> been<00:04:47.440> on<00:04:47.650> holiday<00:04:47.800> on<00:04:48.520> top<00:04:48.700> of<00:04:48.820> that

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
when I've been on holiday on top of that

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.450 
when I've been on holiday on top of that
I<00:04:49.000> put<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.480> translucent<00:04:50.170> silk<00:04:50.460> finishing

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
I put the translucent silk finishing

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.940 
I put the translucent silk finishing
powder<00:04:51.700> which<00:04:52.500> would<00:04:53.500> be<00:04:53.620> really<00:04:53.860> nice

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
powder which would be really nice

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.130 
powder which would be really nice
actually<00:04:54.190> with<00:04:54.640> liquid<00:04:55.420> foundation<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:55.960> don't

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
actually with liquid foundation I don't

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
actually with liquid foundation I don't
think<00:04:56.290> it<00:04:56.410> you<00:04:56.500> can<00:04:56.650> just<00:04:56.680> use<00:04:56.950> it<00:04:57.070> with

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
think it you can just use it with

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.110 
think it you can just use it with
mineral<00:04:57.400> foundation<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:57.850> think<00:04:57.880> it'd<00:04:58.090> be

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
mineral foundation I think it'd be

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.390 
mineral foundation I think it'd be
really<00:04:58.300> nice<00:04:58.510> with<00:04:58.720> liquid<00:04:59.110> and<00:04:59.950> then<00:05:00.070> I<00:05:00.130> set

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
really nice with liquid and then I set

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.730 
really nice with liquid and then I set
the<00:05:00.430> whole<00:05:00.670> thing<00:05:01.000> with<00:05:01.420> my<00:05:01.720> skin<00:05:02.260> de<00:05:02.350> navier--

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
the whole thing with my skin de navier--

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.430 
the whole thing with my skin de navier--
and<00:05:03.390> setting<00:05:04.390> spray<00:05:04.600> that<00:05:04.750> I<00:05:04.780> use<00:05:04.990> every<00:05:05.260> day

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
and setting spray that I use every day

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.130 
and setting spray that I use every day
on<00:05:05.770> my<00:05:06.430> regular<00:05:07.000> foundations<00:05:07.720> where<00:05:07.960> it's

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
on my regular foundations where it's

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.630 
on my regular foundations where it's
really<00:05:08.290> well<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:08.860> freshen<00:05:09.220> up<00:05:09.280> your<00:05:09.340> skin

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
really well to just freshen up your skin

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.620 
really well to just freshen up your skin
and<00:05:09.760> make<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:09.880> look<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.180> little<00:05:10.300> bit<00:05:10.510> more

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
and make it look a little bit more

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.660 
and make it look a little bit more
cheery<00:05:10.990> but<00:05:11.200> to<00:05:11.620> be<00:05:11.710> honest<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.190> could<00:05:12.340> skip

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
cheery but to be honest you could skip

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.130 
cheery but to be honest you could skip
that<00:05:12.820> step<00:05:13.000> because<00:05:13.300> even<00:05:13.900> though<00:05:13.990> you've

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
that step because even though you've

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.500 
that step because even though you've
applied<00:05:14.380> a<00:05:14.950> finishing<00:05:15.550> powder<00:05:15.790> on<00:05:16.090> top<00:05:16.270> of<00:05:16.450> a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
applied a finishing powder on top of a

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.960 
applied a finishing powder on top of a
powder<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:17.410> doesn't<00:05:18.040> look<00:05:18.190> cakey<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:18.700> doesn't

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
powder it doesn't look cakey it doesn't

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.760 
powder it doesn't look cakey it doesn't
look<00:05:19.150> like<00:05:19.840> you've<00:05:20.020> got<00:05:20.200> a<00:05:20.230> lot<00:05:20.440> of<00:05:20.470> make<00:05:20.620> of

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
look like you've got a lot of make of

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.200 
look like you've got a lot of make of
them<00:05:20.890> which<00:05:21.040> is<00:05:21.160> what<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:21.340> really<00:05:21.610> really<00:05:21.910> like

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
them which is what I really really like

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.880 
them which is what I really really like
about<00:05:22.390> this<00:05:22.630> I<00:05:22.840> would<00:05:23.020> say<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.380> coverage<00:05:23.770> of

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
about this I would say the coverage of

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.950 
about this I would say the coverage of
this<00:05:24.040> is<00:05:24.310> medium<00:05:25.000> but<00:05:25.510> you<00:05:25.570> can<00:05:25.720> definitely

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
this is medium but you can definitely

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.680 
this is medium but you can definitely
build<00:05:26.500> it<00:05:26.710> up<00:05:26.890> in<00:05:27.160> any<00:05:27.670> areas<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.450> want

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
build it up in any areas that you want

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.780 
build it up in any areas that you want
to<00:05:28.870> but<00:05:29.050> what<00:05:29.170> I<00:05:29.200> would<00:05:29.440> probably<00:05:29.800> do

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
to but what I would probably do

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.760 
to but what I would probably do
personally<00:05:31.480> is<00:05:31.510> just<00:05:31.780> apply<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:32.020> little<00:05:32.140> bit<00:05:32.530> of

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
personally is just apply a little bit of

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.010 
personally is just apply a little bit of
my<00:05:32.980> favorite<00:05:33.370> concealer<00:05:33.790> underneath<00:05:34.090> which<00:05:34.870> I

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
my favorite concealer underneath which I

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.240 
my favorite concealer underneath which I
would<00:05:35.140> do<00:05:35.290> anywhere<00:05:35.620> with<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.830> regular

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
would do anywhere with a regular

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.790 
would do anywhere with a regular
foundation<00:05:36.400> so<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.390> I<00:05:37.960> would<00:05:38.200> say<00:05:38.380> medium

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
foundation so and I would say medium

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.270 
foundation so and I would say medium
coverage<00:05:39.160> can<00:05:39.520> be<00:05:39.700> built<00:05:40.060> up<00:05:40.300> but<00:05:40.990> very

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
coverage can be built up but very

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.020 
coverage can be built up but very
natural-looking<00:05:42.280> and<00:05:42.790> what<00:05:42.940> I've<00:05:43.000> noticed

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
natural-looking and what I've noticed

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.150 
natural-looking and what I've noticed
with<00:05:43.540> this<00:05:43.630> as<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.930> wears<00:05:44.140> really<00:05:44.440> well<00:05:44.590> it

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
with this as it wears really well it

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.220 
with this as it wears really well it
doesn't<00:05:45.460> move<00:05:45.580> around<00:05:45.640> like<00:05:46.450> some<00:05:46.750> liquid

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
doesn't move around like some liquid

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.720 
doesn't move around like some liquid
foundations<00:05:47.770> come<00:05:47.980> which<00:05:48.130> is<00:05:48.280> really<00:05:48.550> good

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
foundations come which is really good

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.270 
foundations come which is really good
lasting<00:05:49.150> power<00:05:49.300> for<00:05:49.600> me<00:05:49.690> is<00:05:49.900> quite<00:05:50.710> good<00:05:50.980> just

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
lasting power for me is quite good just

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.400 
lasting power for me is quite good just
probably<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.330> little<00:05:52.450> bit<00:05:52.690> more<00:05:52.840> than<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.140> liquid

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
probably a little bit more than a liquid

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.410 
probably a little bit more than a liquid
foundation<00:05:53.560> also<00:05:54.550> when<00:05:54.730> it<00:05:54.820> does<00:05:55.030> start<00:05:55.330> to

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
foundation also when it does start to

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.150 
foundation also when it does start to
fade<00:05:55.690> off<00:05:55.840> a<00:05:55.870> little<00:05:56.050> bit<00:05:56.290> it<00:05:56.710> doesn't<00:05:57.100> go

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
fade off a little bit it doesn't go

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.980 
fade off a little bit it doesn't go
party<00:05:57.610> on<00:05:57.730> me<00:05:57.910> which<00:05:58.090> I<00:05:58.270> really<00:05:58.540> like<00:05:58.720> I<00:05:58.960> don't

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
party on me which I really like I don't

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.870 
party on me which I really like I don't
necessarily<00:05:59.350> mind<00:05:59.980> if<00:06:00.160> a<00:06:00.250> foundation<00:06:00.730> doesn't

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
necessarily mind if a foundation doesn't

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.400 
necessarily mind if a foundation doesn't
last<00:06:01.120> on<00:06:01.270> me<00:06:01.420> all<00:06:01.480> day<00:06:01.660> because<00:06:01.810> I<00:06:02.020> do<00:06:02.080> usually

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
last on me all day because I do usually

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.400 
last on me all day because I do usually
touch-up<00:06:03.130> but<00:06:03.880> if<00:06:04.300> it<00:06:04.540> doesn't<00:06:04.780> last<00:06:04.930> all<00:06:05.170> day

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
touch-up but if it doesn't last all day

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.760 
touch-up but if it doesn't last all day
and<00:06:05.680> it's<00:06:06.310> fading<00:06:06.820> in<00:06:07.120> a<00:06:07.900> patchy<00:06:08.170> way<00:06:08.500> then

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
and it's fading in a patchy way then

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.440 
and it's fading in a patchy way then
that's<00:06:08.920> what's<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.370> real<00:06:09.520> no-no<00:06:09.910> for<00:06:10.060> me<00:06:10.180> if<00:06:10.330> it

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
that's what's a real no-no for me if it

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.210 
that's what's a real no-no for me if it
fades<00:06:10.960> evenly<00:06:11.500> then<00:06:11.620> that's<00:06:11.830> not<00:06:12.010> a<00:06:12.040> problem

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
fades evenly then that's not a problem

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.430 
fades evenly then that's not a problem
because<00:06:12.550> it's<00:06:12.760> just<00:06:12.940> fading<00:06:13.330> off<00:06:13.510> and<00:06:13.810> all

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
because it's just fading off and all

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.720 
because it's just fading off and all
your<00:06:14.620> life<00:06:14.770> with<00:06:14.950> splotches<00:06:15.430> all<00:06:15.490> of<00:06:15.640> your

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
your life with splotches all of your

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.980 
your life with splotches all of your
face<00:06:15.910> I<00:06:15.940> don't<00:06:16.150> like<00:06:16.270> that<00:06:16.510> look<00:06:16.690> and<00:06:16.900> you

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
face I don't like that look and you

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.240 
face I don't like that look and you
definitely<00:06:17.200> don't<00:06:17.530> get<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:17.950> from<00:06:18.130> this

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
definitely don't get that from this

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.100 
definitely don't get that from this
which<00:06:18.460> is<00:06:18.580> really<00:06:18.850> good<00:06:19.030> I<00:06:19.270> think<00:06:19.870> it's<00:06:19.990> a

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
which is really good I think it's a

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.410 
which is really good I think it's a
really<00:06:20.320> good<00:06:20.590> price<00:06:21.040> and<00:06:21.580> I<00:06:22.000> think<00:06:22.180> you<00:06:22.240> get

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
really good price and I think you get

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.420 
really good price and I think you get
quite<00:06:22.630> a<00:06:22.660> lot<00:06:22.840> part<00:06:23.080> of<00:06:23.170> you<00:06:23.350> money<00:06:23.590> and<00:06:23.860> it's

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
quite a lot part of you money and it's

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.490 
quite a lot part of you money and it's
definitely<00:06:24.970> well<00:06:25.240> formulated<00:06:25.930> product<00:06:26.320> the

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
definitely well formulated product the

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.660 
definitely well formulated product the
only<00:06:26.680> thing<00:06:26.800> is<00:06:26.950> because<00:06:27.280> you're<00:06:27.430> ordering

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
only thing is because you're ordering

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.910 
only thing is because you're ordering
online<00:06:28.030> obviously<00:06:28.390> it<00:06:29.290> can<00:06:29.470> be<00:06:29.560> a<00:06:29.590> little<00:06:29.800> bit

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
online obviously it can be a little bit

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.590 
online obviously it can be a little bit
difficult<00:06:30.100> to<00:06:30.460> select<00:06:30.610> shades<00:06:31.030> and<00:06:31.420> I

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
difficult to select shades and I

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.820 
difficult to select shades and I
definitely<00:06:32.020> think<00:06:32.110> I<00:06:32.260> could<00:06:32.320> have<00:06:32.500> done<00:06:32.530> with

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
definitely think I could have done with

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.620 
definitely think I could have done with
a<00:06:32.860> slightly<00:06:33.160> lighter<00:06:33.430> shade<00:06:33.640> they<00:06:34.090> do<00:06:34.150> offer<00:06:34.600> a

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
a slightly lighter shade they do offer a

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.050 
a slightly lighter shade they do offer a
sampling<00:06:35.080> service<00:06:35.530> so<00:06:35.680> you<00:06:35.710> can<00:06:35.800> order<00:06:36.400> some

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
sampling service so you can order some

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.770 
sampling service so you can order some
small<00:06:37.630> parts<00:06:38.080> and<00:06:38.320> you<00:06:38.440> can<00:06:38.470> see

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
small parts and you can see

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.120 
small parts and you can see
which<00:06:39.170> is<00:06:39.350> right<00:06:39.590> for<00:06:39.740> you<00:06:39.860> without

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
which is right for you without

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.379 
which is right for you without
committing<00:06:40.460> to<00:06:40.580> a<00:06:40.700> big<00:06:40.880> part<00:06:41.120> which<00:06:41.240> is

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
committing to a big part which is

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.420 
committing to a big part which is
definitely<00:06:41.570> a<00:06:41.870> good<00:06:42.080> way<00:06:42.230> to<00:06:42.920> do<00:06:43.070> it<00:06:43.220> if<00:06:43.340> you

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
definitely a good way to do it if you

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.680 
definitely a good way to do it if you
don't<00:06:43.550> have<00:06:43.820> kind<00:06:44.090> of<00:06:44.120> a<00:06:44.210> high<00:06:44.360> street

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
don't have kind of a high street

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.510 
don't have kind of a high street
presence<00:06:44.960> all<00:06:45.410> in<00:06:45.710> all<00:06:45.860> I<00:06:45.889> would<00:06:46.010> definitely

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
presence all in all I would definitely

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.010 
presence all in all I would definitely
recommend<00:06:46.639> the<00:06:46.970> lui<00:06:47.120> low-low<00:06:47.570> either<00:06:47.810> if

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
recommend the lui low-low either if

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.379 
recommend the lui low-low either if
you're<00:06:48.169> a<00:06:48.200> mineral<00:06:48.620> fan<00:06:48.860> or<00:06:49.130> you<00:06:49.940> kind<00:06:50.090> of<00:06:50.180> fed

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
you're a mineral fan or you kind of fed

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:51.550 
you're a mineral fan or you kind of fed
up<00:06:50.480> with<00:06:50.570> your<00:06:50.690> current<00:06:50.840> foundations<00:06:51.470> and

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
up with your current foundations and

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.110 
up with your current foundations and
you've<00:06:51.710> not<00:06:51.860> really<00:06:52.010> tried<00:06:52.340> mineral<00:06:52.760> makeup

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
you've not really tried mineral makeup

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.490 
you've not really tried mineral makeup
but<00:06:53.210> you're<00:06:53.360> willing<00:06:53.600> to<00:06:53.630> give<00:06:53.840> it<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:53.990> go<00:06:54.200> I

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
but you're willing to give it a go I

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.780 
but you're willing to give it a go I
don't<00:06:54.680> think<00:06:54.889> it's<00:06:55.010> worth<00:06:55.160> the<00:06:55.310> money

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790 
don't think it's worth the money

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.090 
don't think it's worth the money
really<00:06:56.300> nice<00:06:56.450> application<00:06:56.690> price<00:06:57.560> is<00:06:57.830> good

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
really nice application price is good

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.360 
really nice application price is good

and good shade selection only fingers

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.740 
and good shade selection only fingers

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:03.889 
just have to be a little bit careful

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:06.700 
just have to be a little bit careful
with<00:07:03.950> the<00:07:04.070> shades<00:07:04.310> and<00:07:04.870> maybe<00:07:05.870> order<00:07:06.680> some
