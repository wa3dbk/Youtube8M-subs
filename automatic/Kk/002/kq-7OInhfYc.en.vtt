00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.010
 hello pilots with you gif and 26 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.340
 this week's news release is quite 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.779
 a little and almost all gaming 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.130
 in the newsletter pretty often 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.500
 news from e3 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.570
 I have already told you about them 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.349
 what I did not say correctly braben got 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.040
 no reward 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.410
 from e3 and that Guinness book of records for 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.540
 the longest series space simulator a in 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.000
 Otherwise, only showed a screenshot 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.860
 more precisely render fighters all three 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.360
 condor who will appear in the combo class 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.430
 less nights but this one is in low resolution 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.250
 This week the game has been updated as 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.620
 client and server side if you 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.110
 remember the video about the power I told you 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.340
 in most systems pilots perform 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.610
 both tasks for example 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.460
 and to protect and weaken the system 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.619
 to complicate the task of the players 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.750
 developers raised the bar five times 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.600
 for all types of tasks and 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.579
 need to raise more therefore 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.049
 players who are now actively playing 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.639
 powerplay weaken protect systems 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.710
 I advise you to carefully watch where your 

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:23.840
 strength needs help because more 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.200
 100 percent make no sense 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.729
 there is no better goal but to transfer resources to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.490
 the rest of these updates contain 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.889
 in every possible way corrections and how much I 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.020
 it is known great on receipt 

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.209
 following missions to the ranks of the federation and 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.539
 alliance 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:43.909
 exact numbers I do not have seats on the I 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.869
 I realized that the higher the rank the longer to wait 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.450
 new mission 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.369
 but where is she there in my area 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.130
 a few hours at least for sure 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.170
 not a week so if someone does not give 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.609
 new mission for weeks write 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.429
 developers about shooting 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.079
 ships of enemy forces 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.950
 here I had time to shoot 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.779
 this week 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.660
 what I actually did all 

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:10.849
 quite easily shot off often 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.560
 fly transport workers either small 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.349
 ships 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.540
 if you fly for friends then you got 15 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.120
 points are not divided at all as is the case with 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.450
 reward and get 15 points each 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.100
 pilot only two points are 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.470
 pauses when in the system 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.320
 no one appears from the enemies and you 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.250
 can you fly there 57 and no one 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.990
 intercept and second that here are the glasses 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.000
 politicians who got needed 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.480
 sure to have time to hand over to the capital 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.550
 until the end of the turn otherwise they just wo n't 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.750
 counted and at your death there is still 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:52.100
 speak a move for those who forget remind 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.930
 happening on thursday what else is together with 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.870
 the pilot is blind walker for what is great 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.510
 thanks, we checked a couple of weeks ago 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.390
 how do drones work if you dig in the wing and 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.640
 as considered ore steroids result 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.200
 The following composition of ore in asteroids 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.750
 same for all pilots 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.850
 but for each pilot he is considered 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.340
 separately that is for example i can 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.310
 dig in a steroid and for me it's empty a 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.760
 other pilots for them he is not full yet 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.040
 didn't dig your share 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.500
 moreover if the pilot release the drone 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.300
 the researcher is the link then drone 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.670
 will show for each pilot their 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.130
 ore values i mean mine for me 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.500
 for colleagues on the link will be their value 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.870
 how much is left for them therefore for those 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.370
 who wants to dig zine in principle can 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.950
 explore or take only one 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.990
 pilot and flight managers 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.300
 drones pickers usually drag in 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.390
 your dead body but sometimes don't mind drag 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.770
 in a stranger if your for example is closed well 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.720
 about ore 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.730
 yours is not any here 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.910
 problems they carry everything indiscriminately 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.460
 I absolutely do not understand separately from 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.650
 news I made a video about fines and 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.050
 penalties as a separate fork because 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.120
 what began to arrive many questions on 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.150
 this look tried to check everything 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.940
 moments that could well be news on this 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.240
 come to an end with you was gif and successful 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.240
 you flight
