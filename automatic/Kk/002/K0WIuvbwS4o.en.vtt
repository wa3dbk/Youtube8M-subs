00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.020
So in today's episode i'm going to be making Dominos Garlic Bread!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.500
Its very easy to make, and you can make it at home!

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.680
The obvious crowd pleaser, so lets make Dominos Garlic Bread!

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.260
The ingredients we need to make Dominos garlic bread are:

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.540
250 grams/2 cups of all purpose flour

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:33.677
2 tablespoons butter

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.560
2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon sugar

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.910
2 tablespoons chopped garlic

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940
2 tablespoons corn meal

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.300
1 and a half teaspoon dry yeast!

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.222
oregano, 1 teaspoon

00:00:45.222 --> 00:00:49.580
Pizza seasoning, 1-2 teaspoon, garlic herb bread seasoning 1 teaspoon

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.081
and lukewarm water

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.140
Firstly, we'll add yeast to lukewarm water

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.972
so that it rises

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.400
1 teaspoon yeast and the sugar

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.880
mix well!

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.880
set aside for 10-15 minutes

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.500
so that the yeast activates which you can identify when you see bubbles

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.400
so now pour your "all purpose flour" to a bowl

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.980
the yeast has activated the bubbles are here. Now we'll prepare the dough

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:42.240
make some space in the centre for the yeast

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:53.500
mix it well, add butter, olive oil, finely chopped garlic

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.480
ensure that you put a lot of garlic(or garlic powder), so that a lot of fragrance exudes

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.380
Now i'll add garlic herbs, if you don't have them dont worry its optional

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.933
oregano

00:02:08.207 --> 00:02:10.207
pizza seasoning

00:02:12.453 --> 00:02:14.453
add a little water

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.380
My dough is ready! Its supposed to be sticky like this, now I'll take it out and put it on a surface

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.700
we'll knead it nicely, but before that, we'll dust some flour on the surface

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.320
we'll knead it now. For this dough, I've used around 3/4th cups of water

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.240
This step is important, because the gluten develops like this

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.360
after kneading it like this, we'll spread some oil in the bowl

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.240
and store the dough in it, covered

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820
tuck it in itself a little...and perfect

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.760
now we'll keep it in the bowl

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.420
rub olive oil

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.340
cover it with plastic wrap and store

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.280
traditionally its kept for 24 hours so that it rises

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.380
but since I don't have either the time or the patience

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.620
I'm going to do a trick!

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.860
I have pre-heated my oven for 10 minutes

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.100
I'll keep the dough in it, but I'll switch it off

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.780
I'll keep it in the switched off pre-heated oven for 30 minutes, and it'll have risen when i take it out

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.780
so thats my little trick

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.280
I have switched it off, I'm also taking the plug out

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.740
Lets keep it for half an hour

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:14.200
We won't close it because its very hot inside, so we'll keep it a little open so the hot air escapes

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200
and it rises quickly

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.600
you can keep it anywhere in the kitchen or home where its hot

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.700
and if you want to give it 24 hours thats awesome too, you could knead at night

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.900
and prepare the garlic bread in the morning

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:36.373
so i'm leaving it for half an hour

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:44.220
after half an hour, the dough has risen well

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.319
take it out on your surface

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.760
knead it again

00:05:09.553 --> 00:05:11.553
cut it in half

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.160
we'll make 2 garlic breads from it, keep one part of the dough aside

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.420
lets start making garlic bread

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.020
dust some corn meal on the surface, that would enure crispiness

00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:33.515
a little above

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.040
now we'll spread butter

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.540
some oregano to top off

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.589
pizza seasoning

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.000
and now we'll fold!

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:23.800
now we'll shift it to the baking tray but ensure you've spread butter on the tray before

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.240
and on it, flood pizza seasoning or oregano

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.640
and shift the dough finally

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.200
do spread butter abundantly on the dough

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:57.060
a round of oregano and pizza seasoning again!

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.700
now we'll slit it, don't go all the way till the end

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.760
just slit it a little, the way garlic bread has those cuts

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.220
within every inch

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.180
you can put cheese in the dough and make it cheesy garlic bread too(like in the little video below)

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.980
the dough is ready to go into the oven and become garlic bread,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.000
I have pre heated the oven for 10 minutes

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.720
we'll bake it on 200 degrees

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.899
for 15-20 minutes

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.960
it also depends on your oven, so you should check that

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.460
so my garlic bread is ready, its exactly like Dominos!

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.460
my whole house smells amazing

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.580
I had filled the second one with cheese, so its cheesy garlic bread

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:59.080
