is like this choice I just what yeah

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.230 
is like this choice I just what yeah
see<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.310> short<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.790> wouldn't<00:01:51.119> like

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
see if it was this short I wouldn't like

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.749 
see if it was this short I wouldn't like
it<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:51.960> yeah<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:56.219> would

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it just because yeah and I really would

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.539 
it just because yeah and I really would
not<00:01:56.969> recommend<00:01:57.659> wearing<00:01:58.290> leggings<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.250> pants

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
not recommend wearing leggings as pants

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.340 
not recommend wearing leggings as pants
I<00:01:59.759> think<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.180> does<00:02:00.570> not<00:02:00.659> look<00:02:00.810> great

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I think it just does not look great

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830 
I think it just does not look great
it<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.369> because<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> material<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.630> too

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it just it's because the material is too

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.870 
it just it's because the material is too
thin<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.350> doesn't<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.219> leave<00:02:05.490> enough

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
thin and just doesn't like leave enough

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.880 
thin and just doesn't like leave enough
to<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> imagination<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:07.829> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
now I'm wearing this outfit with

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.760 
now I'm wearing this outfit with
leggings<00:05:06.419> and<00:05:06.659> I<00:05:06.960> actually<00:05:07.110> rolled<00:05:07.379> up<00:05:07.620> the

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
leggings and I actually rolled up the

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.249 
leggings and I actually rolled up the
scourge<00:05:08.189> of<00:05:08.430> fish<00:05:08.729> a<00:05:09.060> competitor<00:05:09.539> actually<00:05:09.870> if

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
scourge of fish a competitor actually if

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.839 
scourge of fish a competitor actually if
you<00:05:10.439> can<00:05:10.620> see<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:10.979> think<00:05:11.039> that<00:05:11.490> if<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.699> do

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
you can see and I think that if you do

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.510 
you can see and I think that if you do
that<00:05:12.150> then<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.289> leggings<00:05:13.680> really<00:05:14.009> works<00:05:14.189> well

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
that then the leggings really works well

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.019 
that then the leggings really works well
with<00:05:14.669> it

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:15.029 
with it

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.899 
with it
but<00:05:15.449> if<00:05:16.349> you<00:05:16.529> just<00:05:16.770> leave<00:05:17.009> it<00:05:17.039> sale<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.879> don't

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
but if you just leave it sale I don't

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.999 
but if you just leave it sale I don't
know<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.319> it's<00:05:19.319> just<00:05:19.500> again<00:05:19.830> I<00:05:19.860> don't

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
know I just it's just again I don't

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.040 
know I just it's just again I don't
think<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:20.400> works<00:05:20.610> quite<00:05:20.789> as<00:05:21.539> well<00:05:21.810> just

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
think it works quite as well just

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.730 
think it works quite as well just
because<00:05:22.349> of<00:05:22.469> the<00:05:22.560> length<00:05:23.900> yes<00:05:24.900> that<00:05:25.259> would<00:05:25.560> be

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
because of the length yes that would be

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.760 
because of the length yes that would be
what<00:05:25.919> it<00:05:26.039> would<00:05:26.879> look<00:05:27.000> like<00:05:27.060> Bush<00:05:27.479> and<00:05:27.779> I<00:05:28.650> don't

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
what it would look like Bush and I don't

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.800 
what it would look like Bush and I don't
I<00:05:29.430> couldn't<00:05:29.849> imagine<00:05:29.969> myself<00:05:30.240> wearing<00:05:30.569> it

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
I couldn't imagine myself wearing it

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.600 
I couldn't imagine myself wearing it
like<00:05:30.960> that<00:05:31.139> but<00:05:31.650> if<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:31.979> was<00:05:32.069> rolled<00:05:32.310> off<00:05:32.490> a

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
like that but if it was rolled off a

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:41.719 
like that but if it was rolled off a
little<00:05:32.729> bit<00:05:32.969> then<00:05:33.599> I<00:05:33.810> check<00:05:34.050> in<00:05:34.199> with<00:05:34.229> my<00:05:40.729> so

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729
