00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
usual way to do this is via this address

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.450 
usual way to do this is via this address
192.168.0.1<00:00:33.020> ok<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:35.130> life<00:00:35.280> to

you'll<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.879> go<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.030> advanced<00:00:42.450> settings

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you'll have to go to advanced settings

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.639 
you'll have to go to advanced settings
and<00:00:47.719> usually<00:00:48.719> under<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.440> under

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and usually under it will be under

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.740 
and usually under it will be under
security<00:00:50.100> usually<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.390> find<00:00:51.539> something

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
security usually but just find something

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.950 
security usually but just find something
that's<00:00:52.620> called<00:00:52.890> port<00:00:53.250> forwarding<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:54.329> could

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that's called port forwarding it could

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.099 
that's called port forwarding it could
be<00:00:55.110> anywhere<00:00:55.520> depending<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:57.000> make<00:00:57.510> make

one we're going to need to set up a new

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.980 
one we're going to need to set up a new
one<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.299> might<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:17.210> but<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.240> the

Virgin it isn't so just just give it a
name<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:25.320> yeah<00:01:26.280> you'll<00:01:26.580> need<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.790> give

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
name like that yeah you'll need to give

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.499 
name like that yeah you'll need to give
it<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.180> start<00:01:27.479> port<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:29.009> port<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:30.409> 3389

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
it a start port and the port is 3389

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.560 
it a start port and the port is 3389
3399<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.680> port<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
3399 and it is just that port and to the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.830 
3399 and it is just that port and to the
end<00:01:36.720> port<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> same<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.689> this<00:01:39.689> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
end port is also the same for this is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.039 
end port is also the same for this is
the<00:01:39.930> port<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.770> IDP<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.700> connecting<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the port at the IDP is to connecting the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.550 
the port at the IDP is to connecting the
protocols<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.740> use<00:01:44.040> will<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.909> TCP<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> UDP

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
protocols that use will be TCP and UDP

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.270 
protocols that use will be TCP and UDP
so<00:01:47.399> these<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.790> needed<00:01:48.360> selected<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
so these will be needed selected and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.219 
so these will be needed selected and
select<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.850> IP<00:01:51.000> address<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.479> your<00:01:51.540> computer

and<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.950> was<00:02:24.470> I'm<00:02:25.470> going<00:02:25.770> for<00:02:25.920> phone<00:02:26.069> number<00:02:26.280> in

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and it was I'm going for phone number in

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.070 
and it was I'm going for phone number in
here<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.840> was<00:02:28.080> 19<00:02:28.500> because<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
here it was 19 because this is a the the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.860 
here it was 19 because this is a the the
computer<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.830> want<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.160> forward<00:02:32.489> to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
computer that you want it to forward to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.850 
computer that you want it to forward to
and<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:34.020> what<00:02:34.110> we<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.500> add<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> rule

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
and then what we do is just add the rule

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.030 
and then what we do is just add the rule
okay<00:02:38.510> once<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.840> done<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.590> not<00:02:40.739> over

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
