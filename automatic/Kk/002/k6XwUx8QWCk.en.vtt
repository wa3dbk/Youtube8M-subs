Crusaders<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:55.119> think<00:00:55.780> we<00:00:55.869> can<00:00:55.989> all<00:00:56.140> assume<00:00:56.409> that

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
Crusaders I think we can all assume that

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.869 
Crusaders I think we can all assume that
it's<00:00:56.710> been<00:00:56.830> a<00:00:56.860> whole<00:00:57.129> year<00:00:57.189> since<00:00:57.640> the

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
it's been a whole year since the

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.240

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
beginning of the show and in no way do I

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.609 
beginning of the show and in no way do I
want<00:01:00.339> them<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.820> be<00:01:00.909> completely<00:01:01.509> grown<00:01:01.900> up<00:01:02.110> but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
want them to be completely grown up but

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.380 
want them to be completely grown up but
they<00:01:02.799> are<00:01:03.009> kids<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.699> kids<00:01:03.909> look<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.180> little

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
they are kids and kids look a little

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.859

different<00:01:04.839> every<00:01:04.960> year<00:01:06.119> take<00:01:07.119> Jim<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:07.659> Tim

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
different every year take Jim and Tim

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.560

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
possible for example these tweeds looked

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.690 
possible for example these tweeds looked
exactly<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.110> same<00:01:11.259> for<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.040> first<00:01:12.280> three

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
exactly the same for the first three

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.609 
exactly the same for the first three
seasons<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:13.240> kompas<00:01:13.570> well<00:01:13.840> but<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.380> fourth

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
seasons of kompas well but the fourth

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.319 
seasons of kompas well but the fourth
season<00:01:14.860> they<00:01:15.369> were<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.520> little<00:01:15.579> taller<00:01:16.030> they

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
season they were a little taller they

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:17.609 
season they were a little taller they
had<00:01:16.450> different<00:01:16.810> clothes<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.439> could

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
had different clothes and you could

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.490 
had different clothes and you could
definitely<00:01:17.799> tell<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.369> they<00:01:18.670> were<00:01:18.700> older<00:01:19.500> so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
definitely tell that they were older so

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.370 
definitely tell that they were older so
for<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.009> CMC<00:01:21.670> maybe<00:01:22.509> they<00:01:22.930> could<00:01:23.170> get<00:01:23.350> a

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
for the CMC maybe they could get a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.980 
for the CMC maybe they could get a
little<00:01:23.590> taller<00:01:23.979> longer<00:01:24.579> hair<00:01:25.060> may<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:25.869> a

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
little taller longer hair may be a

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.580 
little taller longer hair may be a
