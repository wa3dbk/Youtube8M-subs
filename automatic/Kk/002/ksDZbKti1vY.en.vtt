your SD card so as you can see my 7300

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.260 
your SD card so as you can see my 7300
is<00:00:38.820> mounted<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.780> my<00:00:39.809> front<00:00:40.469> windshield<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.820> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is mounted on my front windshield it is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270 
is mounted on my front windshield it is
my<00:00:42.600> main<00:00:42.870> dashcam<00:00:43.379> at<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> moment<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
my main dashcam at the moment and you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.000 
my main dashcam at the moment and you
can<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.800> small

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
can see that it is really really small

so<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.879> small<00:00:51.410> because<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so I like it it's small because it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.139 
so I like it it's small because it
doesn't<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.690> SD<00:00:54.899> card<00:00:55.289> slot

doesn't have to have the SD card slot

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.020 
doesn't have to have the SD card slot
inside<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.449> camera<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.940> the

right in here and you can see that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.359 
right in here and you can see that
that's<00:01:33.659> d-<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:34.680> SD<00:01:35.040> card<00:01:35.070> right<00:01:35.430> there

that's d- that's my SD card right there

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.069 
that's d- that's my SD card right there
and<00:01:39.799> this<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> power<00:01:41.340> cable<00:01:41.850> which<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and this is the power cable which is

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.950 
and this is the power cable which is
coming<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.890> from<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.340> fuse<00:01:44.700> box<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.720> right

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
coming in from my fuse box on the right

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.649 
coming in from my fuse box on the right
side<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.590> panel<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.479> was

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
side right panel here so it was

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.870 
side right panel here so it was
relatedly<00:01:49.259> easy<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:50.100> me<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.610> honest

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
relatedly easy for me to be honest

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.210 
relatedly easy for me to be honest
because<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.630> Audi's<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.290> fuse<00:01:52.680> boxes<00:01:53.009> aren't

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
because for Audi's the fuse boxes aren't

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.990 
because for Audi's the fuse boxes aren't
on<00:01:53.399> both<00:01:53.670> sides<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> hide

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
on both sides and because I want to hide

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.090 
on both sides and because I want to hide
my<00:01:57.000> body<00:01:57.210> compartment<00:01:58.049> inside<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.710> glove<00:01:58.950> box

my body compartment inside the glove box

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
my body compartment inside the glove box
and<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.759> make<00:01:59.909> it<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:00.360> cleaner

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and to make it a little more cleaner

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.280 
and to make it a little more cleaner
less<00:02:01.439> wire<00:02:01.740> work<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.250> decide<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.939> use<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.290> power

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
less wire work I decide to use a power

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.719 
less wire work I decide to use a power
from<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.009> side<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:06.270> look<00:02:07.079> at<00:02:07.259> 1700<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.340> also

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
from this side and look at 1700 can also

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.900 
from this side and look at 1700 can also
be<00:02:09.569> hardwired<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:11.370> provide<00:02:11.640> parking

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
be hardwired to do to provide parking

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
be hardwired to do to provide parking
mode<00:02:12.150> by<00:02:12.270> motion<00:02:12.629> detection

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
mode by motion detection

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.280 
mode by motion detection
it<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.549> good<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.650> hardwire<00:02:16.650> them<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.989> wire

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
it is good to hardwire them so this wire

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.640 
it is good to hardwire them so this wire
is<00:02:19.730> actually<00:02:20.730> coming<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.299> from<00:02:21.629> my<00:02:22.110> fuse<00:02:22.379> box

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
is actually coming in from my fuse box

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.740 
is actually coming in from my fuse box
so<00:02:23.280> all<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.519> power<00:02:23.760> cables<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.450> whatnot

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
so all the power cables and whatnot

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.860 
so all the power cables and whatnot
there<00:02:24.959> are<00:02:25.110> all<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.799> top<00:02:26.489> 10<00:02:26.730> sign<00:02:27.120> my<00:02:27.299> fuse<00:02:27.569> box

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
there are all in top 10 sign my fuse box

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.559 
there are all in top 10 sign my fuse box
so<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:28.799> i<00:02:28.830> have<00:02:29.190> here<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.269> body

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
so all i have here is the body

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.589 
so all i have here is the body
compartment<00:02:31.170> with<00:02:31.349> some<00:02:31.530> wires<00:02:31.799> and

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
compartment with some wires and

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.500 
compartment with some wires and
basically<00:02:33.599> i<00:02:33.870> would<00:02:34.379> lock<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.860> thing<00:02:35.510> close

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
basically i would lock this thing close

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.690 
basically i would lock this thing close
it<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.870> lock<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:38.180> they<00:02:39.180> won't<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.569> so

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
it and lock it and they won't know so

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.470 
it and lock it and they won't know so
people<00:02:41.700> wanted<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.530> basically<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> unit

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
people wanted to basically have a unit

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.259 
people wanted to basically have a unit
in<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.019> market<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.519> have

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
in the market that you can have

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.869 
in the market that you can have
separated<00:02:48.870> body<00:02:49.530> through<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> camera<00:02:50.519> so

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
separated body through the camera so

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.880 
separated body through the camera so
even<00:02:51.420> if<00:02:51.569> someone<00:02:51.900> were<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.079> snatch<00:02:52.470> away<00:02:52.500> your

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
even if someone were to snatch away your

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
even if someone were to snatch away your
camera<00:02:53.250> your<00:02:53.370> SD<00:02:53.819> card<00:02:53.849> is<00:02:54.269> kept<00:02:54.930> this

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
camera your SD card is kept this

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.830 
camera your SD card is kept this
somewhere<00:02:55.650> kept<00:02:56.129> in<00:02:56.280> somewhere<00:02:56.640> secure<00:02:57.120> for

somewhere kept in somewhere secure for
