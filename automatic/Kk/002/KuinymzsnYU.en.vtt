00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.720

 the race red flag that means 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.799
 Now the vehicles are gathering here 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.830

 get the corner and then be on the 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:31.399
 evenly, the stretched posts are booked 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:35.050

 unbelievable what these cars cut up 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.270
 Of course, this is only the second at the moment 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.520
 but worry in the background we have 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.890

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.630

 pass by outside and drives privately 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.120
 that's what he wants to do to open the door for him 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:25.370
