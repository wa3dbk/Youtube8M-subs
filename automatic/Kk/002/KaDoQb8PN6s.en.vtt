moving on to the back we do have a
cutout<00:02:23.240> for<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.510> camera<00:02:23.840> which<00:02:23.990> looks<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.350> be

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
cutout for the camera which looks to be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.530 
cutout for the camera which looks to be
just<00:02:24.500> fine<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> little<00:02:25.970> speaker<00:02:26.360> grill

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
down here and of course you know your

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.270 
down here and of course you know your
30-pin<00:02:29.000> cut<00:02:29.870> out<00:02:30.020> here<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.980> let's<00:02:31.130> go<00:02:31.250> ahead

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
30-pin cut out here so let's go ahead

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.570 
30-pin cut out here so let's go ahead
and<00:02:31.430> see<00:02:31.580> if<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.060> has<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.510> smart<00:02:33.020> cover

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
and see if this has the smart cover

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.760 
and see if this has the smart cover
features<00:02:34.720> there<00:02:35.720> we<00:02:35.810> go<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.290> does<00:02:36.440> have<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
features there we go so it does have the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.500 
features there we go so it does have the
magnets<00:02:37.160> which<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.459> very<00:02:37.670> nice<00:02:37.910> although<00:02:38.480> I

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
magnets which is very nice although I

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.060 
magnets which is very nice although I
would<00:02:38.720> assume<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.020> almost<00:02:39.290> all<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.709> them<00:02:39.830> do

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
would assume that almost all of them do

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.300 
would assume that almost all of them do
at<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.459> point<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.560> there<00:02:42.709> we<00:02:42.800> go<00:02:42.830> now<00:02:43.190> one

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
at this point so there we go now one

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.920 
at this point so there we go now one
thing<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.520> can<00:02:43.700> see<00:02:43.820> myself<00:02:44.000> not<00:02:44.420> liking<00:02:44.810> about

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
thing I can see myself not liking about

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.570 
thing I can see myself not liking about
this<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.800> does<00:02:45.950> seem<00:02:46.160> sort<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> week

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
this is it does seem sort of a week

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.490 
this is it does seem sort of a week
attraction<00:02:47.150> unless<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.690> get<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.020> just

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
attraction unless you get this just

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.810 
attraction unless you get this just
right<00:02:48.620> if<00:02:48.860> it's<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.550> will<00:02:49.640> not

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
right if it's like this it will not

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.210 
right if it's like this it will not
close<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.530> does<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:51.950> be<00:02:52.070> like<00:02:52.190> that

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
close so it does have to be like that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.660 
close so it does have to be like that
you<00:02:52.459> can<00:02:52.610> actually<00:02:52.730> hear<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.180> lock<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:54.670> like

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
you can actually hear it lock to like

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.160 
you can actually hear it lock to like
that<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.180> i'll<00:02:56.390> go<00:02:56.510> ahead<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.660> review<00:02:56.959> that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170
