00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.080 
little shitty cup holder
and<00:02:55.440> then<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.069> glove<00:02:56.280> box<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.760> actually

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and then the glove box is actually

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.089 
and then the glove box is actually
behind<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.780> passenger<00:02:58.500> seat<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
behind the passenger seat so you have to

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.979 
behind the passenger seat so you have to
move<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.310> seat<00:02:59.610> forward<00:02:59.640> I<00:03:00.239> think<00:03:00.870> it's

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
move the seat forward I think it's

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.400 
move the seat forward I think it's
manual<00:03:01.410> yeah<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.610> seat<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:02.849> manual<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.349> you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
manual yeah the seat is manual so you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.780 
manual yeah the seat is manual so you
move<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.739> forward<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.370> then<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.580> have<00:03:05.760> a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
move this forward and then you have a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.949 
move this forward and then you have a
decent<00:03:06.780> sized<00:03:07.230> space<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.180> then<00:03:09.810> these

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
decent sized space there and then these

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.340 
decent sized space there and then these
two<00:03:10.020> things<00:03:10.470> are<00:03:10.770> like<00:03:11.959> silverware<00:03:12.959> drawers

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
two things are like silverware drawers

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.770 
two things are like silverware drawers
or<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:13.830> don't<00:03:14.430> know<00:03:14.580> what<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.330> then<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.569> bose

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
or I don't know what and then the bose

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.410 
or I don't know what and then the bose
subwoofer<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.680> behind<00:03:17.100> here<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:18.180> I've<00:03:18.239> seen

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
subwoofer is behind here so I've seen

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.460 
subwoofer is behind here so I've seen
people<00:03:18.600> put<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:20.220> ampere<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:20.970> then<00:03:21.450> seal<00:03:22.260> this

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
people put the ampere and then seal this

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.589 
people put the ampere and then seal this
up<00:03:22.739> with<00:03:23.190> dynamat<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.970> put<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.239> subwoofer

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
up with dynamat and put a subwoofer

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.559 
up with dynamat and put a subwoofer
there<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.980> don't<00:03:26.760> think<00:03:26.970> I'm<00:03:27.120> really<00:03:27.300> going<00:03:27.510> to

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
there I don't think I'm really going to

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.890 
there I don't think I'm really going to
get<00:03:27.780> into<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.430> right<00:03:29.430> away<00:03:29.850> though<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.450> sub

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
get into that right away though the sub

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.470 
get into that right away though the sub
is<00:03:31.140> not<00:03:31.380> great<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.900> works<00:03:34.170> well<00:03:34.680> enough

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
is not great but it works well enough

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.050 
is not great but it works well enough
and<00:03:36.480> probably<00:03:36.900> extends<00:03:37.500> down<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.890> like<00:03:40.280> 35<00:03:41.280> 40

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
and probably extends down to like 35 40

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.770 
and probably extends down to like 35 40
Hertz<00:03:42.209> which<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:43.440> not<00:03:43.970> super<00:03:44.970> low<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.690> the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
Hertz which is not super low for the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.199 
Hertz which is not super low for the
crap<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.319> listen<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.799> what<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:48.030> good

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
crap that I listen to what it's good

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.240 
crap that I listen to what it's good
enough<00:03:48.420> um<00:03:49.549> a<00:03:51.500> weird<00:03:52.500> thing<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.799> have<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.950> push

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
enough um a weird thing you have to push

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.150 
enough um a weird thing you have to push
the<00:03:53.580> stick<00:03:53.910> shift<00:03:54.180> down<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:55.709> get<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.010> to

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
the stick shift down to get it to

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.360 
the stick shift down to get it to
reverse<00:03:56.459> I<00:03:56.760> know<00:03:57.720> why<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.260> can't<00:03:58.769> see<00:03:58.980> anyone

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
reverse I know why I can't see anyone

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.660 
reverse I know why I can't see anyone
shifting<00:04:00.030> into<00:04:00.239> reverse<00:04:00.299> on<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.959> highway

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
shifting into reverse on the highway

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.710 
shifting into reverse on the highway
especially<00:04:02.670> since<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.120> don't<00:04:03.269> think<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.510> put

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
especially since I don't think I put

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.539 
especially since I don't think I put
synchros<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.829> reverse<00:04:05.790> gears<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.650> I'll<00:04:08.400> be

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
synchros on reverse gears so I'll be

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.420 
synchros on reverse gears so I'll be
pretty<00:04:08.700> hard<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.090> do<00:04:09.329> even<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.920> know<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.220> mean

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
pretty hard to do even you know I mean

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.150 
pretty hard to do even you know I mean
regular<00:04:11.670> like<00:04:12.209> my<00:04:12.560> Maximus<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.680> their<00:04:13.799> courts

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
regular like my Maximus and their courts

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.340 
regular like my Maximus and their courts
didn't<00:04:14.430> do<00:04:14.519> that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
didn't do that

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.390 
didn't do that
so<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:16.700> see<00:04:17.690> that's<00:04:17.900> my<00:04:18.110> spot<00:04:18.410> over<00:04:18.830> there<00:04:18.860> next

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
so I see that's my spot over there next

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.490 
so I see that's my spot over there next
