have a loop at the end of them you
simply<00:04:22.830> take<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.220> tail<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.640> it

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
simply take the tail of it

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.570 
simply take the tail of it
you're<00:04:24.810> gonna<00:04:24.900> twist<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.440> into<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.920> loop<00:04:26.100> like

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
you're gonna twist it into the loop like

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.000 
you're gonna twist it into the loop like
so<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.900> brand's<00:04:28.230> gonna<00:04:28.380> be<00:04:28.500> on<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.680> outside

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
so the brand's gonna be on the outside

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.440 
so the brand's gonna be on the outside
these<00:04:29.250> have<00:04:29.400> padding<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.120> really<00:04:30.300> easy

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
these have padding so it's really easy

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.930 
these have padding so it's really easy
to<00:04:30.570> get<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.560> then<00:04:32.070> how<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:32.880> I'm

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
to get that and then how you and I'm

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.690 
to get that and then how you and I'm
working<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:34.410> tail<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:35.130> always<00:04:35.550> going<00:04:35.640> to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
working is the tail is always going to

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.340 
working is the tail is always going to
be<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.910> one<00:04:36.000> between<00:04:36.210> your<00:04:36.450> thumb<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.720> index

be the one between your thumb and index
finger<00:04:37.440> okay<00:04:38.010> that's<00:04:38.250> how<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.400> know<00:04:38.580> it's

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
finger okay that's how you know it's

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.220 
finger okay that's how you know it's
gonna<00:04:38.910> be<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.120> wrist<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.750> tails<00:04:39.990> gonna<00:04:40.110> be

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
gonna be the wrist the tails gonna be

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.780 
gonna be the wrist the tails gonna be
going<00:04:40.410> between<00:04:40.680> your<00:04:40.830> thumb<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.070> your

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
going between your thumb and your

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.720 
going between your thumb and your
fingers<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.840> that's<00:04:43.200> how<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.800> if<00:04:44.640> you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
fingers and that's how you do it if you

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.460 
fingers and that's how you do it if you
do<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:44.850> backwards<00:04:45.360> it's<00:04:45.510> very<00:04:45.720> easy<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.050> undo

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
do it backwards it's very easy to undo

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.900 
do it backwards it's very easy to undo
like<00:04:46.710> say<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.920> do<00:04:47.160> it<00:04:47.250> for<00:04:47.370> this<00:04:47.460> hand<00:04:47.700> right

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
man oh that's not right it's not going

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.080 
man oh that's not right it's not going
between<00:04:50.220> my<00:04:50.310> thumb<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.520> my<00:04:50.700> fingers<00:04:51.000> it's

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
between my thumb and my fingers it's

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.880 
between my thumb and my fingers it's
going<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.300> opposite<00:04:51.570> way<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:52.380> very<00:04:52.590> easy<00:04:52.740> to

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
going the opposite way it's very easy to

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.530 
going the opposite way it's very easy to
do<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.130> can<00:04:53.190> take<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.910> strap<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.330> literally

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
do you can take the strap and literally

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.590 
do you can take the strap and literally
just<00:04:55.250> spin<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.370> around<00:04:56.460> we<00:04:57.120> loop<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.480> other

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
just spin it around we loop it the other

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.810 
just spin it around we loop it the other
way<00:04:57.780> all<00:04:58.200> straps<00:04:58.770> are<00:04:59.010> interchangeable<00:04:59.640> like

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
way all straps are interchangeable like

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.910 
way all straps are interchangeable like
