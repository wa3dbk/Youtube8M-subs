$100 they're small as you see right here
my<00:00:59.629> only<00:01:00.629> problem<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:01.230> them<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.620> they

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
my only problem with them is that they

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.390 
my only problem with them is that they
do<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:03.059> TTL<00:01:03.870> metering<00:01:04.080> built<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.369> I

do not have TTL metering built in but I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
do not have TTL metering built in but I
mean<00:01:05.580> beggars<00:01:06.420> can't<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.689> choosers<00:01:06.990> when

manual<00:02:25.740> mode<00:02:25.770> these<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.820> might<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.120> TTL<00:02:27.600> so

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
manual mode these you might have TTL so

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.750 
manual mode these you might have TTL so
it<00:02:28.410> needs<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.800> be<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:28.950> manual<00:02:29.280> mode<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.490> order

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it needs to be in manual mode and order

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.660 
it needs to be in manual mode and order
fire<00:02:30.440> now<00:02:31.440> I'm<00:02:31.530> going<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.740> put<00:02:31.920> the

the Tamron 17 252 8 right they have on

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.710 
the Tamron 17 252 8 right they have on
here<00:02:43.350> it's<00:02:44.100> an<00:02:44.220> awesome<00:02:44.580> awesome<00:02:45.030> lens

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
here it's an awesome awesome lens

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.080 
here it's an awesome awesome lens
actually<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.410> let's<00:02:47.280> prove<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.910> guys

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
actually and let's prove to you guys

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.720 
actually and let's prove to you guys
once<00:02:48.360> again<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.110> works<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:52.550> one<00:02:53.550> more

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
once again that it works so and one more

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.260 
once again that it works so and one more
time

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.270 

yeah<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.540> guys<00:02:57.660> were<00:02:57.810> able<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.080> see<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.380> not

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
yeah you guys were able to see that not

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.550 
yeah you guys were able to see that not
a<00:02:59.310> problem<00:02:59.870> now<00:03:00.870> here's<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.200> other<00:03:01.260> cool

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
a problem now here's the other cool

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.270 
a problem now here's the other cool
thing<00:03:01.740> about<00:03:01.770> these<00:03:02.250> triggers<00:03:04.040> let's<00:03:05.040> say

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
thing about these triggers let's say

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.370 
thing about these triggers let's say
you're<00:03:05.700> into<00:03:07.310> shooting<00:03:08.480> with<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.600> remotes<00:03:10.020> of

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
you're into shooting with the remotes of

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.580 
you're into shooting with the remotes of
some<00:03:10.590> sort<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.660> will<00:03:12.810> come<00:03:12.960> off<00:03:13.020> just

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
some sort so this will come off just

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.920 
some sort so this will come off just
like<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.250> then<00:03:15.240> I'm<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> turn<00:03:15.810> it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
like that and then I'm going to turn it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.860 
like that and then I'm going to turn it
off<00:03:16.080> by<00:03:16.440> holding<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.860> button<00:03:16.890> down<00:03:17.130> there<00:03:17.870> now

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
off by holding the button down there now

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.920 
off by holding the button down there now
the<00:03:19.800> receiver<00:03:20.130> has<00:03:20.610> two<00:03:21.060> different<00:03:21.240> pins<00:03:21.720> at

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
the receiver has two different pins at

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.380 
the receiver has two different pins at
the<00:03:22.020> side<00:03:22.230> there's<00:03:23.010> one<00:03:23.310> ports<00:03:23.850> rather<00:03:24.120> and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
the side there's one ports rather and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.880 
the side there's one ports rather and
there's<00:03:25.140> two<00:03:25.320> right<00:03:25.500> there

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
there's two right there

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.140 
there's two right there
so<00:03:26.700> since<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.090> using<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.810> D<00:03:28.200> 5100<00:03:29.160> I'm<00:03:29.970> going

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
so since I'm using the D 5100 I'm going

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.120 
so since I'm using the D 5100 I'm going
to<00:03:30.210> take<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:30.480> cable<00:03:30.690> right<00:03:30.870> here<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.620> these

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
to take this cable right here and these

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.750 
to take this cable right here and these
cables<00:03:32.520> come<00:03:32.730> with<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.240> package<00:03:33.960> actually

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
cables come with the package actually

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.000 
cables come with the package actually
package<00:03:35.760> looks<00:03:36.240> like<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:37.730> right<00:03:38.730> here<00:03:39.000> and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
package looks like this right here and

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.140 
package looks like this right here and
then<00:03:41.010> there's<00:03:41.130> another<00:03:41.310> table<00:03:41.790> right<00:03:41.940> here

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
then there's another table right here

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.660 
then there's another table right here
too<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.930> different<00:03:43.320> types<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.650> flashes<00:03:44.100> I'll

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
too for different types of flashes I'll

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.150 
too for different types of flashes I'll
show<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.120> later<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.720> bit<00:03:46.070> but<00:03:47.070> either

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
show you that later in a bit but either

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.750 
show you that later in a bit but either
way<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:48.120> which<00:03:48.960> is<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.230> receiver<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.830> now

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
way this which is the receiver is now

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.900 
way this which is the receiver is now
going<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:50.970> going<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.480> go<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.930> my<00:03:52.070> hot<00:03:53.070> shoe<00:03:53.280> like

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
going to going to go in my hot shoe like

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.880 
going to going to go in my hot shoe like
so<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.810> doesn't<00:03:55.080> really<00:03:55.170> need<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.560> go<00:03:55.650> into<00:03:55.800> the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
so it doesn't really need to go into the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.600 
so it doesn't really need to go into the
hot<00:03:56.010> shoe<00:03:56.220> at<00:03:56.400> all<00:03:56.820> because<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.780> mean<00:03:58.170> this<00:03:58.610> it's

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
hot shoe at all because I mean this it's

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.520 
hot shoe at all because I mean this it's
dead<00:03:59.880> weight<00:03:59.910> right<00:04:00.360> there<00:04:00.390> that's<00:04:00.840> there's

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
dead weight right there that's there's

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.330 
dead weight right there that's there's
no<00:04:01.770> pins<00:04:02.250> at<00:04:02.490> all<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:03.360> interact<00:04:04.170> with<00:04:04.340> the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
no pins at all to interact with the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.390 
no pins at all to interact with the
Nikon<00:04:05.700> camera<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:06.150> all<00:04:06.240> but<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:07.410> then<00:04:08.010> plugs

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
Nikon camera at all but this then plugs

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.260 
Nikon camera at all but this then plugs
into<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.760> side<00:04:09.000> here<00:04:10.550> and<00:04:11.550> let's<00:04:11.910> plug<00:04:12.240> that

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
into the side here and let's plug that

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:19.490 
into the side here and let's plug that
in<00:04:12.600> just<00:04:13.200> like<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:14.720> cameras<00:04:15.720> on<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:18.500> triggers

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
in just like so cameras on and triggers

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.730 
in just like so cameras on and triggers
on<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.850> now<00:04:21.690> we're<00:04:22.020> going<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.200> turn<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.530> on

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
on and now we're going to turn this on

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.800 
on and now we're going to turn this on
and<00:04:24.080> we're<00:04:25.080> going<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.260> show<00:04:25.680> you

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
and we're going to show you

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:35.170 
and we're going to show you
how<00:04:27.810> this<00:04:27.960> works<00:04:29.539> right<00:04:30.539> here<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.550> come<00:04:33.330> on

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
how this works right here so come on

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.830 
how this works right here so come on
okay<00:04:36.180> now<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.139> and<00:04:37.879> now<00:04:39.139> focusing<00:04:41.750> it's<00:04:42.750> a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
okay now it's on and now focusing it's a

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.110 
okay now it's on and now focusing it's a
wireless<00:04:43.199> remote<00:04:43.490> works<00:04:44.490> really<00:04:44.789> really<00:04:44.909> well

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
wireless remote works really really well

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.700 
wireless remote works really really well
and<00:04:46.909> that's<00:04:47.909> really<00:04:48.270> about<00:04:48.449> it<00:04:48.629> for<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.199> Velo

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
and that's really about it for the Velo

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.540 
and that's really about it for the Velo
triggers<00:04:50.330> they<00:04:51.330> work<00:04:51.599> well<00:04:51.919> they're<00:04:52.919> built<00:04:53.250> oh

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
triggers they work well they're built oh

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.899 
triggers they work well they're built oh
as<00:04:53.969> it<00:04:54.270> still<00:04:54.599> goes<00:04:54.780> off<00:04:55.669> they're<00:04:56.669> built

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
as it still goes off they're built

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:02.439 
as it still goes off they're built
relatively<00:04:57.509> well<00:04:57.689> I<00:04:57.900> mean<00:04:58.879> this<00:04:59.879> is<00:04:59.939> one<00:05:00.389> of

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
relatively well I mean this is one of

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.010 
relatively well I mean this is one of
transmitter<00:05:03.449> it's<00:05:04.289> really<00:05:04.560> really<00:05:04.770> small

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
transmitter it's really really small

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.689 
transmitter it's really really small
versus<00:05:07.020> something<00:05:07.229> like<00:05:07.409> the<00:05:07.830> foatx<00:05:08.219> wireless

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
versus something like the foatx wireless

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.909 
versus something like the foatx wireless
triggers<00:05:09.029> I<00:05:09.150> mean<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:10.259> phottix<00:05:10.620> wireless

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
triggers I mean the phottix wireless

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.350 
triggers I mean the phottix wireless
triggers<00:05:11.219> are<00:05:11.370> beyond<00:05:11.639> this<00:05:11.789> and<00:05:11.969> the<00:05:12.060> company

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
triggers are beyond this and the company

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.019 
triggers are beyond this and the company
even<00:05:12.659> admits<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:13.159> the<00:05:14.159> phottix<00:05:14.669> wireless

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:15.029 
even admits that the phottix wireless

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.899 
even admits that the phottix wireless
triggers<00:05:15.389> should<00:05:16.110> be<00:05:16.199> honest<00:05:16.469> with<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:16.909> are

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
triggers should be honest with you are

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.570 
triggers should be honest with you are
really<00:05:18.240> really<00:05:18.449> good<00:05:18.779> and<00:05:19.129> these<00:05:20.129> are<00:05:20.340> really

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
really really good and these are really

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.879 
really really good and these are really
really<00:05:20.669> good<00:05:20.939> for<00:05:21.090> what<00:05:21.270> they<00:05:21.389> do<00:05:21.889> the

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
really good for what they do the

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.950 
really good for what they do the
versatility<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:24.259> the<00:05:26.090> build<00:05:27.090> quality<00:05:27.419> the

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
versatility and the build quality the

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.680 
versatility and the build quality the
cost<00:05:28.550> everything<00:05:29.550> really<00:05:29.759> really<00:05:29.939> suits<00:05:30.539> very

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
cost everything really really suits very

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.619 
cost everything really really suits very
well<00:05:31.020> for<00:05:31.589> its<00:05:32.000> target<00:05:33.000> market<00:05:33.389> the<00:05:33.419> people

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
well for its target market the people

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.409 
well for its target market the people
that<00:05:34.050> are<00:05:34.139> looking<00:05:34.289> for<00:05:34.770> affordable<00:05:35.759> wireless

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
that are looking for affordable wireless

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.550 
that are looking for affordable wireless
triggers<00:05:36.810> don't<00:05:37.469> necessarily<00:05:38.250> want<00:05:39.259> TTL<00:05:40.259> or

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
triggers don't necessarily want TTL or

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.100 
triggers don't necessarily want TTL or
maybe<00:05:40.979> are<00:05:41.370> learning<00:05:41.849> so<00:05:42.120> they'll<00:05:42.419> use<00:05:42.839> manual

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
maybe are learning so they'll use manual

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.610 
maybe are learning so they'll use manual
flash<00:05:43.560> instead<00:05:44.089> but<00:05:45.089> another<00:05:45.509> way<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:46.050> mean<00:05:46.349> you

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
flash instead but another way I mean you

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.890 
flash instead but another way I mean you
get<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.580> whole<00:05:47.849> bunch<00:05:48.029> with<00:05:48.270> them<00:05:48.389> too<00:05:48.539> you<00:05:48.719> get

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
get a whole bunch with them too you get

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.649 
get a whole bunch with them too you get
different<00:05:49.319> cables<00:05:49.889> these<00:05:50.219> ones<00:05:50.520> are<00:05:50.699> for<00:05:50.909> the

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
different cables these ones are for the

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.129 
different cables these ones are for the
higher-end<00:05:52.339> DSLRs<00:05:53.339> and<00:05:53.490> then<00:05:54.419> this<00:05:54.810> one<00:05:55.110> right

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
higher-end DSLRs and then this one right

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:02.749 
higher-end DSLRs and then this one right
in<00:05:55.500> here<00:05:56.419> has<00:05:58.339> two<00:05:59.339> mail<00:05:59.969> app<00:06:00.330> inputs<00:06:01.050> and<00:06:01.759> then

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
in here has two mail app inputs and then

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.990 
in here has two mail app inputs and then
you<00:06:03.060> get<00:06:04.460> another<00:06:05.460> one<00:06:07.039> for<00:06:08.039> other<00:06:08.370> flashes

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
you get another one for other flashes

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.350 
you get another one for other flashes
some<00:06:09.960> of<00:06:10.080> them<00:06:10.169> have<00:06:10.289> a<00:06:10.319> port<00:06:10.680> just<00:06:10.919> like<00:06:11.069> that

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
some of them have a port just like that

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.779 
some of them have a port just like that
that<00:06:12.360> you<00:06:12.539> can<00:06:12.629> plug<00:06:12.839> it<00:06:12.930> into<00:06:13.460> so<00:06:14.460> that's<00:06:14.669> it

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
that you can plug it into so that's it

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.890 
that you can plug it into so that's it
it<00:06:14.849> does<00:06:15.060> these<00:06:15.539> are<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:17.089> Velo<00:06:18.089> freeway

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
it does these are the Velo freeway

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.459 
it does these are the Velo freeway
fusion<00:06:19.469> wireless<00:06:20.250> triggers<00:06:21.139> you<00:06:22.139> can<00:06:22.349> get

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
fusion wireless triggers you can get

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.879 
fusion wireless triggers you can get
them<00:06:22.680> at<00:06:22.860> bnh<00:06:23.339> photo<00:06:23.669> and<00:06:24.529> that's<00:06:25.529> really
