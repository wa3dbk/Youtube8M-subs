the sony vaio t 13 the battery is this
one<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.950> screwed<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.309> place<00:00:11.580> by<00:00:11.969> these

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
one and it's screwed in place by these

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.450 
one and it's screwed in place by these
two<00:00:12.740> three<00:00:13.740> screws

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
two three screws

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.790 
two three screws
now<00:00:14.820> I've<00:00:15.120> already<00:00:15.360> unscrew<00:00:16.109> those<00:00:16.260> because

now I've already unscrew those because

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.859 
now I've already unscrew those because
it's<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.490> take<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> little<00:00:18.240> bit<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.600> time

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it's going to take a little bit of time

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.439 
it's going to take a little bit of time
and<00:00:19.130> once<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.279> unscrew<00:00:20.430> them<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.240> quite

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and once you unscrew them it's quite

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
and once you unscrew them it's quite
easy<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.990> remove<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> battery<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.980> just

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
easy to remove the battery it's just

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.089 
easy to remove the battery it's just
like<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.439> here<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
battery is the 45 watt hour cell so

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
battery is the 45 watt hour cell so
quite<00:00:31.940> quite<00:00:32.940> good<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.690> an<00:00:33.930> ultrabook

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
quite quite good for an ultrabook

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.740 
quite quite good for an ultrabook
and<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.090> want<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> access<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and then if you want to access the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.900 
and then if you want to access the
memory<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.739> hard<00:00:38.010> drive<00:00:38.219> you're<00:00:38.879> going

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
memory and the hard drive you're going

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.060 
memory and the hard drive you're going
to<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.540> remove<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.079> Bay<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.920> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to have to remove this Bay and for that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.500 
to have to remove this Bay and for that
you're<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:42.239> tiny

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you're going to need a very tiny

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.720 
you're going to need a very tiny
screwdriver<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.770> there<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.430> three

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
screwdriver and there are just three

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.290 
screwdriver and there are just three
screws<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:46.969> unscrew<00:00:47.969> here

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:59.650 

should<00:00:51.300> only<00:00:51.480> take<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.809> couple<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.289> seconds<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.520 

once<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.219> this<00:01:02.219> panel<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.879> just

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
once you do that this panel will just

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.920 
once you do that this panel will just
get<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.090> very<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:06.630> easy

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
get out like this so it's very very easy

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.030 
get out like this so it's very very easy
to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.210> over<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
to do this and over here you have the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.920 
to do this and over here you have the
memory<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> Dames

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
memory you can see that one of the Dames

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.280 
memory you can see that one of the Dames
is<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:14.119> occupied<00:01:15.119> well<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
is actually occupied well one of the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.649 
is actually occupied well one of the
dims<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.820> available<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.210> believe<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
dims is available so I believe one of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.649 
dims is available so I believe one of
the<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> modules<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.640> soldered<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the one of the modules is soldered on

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
the one of the modules is soldered on
your<00:01:21.840> motherboard<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.890> also<00:01:23.009> have

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
your motherboard and you also have

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
your motherboard and you also have
another<00:01:23.610> module<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.900> add<00:01:25.020> some

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
another module here so you can add some

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.039 
another module here so you can add some
extra<00:01:25.500> memory<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.250> upgrade<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> also

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
extra memory and upgrade it and also

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.649 
extra memory and upgrade it and also
this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.070> hard<00:01:29.369> drive<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:30.210> order<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
this is the hard drive in order to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.210 
this is the hard drive in order to
remove<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> remove<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
remove this one you have to remove a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.010 
remove this one you have to remove a
couple<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.670> extra<00:01:32.880> screws<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.750> one
