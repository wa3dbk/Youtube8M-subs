00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
what happened starting I guess with the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.420 
what happened starting I guess with the
puck<00:00:35.430> slip<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> plat<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.430> thought

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
puck slip on the plat first I thought

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.819 
puck slip on the plat first I thought
the<00:00:38.550> first<00:00:38.730> time<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> felt<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> game<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the first time I felt in the game or a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.630 
the first time I felt in the game or a
warm-up<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.649> you<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> fell<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.309> ladee

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
warm-up and you know I fell into ladee

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.330 
warm-up and you know I fell into ladee
and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.620> Potsie<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.829> tried<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and then Potsie just tried to get out of

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.729 
and then Potsie just tried to get out of
the<00:00:47.399> way<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.469> kicked<00:00:49.469> me<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the way and kind of kicked me in the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.880 
the way and kind of kicked me in the
face<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:51.329> remember<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> didn't<00:00:52.770> feel

face there so I remember I didn't feel
too<00:00:52.949> much<00:00:53.100> pain<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> thought<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> was<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
too much pain I thought it was just a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.950 
too much pain I thought it was just a
