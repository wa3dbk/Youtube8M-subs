 watch and download any type of anime 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.930
 from your android device without 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.630
 import the android version that 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.250
 own so surely for sure if 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.310

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.020
 the web called anime flv then in this one 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.970
 this video so I put them to share the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.030
 official client of said web as already 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.390
 we see here the point apk has a size 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.700
 1.3 megabyte only required 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.400
 an android version of practically 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.170
 2.1 onwards because then to 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.300
 then let's see the interface of 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.460
 the application and it's very simple and it's for 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.230
 that that has to be compatible with your 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.170
 device regardless of the version of 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.019
 android and then if it's high- end or 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.700
 low end because as we see here 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.930
 application as you see the interface is very 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 simple but if it is very 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.250
 very necessary I would say the adjustments and the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.789
