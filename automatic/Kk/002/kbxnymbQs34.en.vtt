00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.630
 hello welcome to all of you on 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.640
 that you saw yourself today a new 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.099
 video presentation that focuses on a 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.179
 very small housing since it houses in 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.669
 this little box 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.570
 this little case method that's it's this 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.829
 that at 110 weesa a box-type 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.649
 mini-itx that we can hang 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.690
 behind the screen it comes from 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.129
 antec and we offer you now 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.269
 a complete video presentation 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.030
 let's find out together what is what 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.420
 110 weesa first of all we have a 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.710
 small explanatory note on the case 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.780
 we then find the external power supply 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.280
 it is 90 watts type which is 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.940
 rather well we can put a big 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.770
 processor on the mini-itx motherboard 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.750
 we then find the necessary to 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.610
 to connect the motherboard to the pcb 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.270
 which is powered by food 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.880
 external with for example also two 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.670
 taken sata a jack catherine cpu and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.320
 a molex plug 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.640
 we continue with the cord 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:33.280
 power industry 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.120
 the device precisely a visa on 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.180
 slide the box here and it's fixed to 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.400
 the screen so we have a screen equipped with a 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.370
 computer but we also find a 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.290
 little vertical foot see that's it 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:55.810
 simple we take the case we slip to 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.580
 level of foot play like those on 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.810
 put a small screw underneath and we have 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.720
 so a complete mini pc to be used 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.420
 and that will be put next to your screen 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.380
 go on we are attacking now see 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.500
 remove the foot there is the little hole for 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.360
 the fixation here we attack 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.870
 now precisely to what is this 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.570
 than 110 to this little mini-type box 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.050
 eatx on the top we have a big mass 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.970
 which will clear the air pro 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.940
 with hot air coming from the motherboard 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.980
 cpu ventirad to escape easily 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.810
 the CPU cooler for one also 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.440
 eat enough fresh air 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.959
 easily 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.730
 we then find the logo antec power 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.420
 ' activity dates entries 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.209
 4-port USB 2.0 audio outputs 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.570
 below we have the device to fix 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.180
 the foot is on the other side a grid 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.239
 plastic ventilation 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.730
 in the back we have the location for the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.660
 backplate from your motherboard as well as 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.110
 death one for the external power supply 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.610
 under the casing 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.880
 nothing very specific 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.750
 we see we have a coating that mimics 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.090
 touch the mesh and some streaks 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.590
 always to allow the air to 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.870
 pass in a pretty shop 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.090
 easily immediately we open it there 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.560
 is that to 110 in order to discover it a 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.960
 little more detail inside 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.760
 the opening is pretty simple we remove 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.140
 screw in the back and we catch the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.520
 panel one will just raised to 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.080
 inside the case you go on the 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.230
 see there is not fifteen minutes thing 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.709
 since we are on a base of housings 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.650
 Mini-ITX 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.760
 in the background we have a platinum that 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.570
 will insert hard drives 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.630
 two storage units maximum then 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.300
 we have all the cables storage units 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.480
 in 2.5 inches of course then we have them 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.840
 cords for usb for the power on 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.440
 their there are the diode of activity as well 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.989
 only for the audio output inputs at this 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.370
 level that we will integrate the 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.590
 motherboard simply can therefore 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.110
 install our hard drive a map 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.669
 mother and we see it here a little bit more 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.650
 back we have the device 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.900
 feeding that comes in addition 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.460
 of the external brick 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.380
 this is where the drass connected by 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.360
 example the connector that will allow 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.540
 distribute all the current to the map 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.130
 mother and the various components 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.050
 you see we did very quickly the 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.870
 turn of this small housing case that is 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.330
 actually a case of antec type with 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.000
 an excellent plastic whatever 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.100
 the place where we look at the case the 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.620
 finish is very good and the price is there 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.070
 we will say acceptable for a case of 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.229
 this size 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.390
 we are at 85 euros with a diet 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.010
 90 watts 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.290
 it may seem expensive but for a 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.510
 external power supply of 90 watts and a 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.310
 excellent price you can at worst you 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.169
 fall back on the non weesa version that 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.150
 is a little cheaper on that one 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.620
 you see very soon on call tv for 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.360
 new presentation videos and 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.419
 of course on cowcotland.com for 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.080
 discover the complete test of this x 410 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.080
