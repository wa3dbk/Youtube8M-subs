00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
right guys we're going to use a JV weld

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.399 
right guys we're going to use a JV weld
which<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.119> very<00:01:40.450> common<00:01:40.780> for<00:01:40.810> small<00:01:41.200> leaks

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
which is very common for small leaks

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.319 
which is very common for small leaks
like<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:41.770> basically<00:01:42.490> it's<00:01:42.579> a<00:01:42.640> steel<00:01:43.000> and

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
like this basically it's a steel and

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.090 
like this basically it's a steel and
then<00:01:43.630> there's<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.840> hardener<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:44.710> just<00:01:44.920> liquid

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
then there's a hardener so just liquid

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.130 
then there's a hardener so just liquid
steel<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.759> basically<00:01:46.540> what<00:01:46.689> you<00:01:46.750> want<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:46.960> do

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
steel and basically what you want to do

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.980 
steel and basically what you want to do
is<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> use<00:01:48.130> even<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.700> amount<00:01:48.969> of<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.719> steel

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
is a use even the amount of the steel

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.109 
is a use even the amount of the steel
and<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.229> hardener<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:51.130> what<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.820> got<00:01:51.969> it

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
and the hardener and what you got it

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.910 
and the hardener and what you got it
there<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.299> want<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.659> mix<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:53.079> I<00:01:53.229> mean<00:01:53.590> for<00:01:53.890> now

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
there you want to mix it I mean for now

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.399 
there you want to mix it I mean for now
I<00:01:54.039> got<00:01:54.219> I<00:01:54.280> just<00:01:54.579> got<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.729> screw<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.270> just<00:01:56.110> mix<00:01:56.289> it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
I got I just got a screw and just mix it

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.630 
I got I just got a screw and just mix it
up<00:01:56.469> with<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.100> want<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.340> apply<00:01:57.430> to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
up with that and you want to apply to

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.999 
up with that and you want to apply to
wherever<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.390> leaks<00:01:58.600> are<00:01:58.810> like<00:01:59.229> wherever<00:01:59.799> the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
wherever the leaks are like wherever the

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.940 
wherever the leaks are like wherever the
leaks<00:02:00.189> are<00:02:00.280> at<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:02.380> takes<00:02:02.560> about<00:02:02.649> four

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
leaks are at and it takes about four

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.399 
leaks are at and it takes about four
minutes<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.460> harden<00:02:03.850> up<00:02:04.149> so<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.780> mean<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.350> know

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
minutes to harden up so I mean you know

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.620 
minutes to harden up so I mean you know
got<00:02:05.649> too<00:02:05.799> much<00:02:05.920> time<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.250> work<00:02:06.369> with<00:02:06.430> but<00:02:07.390> just

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
got too much time to work with but just

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:31.600 
got too much time to work with but just
enough

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.300 

we<00:02:32.610> want<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.880> evenly<00:02:33.360> mix<00:02:33.920> as<00:02:34.920> much<00:02:35.160> as

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
we want it to evenly mix as much as

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.310 
we want it to evenly mix as much as
possible<00:02:35.780> basically<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.840> want<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:36.990> get<00:02:37.170> it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
possible basically you want to get it

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.040 
possible basically you want to get it
find<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> leaks<00:02:38.490> for<00:02:38.970> example<00:02:39.420> right<00:02:39.600> here<00:02:39.900> is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
find the leaks for example right here is

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.700 
find the leaks for example right here is
one<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.740> our<00:02:40.860> major<00:02:41.100> leaks<00:02:41.460> we<00:02:41.640> had<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.170> just

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
one of our major leaks we had and just

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:51.170 
one of our major leaks we had and just
coat<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:49.730> mean<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.910> going<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.090> obviously

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
coat it I mean it's going to obviously

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.260 
coat it I mean it's going to obviously
look<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.690> little<00:02:51.810> weird<00:02:52.020> but<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.380> do<00:02:52.980> plan<00:02:53.190> on

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
look a little weird but we do plan on

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.610 
look a little weird but we do plan on
spray-painting<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.390> boat<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.560> is

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
spray-painting this boat so and this is

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.050 
spray-painting this boat so and this is
obviously<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.250> bottom<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.640> boat<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.940> it's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
obviously the bottom of the boat so it's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.300 
obviously the bottom of the boat so it's
not<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.270> it's<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> big<00:02:57.600> deal<00:02:58.010> all<00:02:59.010> right<00:02:59.070> guys

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
not like it's a big deal all right guys

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.760 
not like it's a big deal all right guys
so<00:02:59.520> this<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.730> what<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.090> got<00:03:00.240> as<00:03:00.510> our<00:03:00.780> pretty

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
so this is what we got as our pretty

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.520 
so this is what we got as our pretty
much<00:03:01.890> our<00:03:02.040> finished<00:03:02.400> product<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.940> know<00:03:03.530> we're

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
but this is all where we JB welded you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.750 
but this is all where we JB welded you
know<00:03:09.270> like<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.380> said<00:03:10.440> when<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.250> flip<00:03:11.460> over<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
know like I said when you flip over the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.760 
know like I said when you flip over the
bow<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:11.940> see<00:03:12.420> where<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.630> main<00:03:12.840> holes<00:03:13.080> are<00:03:13.260> but

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
bow you see where the main holes are but

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.050 
bow you see where the main holes are but
if<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.130> any<00:03:14.280> little<00:03:14.520> specks<00:03:14.790> where<00:03:14.970> you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
think it might be be becoming a hole or

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.780 
think it might be be becoming a hole or
you<00:03:18.330> know<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.720> it's<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.080> real<00:03:19.530> really<00:03:20.370> really

slow leak just uh throw some of that jb

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.000 
slow leak just uh throw some of that jb
weld<00:03:23.340> right<00:03:23.610> over<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.500> here<00:03:25.500> are<00:03:25.590> some<00:03:25.770> of<00:03:25.890> the

weld right over it here are some of the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.990 
weld right over it here are some of the
main<00:03:26.280> leaks<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:26.880> had<00:03:27.060> up<00:03:27.239> here<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:29.700> then

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
main leaks that we had up here and then

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.750 
main leaks that we had up here and then
there's<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:31.709> or<00:03:31.830> two<00:03:31.980> more<00:03:32.190> up<00:03:32.340> here<00:03:32.580> that

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
there's one one or two more up here that

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.140 
there's one one or two more up here that
we<00:03:32.880> make<00:03:33.090> sure<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.420> got<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:35.070> we're<00:03:35.940> going<00:03:36.090> to

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
we make sure we got and we're going to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.760 
we make sure we got and we're going to
let<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.450> dry<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.170> then<00:03:37.530> we're<00:03:37.650> gonna

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
let this dry and then we're gonna

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.000 
let this dry and then we're gonna
actually<00:03:38.580> use<00:03:38.820> some<00:03:39.180> flex<00:03:39.570> seal<00:03:39.840> over<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.739> and

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
actually use some flex seal over it and

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.100 
actually use some flex seal over it and
then<00:03:41.550> where<00:03:41.940> we<00:03:42.090> might<00:03:42.300> notice<00:03:42.750> some<00:03:43.020> other

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
then where we might notice some other

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.380 
then where we might notice some other
holes<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.680> then<00:03:44.070> we're<00:03:44.940> going<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> fill<00:03:45.270> the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
holes and then we're going to fill the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.910 
holes and then we're going to fill the
boat<00:03:45.540> back<00:03:45.690> up<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.200> little<00:03:46.440> while<00:03:46.590> when<00:03:46.769> it's

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
boat back up in a little while when it's

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.590 
boat back up in a little while when it's
all<00:03:47.100> said<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.580> done<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.030> make<00:03:48.209> sure<00:03:48.360> all<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
all said and done and make sure all the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.050 
all said and done and make sure all the
leaks<00:03:48.780> are<00:03:48.900> fixed<00:03:49.310> all<00:03:50.310> right<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.030> a

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
leaks are fixed all right this is a

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.810 
leaks are fixed all right this is a
rubber<00:03:51.570> flex<00:03:51.900> seal<00:03:52.080> pretty<00:03:52.350> much<00:03:52.530> um<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:53.580> think

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
rubber flex seal pretty much um I think

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.580 
rubber flex seal pretty much um I think
it's<00:03:54.060> clear<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.630> then<00:03:54.780> there's<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.170> it's<00:03:55.500> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
it's clear and then there's a it's a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.380 
it's clear and then there's a it's a
clear<00:03:55.830> one<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.160> get<00:03:56.340> black<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.850> get<00:03:57.060> clear<00:03:57.360> I
