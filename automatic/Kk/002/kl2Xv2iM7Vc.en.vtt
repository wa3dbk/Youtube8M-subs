 Input looks for the Samsung keyboard 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.519

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.610
 to the point keyboard vision comes 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:14.170

 they only have a few apps left 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.670
 disposal that you can then use 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.989
 should the device hang up and 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.720
 You can not do the menu anymore 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.400
 it was possible to use it with predecessors 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.290
 to take out such a hard reset 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.549
 do not trigger that with the new ones 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.829
 possible, the battery is fixed 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.630
 built like a hat he has anyway 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.100
 Perform now I show to them 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.989
 Just keep the volumes quiet 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.000
 key pressed and at the same time the 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.010
 On switch you just have to 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.010
 wait until the device turns off and 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:19.120
 automatically reboots and already 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.769
 is the hartwig carried out the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.139
 difference between the s6 and the s6 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.450
 Of course, the display curve is the one 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.460
 here on both sides looks what the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.940
 brings additional functionality 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.979
 such as the vip indicator so called samsung 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.720
 fast access to important contacts 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.000
 they're over that little gray one 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.919
 Bring the bar on the edge of the display 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.470
 you can just pull the edge up 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.120
 to the display center and you will see 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.680
 that you have five important contacts 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.960
 You can add these too 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.800
 call immediately or with a sms 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.389
 notify 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.090
 I've already added three here 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.440

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.400

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.930
 on the plus symbol and out of theirs 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.960
 you can then contact the 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.120
 Select appropriate 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.310

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.009
 They are also fast in color 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.720
 sorted that is helpful if that 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.669
 device is switched off and with the 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.199
 display on the table is about because 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.729
 then the smartphone runs in the 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.740
 appropriate color on so you know 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:21.479
 Immediately without looking who's calling me 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.340
 who writes me a sms do you want the 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.620
 focus on a specific motive 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.180
 the tracking autofocus helps the 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.419
 Activate in the settings of the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.270

 want to keep focus 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.889
 and the camera follows the motive of 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.780
 alone 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.060
 this saves you time and, above all, saves you time 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.470
 during the sightseeing tour with crowds 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.220
 in the fore and aft is that 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.220
