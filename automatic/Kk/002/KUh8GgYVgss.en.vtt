like it and it's it's a fabulous little
airplane<00:00:57.290> but<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.710> nice<00:00:57.920> thing<00:00:57.949> about<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.549> is

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
airplane but the nice thing about it is

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.509 
airplane but the nice thing about it is
I<00:00:58.940> can<00:00:59.150> operate<00:00:59.540> it<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.869> about<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.010> same<00:01:01.190> cost

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
I can operate it and about the same cost

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.869 
I can operate it and about the same cost
as<00:01:01.699> it<00:01:02.239> cost<00:01:02.659> me<00:01:02.869> to<00:01:02.900> operate<00:01:03.470> a<00:01:03.500> 172<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:04.699> the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
as it cost me to operate a 172 so the

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.410 
as it cost me to operate a 172 so the
whole<00:01:05.059> idea<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.630> is<00:01:06.260> that<00:01:06.530> for<00:01:07.189> not<00:01:07.850> too<00:01:08.270> much

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
whole idea is is that for not too much

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.649 
whole idea is is that for not too much
money<00:01:08.750> I<00:01:08.869> can<00:01:09.079> have<00:01:09.680> people<00:01:10.369> though<00:01:10.969> their

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
care about the twin time because that's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.160 
care about the twin time because that's
where<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.039> do<00:01:22.219> all<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.359> emergency
