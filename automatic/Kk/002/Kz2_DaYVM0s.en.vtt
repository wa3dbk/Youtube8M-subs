rail and in the past where they've

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.179 
rail and in the past where they've
jumped<00:01:17.119> over<00:01:17.540> them<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:18.229> cue<00:01:18.439> ball<00:01:18.619> jumps<00:01:19.040> off

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
jumped over them the cue ball jumps off

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.530 
jumped over them the cue ball jumps off
the<00:01:19.340> table<00:01:19.790> because<00:01:20.060> they<00:01:20.210> have<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.420> go

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
the table because they have to go

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.859 
the table because they have to go
support<00:01:21.079> but<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:21.950> easy<00:01:22.130> jumper<00:01:22.790> we're<00:01:23.750> able

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
support but the easy jumper we're able

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.740 
support but the easy jumper we're able
to<00:01:24.110> get<00:01:24.259> up<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.770> down<00:01:24.920> quickly<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.509> then

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
to get up and down quickly and then

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.450 
to get up and down quickly and then
eliminates<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.350> possibility<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:28.100> jumping

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
eliminates the possibility of jumping

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.760 
eliminates the possibility of jumping
off<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.759> table<00:01:29.210> here<00:01:29.750> I'm<00:01:29.899> hooked<00:01:30.140> on<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.469> 12

off the table here I'm hooked on the 12

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.340 
off the table here I'm hooked on the 12
the<00:01:31.700> 8<00:01:31.820> won't<00:01:32.119> go<00:01:32.329> on<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.539> side<00:01:32.780> I'm<00:01:33.140> going<00:01:33.289> to

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
the 8 won't go on the side I'm going to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.520 
the 8 won't go on the side I'm going to
bank<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:33.890> right<00:01:34.130> here<00:01:34.689> but<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.840> easy<00:01:35.960> jumper

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
bank it right here but the easy jumper

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.289 
bank it right here but the easy jumper
this<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:36.829> easy<00:01:37.039> because<00:01:37.399> we<00:01:37.700> can<00:01:37.850> get<00:01:37.969> over<00:01:38.210> the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
this is easy because we can get over the

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.359 
this is easy because we can get over the
ball<00:01:38.509> put<00:01:39.259> that<00:01:39.439> half<00:01:39.680> of<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.920> cue<00:01:40.159> ball<00:01:40.340> off

ball put that half of the cue ball off
the<00:01:40.700> table<00:01:41.149> it's<00:01:41.719> all<00:01:41.869> easy<00:01:42.140> with<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.710> easy

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
the table it's all easy with the easy

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.160 
the table it's all easy with the easy
jumper<00:01:43.460> many<00:01:44.210> times<00:01:44.539> we<00:01:44.750> have<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.899> situation

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
jumper many times we have a situation

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.090 
jumper many times we have a situation
where<00:01:45.619> we<00:01:45.770> can't<00:01:46.070> reach<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.759> shot<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.920> it's<00:01:48.920> a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
where we can't reach the shot and it's a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.010 
where we can't reach the shot and it's a
fairly<00:01:49.369> easy<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.820> jump<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:50.420> we<00:01:50.509> still<00:01:50.719> can't

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
fairly easy to jump but we still can't

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.649 
fairly easy to jump but we still can't
reach<00:01:51.289> it<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.859> easy<00:01:52.039> jumper<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:53.420> like

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
reach it but the easy jumper just like

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.090 
reach it but the easy jumper just like
being<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:54.109> lot<00:01:54.350> taller

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100
