 That means in the industry actually 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.060
 it is an association of both 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.610
 worlds from the classic world of toys 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.930

 you practically from both worlds that 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.650

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.530
 that may sound complicated but at 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.540
 toys for a younger audience 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.160
 it is often so that the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.600
 electronics is almost a must 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.370

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.210
 simply forcibly that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.220

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.060
 generation between boardgame and
