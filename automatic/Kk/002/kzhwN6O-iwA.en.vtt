well<00:00:00.240> I<00:00:00.269> was<00:00:00.900> diagnosed<00:00:01.319> with<00:00:01.439> breast<00:00:01.589> cancer

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
well I was diagnosed with breast cancer

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.329 
well I was diagnosed with breast cancer
at<00:00:02.639> 32<00:00:03.480> years<00:00:03.510> old<00:00:03.870> it's<00:00:04.410> 32<00:00:04.799> years<00:00:04.980> old<00:00:05.069> when<00:00:05.279> I

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
at 32 years old it's 32 years old when I

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.210 
at 32 years old it's 32 years old when I
was<00:00:05.370> diagnosed<00:00:05.790> with<00:00:05.940> breast<00:00:06.089> cancer<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:07.220> I

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
was diagnosed with breast cancer and I

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.870 
was diagnosed with breast cancer and I
went<00:00:08.760> through<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.030> whole<00:00:09.210> series<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.880> scans

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
went through the whole series of scans

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.020 
went through the whole series of scans
and<00:00:12.240> tests<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.900> biopsies<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and tests and biopsies and one of the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.790 
and tests and biopsies and one of the
first<00:00:15.240> things<00:00:15.560> my<00:00:16.560> oncologist<00:00:18.800> recommended

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
first things my oncologist recommended

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.099 
first things my oncologist recommended
is<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.369> get<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> PET<00:00:20.789> scan<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.600> see<00:00:21.810> where

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
is that I get a PET scan to see where

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.840 
is that I get a PET scan to see where
the<00:00:22.410> cancer<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.400> had<00:00:23.550> spread

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the cancer is if it's had spread

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.790 
the cancer is if it's had spread
anywhere<00:00:24.210> else<00:00:24.480> outside<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> breast<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
anywhere else outside of the breast and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.470 
anywhere else outside of the breast and
as<00:00:25.980> well<00:00:26.189> where<00:00:26.400> where<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> breast<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.390> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
as well where where in the breast it is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.710 
as well where where in the breast it is
and<00:00:27.689> how<00:00:27.750> active<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> RUS<00:00:29.510> my<00:00:30.510> PET

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and how active it is in the RUS my PET

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.889 
and how active it is in the RUS my PET
scan<00:00:31.019> revealed<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.769> big<00:00:32.040> tumor<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.420> my<00:00:33.450> right

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
scan revealed a big tumor in my right

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.220 
scan revealed a big tumor in my right
breast<00:00:34.430> that<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.610> very<00:00:35.910> active<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:37.050> in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
breast that was very active I think in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.280 
breast that was very active I think in
the<00:00:37.380> PET<00:00:37.710> scan<00:00:37.980> world<00:00:38.309> they<00:00:38.430> say<00:00:38.610> FDD<00:00:39.290> FDG

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the PET scan world they say FDD FDG

the PET scan world they say FDD FDG
uptake<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.100> had<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.370> high<00:00:41.730> level<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
uptake and it had a very high level of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.240 
uptake and it had a very high level of
uptake<00:00:42.710> which<00:00:43.710> means<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:45.079> I<00:00:46.250> believe

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
uptake which means it was a I I believe

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
uptake which means it was a I I believe
it<00:00:47.370> means<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.700> very<00:00:47.940> aggressive<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.629> very

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it means it's very aggressive in a very

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.729 
it means it's very aggressive in a very
active<00:00:49.260> cancer<00:00:50.360> which<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.539> biopsy<00:00:51.989> proved<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
active cancer which the biopsy proved it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.189 
active cancer which the biopsy proved it
to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.190> well<00:00:53.430> shortly<00:00:54.329> after<00:00:54.719> my<00:00:54.870> initial

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to be as well shortly after my initial

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.060 
to be as well shortly after my initial
diagnosis<00:00:56.030> they<00:00:57.030> found<00:00:57.360> additional<00:00:57.840> tumors<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
diagnosis they found additional tumors I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.110 
diagnosis they found additional tumors I
had<00:00:59.760> metastatic<00:01:00.719> lesion<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.440> spine<00:01:02.120> about

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
had metastatic lesion in my spine about

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.179 
had metastatic lesion in my spine about
two<00:01:03.270> years<00:01:03.390> after<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.750> original<00:01:04.470> diagnosis

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
two years after my original diagnosis

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.690 
two years after my original diagnosis
and<00:01:05.519> then<00:01:06.710> about<00:01:07.710> four<00:01:08.040> years<00:01:08.250> after<00:01:08.610> my

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and then about four years after my

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
and then about four years after my
original<00:01:09.119> diagnosis<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.200> also

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
original diagnosis it was also

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
original diagnosis it was also
discovered<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.189> lungs<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.450> am

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
discovered in my lungs in which I am

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.859 
discovered in my lungs in which I am
currently<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.380> treatment<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.659> sort

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
currently in treatment for so it's sort

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
currently in treatment for so it's sort
of<00:01:15.960> ongoing<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.979> remission<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
of ongoing I was in remission for a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.010 
of ongoing I was in remission for a
little<00:01:17.909> while<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> came<00:01:18.780> back

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
little while and then it came back

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.789 
little while and then it came back
remission<00:01:19.799> again<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.430> came<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:21.799> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
remission again and it came back that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.969 
remission again and it came back that
scans<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.280> really<00:01:23.580> crucial<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:25.350> they're

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
scans are really crucial I see they're

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
scans are really crucial I see they're
different<00:01:26.250> than<00:01:26.610> cat-scans<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:27.900> them

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
different than cat-scans I get them

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.910 
different than cat-scans I get them
together<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:30.240> cat<00:01:30.420> scan<00:01:30.630> shows<00:01:31.380> me<00:01:31.619> shows

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
together and the cat scan shows me shows

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.310 
together and the cat scan shows me shows
the<00:01:32.280> physicians<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.939> myself<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.659> anatomy<00:01:34.200> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the physicians and myself the anatomy of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
the physicians and myself the anatomy of
where<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> tumors<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> PET<00:01:35.909> scan

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
where the tumors are but the PET scan

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.380 
where the tumors are but the PET scan
shows<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.020> activity<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> tumors<00:01:38.390> because

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
shows the activity of the tumors because

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
shows the activity of the tumors because
it's<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:39.869> enough<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.590> where<00:01:40.979> something

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it's not enough to know where something

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.710 
it's not enough to know where something
is<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.630> also<00:01:43.020> important<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.720> what

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
is it's also important to know if what

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.690 
is it's also important to know if what
you<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.200> cat<00:01:46.409> scan<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.829> cancer<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.549> also

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you see in a cat scan is cancer and also

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780 
you see in a cat scan is cancer and also
how<00:01:48.090> active<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> how<00:01:49.100> how<00:01:50.100> large<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
how active is it how how large is the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.090 
how active is it how how large is the
FDG<00:01:51.509> uptake<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.290> that's<00:01:52.500> also<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.860> measure

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
FDG uptake because that's also a measure

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.160 
FDG uptake because that's also a measure
of<00:01:53.220> how<00:01:53.520> treatment<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> working<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.020> much

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
of how treatment is working not so much

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.200 
of how treatment is working not so much
if<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.549> shrinking<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.030> that's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
if it's all if it's shrinking it that's

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.179 
if it's all if it's shrinking it that's
wonderful<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:57.990> also<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> uptake<00:01:59.040> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wonderful but also if the uptake is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.520 
wonderful but also if the uptake is
decreasing<00:01:59.790> over<00:02:00.030> time<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.810> means<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
decreasing over time it means that the

and that treatment is still having some

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
effect and I've had that experience in

effect and I've had that experience in
the<00:02:10.479> past<00:02:10.660> especially<00:02:11.230> with<00:02:11.530> my<00:02:11.650> spine<00:02:11.980> tumor

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the past especially with my spine tumor

the past especially with my spine tumor
with<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.110> follow-up<00:02:14.830> scans<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.670> get<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.390> PET

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
with the follow-up scans I get the PET

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.050 
with the follow-up scans I get the PET
scans<00:02:16.780> every<00:02:17.020> three<00:02:17.230> months<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.770> there<00:02:18.460> they

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
scans every three months and there they

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.449 
scans every three months and there they
would<00:02:19.390> initially<00:02:19.840> show<00:02:20.050> an<00:02:20.320> great<00:02:21.010> increase

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
would initially show an great increase

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.090 
would initially show an great increase
in<00:02:21.610> uptake<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.300> then<00:02:23.200> with<00:02:23.410> treatment<00:02:23.920> does

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
in uptake and then with treatment does

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.400 
in uptake and then with treatment does
treatment<00:02:24.459> progress<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.150> FDG<00:02:25.930> uptake<00:02:26.230> would

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
treatment progress the FDG uptake would

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.630 
treatment progress the FDG uptake would
decrease<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.330> was<00:02:28.480> great<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.810> see<00:02:29.640> it

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
decrease and that was great to see it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.600 
decrease and that was great to see it
was<00:02:30.820> really<00:02:30.910> great<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.420> see<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.370> little

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
was really great to see it's a little

was really great to see it's a little
tough<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.380> always<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.920> anxiety<00:02:36.430> about<00:02:36.520> not

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
tough it is always the anxiety about not

tough it is always the anxiety about not

knowing what the outcome will be but the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.320

or<00:04:12.319> to<00:04:12.590> find<00:04:12.830> be<00:04:13.550> more<00:04:13.730> specific<00:04:13.970> in<00:04:14.390> their

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
or to find be more specific in their

or to find be more specific in their
location<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.410> therefore<00:04:16.370> find<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:17.150> more

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
location and therefore find a more

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.210 
location and therefore find a more
specific<00:04:17.810> treatment<00:04:18.290> for<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.590> person<00:04:19.070> that

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
specific treatment for that person that

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.510 
specific treatment for that person that
will<00:04:19.400> give<00:04:20.329> them<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.570> longer<00:04:21.230> life<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.890> a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
will give them a longer life and a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.000 
will give them a longer life and a
better<00:04:22.670> quality<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.270> life<00:04:23.600> for<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.770> years

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
better quality of life for the years

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.550 
better quality of life for the years
that<00:04:25.070> they<00:04:25.310> have<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:26.090> so<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.720> think<00:04:26.930> advancing

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
that they have and so I think advancing

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.500 
that they have and so I think advancing
technology<00:04:28.070> is<00:04:28.190> wonderful<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.970> if<00:04:29.150> it's<00:04:29.330> the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
technology is wonderful and if it's the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.830 
technology is wonderful and if it's the
appropriate<00:04:29.650> test<00:04:30.820> for<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:31.940> patient<00:04:32.480> they

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
appropriate test for that patient they

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.720 
appropriate test for that patient they
should<00:04:33.080> have<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.440> covered<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.070> have<00:04:34.550> it

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
should have it covered and have it

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.580 
should have it covered and have it
ordered<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.390> have<00:04:35.930> it<00:04:36.050> part<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.380> their

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
ordered and have it part of their

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.400 
ordered and have it part of their
follow-up<00:04:37.250> plan<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.840> public<00:04:39.169> should

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
follow-up plan the public should

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.830 
follow-up plan the public should
definitely<00:04:39.830> be<00:04:40.010> educated<00:04:40.850> about<00:04:41.060> what<00:04:41.660> these

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
definitely be educated about what these

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.880 
definitely be educated about what these
technologies<00:04:42.590> do<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.810> they're<00:04:44.810> where<00:04:45.710> they

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
technologies do and they're where they

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.310 
technologies do and they're where they

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
what does a PET scan mean you know the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.710 
what does a PET scan mean you know the

you know it's P et and in layman's term

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.480 
you know it's P et and in layman's term
explain<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.530> them<00:05:00.650> what<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:00.919> does<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.340> how<00:05:01.400> it

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
explain to them what it does and how it

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.220 
explain to them what it does and how it
differs<00:05:01.760> from<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.120> other<00:05:02.360> scans<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:03.020> how<00:05:03.110> it

differs from the other scans and how it

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.740 
differs from the other scans and how it
complements<00:05:04.510> all<00:05:05.510> their<00:05:05.780> scans<00:05:06.290> and<00:05:06.530> tests<00:05:06.919> to

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
complements all their scans and tests to

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.740 
complements all their scans and tests to
give<00:05:08.750> them<00:05:09.050> a<00:05:09.530> good<00:05:10.070> idea<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:11.150> what's<00:05:11.360> going<00:05:11.540> on

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
give them a good idea of what's going on

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.890 
give them a good idea of what's going on
in<00:05:11.870> their<00:05:11.990> body<00:05:13.120> so<00:05:14.120> it's<00:05:14.270> very<00:05:14.419> important

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
in their body so it's very important

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.800 
in their body so it's very important
definitely<00:05:15.910> it's<00:05:16.910> not<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.150> much<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.479> more<00:05:17.660> the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
definitely it's not so much the more the

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.420 
definitely it's not so much the more the
better<00:05:17.960> but<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.440> more<00:05:18.620> specific<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:19.370> the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
better but the more specific and the

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.390 
better but the more specific and the
more<00:05:19.610> thorough<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.180> better
