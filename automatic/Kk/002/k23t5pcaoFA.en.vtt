00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.629
 First, I want to show you how 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.270
 An airy ring crochets 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.779
 one begins with an air make by 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:19.170
 you first put a sling and then 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:25.140
 from behind the thread through the ring 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:32.790
 pull and tighten then take one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:37.550
 his against nobility and does one 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.310
 Envelope sees through the loop 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.060
 and repeated as many times as you the 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.060
 needed 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 so i have six air here then measure 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:15.940
 before me a ring and hegel in the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:18.490
 first air mass a chain a cat 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.850
 mesh works like this one makes one 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.399
 envelope and pull the thread through both 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.170
 wrap 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.170
 so you get an air bring 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.400
 as an alternative to the air mass ring one can 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.140
 also with the so-called thread rain 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.730
 begin 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.760
 I put the thread between me 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.060
 small finger and ring finger wraps 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.640
 him two times the index finger once around 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.270
 thumb and then put back 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.210
 between little finger and ring finger 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:03.530
 I'll take my crochet hook under it 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.560
 the thread of the thumb make a envelope 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.660
 take this thread 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.810
 This creates a small loop and 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:17.810
 Crochet it an air mass that way 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.140
 The thread ring is created in which one then 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.150
 crochet the corresponding stitches 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.540
 I will make seven firm stitches here 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:31.520
 crochet a tight crochet one crochets one 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.720
 by making an envelope 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:41.510
 driver then picks up and then again 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:46.750
 the two loops pull envelope were 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.750
 get thread through both again 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.620
 so now I wash seven and 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.209
 pull the thread to ring by the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.209
 short end and pull it 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.959
 this closes the ring and then 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.370
 I would have a cat mesh in the first 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:44.019
 solid mesh thus engraved in the first 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:50.379
 solid mass one was pulling the thread 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:54.750
 through and through both and 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.750
 Thus, the thready ring is ready 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.490
 nigl do not work in rounds 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.400
 Most people start working with them 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.190
 an air mesh chain in front of me 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.030
 again a sling and pull the 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.030
 thread through 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.290
 and then we would make the air 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.290
 wrap 10 times 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.400
 so that's the breadth of my work now 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.600
 Now I want to crochet 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.180
 I start with a first 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.120
 turn air mesh 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.360
 that is, which is basically an air 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.419
 mesh that makes sure that I then up 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.919
 this corresponding height am then 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.880
 daily a tight loop in the next 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:15.870
 firmly 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:18.949
 get some mesh and then the denise 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:23.669
 draw thread through the two wrote 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:27.710
 So I sting in the mesh-making 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:31.169
 pull an envelope through the loop 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:38.669
 or the thread again and pull the 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:42.090
 do not thread both strokes into the loop 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.210
 pierce the mesh envelope by the 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.800
 thread again get an envelope and 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.800
 pull through the two voices 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.460
 so and so the series looks solid 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.460
 mesh out
