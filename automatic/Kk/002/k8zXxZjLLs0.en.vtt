sunscreen<00:04:57.740> serum<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.490> like<00:04:58.880> such<00:04:59.510> a

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
sunscreen serum that is like such a

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.690 
sunscreen serum that is like such a
mouthful<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:00.260> have<00:05:00.770> we<00:05:00.920> heard<00:05:01.070> about<00:05:01.250> all<00:05:01.460> that

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
mouthful I have we heard about all that

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.680 
mouthful I have we heard about all that
but<00:05:02.300> basically<00:05:02.570> it's<00:05:03.080> just<00:05:03.230> an<00:05:03.560> SPF<00:05:04.370> 30<00:05:04.940> serum

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
but basically it's just an SPF 30 serum

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.150 
but basically it's just an SPF 30 serum
and<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:06.140> think<00:05:06.350> this<00:05:06.470> is<00:05:06.530> really<00:05:06.770> cool<00:05:07.010> because

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
and I think this is really cool because

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.090 
and I think this is really cool because
I've<00:05:07.460> never<00:05:07.490> seen<00:05:07.970> an<00:05:08.180> SPF<00:05:08.990> serum<00:05:09.530> usually

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.700 
I've never seen an SPF serum usually
it's<00:05:10.250> like<00:05:10.370> an<00:05:10.520> SPF<00:05:11.330> sunscreen<00:05:11.630> lotion<00:05:12.500> and

it's like an SPF sunscreen lotion and

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.070 
it's like an SPF sunscreen lotion and
the<00:05:12.880> difference<00:05:13.880> between<00:05:14.030> like<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.360> lotion<00:05:14.630> /

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
the difference between like a lotion /

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.310 
the difference between like a lotion /
moisturizer<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.100> as<00:05:16.520> serum<00:05:16.970> is<00:05:17.270> that<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
moisturizer and as serum is that the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.410 
moisturizer and as serum is that the
serum<00:05:18.710> will<00:05:19.040> go<00:05:19.400> deeper<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.790> penetrate<00:05:20.300> the

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
serum will go deeper and penetrate the

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.410 
serum will go deeper and penetrate the
skin<00:05:20.600> a<00:05:20.660> lot<00:05:20.840> deeper<00:05:21.050> targeting<00:05:21.770> whatever

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
skin a lot deeper targeting whatever
