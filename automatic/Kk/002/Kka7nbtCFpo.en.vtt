00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.870
 in this lesson we will learn to create 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:16.880
 own project in may and it is very 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:19.949
 important so let's start try to open the file 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.260
 look at the address bar we see 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.529
 that initially mine opened a folder with 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.130
 default project now go to the menu 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 file and select project 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.530
 we see a window that can project in May 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.489
 contain a large number of different 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.700
 texture files prices with models sounds 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.700
 various video pictures and more 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.789
 try to create a new project click on 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.559
 The new button and the first thing we do is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.690
 choose the location of our new 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.250
 disk space project 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.010
 computer, you can choose the location 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.140
 opening the explorer and you can enter the address 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.600
 most so I will do for example drive e 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.439
 my underscore 2014 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.979
 and the project will call May lower honorable 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.700
 projet one is very important in the title 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.950
 folders 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.560
 used only in Latin and was not 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.880
 spaces starting from seems correct 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.950
 to work with this project in this window we 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.439
 we observe the list and the name of folders for 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.360
 different contents of the folder these will appear 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.360
 New project in the place indicated in you 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.770
 open the explorer as we see in the folder with 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.570
 project appeared folders under 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.759
 particle image 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.100
 clips sounds and other elements 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.409
 now if we click open 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.700
 look for the file we will start from the folder with 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.700
 project created 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.160
 if you plan on working on 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.660
 several projects for the temporary 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.380
 there is a need to switch 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.480
 between them 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.050
 This is done using the stitch chain 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.600
 project menu file choose from position 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.600
 another project and shake sex 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.660
 Now opening the file the search will start with 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.410
 the current project namely from my 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.720
 models that just chose the menu 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.080
 opening the file you can easily find the desired 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.670
 switching between projects 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.640
 drop-down menu of projects choose 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.840
 we need to chase lower click on 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.450
 the folder on the left we see its contents 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.820
 choose another project the same folder and see 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.800
 what is this project folder which is selected 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.120
 drop down menu and its contents 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.800
 another in this tutorial we have sorted out how 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.630
 create projects for work 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.150
 and in the next we'll find out how
