definitely closed him off as well so if

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.160 
definitely closed him off as well so if
Malfurion<00:02:44.639> and<00:02:44.879> Diablo<00:02:45.629> did<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> little<00:02:46.079> bit

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
Malfurion and Diablo did a little bit

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.629 
Malfurion and Diablo did a little bit
better<00:02:46.319> job<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.590> body<00:02:46.889> blocking<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.459> would

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
better job of body blocking that would

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.460 
better job of body blocking that would
have<00:02:47.730> been<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.879> guaranteed<00:02:48.690> dead<00:02:48.989> stitches

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
have been a guaranteed dead stitches

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.680 
have been a guaranteed dead stitches
instead<00:02:50.190> he<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.670> barely<00:02:50.940> gets<00:02:51.239> away<00:02:51.480> all

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
instead he just barely gets away all

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.839 
instead he just barely gets away all
because<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:52.620> didn't<00:02:52.889> abuse<00:02:53.129> Bobby<00:02:53.430> blocking

e.t.c down from walking towards me and

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
dashing to me and stuff like that but he

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.330 
dashing to me and stuff like that but he
also<00:03:39.419> stopped<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.079> abathur<00:03:40.560> projectiles

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
from shooting me I was definitely in

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.289 
from shooting me I was definitely in
range<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.040> abathur<00:03:44.370> projectile<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:45.209> as

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
range of the abathur projectile but as

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.839 
range of the abathur projectile but as
you<00:03:45.449> can<00:03:45.569> see<00:03:45.629> again<00:03:46.319> he<00:03:46.919> actually<00:03:47.310> stood<00:03:47.579> in

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
the way of the projectile so he absorbed

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.619 
the way of the projectile so he absorbed
the<00:03:50.370> attack<00:03:50.669> because<00:03:51.000> he<00:03:51.150> knew<00:03:51.329> he<00:03:51.510> would

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
the attack because he knew he would

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.569 
the attack because he knew he would

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
and body block him to death now here is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.040 
and body block him to death now here is
a<00:04:39.889> slight<00:04:40.610> body<00:04:41.060> block<00:04:41.389> where<00:04:41.600> this<00:04:41.660> happens

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
a slight body block where this happens

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.600 
a slight body block where this happens
it's<00:04:42.199> not<00:04:42.260> really<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.830> Nova's<00:04:43.130> fault<00:04:43.370> too

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
it's not really the Nova's fault too

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.520 
it's not really the Nova's fault too
much<00:04:43.820> but<00:04:44.360> as<00:04:44.449> you<00:04:44.570> can<00:04:44.690> see<00:04:44.840> this<00:04:44.990> Diablo<00:04:45.500> is

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
much but as you can see this Diablo is

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.110 
much but as you can see this Diablo is
really<00:04:46.040> low<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.340> he<00:04:46.400> knows<00:04:46.580> he's<00:04:46.760> about<00:04:46.940> to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
really low and he knows he's about to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.780 
really low and he knows he's about to
die<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.479> he<00:04:47.570> tries<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.080> escape<00:04:48.320> last<00:04:48.830> second<00:04:49.310> he

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
die so he tries to escape last second he

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.370 
die so he tries to escape last second he
runs<00:04:50.030> upward<00:04:50.510> instead<00:04:50.660> of<00:04:50.960> straight<00:04:51.199> to<00:04:51.350> the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
runs upward instead of straight to the

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.890 
runs upward instead of straight to the
left<00:04:51.680> now<00:04:52.130> there<00:04:52.460> was<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.639> path<00:04:52.940> cut<00:04:53.270> between<00:04:53.630> me

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
left now there was a path cut between me

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.230 
left now there was a path cut between me
and<00:04:54.169> our<00:04:54.650> Nova<00:04:55.100> but<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.430> reason<00:04:55.790> he<00:04:55.820> decided

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
and our Nova but the reason he decided

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.940 
and our Nova but the reason he decided
to<00:04:56.389> run<00:04:56.540> upwards<00:04:56.810> instead<00:04:57.470> of<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:57.800> know<00:04:57.889> to

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
to run upwards instead of you know to

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.040 
to run upwards instead of you know to
the<00:04:58.130> left<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.460> little<00:04:58.580> bit<00:04:58.729> is<00:04:58.970> because<00:04:59.660> then

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
the left a little bit is because then

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.780 
the left a little bit is because then
he'd<00:05:00.169> still<00:05:00.380> be<00:05:00.530> in<00:05:00.560> valleys<00:05:01.040> range<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.580> Vala

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
he'd still be in valleys range and Vala

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.250 
he'd still be in valleys range and Vala
would<00:05:02.000> finish<00:05:02.180> him<00:05:02.389> off<00:05:02.450> anyway<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:02.870> he<00:05:03.080> knows

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
would finish him off anyway and he knows

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.990 
would finish him off anyway and he knows
this<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:03.680> he<00:05:03.800> tries<00:05:04.040> to<00:05:04.190> run<00:05:04.340> away<00:05:04.490> from<00:05:04.729> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
this so he tries to run away from the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.909 
this so he tries to run away from the
Valles<00:05:05.300> straight<00:05:05.570> up<00:05:05.810> unfortunately<00:05:06.800> the

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
Valles straight up unfortunately the

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.310 
Valles straight up unfortunately the
Nova's<00:05:07.190> position<00:05:07.760> calls<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.630> Diablo<00:05:09.110> to

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
Nova's position calls the Diablo to

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.170 
Nova's position calls the Diablo to
wiggle<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.830> little<00:05:10.070> bit<00:05:10.250> instead<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.700> getting<00:05:11.000> a

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
wiggle a little bit instead of getting a

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.879 
wiggle a little bit instead of getting a
straight<00:05:11.570> escape<00:05:11.930> route<00:05:12.200> now<00:05:12.380> he<00:05:12.440> might<00:05:12.710> have

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
straight escape route now he might have

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.710 
straight escape route now he might have
died<00:05:13.070> anyway<00:05:13.490> even<00:05:13.669> if<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.940> Nova<00:05:14.210> wasn't<00:05:14.600> in

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
died anyway even if the Nova wasn't in

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.050 
died anyway even if the Nova wasn't in
his<00:05:14.840> way<00:05:15.050> but<00:05:15.370> you<00:05:16.370> just<00:05:16.490> got<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:16.669> try<00:05:16.850> to<00:05:16.910> look

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
his way but you just got to try to look
