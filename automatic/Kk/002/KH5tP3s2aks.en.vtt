00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:31.013
Is that yours?

00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:32.728
Excuse me?

00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:34.735
This car, is it yours?

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:37.730
I'd like to know who allowed you.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.093
Monsieur doesn't live in Paris.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.375
Who cares?

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:45.516
Otherwise, he'd know
that this place is mine!

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.934
I see. So, I'm the wrong one.

00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:01.829
What's happening?

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:03.167
What do you want?

00:01:03.247 --> 00:01:05.466
These people are regulars.

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.180
So, they have some rights.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:09.993
Well, well.

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:13.777
I beg your pardon for
damaging your privileges.

00:01:14.488 --> 00:01:16.369
But I won't congratulate you.

00:01:16.708 --> 00:01:18.002
We're not asking for that.

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:19.620
That would take the cake.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.325
See you soon, idiot!

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:44.792
Listen.

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:48.179
I'm planning on a vengeance.

00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:52.862
This evening, for the
first time in my life,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.350
somebody hurt me.

00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:00.188
My little car was moved

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:02.864
without my permission.

00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:08.164
This little monster deserves
a good lesson.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.631
Cruel.

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:16.401
He doesn't know Ronald.

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:20.938
For an eye, the face.

00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:22.046
For a tooth...

00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:25.355
But we have to wait.

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:27.843
Let's be patient.

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.105
Let's be hypocritical.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.822
Let's be another.

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:42.262
Let's make up our smile.

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:52.604
I'll get it.

00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:02.676
Yes?

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:05.290
Who are you calling for?

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.683
Who's speaking?

00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:11.269
No, monsieur, he's not home, yet.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.066
I'll tell him, monsieur.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.805
I'll tell him, monsieur.

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:21.188
Yes, I'll tell him.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.822
Goodbye, monsieur.

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:32.963
I'll get my vengeance.

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:36.945
I don't know how, yet...

00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:41.633
but God will participate.

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:47.048
I need a miracle.

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.260
Satan is mine!

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:13.313
Who is she?

00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:17.013
Amboisine.

00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:18.706
- You know her?
- A little bit.

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:19.909
She's cheeky.

00:04:20.518 --> 00:04:22.211
The most beautiful butt in the city.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.695
Admirable.

00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:25.013
What a nice ass.

00:04:26.138 --> 00:04:27.162
Are we going?

00:04:27.242 --> 00:04:28.333
Let's go.
