Swampert<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.440> guess<00:02:31.739> he's<00:02:32.549> printing<00:02:32.760> another

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
Swampert I guess he's printing another

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.220 
Swampert I guess he's printing another
earthquake<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.569> he<00:02:33.629> thought<00:02:33.780> he<00:02:33.870> could<00:02:33.900> miss

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
earthquake so he thought he could miss

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.839 
earthquake so he thought he could miss
won't<00:02:34.379> forget<00:02:34.530> some<00:02:34.680> rocks<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.610> that

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
won't forget some rocks out so that

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.370 
won't forget some rocks out so that
double<00:02:36.060> switch<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.330> perfect<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:36.930> me<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.290> I'm

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
double switch is perfect for me so I'm

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.289 
double switch is perfect for me so I'm
gonna<00:02:37.500> start<00:02:37.739> laying<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.160> some<00:02:38.340> spikes<00:02:38.640> which

rock star was annoying but I believe I

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.569 
rock star was annoying but I believe I

decide just go for more spikes right
here<00:03:35.790> cuz<00:03:36.419> i<00:03:36.660> might<00:03:36.930> as<00:03:37.079> well<00:03:37.260> i<00:03:37.440> mean<00:03:37.650> he<00:03:37.859> does

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
here cuz i might as well i mean he does

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.319 
here cuz i might as well i mean he does
have<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.280> total<00:03:38.430> gifts<00:03:38.669> which<00:03:38.790> avoids<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.209> but

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
have the total gifts which avoids on but

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.490 
have the total gifts which avoids on but
everything<00:03:39.660> else<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:39.900> his<00:03:39.989> team<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.200> hit<00:03:40.380> by

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
everything else on his team is hit by

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.470 
everything else on his team is hit by
them<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.040> i<00:03:41.250> might<00:03:41.790> as<00:03:41.819> well<00:03:41.940> get<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.180> actual

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
them so i might as well get that actual

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.210 
them so i might as well get that actual
residual<00:03:42.810> damage<00:03:42.930> working<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:43.889> i<00:03:43.919> figured

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
residual damage working but i figured

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.740 
residual damage working but i figured
here<00:03:44.489> he<00:03:44.700> shouldn't<00:03:45.150> have<00:03:45.180> thunder<00:03:45.540> wave<00:03:45.630> he

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
here he shouldn't have thunder wave he

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.839 
here he shouldn't have thunder wave he
has<00:03:45.840> no<00:03:45.989> reason<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.260> go<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:46.950> yet<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.819> i

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
has no reason to go for it yet so i

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.870 
has no reason to go for it yet so i
figure<00:03:48.120> i<00:03:48.150> can<00:03:48.299> go<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.569> raikou<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.730> do<00:03:50.730> some

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
figure i can go to raikou and do some

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.490 
figure i can go to raikou and do some
damage<00:03:51.030> my<00:03:51.239> finger<00:03:51.510> he's<00:03:51.660> gonna<00:03:51.810> predict<00:03:52.319> make

this<00:04:26.340> thing<00:04:26.460> he<00:04:26.550> doesn't<00:04:26.850> know<00:04:27.000> that<00:04:27.030> yet<00:04:27.210> so

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
this thing he doesn't know that yet so

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.720 
this thing he doesn't know that yet so
he's<00:04:28.110> more<00:04:28.320> enticed<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.740> stay<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.130> thinking<00:04:29.520> I

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
he's more enticed to stay in thinking I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.210 
he's more enticed to stay in thinking I
don't<00:04:29.910> have<00:04:30.030> anything<00:04:30.240> for<00:04:30.660> him<00:04:31.100> which<00:04:32.100> is

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
don't have anything for him which is

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.160 
don't have anything for him which is
fine<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.880> take<00:04:33.060> him<00:04:33.180> out<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.840> goes<00:04:33.960> into

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
fine so I take him out it goes into

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.270 
fine so I take him out it goes into
Zoomer<00:04:34.530> all<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:34.800> figure<00:04:35.040> he's<00:04:35.190> gonna

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
Zoomer all and I figure he's gonna

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.430 
Zoomer all and I figure he's gonna
predict<00:04:35.610> me<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:35.790> switch<00:04:35.970> out<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.990> I'm<00:04:37.290> just

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
predict me to switch out so I'm just

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.260 
predict me to switch out so I'm just
getting<00:04:37.620> over<00:04:37.710> HP<00:04:37.980> grass<00:04:38.160> cuz<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.610> don't<00:04:39.120> really

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270

wanna take an aqua jet but I know the

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.910 
wanna take an aqua jet but I know the
risk<00:04:41.160> is<00:04:41.570> there<00:04:42.570> that<00:04:42.960> he<00:04:43.230> wants<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.650> predict

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
risk is there that he wants to predict

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.680 
risk is there that he wants to predict
the<00:04:43.950> switch<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.760> do<00:04:44.820> go<00:04:45.030> for<00:04:45.150> HP<00:04:45.360> grass<00:04:45.480> take

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.480 
switch so I just go straight for you
turn<00:05:00.600> cuz<00:05:00.990> there<00:05:01.440> was<00:05:01.590> really<00:05:01.980> no<00:05:02.190> reason<00:05:02.340> to

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
turn cuz there was really no reason to

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.010 
turn cuz there was really no reason to
go<00:05:02.580> for<00:05:02.730> anything<00:05:02.880> else<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.510> might<00:05:03.780> as<00:05:03.810> well

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
go for anything else so might as well

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.440 
go for anything else so might as well
right<00:05:04.230> but<00:05:04.980> I'm<00:05:05.160> you<00:05:05.310> I'm<00:05:05.430> channel<00:05:05.760> or<00:05:05.910> on<00:05:06.180> the

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
right but I'm you I'm channel or on the

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.290 
right but I'm you I'm channel or on the
dusclops<00:05:06.750> cuz<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.680> mean<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.340> Shadow<00:05:08.700> Ball<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:09.090> can

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
dusclops cuz I mean I Shadow Ball I can

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.420 
dusclops cuz I mean I Shadow Ball I can
kind<00:05:09.450> of<00:05:09.510> take<00:05:09.630> it<00:05:09.750> on<00:05:09.840> but<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.260> figure<00:05:10.740> here<00:05:11.010> he

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
kind of take it on but I figure here he

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.040 
kind of take it on but I figure here he
would<00:05:11.550> go<00:05:11.910> for<00:05:12.090> something<00:05:12.120> weird<00:05:12.600> and<00:05:12.780> might

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
would go for something weird and might

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.900 
would go for something weird and might
not<00:05:13.170> expect<00:05:13.440> sub<00:05:13.800> so<00:05:14.070> I'm<00:05:14.160> gonna<00:05:14.250> go<00:05:14.490> for<00:05:14.670> sub

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
not expect sub so I'm gonna go for sub

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.670 
not expect sub so I'm gonna go for sub
cuz<00:05:15.660> maybe<00:05:15.870> he's<00:05:16.080> getting<00:05:16.260> over<00:05:16.320> some<00:05:16.530> weird

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
cuz maybe he's getting over some weird

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.440 
cuz maybe he's getting over some weird
status<00:05:17.130> move<00:05:17.310> but<00:05:17.580> he<00:05:17.790> does<00:05:17.940> actually<00:05:18.150> carry
