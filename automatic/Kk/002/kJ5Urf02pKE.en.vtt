00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.090 
we're going to begin with the fire
seventh<00:00:15.330> which<00:00:15.990> has<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.500> highest<00:00:16.529> accuracy

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
seventh which has the highest accuracy

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.279 
seventh which has the highest accuracy
in<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> group<00:00:17.640> class<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.869> we'll<00:00:18.960> take<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> look

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
in the group class so we'll take a look

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.929 
in the group class so we'll take a look
here<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.710> prior<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> pretty<00:00:20.250> rapidly<00:00:20.550> at<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
here some prior to pretty rapidly at the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
here some prior to pretty rapidly at the
wall<00:00:21.439> now<00:00:22.439> let's<00:00:22.740> get<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> very<00:00:23.070> small<00:00:23.310> window

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
wall now let's get a very small window

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.580 
wall now let's get a very small window
spray<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.869> highlight<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.260> area<00:00:25.470> so

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
spray I'm going to highlight the area so

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.349 
spray I'm going to highlight the area so
you<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> better<00:00:25.980> view<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:27.180> this

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
you get a better view of it but this

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.050 
you get a better view of it but this
year<00:00:27.570> unlike<00:00:28.019> other<00:00:28.140> cards<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.519> pistols<00:00:29.970> are

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
year unlike other cards the pistols are

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420 
year unlike other cards the pistols are
really<00:00:30.269> effective<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> it's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
really effective and I think that a it's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.799 
really effective and I think that a it's
part<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> best<00:00:33.000> batch<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.360> pistols<00:00:33.690> we've

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
part of the best batch of pistols we've

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.860 
part of the best batch of pistols we've
had<00:00:33.989> yet<00:00:34.430> in<00:00:35.430> my<00:00:35.579> opinion<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.690> lot<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
had yet in my opinion I know a lot of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.360 
had yet in my opinion I know a lot of
you<00:00:36.960> guys<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.380> at<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.559> wife<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:37.980> two<00:00:38.160> but

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you guys will look at my wife at two but

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
you guys will look at my wife at two but
a<00:00:39.329> lot<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> those<00:00:40.020> were<00:00:40.170> fully<00:00:40.440> automatic

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
a lot of those were fully automatic

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.830 
a lot of those were fully automatic
where<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.340> only<00:00:41.520> has<00:00:41.670> 10<00:00:42.210> fully<00:00:42.390> automatic

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
where this only has 10 fully automatic

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.479 
where this only has 10 fully automatic
pistol<00:00:43.140> now<00:00:43.710> let's<00:00:43.950> take<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
pistol now let's take a look at the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
pistol now let's take a look at the
tac-45<00:00:44.969> which<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:45.719> powerful<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
tac-45 which is the more powerful of the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.760 
tac-45 which is the more powerful of the
semi-automatic<00:00:47.399> pistols<00:00:48.530> now<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.680> take

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
semi-automatic pistols now you can take

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.229 
semi-automatic pistols now you can take
a<00:00:49.860> look<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> lot<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> kick<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.850> gun<00:00:51.030> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
a look not a lot of kick on the gun so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.170 
a look not a lot of kick on the gun so
the<00:00:51.420> spray<00:00:51.690> remains<00:00:52.440> relatively<00:00:52.829> small<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the spray remains relatively small the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
the spray remains relatively small the
problem<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> tac-45<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> has<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
problem with the tac-45 is it has a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920 
problem with the tac-45 is it has a
smaller<00:00:55.860> clip<00:00:56.399> size<00:00:56.610> although<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.780> get

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
smaller clip size although if you get

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
smaller clip size although if you get
the<00:00:58.020> extended<00:00:58.079> mags<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.980> obviously<00:00:59.489> makes<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the extended mags it obviously makes it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.349 
the extended mags it obviously makes it
better<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.800> like<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.949> one<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.730> specially<00:01:03.239> if

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
better I like this one if specially if

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
better I like this one if specially if
it<00:01:03.480> also<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:03.899> modded<00:01:04.229> controllers<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it also use modded controllers the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.179 
it also use modded controllers the
favorite<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.210> group<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.930> me<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.380> b23r

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
favorite of the group for me is the b23r

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.210 
favorite of the group for me is the b23r
which<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> higher<00:01:10.260> rate<00:01:10.530> great<00:01:10.950> accuracy

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
which has a higher rate great accuracy

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
which has a higher rate great accuracy
but<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> three<00:01:12.030> sharp<00:01:12.270> first<00:01:12.510> very

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
but it's a three sharp first very

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.740 
but it's a three sharp first very
similar<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> raviga<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.600> was

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
similar to that of the raviga which was

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.890 
similar to that of the raviga which was
in<00:01:15.930> 1<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.530> 1<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> 2<00:01:16.799> which<00:01:17.220> everyone<00:01:17.520> loves<00:01:17.900> now

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
in 1 and 1 a 2 which everyone loves now

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
in 1 and 1 a 2 which everyone loves now
let's<00:01:19.049> take<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> look<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> huge<00:01:20.220> spray

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
let's take a look here not a huge spray

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
let's take a look here not a huge spray
window<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.150> much<00:01:21.420> bigger<00:01:21.659> than<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.049> semi

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
window I'm much bigger than the semi

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.719 
window I'm much bigger than the semi
automatics<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.640> expected

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
automatics but that's to be expected

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.690 
automatics but that's to be expected
with<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> burst<00:01:24.979> but<00:01:25.979> very<00:01:26.159> powerful<00:01:26.340> i'm

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
with the burst but very powerful i'm

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
with the burst but very powerful i'm
going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> show<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.000> some<00:01:27.240> video<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> me<00:01:27.960> using

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
going to show you some video of me using

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.330 
going to show you some video of me using
it<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.530> showing<00:01:28.829> how<00:01:28.890> great<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> really

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it just showing how great it really

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
it just showing how great it really
could<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.840> execution<00:01:31.560> which

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
could be now this is the execution which

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.030 
could be now this is the execution which
is<00:01:31.860> pretty<00:01:32.009> neat<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:33.530> 12-gauge<00:01:34.530> revolver

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
is pretty neat it's a 12-gauge revolver

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.910 
is pretty neat it's a 12-gauge revolver
that<00:01:35.520> uses<00:01:35.850> shotgun<00:01:36.479> shells<00:01:36.689> high<00:01:37.619> damage

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that uses shotgun shells high damage

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
that uses shotgun shells high damage
from<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.700> close<00:01:38.939> range<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> hit

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
from really close range but if you hit

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.569 
from really close range but if you hit
this<00:01:39.930> far<00:01:40.170> away<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:40.920> firing<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> along

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
this far away as I'm firing it along

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
this far away as I'm firing it along
really<00:01:42.240> does<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> damage<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
really does it do the damage that it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.620
