 hello to all of you have I well 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.750
 find today to talk to you 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.090
 a subject I've heard a lot about 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.189
 by commenting on my first video 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.660
 tutoz so firstly make-up tutorial 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.009
 for the one who follow me on my blog 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.269
 that a crack a sagat you know that 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.849
 I am a big big consumer 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.939
 of organic products I advocate the natural the 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.699
 bio the breast in terms of food in 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.160
 facial care for the 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.649
 hair for the body is actually 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.820
 growing to about of 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.590
 makeup unlike head is what 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.300
 you could have thought my first tutorial 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.010
 that I actually did I used 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.359
 no organic product I really use 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.829
 brands like mc sephora make up for 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.760
 ever 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.829
 actually there was nothing bio 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.350
 or very few organic products anyway 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.879
 in this video is a lot actually 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.859
 notice but how is it done then 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.020
 that you really take the natural and 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.640
 it's true in terms of care justice that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.920
 vegetable oils as products 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.700
 than organic shampoos that masks 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.560
 bio etc 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.799
 so I understand your astonishment 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.000
 actually but actually that's why 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.159
 I'm doing this video to explain to you 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.329
 do not forget cabbage makeup artist 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.159
 it's my job that I'm not 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.000
 makeup artist for individuals for 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.409
 life every day but I am 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.750
 really makeup artist in the media and 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.790
 especially in television and cinema 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.680
 television especially there really is a 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.439
 specific makeup to have it takes 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.210
 do not forget that there are huge lights 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.740
 on the plateaus that you really need 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.590
 to prevent a shine it is necessary that 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.030
 the state be very pushed because they 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.200
 make more bland on the air points 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.530
 here it is a makeup totally 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.299
 different so unfortunately I have not 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.950
 still replaced all my briefcase we're going 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.050
 say by healthier products and more 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.300
 bio because not because everything 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.460
 just I can not I can not 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 do my job well I can not do it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 can not afford to have a 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.350
 result less well under the pretext that I 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.910
 will only use organic products 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.260
 now I wish I could tell you 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.060
 I wish I could afford it 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.860
 but I can not I can not put in 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.270
 peril my job but result of my 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.760
 job 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.540
 just because I was changing and producing 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.610
 actually at being 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.810
 poor as the super 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.760
 product because there are pearls in 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.620
 dari product there really are super 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.270
 prices can adapt to TV in cinema 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.070
 for everyday life I wanted 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.570
 to discover as and when 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.770
 there are other products that I finally have 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.150
 that's why I do not necessarily 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.060
 managed to change or replace with 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.490
 organic products so for tutorials I 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.840
 will make 100% organic tutorials you will send 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.840
 for example my next tutorial you go 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.690
 see it's a makeup with that 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.560
 beautiful caramel color products 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.330
 cosmetics and rms so that 100% organic 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 like I'll do it to you it's obvious 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.440
 but I also want to show you what 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.940
 I do in my work and in life 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.670
 everyday it would be hypocritical 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.110
 for me to make everything believe that 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.400
 I use only organic products for 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.480
 me it's not true in makeup 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.230
 actually I have less this side 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.890
 as I tell myself that makeup 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.510
 removes it 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.970
 at the end of the day it's not 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.739
 done to heal at the base in my head 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.480
 that I say to myself well if it's not organic 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.060
 it's not very serious at least I have the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.590
 care after that come behind and 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.239
 this is it can not be catastrophic 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.690
 not as catastrophic for me as 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.160
 cream or shampoo or deodorant 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.350
 for example they are not they 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.170
 are full of junk 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.489
 this is for me the organic makeup is 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.950
 great we'll say c1 and more if it's 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.959
 the case but it's not mandatory not in 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.670
 not in any case for me not for my 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.200
 work anyway here I wanted 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.660
 just tell you that and I wanted I want 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.980
 also affected I also want to touch 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.060
 girls who are not necessarily thoroughly 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.620
 in the lot because there are plenty of them 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.820
 acquired this not 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.550
 affected by that but who not want me 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.230
 see tutorials of makeup tutorials and 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.860
 in this case I speak necessarily left 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.960
 it's done 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.090
 side so here you will see some tutorials 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.310
 will say 100% organic and you will see from 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.450
 tutorials with classic products have to 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.460
 to say I still advocate organic 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.680
 and natural it's obvious I'm 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.910
 absolutely against theses about 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.890
 cosmetics on foods but that's 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.210
 since 2013 since March 2013 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.010
 happily there is a law that has passed 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.590
 in Europe like what all products 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.730
 that we buy in europe do not have 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.030
 not the right to be tested on 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.830
 animals 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.430
 so that's a huge plus and it's 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.990
 awesome so in France that you buy 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.260
 in any case have not tested on 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.730
 animals 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.470
 after I could go a lot again 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.490
 further to use marks that do not 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.320
 do not sell in China for example 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.780
 because you have to know that all 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.240
 brands that are selling in China are 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.220
 necessarily actually to be sold in 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.419
 China cosmi a cosmetics must have 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.600
 been tested on animals 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.919
 so the mark gives the right to the 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.580
 chain to test the animals can be 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.960
 sold in China 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.120
 so actually game to go over 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.100
 far and will not say all the marks there 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.330
 are sold in China 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.229
 I stop and forget because it's 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.960
 Marquis who are not necessarily against 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:04.020
 the tests and I would still like to tell you 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.340
 that I would like to do that but there are 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.120
 professional makeup brands 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.860
 like mac that are sold in china which 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.900
 was proposing great product for the media 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.310
 and so on it I can not I can 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.860
 I can not stop working with 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.330
 this kind of brand mac 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.680
 so here I found the solution at 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.880
 progressively and I just wanted 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.050
 parent takes it on like what 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.669
 actually you have found 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.600
 organic makeup that painted on my 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.120
 chain was going to find other 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.470
 much more classic makeup and that 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.669
 Nevertheless, I still preach 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.650
 values ​​and I hope you do not 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.300
 do not want two of my guys is a little 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.460

 target that bio people that the 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.369
 people 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.189
 because because it would be a pity 

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:42.659
 here I kiss you very much I hope that
