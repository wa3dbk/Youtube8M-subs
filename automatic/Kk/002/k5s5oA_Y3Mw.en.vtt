00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.100
 live your house 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.410
 Y 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.559
 in the playrooms for children 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.330
 It is important to have some furniture where 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.400
 collect all the things we have 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.810
 thrown on the floor precisely for 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 prevent them from stumbling and they 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.369
 can they hit today we're going to teach them 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.199
 how to make a very easy ledge and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.349
 fun and we will locate it in this 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.349
 place 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.720
 The first thing we are going to do is sand 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.390
 now let's take a measure of 15 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.950
 centimeters and we started to aim 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.800
 we take the bases that are 1 meter with 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.470
 80 centimeters we take the measurements and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.840
 we mark the slats should be 70 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.630
 centimeters long each one now yes 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.470
 we aim 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.470
 ah 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 remember that in order to secure the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.350
 strips we must apply glue to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.600
 wood 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.610
 once we are putting together the pieces 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.250
 we leave spaces to put the slats 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.170
 smooth that are the shelf and the round ones and 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.620
 They are used to hang things like clothes 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.990
 children 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.770
 Once the furniture is assembled, we will apply 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.630
 the lacquer remembers wearing face masks 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.440
 now we are going to see how I know our 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.110
 shelf already installed in the room 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.940
 You saw it so easy to make a shelf 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.800
 fun for our children and the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.080
 materials we always get them in 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.430
 conscious and if you want more ideas do not
