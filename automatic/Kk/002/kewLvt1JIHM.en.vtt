reasons<00:01:44.539> about<00:01:44.750> haven't<00:01:46.119> looked<00:01:47.119> at<00:01:47.299> it<00:01:47.360> a

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.780 

sing-off<00:02:05.630> hard<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.500> get<00:02:06.679> out<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:13.400> one<00:02:13.610> has<00:02:13.760> a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
sing-off hard to get out this one has a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.890 
sing-off hard to get out this one has a
net<00:02:14.120> point<00:02:14.420> i<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> only

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
net point i think so this is the only

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.870 
net point i think so this is the only
one<00:02:18.200> there<00:02:18.700> net<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.150> or<00:02:20.599> now<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:22.519> one<00:02:22.730> has

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
one there net on it or now this one has

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.130 
one there net on it or now this one has
me<00:02:23.060> too

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.630

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
side this is really good this is a nice

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.920 
side this is really good this is a nice
amount<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.560> hair<00:03:15.710> this<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:15.950> really<00:03:16.460> full<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
amount of hair this is really full the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.280 
amount of hair this is really full the
wave<00:03:21.200> pattern<00:03:21.800> is<00:03:22.180> amazing<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.960> like<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
wave pattern is amazing and I like the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.900 
wave pattern is amazing and I like the
fact<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.890> same<00:03:25.100> throughout<00:03:25.490> all

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
fact that it's the same throughout all

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.020 
fact that it's the same throughout all
of<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.270> bundles<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.380> wave<00:03:27.880> pattern<00:03:28.880> is<00:03:29.000> like

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
of the bundles the wave pattern is like

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:37.120 
of the bundles the wave pattern is like
one<00:03:29.300> point<00:03:35.320> closure<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.620> ballina<00:03:36.890> had<00:03:37.100> a

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
one point closure and I ballina had a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:54.220 
one point closure and I ballina had a
free<00:03:38.090> part<00:03:38.360> Phil<00:03:38.630> dressing

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.729 

oh<00:03:57.310> my<00:03:58.310> gosh<00:03:58.549> we<00:03:58.819> guys<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.180> hair<00:03:59.720> on<00:03:59.989> this

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
oh my gosh we guys the hair on this

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.140 
oh my gosh we guys the hair on this
closure<00:04:01.069> so<00:04:01.489> soft<00:04:03.280> well<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:04.489> thing<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:05.030> I'm

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
closure so soft well one thing that I'm

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.199 
closure so soft well one thing that I'm
noticing<00:04:05.590> just<00:04:06.590> by<00:04:06.739> doing<00:04:06.799> that<00:04:07.250> there's<00:04:08.030> not

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
noticing just by doing that there's not

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.900 
noticing just by doing that there's not
a<00:04:08.269> lot<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.510> hair<00:04:08.750> on<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.019> closure<00:04:09.260> um<00:04:12.910> it's

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
a lot of hair on this closure um it's

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.689 
a lot of hair on this closure um it's
enough<00:04:14.980> but<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.930> think<00:04:17.930> this<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.139> a<00:04:18.199> free<00:04:18.350> part

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
enough but I think this is a free part

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.830 
enough but I think this is a free part
this<00:04:19.699> is<00:04:19.880> what<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.120> looks<00:04:20.329> like<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.570> i<00:04:20.630> love

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
this is what it looks like and i love

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.140 
this is what it looks like and i love
how<00:04:20.930> has<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.350> band<00:04:21.620> around<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.639> so<00:04:22.880> when<00:04:23.120> I

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
how has the band around it so when I

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.960 
how has the band around it so when I
make<00:04:23.419> my<00:04:23.449> wigs<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.500> don't<00:04:25.010> stab<00:04:25.370> through<00:04:25.820> this

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
make my wigs I don't stab through this

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.020 
make my wigs I don't stab through this
and<00:04:26.270> put<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.750> hole<00:04:27.020> into<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:28.070> actual<00:04:28.430> lace<00:04:28.669> part

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
and put a hole into the actual lace part

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.290 
and put a hole into the actual lace part
but<00:04:29.780> yeah<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.350> closure<00:04:31.250> does<00:04:31.699> not<00:04:31.910> have<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> lot

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
but yeah the closure does not have a lot

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.879 
but yeah the closure does not have a lot
of<00:04:32.330> hair<00:04:32.570> on<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:34.930> I've<00:04:35.930> had<00:04:36.350> closures<00:04:36.860> that

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
of hair on it I've had closures that

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.790 
of hair on it I've had closures that
have<00:04:37.310> been<00:04:37.490> very<00:04:37.789> very<00:04:38.090> very<00:04:38.270> full<00:04:38.750> this<00:04:39.410> isn't

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
have been very very very full this isn't

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.090 
have been very very very full this isn't
insanely<00:04:40.190> thin<00:04:40.820> but<00:04:41.449> it's<00:04:41.810> not<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.470> thickest

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
insanely thin but it's not the thickest

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:53.970 
insanely thin but it's not the thickest
closure<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:44.419> I've<00:04:44.780> had

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980

funny corn chip type smells to it it
smells<00:05:16.150> like<00:05:16.740> hair<00:05:19.980> this<00:05:20.980> actually<00:05:21.190> doesn't

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
smells like hair this actually doesn't

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.430

doesn't smell like anything and for the

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.990 
doesn't smell like anything and for the
most<00:05:30.580> part<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:31.570> curl<00:05:31.870> patterns<00:05:32.380> with<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:33.000> the

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
most part the curl patterns with the the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.300 
most part the curl patterns with the the
closure<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:34.480> actual<00:05:34.900> bundles<00:05:35.350> this<00:05:35.890> looks<00:05:36.220> a

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
closure and actual bundles this looks a

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.450 
closure and actual bundles this looks a
little<00:05:36.460> more<00:05:36.700> looser<00:05:37.150> than<00:05:37.390> um<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:39.130> actual

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
little more looser than um the actual

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.910 
little more looser than um the actual
bundles<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.030> ways<00:05:40.480> are<00:05:40.810> more<00:05:41.080> defined<00:05:41.530> in

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
bundles the ways are more defined in

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.250 
bundles the ways are more defined in
this<00:05:42.880> um<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:45.250> bundles<00:05:46.060> versus<00:05:46.570> the

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
this um and the bundles versus the

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.200 
this um and the bundles versus the
closure<00:05:50.370> this<00:05:51.370> balloon<00:05:51.640> is<00:05:51.670> the<00:05:51.820> smells<00:05:52.060> like

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
closure this balloon is the smells like

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.430 
closure this balloon is the smells like
anything<00:05:52.600> this<00:05:52.780> is<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:53.200> like<00:05:53.650> really<00:05:54.580> like

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
anything this is it like really like

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.840 
anything this is it like really like
tripping<00:05:56.440> me<00:05:56.530> out<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.860> doesn't<00:05:57.100> have<00:05:57.370> any<00:05:57.640> type

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
tripping me out it doesn't have any type

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.040 
tripping me out it doesn't have any type
of<00:05:57.880> smell<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.360> I'm<00:05:58.600> not<00:05:58.750> used<00:05:58.960> to<00:05:59.050> that<00:06:01.050> it's

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
of smell to it I'm not used to that it's

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.930 
of smell to it I'm not used to that it's
nice<00:06:02.230> but<00:06:02.890> the<00:06:03.040> hair<00:06:03.190> on<00:06:03.220> the<00:06:03.340> closures<00:06:03.700> really

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
nice but the hair on the closures really

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.670 
nice but the hair on the closures really
really<00:06:04.120> solved<00:06:04.510> but<00:06:04.690> like<00:06:04.900> I<00:06:05.020> said<00:06:05.080> it's<00:06:05.500> not

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
really solved but like I said it's not
