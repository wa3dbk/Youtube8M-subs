00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.470 
wondered why naked mole rats are naked
the<00:03:08.739> reason<00:03:09.159> is<00:03:09.370> because<00:03:09.640> they<00:03:10.209> live<00:03:10.450> in

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the reason is because they live in

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.569 
the reason is because they live in
underground<00:03:10.989> tunnels<00:03:11.709> which<00:03:12.099> maintain<00:03:12.549> a

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
underground tunnels which maintain a

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.119 
underground tunnels which maintain a
temperature<00:03:12.879> between<00:03:13.510> 82<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.500> 89<00:03:14.920> degrees

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
temperature between 82 and 89 degrees

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.640 
temperature between 82 and 89 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.599> they<00:03:16.750> don't<00:03:16.930> have<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.290> need<00:03:17.620> for

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
Fahrenheit so they don't have a need for

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.339 
Fahrenheit so they don't have a need for
an<00:03:18.010> insulating<00:03:18.579> layer<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:19.030> fat<00:03:19.329> or<00:03:19.629> fur<00:03:19.989> and

an insulating layer of fat or fur and

an insulating layer of fat or fur and
they<00:03:21.129> don't<00:03:21.250> even<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.549> sweat<00:03:22.000> glands
