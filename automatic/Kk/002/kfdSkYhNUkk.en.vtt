Tupperware<00:01:12.850> actually<00:01:13.240> has<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.420> lifetime

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870

guarantee<00:01:14.050> on<00:01:14.620> their<00:01:14.800> lids<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.310> they're<00:01:15.400> very

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
guarantee on their lids and they're very

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.240 
guarantee on their lids and they're very
good<00:01:15.730> about<00:01:15.910> honoring<00:01:16.300> that<00:01:16.680> off<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:17.980> I<00:01:18.010> looked

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
good about honoring that off so I looked

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.610 
good about honoring that off so I looked
up<00:01:18.430> they<00:01:18.610> just<00:01:18.880> simply<00:01:19.090> have<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.930> satisfaction

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
up they just simply have a satisfaction

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.380 
up they just simply have a satisfaction
guarantee<00:01:20.800> so<00:01:21.370> I've<00:01:21.430> never<00:01:21.610> tried<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.180> return

guarantee so I've never tried to return
anything<00:01:22.810> there<00:01:22.960> but<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.410> imagine<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.820> they

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
anything there but I imagine that they

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.590 
anything there but I imagine that they
would<00:01:26.190> also<00:01:27.190> honor<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.850> if<00:01:28.030> anything<00:01:28.270> broke

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
would also honor and if anything broke

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.210 
would also honor and if anything broke
but<00:01:28.780> it's<00:01:28.870> very<00:01:29.050> sturdy<00:01:29.500> I<00:01:31.050> really<00:01:32.050> love<00:01:32.350> how

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
but it's very sturdy I really love how

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.520 
but it's very sturdy I really love how
tough<00:01:33.670> where<00:01:33.880> seems<00:01:34.300> to<00:01:34.480> stack<00:01:34.870> up<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.230> little

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
tough where seems to stack up a little

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.649 
tough where seems to stack up a little
bit<00:01:35.680> better<00:01:35.860> than<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.520> oXXO<00:01:36.940> containers<00:01:37.480> you

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
bit better than the oXXO containers you

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.200 
bit better than the oXXO containers you
can<00:01:37.690> build<00:01:38.140> on<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.350> because<00:01:38.770> here<00:01:39.490> we<00:01:39.640> have<00:01:39.880> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
can build on it because here we have the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.320 
can build on it because here we have the
largest<00:01:40.600> container<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:42.130> can<00:01:42.340> put<00:01:42.550> two<00:01:43.000> of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
largest container and I can put two of

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.020 
largest container and I can put two of
these<00:01:43.690> smaller<00:01:44.170> containers<00:01:44.830> side-by-side<00:01:45.730> on

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
these smaller containers side-by-side on

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.190 
these smaller containers side-by-side on
it<00:01:46.890> however<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.310> cannot<00:01:49.180> do<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.510> with<00:01:49.720> Ock<00:01:49.930> so

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
it however I cannot do that with Ock so

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.590 
it however I cannot do that with Ock so
the<00:01:50.920> only<00:01:51.280> thing<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.580> can<00:01:51.760> stack<00:01:52.030> on<00:01:52.300> it<00:01:52.420> is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
the only thing I can stack on it is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.190 
the only thing I can stack on it is
something<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.530> exact<00:01:54.010> same<00:01:54.880> size<00:01:55.510> so<00:01:56.080> it's

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
something of the exact same size so it's

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.890 
something of the exact same size so it's
a<00:01:56.260> little<00:01:56.500> bit<00:01:56.620> more<00:01:56.710> difficult<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.250> configure

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
a little bit more difficult to configure

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.620 
a little bit more difficult to configure
also<00:01:58.900> if<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.740> notice<00:02:00.070> Tupperware<00:02:00.760> has<00:02:01.150> more

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
also if you notice Tupperware has more

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.039 
also if you notice Tupperware has more
of<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.900> ridge<00:02:02.680> there<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:03.880> if<00:02:04.330> it's<00:02:04.600> up<00:02:04.750> high<00:02:04.990> you

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
of a ridge there so if it's up high you

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.009 
of a ridge there so if it's up high you
need<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.530> pull<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:05.890> out<00:02:06.720> these<00:02:07.720> top<00:02:07.990> ones

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
need to pull it out these top ones

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.869 
need to pull it out these top ones
aren't<00:02:08.379> gonna<00:02:08.470> jump<00:02:08.799> off<00:02:08.979> on<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.489> one<00:02:09.700> they

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
aren't gonna jump off on this one they

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.640 
aren't gonna jump off on this one they
can<00:02:10.060> slide<00:02:10.330> off<00:02:10.539> easier<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.470> way<00:02:11.620> that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
can slide off easier so the way that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.870 
can slide off easier so the way that
they<00:02:11.950> nest<00:02:12.280> inside<00:02:12.730> on<00:02:13.569> top<00:02:13.780> wears<00:02:14.080> is

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
they nest inside on top wears is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.340 
they nest inside on top wears is
definitely<00:02:15.880> better<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.930> they<00:02:17.110> all

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
definitely better and they all

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.850 
definitely better and they all
so<00:02:17.560> have<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:18.550> more<00:02:18.820> sizes<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.870> options<00:02:20.470> and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
so have just more sizes and options and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.850 
so have just more sizes and options and
I<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.850> how<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.270> have<00:02:22.300> this<00:02:22.750> particular<00:02:23.020> lid

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
I like how they have this particular lid

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.590 
I like how they have this particular lid
where<00:02:24.490> you<00:02:24.580> can<00:02:24.700> put<00:02:24.820> like<00:02:24.940> your<00:02:25.030> baking<00:02:25.360> soda
