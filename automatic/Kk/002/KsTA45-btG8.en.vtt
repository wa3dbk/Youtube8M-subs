00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
Pepe Reina is fit Brad Jones gets the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.059 
Pepe Reina is fit Brad Jones gets the
nod<00:03:02.549> for<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.910> goalkeeper<00:03:03.330> at<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.769> end<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.610 
nod for the goalkeeper at the end of the
day<00:03:05.250> looking<00:03:05.880> back<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.269> would<00:03:06.569> say<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.110> was<00:03:07.590> a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
day looking back I would say that was a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.620 
day looking back I would say that was a
poor<00:03:08.040> decision<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.880> play<00:03:09.120> Brad<00:03:09.569> Jones<00:03:11.630> number

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
poor decision to play Brad Jones number

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.360 
poor decision to play Brad Jones number
one<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.959> think<00:03:13.080> Pepe<00:03:13.650> Reina<00:03:13.920> would<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.190> dealt

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
one I think Pepe Reina would have dealt

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.620 
one I think Pepe Reina would have dealt
with<00:03:14.549> that<00:03:14.640> cross<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.120> led<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.480> first

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
with that cross that led to the first

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.789 
with that cross that led to the first
goal<00:03:15.870> maybe<00:03:16.709> not<00:03:16.920> but<00:03:17.780> for<00:03:18.780> Jones's<00:03:19.200> punch<00:03:19.500> to

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
goal maybe not but for Jones's punch to

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.500 
goal maybe not but for Jones's punch to
punch<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:20.190> right<00:03:20.459> back<00:03:20.640> into<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.239> middle<00:03:21.480> of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
punch it right back into the middle of

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.259 
punch it right back into the middle of
the<00:03:21.600> field<00:03:21.780> very<00:03:22.320> poor<00:03:22.590> decision<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:24.150> be

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
the field very poor decision and to be

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.050 
the field very poor decision and to be
honest<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.870> i<00:03:25.220> think<00:03:26.220> his<00:03:26.549> defenders

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
honest with you i think his defenders

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.130 
honest with you i think his defenders
had<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.359> one<00:03:27.480> cover<00:03:27.630> i<00:03:27.720> don't<00:03:27.870> think<00:03:28.019> he<00:03:28.109> ever

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
had that one cover i don't think he ever

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.710 
had that one cover i don't think he ever
need<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.470> come<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.799> first<00:03:29.010> place<00:03:29.720> Jones

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
need to come in the first place Jones

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.800 
need to come in the first place Jones
did<00:03:31.410> not<00:03:31.650> look<00:03:31.920> convincing<00:03:32.820> for<00:03:33.329> homage<00:03:33.570> for

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
did not look convincing for homage for

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.410 
did not look convincing for homage for
part<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> game<00:03:34.769> he<00:03:35.010> was<00:03:35.160> nervous<00:03:36.030> looking

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
part of the game he was nervous looking

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.110 
part of the game he was nervous looking
he<00:03:36.900> did<00:03:37.079> make<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> couple<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.680> decent<00:03:37.829> saves<00:03:38.310> but

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
he did make a couple of decent saves but

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.030 
he did make a couple of decent saves but
again<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.840> could<00:03:39.959> see<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.470> he's<00:03:40.709> not<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
again you could see that he's not the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.470 
again you could see that he's not the
goalkeeper<00:03:41.519> that's<00:03:41.730> used<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.120> playing<00:03:42.329> in

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
goalkeeper that's used to playing in

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.240 
goalkeeper that's used to playing in
that<00:03:42.600> goal<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.290> think<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> defense<00:03:43.799> showed

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
that goal and I think the defense showed

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.680 
that goal and I think the defense showed
that<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:44.549> well<00:03:44.760> because<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.150> defense<00:03:45.480> looked

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
that as well because the defense looked

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.199 
that as well because the defense looked
a<00:03:45.780> little<00:03:45.900> bit<00:03:46.079> shaky<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.530> know<00:03:46.940> maybe<00:03:47.940> in<00:03:48.120> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
a little bit shaky you know maybe in the

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.699 
a little bit shaky you know maybe in the
back<00:03:48.359> of<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.600> minds<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.989> Daniel<00:03:49.320> Agger<00:03:49.470> and

Raheem<00:05:38.800> Sterling<00:05:39.220> had<00:05:39.310> a<00:05:39.340> very<00:05:39.670> easy<00:05:39.910> chance

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
Raheem Sterling had a very easy chance

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.360 
Raheem Sterling had a very easy chance
that<00:05:40.540> he<00:05:40.630> should<00:05:40.810> have<00:05:40.900> scored<00:05:41.170> whether<00:05:42.160> or

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
that he should have scored whether or

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.740 
that he should have scored whether or
not<00:05:42.490> he<00:05:42.700> should<00:05:42.730> have<00:05:43.000> passed<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.420> ball<00:05:43.600> to

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750

not he should have passed that ball to
Luis<00:05:44.020> Suarez<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.470> I<00:05:44.680> believe<00:05:44.890> it<00:05:44.980> was<00:05:45.040> the

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
Luis Suarez and I believe it was the

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.540 
Luis Suarez and I believe it was the
64th<00:05:45.700> minute<00:05:46.350> Suarez<00:05:47.350> was<00:05:47.530> screaming<00:05:48.310> for<00:05:48.460> the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550

64th minute Suarez was screaming for the
ball<00:05:49.290> sternly<00:05:50.290> took<00:05:50.500> it<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:51.280> I'm<00:05:51.640> not<00:05:51.760> even

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.180 
ball sternly took it and I'm not even
sure<00:05:52.030> what<00:05:52.360> that<00:05:52.390> was<00:05:52.660> it<00:05:53.620> ended<00:05:53.830> up<00:05:53.920> not<00:05:54.160> even

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190
