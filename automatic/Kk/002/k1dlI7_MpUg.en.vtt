00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.246
Hey Guys

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:13.142
Today I gonna show you guys my new hooby.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.017
Called Hydroponics.

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:22.035
For who doesn't know what this is

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.568
It's a type of cultivation.

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:25.704
"Hydro" from water.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.259
"Ponics"  from agriculture.

00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:32.276
This type of cultivation just uses water

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:34.783
and substrate.

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:41.006
The substrate it's just for the roots hang on something.

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:47.297
And it's not that substrate that give to the plants what they need.

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:54.149
All the nutrients come from the water and light.

00:00:55.867 --> 00:01:00.558
Now let's see my hydroponics System

00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:05.941
There he is!

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:23.313
There gonna come the substrate with the seeds.

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:36.223
As you can hear, the air pump it's goind his job.

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.728
In the deposite, it's the water.

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:58.078
I didn't put the nutrients in the water yet.

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:03.623
The water pump, that pump the water throw this tube.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.196
And come out there.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.933
Then flow throw the chanells.

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:32.903
This is for keep the water flowing inside the deposite.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.012
And for the root. They like air too.

00:02:38.662 --> 00:02:40.891
In Portugal, this kind of cultivation it's not popular.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:45.117
I doesn't know anybody where who do this.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:51.990
I heard about hydroponics, from a chanell where on Youtube

00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:53.987
Called:

00:02:58.027 --> 00:03:07.037
He's from UK, and he's trying this type of cultivation as well.

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:18.368
In Brasil, it's very common do this, because of the weather.

00:03:22.176 --> 00:03:26.216
They plant specially lettuce.

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:34.497
In there, I gonna plant lettuce, tomatos and strawberrys.

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:45.001
But the strawberrys, it's just in the summer

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.149
Ok, as I said, it's necessary substrate and nutrients,

00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:17.090
This is rock wool

00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:28.005
You put the seed in the middle, water, wait on or two week

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:33.903
and you got a beautiful plant ready to be put it on the system.

00:04:33.903 --> 00:04:36.903
You also gonna need nutrients

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.277
This is for grow and I also buy the bloom one.

00:04:48.183 --> 00:04:58.771
I also advise you buy a pH meter.

00:05:02.277 --> 00:05:12.030
Here are my seed ready to put on the system.

00:05:14.863 --> 00:05:17.863
Four tomato seeds.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:24.363
The nutrients must not cath any sun light.

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:37.850
So, I gonna cover the chanells with black plastic.

00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:06.620
Ok, three tomatoseeds 

00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:14.821
Today, it's day 1.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.296
Starts my hydroponic project.

00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:29.143
Now it's just put the nutrients in the water and it's done

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:41.334
