00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
have a few different types so these two

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.730 
have a few different types so these two
are<00:00:30.449> dr.<00:00:30.869> Bronner's<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.619> only

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
are dr. Bronner's and the only

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.600 
are dr. Bronner's and the only
difference<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.870> this<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.079> has<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> more<00:00:34.610> mild

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610

flavor<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.950> guess<00:00:38.129> just

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
flavor and this one is I guess just

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.930 
flavor and this one is I guess just
regular<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.590> also<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.520> big<00:00:41.730> one

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
