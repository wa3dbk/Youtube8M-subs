00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:22.770
 100 meters with fences you can imagine what 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.420
 difficult to run at full speed and 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.420
 that you also have to jump obstacles 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.680
 the 100 meters with hurdles are run 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.890
 on a track with one lane for each 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.280
 competitor each one will have to jump 10 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.620
 hurdles before finishing the race on 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.160
 winner is the first to cross the finish line 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.880
 with his torso to practice this sport 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.070
 you need muscle strength legs 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.070
 long a lot of concentration 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.040
 to start the race athletes 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.700
 they stop on blogs their position is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.470
 almost horizontal this will allow them 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.170
 generate less resistance against 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.770
 wind and so take advantage of the momentum 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.080
 the output signal is a good shot 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.060
 athlete takes a little more than a tenth 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.659
 of second to record the sound and 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.850
 start in each stride the sprinters 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.280
 they must raise the knee as high 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.250
 possible to drop the footstep with 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.259
 a lot of strength when you get in front of a 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.750
 fence all the strength to push yourself 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.299
 up and forward is channeled to 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.580
 through the tip of the foot 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.710
 sprinters of this test in a race 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.500
 they use the same energy that is required 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.500
 to climb a 5000 meter mountain
