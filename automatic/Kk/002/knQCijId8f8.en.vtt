00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.900 

we<00:00:15.560> filled<00:00:15.800> our<00:00:15.920> stockpot<00:00:16.460> about<00:00:16.700> half-full

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
we filled our stockpot about half-full

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.910 
we filled our stockpot about half-full
of<00:00:17.150> water<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:18.260> reason<00:00:18.439> is<00:00:18.710> we're<00:00:18.890> just

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
of water and the reason is we're just

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.900 
of water and the reason is we're just
going<00:00:19.279> to<00:00:19.430> melt<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:20.420> sugar<00:00:21.579> just<00:00:22.579> to<00:00:22.759> get<00:00:22.880> a

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
going to melt the sugar just to get a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.880 
going to melt the sugar just to get a
simple<00:00:23.270> syrup<00:00:23.570> after<00:00:24.320> that<00:00:24.470> we're<00:00:24.680> going<00:00:24.829> to

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
simple syrup after that we're going to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.130 
simple syrup after that we're going to
fill<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.310> rest<00:00:25.520> of<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:25.880> keg<00:00:26.239> we'll<00:00:26.779> just<00:00:26.989> top

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
fill the rest of the keg we'll just top

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.170 
fill the rest of the keg we'll just top
it<00:00:27.169> up<00:00:27.380> with<00:00:27.410> water<00:00:27.739> but<00:00:28.130> for<00:00:28.369> now<00:00:28.489> the<00:00:28.550> the

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
it up with water but for now the the

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.030 
it up with water but for now the the
sugar<00:00:29.390> can<00:00:29.689> just<00:00:29.869> melt<00:00:30.110> and<00:00:30.529> we'll<00:00:30.770> be<00:00:30.860> able<00:00:30.919> to

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
sugar can just melt and we'll be able to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.580 
sugar can just melt and we'll be able to
easily<00:00:31.189> then<00:00:31.610> pour<00:00:32.540> it<00:00:32.630> in<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:32.989> get<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.380> nice

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
easily then pour it in and get a nice

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.710 
easily then pour it in and get a nice
even<00:00:33.890> mixture<00:00:34.160> we'll<00:00:34.910> let<00:00:35.030> this<00:00:35.180> sit<00:00:35.450> for<00:00:35.690> a

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
even mixture we'll let this sit for a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.650 
even mixture we'll let this sit for a
little<00:00:35.810> bit<00:00:36.079> here

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.260 

you<00:00:39.500> can<00:00:39.620> put<00:00:39.770> our<00:00:39.890> extract<00:00:40.400> in<00:00:40.610> and<00:00:41.030> get<00:00:41.180> it

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
you can put our extract in and get it

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.660 
you can put our extract in and get it
all<00:00:41.360> mixed<00:00:41.540> in<00:00:41.840> I<00:00:46.300> like<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.330> just<00:00:47.630> rinse<00:00:47.840> out<00:00:48.080> my

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
all mixed in I like to just rinse out my

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.030 
all mixed in I like to just rinse out my
measuring<00:00:49.670> cup<00:00:49.940> from<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.239> sink<00:00:53.410> it's<00:00:54.410> any<00:00:54.920> of

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
measuring cup from the sink it's any of

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.369 
measuring cup from the sink it's any of
the<00:00:55.129> leftover<00:00:55.550> bits<00:00:55.850> this<00:00:56.720> is<00:00:56.930> ready<00:00:57.110> to<00:00:57.260> go

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
the leftover bits this is ready to go

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.170 
the leftover bits this is ready to go
right<00:00:57.559> into<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.890> keg<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.370> then<00:00:58.879> all<00:00:59.000> we<00:00:59.150> have

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
right into the keg and then all we have

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.940 
right into the keg and then all we have
to<00:00:59.330> do<00:00:59.600> is<00:00:59.780> top<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.170> off<00:01:00.290> with<00:01:00.500> some<00:01:00.559> cold<00:01:00.860> water

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.219 

I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> take<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:09.360> mixture<00:01:09.420> here

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I'm going to take my mixture here

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.910 
I'm going to take my mixture here
and<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.130> dump<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:12.770> we're<00:01:13.770> about

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and I'm going to dump it in we're about

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
and I'm going to dump it in we're about
half<00:01:14.189> full<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.509> now

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
half full now so all we have to do now

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.270 
half full now so all we have to do now
is<00:01:16.340> top<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> rest<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:17.970> some<00:01:18.360> cold<00:01:18.570> water

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
is top the rest up with some cold water

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.300 
is top the rest up with some cold water
now<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.520> use<00:01:20.700> tap<00:01:20.970> water<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.659> use

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
now you can use tap water or you can use

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.350 
now you can use tap water or you can use
bottled<00:01:23.310> water<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.670> spring<00:01:23.970> water<00:01:24.270> or

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
bottled water or spring water or

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.450 
bottled water or spring water or
whatever<00:01:24.539> you<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.929> to<00:01:24.990> use<00:01:25.310> depending<00:01:26.310> on

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
whatever you want to use depending on

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.279 
whatever you want to use depending on
where<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> live<00:01:26.880> our<00:01:27.509> water<00:01:27.780> tastes<00:01:28.170> pretty

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
where you live our water tastes pretty

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.179 
where you live our water tastes pretty
good<00:01:28.439> here<00:01:28.830> so<00:01:29.119> we're<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.149> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
good here so we're just going to do that

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.410 
good here so we're just going to do that
you<00:01:32.189> always<00:01:32.310> want<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.579> leave<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.789> little<00:01:33.030> bit<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you always want to leave a little bit of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
you always want to leave a little bit of
headroom<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.110> keg<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> gets<00:01:35.399> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
headroom on your keg just so it gets a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.120 
headroom on your keg just so it gets a
chance<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> carbonation<00:01:38.009> in

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
chance to to get the carbonation in

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.680 
chance to to get the carbonation in
there<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.789> if<00:01:38.819> you<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.179> a<00:01:39.209> too<00:01:39.450> tight

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
there you know if you have a too tight

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.090 
there you know if you have a too tight
it's<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.679> hard<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it's going to really be hard to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
it's going to really be hard to
carbonate<00:01:41.580> so<00:01:42.149> I'll<00:01:42.299> leave<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> little<00:01:42.780> bit<00:01:42.990> at

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
carbonate so I'll leave a little bit at

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
carbonate so I'll leave a little bit at
the<00:01:43.229> top<00:01:43.440> maybe<00:01:44.069> about<00:01:44.490> two<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> three<00:01:45.600> inches

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the top maybe about two to three inches

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.210 
the top maybe about two to three inches
I'm<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.069> lock<00:01:47.250> our<00:01:47.429> keg<00:01:47.670> down<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
I'm going to lock our keg down this and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.199 
I'm going to lock our keg down this and
then<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:51.030> put<00:01:51.299> our<00:01:51.420> co2<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:54.090> some

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
then we can put our co2 on and get some

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.070 
then we can put our co2 on and get some
pressure<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.720> there<00:01:56.509> okay<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.569> what<00:01:57.929> we<00:01:58.049> want

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
pressure in there okay so what we want

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.589 
pressure in there okay so what we want
to<00:01:58.319> do<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.709> first<00:01:58.890> three<00:01:59.310> days<00:01:59.459> is<00:01:59.849> get

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
to do for the first three days is get

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.410 
to do for the first three days is get
this<00:02:00.780> pressure<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.679> about<00:02:02.599> 30<00:02:03.599> to<00:02:03.899> 40<00:02:04.289> psi

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
this pressure up to about 30 to 40 psi

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.940 
this pressure up to about 30 to 40 psi
probably<00:02:06.420> thirty<00:02:06.659> thirty<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> max

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
probably thirty thirty would be the max

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.720 
probably thirty thirty would be the max
I'd<00:02:08.160> go<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.519> this<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.019> that'll<00:02:10.019> allow<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.440> to

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
I'd go on this and that'll allow it to

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.750 
I'd go on this and that'll allow it to
get<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> lot<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.180> good<00:02:12.359> carbonation<00:02:13.049> in<00:02:13.170> there

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
get a lot of good carbonation in there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.060 
get a lot of good carbonation in there
it's<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.940> bad<00:02:15.150> idea<00:02:15.329> to<00:02:15.750> -<00:02:16.109> every<00:02:16.590> once<00:02:16.829> in<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
it's not a bad idea to - every once in a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.150 
it's not a bad idea to - every once in a
while<00:02:17.100> if<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.090> wanted<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.630> get<00:02:19.160> carbonated

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
while if you wanted to get carbonated

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.309 
while if you wanted to get carbonated
faster<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.239> could<00:02:21.390> actually<00:02:21.600> shake<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.140> keg

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
faster you could actually shake the keg

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.680 
faster you could actually shake the keg
a<00:02:22.350> little<00:02:22.650> bit<00:02:23.060> now<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.120> last<00:02:24.359> thing<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.660> need

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
a little bit now the last thing we need

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.000 
a little bit now the last thing we need
to<00:02:24.840> do<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.440> want<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> get<00:02:25.739> this<00:02:25.859> in

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
to do is we want to get this in

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.890 
to do is we want to get this in
refrigerator<00:02:26.609> the<00:02:27.180> closer<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.690> get<00:02:27.810> it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
refrigerator the closer you can get it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.410 
refrigerator the closer you can get it
to<00:02:28.049> 33<00:02:28.709> 34<00:02:29.220> degrees<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.760> faster<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.239> going

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
to 33 34 degrees the faster it's going

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.449 
to 33 34 degrees the faster it's going
to<00:02:30.510> carbonate<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.590> if<00:02:32.040> you're<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
to carbonate so if you're in the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.009 
to carbonate so if you're in the
summertime<00:02:32.970> you're<00:02:33.150> trying<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> carbonate<00:02:33.900> at

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
summertime you're trying to carbonate at

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.960 
summertime you're trying to carbonate at
7080<00:02:34.620> degrees<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:35.220> going<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.519> take<00:02:35.670> forever

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
7080 degrees it's going to take forever

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.390 
7080 degrees it's going to take forever
it's<00:02:36.389> going<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.630> take<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> couple<00:02:36.930> weeks

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
it's going to take you a couple weeks

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.699 
it's going to take you a couple weeks
hopefully<00:02:38.400> now<00:02:38.549> at<00:02:38.790> 33<00:02:39.480> 34<00:02:39.989> degrees<00:02:40.319> we'll

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
hopefully now at 33 34 degrees we'll

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.770 
hopefully now at 33 34 degrees we'll
have<00:02:40.859> a<00:02:40.889> good<00:02:41.250> carbonation<00:02:41.940> started<00:02:42.359> in<00:02:42.480> two

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
have a good carbonation started in two

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.479 
have a good carbonation started in two
to<00:02:42.900> three<00:02:42.930> days<00:02:43.260> I'm<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.190> turn<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
to three days I'm going to turn the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.360 
to three days I'm going to turn the
pressure<00:02:44.700> down<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.299> 10<00:02:45.840> psi<00:02:46.049> another<00:02:47.040> three

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
pressure down to 10 psi another three

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.879 
pressure down to 10 psi another three
days<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.880> we'll<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.209> nice<00:02:48.450> keg<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.079> cream

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
days and we'll have a nice keg of cream

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.130 
days and we'll have a nice keg of cream
soda
