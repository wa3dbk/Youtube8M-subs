20<00:01:52.170> days<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.740> sure<00:01:53.159> its<00:01:53.399> accelerated<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
20 days it's sure its accelerated you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
20 days it's sure its accelerated you
know<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> learn<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.380> morning<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
know what you learn that morning is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.310 
know what you learn that morning is
great<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.450> your<00:01:57.600> input<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.020> whole<00:01:58.170> nother

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
great but your input in a whole nother

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.100

package<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> afternoon<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.899> another<00:02:00.899> one

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
package in the afternoon and another one

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.200 
package in the afternoon and another one
the<00:02:01.229> next<00:02:01.380> morning<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.219> 24<00:02:02.820> or<00:02:03.000> 48

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the next morning you don't have 24 or 48

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.690 
the next morning you don't have 24 or 48
hours<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> let<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> soak<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.579> they

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
hours to let it soak in so I think they

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.130 
hours to let it soak in so I think they
have<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.939> little<00:02:06.180> advantage<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:06.990> even

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
have a little advantage that way even

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.940 
have a little advantage that way even
though<00:02:07.259> we're<00:02:07.350> gonna<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> accelerate

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
probably pretty solid if we can walk

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.050 
probably pretty solid if we can walk
