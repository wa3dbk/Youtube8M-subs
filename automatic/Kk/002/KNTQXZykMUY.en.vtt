00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
started our research with a baby pool

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.460 
started our research with a baby pool
here<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> studio<00:02:31.090> when<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.959> came<00:02:32.110> time<00:02:32.290> to

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
here in the studio when it came time to

here in the studio when it came time to
move<00:02:32.620> up<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:33.069> took<00:02:33.250> us<00:02:33.370> four<00:02:33.730> months<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.329> find

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
move up it took us four months to find

move up it took us four months to find
the<00:02:34.720> right<00:02:34.930> pool<00:02:35.579> we<00:02:36.579> had<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.849> try<00:02:37.060> different

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
the right pool we had to try different

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.630 
the right pool we had to try different
movements<00:02:37.989> right<00:02:38.709> under<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> water<00:02:39.310> surface

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
lot of fun creating sounds for while

Eel for the shark struggle sound we

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.720 
Eel for the shark struggle sound we
wanted<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.109> create<00:03:59.319> a<00:03:59.709> violent<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.459> turbulent

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
wanted to create a violent and turbulent

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.420 
wanted to create a violent and turbulent
underwater<00:04:01.569> experience<00:04:02.260> therefore<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:03.190> only

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
underwater experience therefore the only

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:14.119 
underwater experience therefore the only
way<00:04:03.579> to<00:04:03.639> do<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:03.819> was<00:04:04.540> to

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.650 

so<00:04:15.129> the<00:04:15.250> sharp<00:04:15.519> punching<00:04:15.939> sound<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.419> actually

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
so the sharp punching sound is actually

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.170 
so the sharp punching sound is actually

when<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.440> came<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.770> creating<00:04:26.889> sounds<00:04:27.759> for<00:04:27.940> a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
when it came to creating sounds for a

when it came to creating sounds for a

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
while we couldn't find anybody that had

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.460 
while we couldn't find anybody that had
a<00:04:30.250> pet<00:04:30.490> whale<00:04:30.759> so<00:04:31.150> we<00:04:31.270> had<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:31.600> use<00:04:31.750> objects<00:04:32.380> to

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
a pet whale so we had to use objects to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.650 
a pet whale so we had to use objects to
try<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:32.949> move<00:04:33.100> large<00:04:33.460> amounts<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:34.060> water<00:04:34.270> that

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
try and move large amounts of water that

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.689 
try and move large amounts of water that
you<00:04:35.139> would<00:04:35.470> expect<00:04:35.919> would<00:04:36.160> happen<00:04:36.220> when<00:04:36.669> a

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
you would expect would happen when a

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:46.379 
you would expect would happen when a
whale<00:04:37.030> moves<00:04:37.360> through<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.690> ocean<00:04:44.970> so<00:04:45.970> for<00:04:46.270> the

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
whale moves through the ocean so for the

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.629 
whale moves through the ocean so for the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
shipping held on to the water but there

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.469 
shipping held on to the water but there
was<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.800> massive<00:04:54.070> thing<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.759> lot<00:04:55.240> of

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
was a massive thing of so a lot of

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.260 
was a massive thing of so a lot of
explosions<00:04:56.169> in<00:04:56.349> 3<00:04:57.130> give<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.610> punch<00:04:57.970> and

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
explosions in 3 give it a punch and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.040 
explosions in 3 give it a punch and
massiveness<00:04:58.870> they<00:04:59.169> be<00:04:59.229> looking<00:04:59.650> for

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
massiveness they be looking for

massiveness they be looking for
apart<00:05:02.050> from<00:05:02.110> underwater<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:03.340> Neopost<00:05:03.729> was<00:05:04.030> a

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
apart from underwater the Neopost was a

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.360 
apart from underwater the Neopost was a
huge<00:05:04.509> challenge<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.710> challenge<00:05:05.919> this<00:05:06.160> time

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
huge challenge the challenge this time

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.790 
huge challenge the challenge this time
around<00:05:06.610> was<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.940> design<00:05:07.090> our<00:05:07.570> system<00:05:08.229> for<00:05:08.560> real

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
around was to design our system for real

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.640 
around was to design our system for real
glass<00:05:09.300> for<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.479> fort<00:05:10.780> our<00:05:11.050> fragments

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
glass for the fort our fragments

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.469 
glass for the fort our fragments
depending<00:05:12.310> on<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.460> size<00:05:12.669> I<00:05:12.909> made<00:05:13.090> sure<00:05:13.270> that

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
depending on the size I made sure that

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.570 
depending on the size I made sure that
the<00:05:13.599> fragment<00:05:13.990> just<00:05:14.199> hit<00:05:14.470> with<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.099> different

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
the fragment just hit with a different

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.149 
the fragment just hit with a different
sound<00:05:15.820> so<00:05:16.630> for<00:05:17.260> example<00:05:17.620> there's<00:05:17.770> different

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
sound so for example there's different

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.520 
sound so for example there's different
sounds<00:05:18.490> for<00:05:18.789> the<00:05:18.849> fragment<00:05:19.510> hitting<00:05:19.720> sand

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
sounds for the fragment hitting sand

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.290 
sounds for the fragment hitting sand
rock<00:05:21.039> wood<00:05:21.789> and<00:05:22.180> also<00:05:22.570> water<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:24.090> what<00:05:25.090> we

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
rock wood and also water and what we

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.529 
rock wood and also water and what we
also<00:05:25.419> do<00:05:25.659> is<00:05:25.690> real<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.380> defy<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:28.270> impact

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
also do is real and defy the impact

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.719 
also do is real and defy the impact
sounds<00:05:28.930> are<00:05:29.050> going<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:29.740> bielski<00:05:30.159> of<00:05:30.580> the
