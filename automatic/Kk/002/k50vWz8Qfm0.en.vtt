00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
not the greatest player that you can get

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.870 
not the greatest player that you can get
from<00:03:09.170> one<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.410> these<00:03:09.500> one<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:09.950> these<00:03:10.130> black

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
balls but it doesn't matter

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.229 
balls but it doesn't matter
