Boneknapper<00:01:04.229> Boneknapper<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.460> pretty<00:01:05.780> strong

Boneknapper Boneknapper is pretty strong

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.770 
Boneknapper Boneknapper is pretty strong
I'm<00:01:08.040> thinking<00:01:08.610> debating<00:01:09.090> should<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.360> use<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
I'm thinking debating should we use the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.050 
I'm thinking debating should we use the
Boneknapper<00:01:09.990> or<00:01:10.439> not<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.909> an

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
Boneknapper or not all right we have an

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.090 
Boneknapper or not all right we have an
excellent<00:01:12.479> chance<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:13.200> victory<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.920> now

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
excellent chance of victory right now

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.990 
excellent chance of victory right now
apparently<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.650> actually<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.880> have

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
apparently so actually if we have

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149 
apparently so actually if we have
excellent<00:01:18.420> chance<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.229> means<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
excellent chance that means that I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.460 
excellent chance that means that I
should<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.270> use<00:01:21.540> some<00:01:21.750> weaker<00:01:22.140> level

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
should just use some weaker level

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.340 
should just use some weaker level
dragons<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.790> actually<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.570> longer

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350

Titan video for a very long time and
luckily<00:05:02.159> we're<00:05:02.490> successful<00:05:02.969> at<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.569> look<00:05:03.719> at

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
difference between hookfang and hookfang

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.670

Titan<00:05:11.279> they<00:05:11.969> look<00:05:12.180> almost<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.229> same<00:05:13.289> of

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
Titan they look almost the same of

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.679 
Titan they look almost the same of

hookfang Titan we turned this into a

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.230 
hookfang Titan we turned this into a
Titan<00:05:22.229> video<00:05:22.680> because<00:05:22.949> we<00:05:23.099> died<00:05:23.310> well<00:05:24.090> that

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240

hookfang I think he looks bigger let's
just<00:05:29.729> put<00:05:29.849> them<00:05:29.939> down<00:05:29.969> for<00:05:30.419> a<00:05:30.840> while<00:05:30.990> for<00:05:31.650> a

minute
so<00:05:32.610> there's<00:05:32.819> hookfang<00:05:33.270> Titan<00:05:33.779> I'm<00:05:34.469> not<00:05:34.710> sure

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
so there's hookfang Titan I'm not sure

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.860 
so there's hookfang Titan I'm not sure
if<00:05:35.069> there's<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.669> much<00:05:35.909> of<00:05:36.089> a<00:05:36.120> difference<00:05:36.300> for

if there's that much of a difference for
you<00:05:37.020> but<00:05:37.860> that's<00:05:37.979> hookfang<00:05:38.490> Titan<00:05:38.969> luckily<00:05:39.389> we

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
you but that's hookfang Titan luckily we

nightmare and the hookfang you know this
one<00:05:54.120> looks<00:05:54.330> so<00:05:54.419> much<00:05:54.690> cooler<00:05:54.960> than<00:05:55.139> hookfang

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
one looks so much cooler than hookfang

alright 96 let's just remember that 122

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.420 
alright 96 let's just remember that 122
I<00:06:12.360> guess<00:06:12.750> he's<00:06:12.960> stronger<00:06:13.289> right<00:06:13.620> how<00:06:14.339> much

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
I guess he's stronger right how much

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.420 
I guess he's stronger right how much
health<00:06:14.699> is<00:06:14.879> yeah<00:06:15.029> oh<00:06:15.620> yeah<00:06:16.620> where<00:06:16.979> do<00:06:17.099> we<00:06:17.250> look

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
health is yeah oh yeah where do we look

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.129 
health is yeah oh yeah where do we look
at<00:06:17.639> the<00:06:17.789> health<00:06:18.060> of<00:06:18.449> these<00:06:18.629> things

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
at the health of these things

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.740 
at the health of these things
anyways<00:06:19.889> that's<00:06:20.219> pretty<00:06:20.729> much<00:06:21.000> it<00:06:21.389> I<00:06:21.569> mean

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
anyways that's pretty much it I mean

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.290 
anyways that's pretty much it I mean
there's<00:06:22.020> nothing<00:06:22.349> to<00:06:22.650> discuss<00:06:23.099> here<00:06:23.610> we

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
there's nothing to discuss here we

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.629 
there's nothing to discuss here we
failed<00:06:24.659> on<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.139> battle<00:06:25.830> so<00:06:26.039> we<00:06:26.069> had<00:06:26.310> to<00:06:26.430> turn

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
failed on the battle so we had to turn

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.209 
failed on the battle so we had to turn
it<00:06:26.849> in<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.180> Titan<00:06:27.779> video<00:06:28.139> and<00:06:28.740> I<00:06:28.800> guess<00:06:29.009> that's

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:29.219 
it in the Titan video and I guess that's

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:31.339 
it in the Titan video and I guess that's
what<00:06:29.400> it<00:06:29.520> is<00:06:29.639> I<00:06:29.669> mean<00:06:30.120> it's<00:06:30.479> the<00:06:30.839> hookfang

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
what it is I mean it's the hookfang

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.249 
what it is I mean it's the hookfang
Titan<00:06:31.919> video<00:06:32.310> we<00:06:32.939> were<00:06:33.060> lucky<00:06:33.360> enough<00:06:33.569> to<00:06:34.020> turn

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
Titan video we were lucky enough to turn
