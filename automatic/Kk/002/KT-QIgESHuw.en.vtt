sometimes that is his downfall that's

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.930 
sometimes that is his downfall that's
the<00:04:44.930> way<00:04:45.110> Rex<00:04:45.440> has<00:04:46.039> sometimes<00:04:46.310> been<00:04:46.580> able<00:04:46.820> to

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
the way Rex has sometimes been able to

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.240 
the way Rex has sometimes been able to
defeat<00:04:47.210> him<00:04:47.270> is<00:04:47.539> by<00:04:48.169> his<00:04:48.410> arrogance<00:04:49.180> but<00:04:50.180> uh

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
defeat him is by his arrogance but uh

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.680 
defeat him is by his arrogance but uh
when<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.910> take<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.690> character<00:04:54.229> like<00:04:54.710> this<00:04:54.979> and

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
when you take a character like this and

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.870 
when you take a character like this and
a<00:04:56.690> character<00:04:57.200> that<00:04:57.320> knows<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:58.099> hero<00:04:58.490> very

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
a character that knows the hero very

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.070 
a character that knows the hero very
well

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
well

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.350 
well
that<00:05:00.860> makes<00:05:01.159> them<00:05:01.400> very<00:05:01.580> dangerous<00:05:02.150> in<00:05:02.330> my

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
that makes them very dangerous in my

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.200 
that makes them very dangerous in my
opinion<00:05:02.870> because<00:05:03.620> he<00:05:03.860> knows<00:05:04.099> Rex<00:05:04.490> very<00:05:05.000> well

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
opinion because he knows Rex very well

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.929 
opinion because he knows Rex very well
he<00:05:05.419> knows<00:05:05.629> him<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.259> he's<00:05:06.860> very<00:05:06.949> in<00:05:07.280> tune<00:05:07.550> with

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:07.939 
he knows him and he's very in tune with

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.339 
he knows him and he's very in tune with
nanites<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:09.080> things<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.039> that<00:05:10.099> so<00:05:11.349> then

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
nanites and things like that so then

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.860 
nanites and things like that so then
Christ<00:05:12.620> is<00:05:12.740> definitely<00:05:13.189> one<00:05:13.490> opponent<00:05:14.240> take

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
Christ is definitely one opponent take
