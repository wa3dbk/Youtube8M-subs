heat for you go to 4 that's pretty
respectable<00:02:58.769> I'm<00:02:59.130> actually<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.700> give

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
respectable I'm actually going to give

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.820 
respectable I'm actually going to give
it<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.150> 3<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.260> needs<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> little

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
it a 3 I think it needs to be a little

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.370 
it a 3 I think it needs to be a little
bit<00:03:01.980> hotter<00:03:02.900> especially<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.200> ghost

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
bit hotter especially if it's a ghost

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.490 
bit hotter especially if it's a ghost
pepper<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:06.180> goes<00:03:06.390> pepper<00:03:06.600> salsa<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.410> we

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
pepper that goes pepper salsa that we

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.900 
pepper that goes pepper salsa that we
had<00:03:08.269> miss<00:03:09.269> Renfro<00:03:09.630> salsa<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:11.100> truly<00:03:11.880> is

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
had miss Renfro salsa now that truly is

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.840 
had miss Renfro salsa now that truly is
ghost<00:03:12.600> pepper<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.350> has<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.400> taste<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.760> a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
ghost pepper this has the taste of a

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.069 
ghost pepper this has the taste of a
ghost<00:03:15.000> pepper<00:03:15.209> but<00:03:15.600> it's<00:03:15.720> not<00:03:15.780> as

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
ghost pepper but it's not as

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.660 
ghost pepper but it's not as
overpowering<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.040> that's<00:03:17.430> not<00:03:17.549> necessarily

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
overpowering but that's not necessarily

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.090 
overpowering but that's not necessarily
a<00:03:18.209> bad<00:03:18.329> thing<00:03:18.650> what<00:03:19.650> would<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.860> give<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.040> for

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
a bad thing what would you give it for

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.080 
a bad thing what would you give it for
flavor<00:03:22.310> 33<00:03:23.690> uh<00:03:24.690> yeah<00:03:25.290> 3<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:25.920> pretty<00:03:26.100> good<00:03:26.190> i'm

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
flavor 33 uh yeah 3 is pretty good i'm

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.600 
flavor 33 uh yeah 3 is pretty good i'm
going<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.329> give<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.540> one<00:03:27.720> more<00:03:27.750> try<00:03:28.549> just<00:03:29.549> to

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
going to give this one more try just to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:40.520 
going to give this one more try just to
give<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.820> second<00:03:30.230> second<00:03:31.230> opinion

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.470 

yeah<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.800> think<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.280> three<00:03:42.520> is<00:03:42.730> pretty<00:03:43.330> accurate

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
yeah I think a three is pretty accurate

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.400 
yeah I think a three is pretty accurate
for<00:03:43.960> the<00:03:44.110> flavor<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.780> kind<00:03:46.990> of<00:03:47.020> it's<00:03:47.200> good

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
for the flavor so it's kind of it's good

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.320 
for the flavor so it's kind of it's good
but<00:03:48.070> it's<00:03:48.130> not<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.520> the<00:03:48.610> greatest<00:03:48.820> barbecue

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
but it's not like the greatest barbecue

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.660 
but it's not like the greatest barbecue
sauce<00:03:49.510> I've<00:03:49.720> ever<00:03:49.840> tasted<00:03:50.050> I<00:03:50.500> certainly<00:03:51.430> like

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
sauce I've ever tasted I certainly like

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.450 
sauce I've ever tasted I certainly like
other<00:03:52.060> barbecue<00:03:52.570> sauces<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.250> pretty

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
other barbecue sauces this is pretty

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.160 
other barbecue sauces this is pretty
good<00:03:54.760> but<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.660> doesn't<00:03:56.110> quite<00:03:56.290> have<00:03:56.680> that

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
good but it it doesn't quite have that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.350 
good but it it doesn't quite have that
like<00:03:59.170> super<00:03:59.680> sweet<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.700> super<00:04:00.880> sweet<00:04:01.150> like

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
like super sweet not super sweet like

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.690

that<00:04:01.570> barbecue<00:04:02.200> tastes<00:04:02.470> yeah<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.250> does<00:04:03.430> it's

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
that barbecue tastes yeah it does it's

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.580 
that barbecue tastes yeah it does it's
like<00:04:03.880> it's<00:04:04.150> like<00:04:04.270> almost<00:04:04.660> there<00:04:05.260> but<00:04:05.440> it's<00:04:05.560> not

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
like it's like almost there but it's not

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.920 
like it's like almost there but it's not
quite<00:04:05.830> there<00:04:06.130> but<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.880> definitely<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> solid

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
quite there but it definitely is a solid

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.880 
quite there but it definitely is a solid
