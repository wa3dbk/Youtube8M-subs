an OLED TV emits light resulting in an
amazing<00:00:14.910> contrast<00:00:15.450> ratio<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.170> color

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
amazing contrast ratio and color

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.330 
amazing contrast ratio and color
expression<00:00:23.150> richer<00:00:24.150> color<00:00:25.099> contrast<00:00:26.099> was

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
expression richer color contrast was

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.400 
expression richer color contrast was
great<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.880> definitely<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.080> colors

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
great but definitely the the colors

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.250 
great but definitely the the colors
popped<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.949> much<00:00:29.130> more<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> OLED<00:00:30.119> yeah<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
popped a much more of the OLED yeah the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.160 
popped a much more of the OLED yeah the
OLED<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.710> superior<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.489> every<00:00:32.579> way<00:00:32.730> any<00:00:33.719> way

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
OLED was superior in every way any way

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.860 
OLED was superior in every way any way
that<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.469> could<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.219> superior

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
that I could think of it was superior

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.690 
that I could think of it was superior
actually<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.200> most<00:00:37.559> impressed<00:00:38.040> about<00:00:38.309> how

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
actually I was most impressed about how

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.780 
actually I was most impressed about how
thin<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.829> compared<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> was

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

you know as thin as a as a self
unbelievable<00:00:49.789> looking<00:00:50.239> at<00:00:50.360> it<00:00:50.480> next<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:51.020> its

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
unbelievable looking at it next to its

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.979 
unbelievable looking at it next to its
competitors<00:00:51.829> it<00:00:52.489> was<00:00:52.670> easy<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.149> see<00:00:53.329> that<00:00:53.660> you

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
competitors it was easy to see that you

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.829 
competitors it was easy to see that you
can<00:00:54.710> definitely<00:00:54.860> notice<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.820> achieves<00:00:56.690> a

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
can definitely notice that it achieves a

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.380 
can definitely notice that it achieves a
true<00:00:57.110> black<00:00:57.379> color<00:00:57.710> versus<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.760> competitor

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
true black color versus the competitor

and<00:00:59.660> I<00:01:00.350> don't<00:01:00.980> know<00:01:01.070> I<00:01:01.100> can't<00:01:01.730> imagine<00:01:01.820> having

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
and I don't know I can't imagine having

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.660 
and I don't know I can't imagine having
it<00:01:02.510> with<00:01:02.660> another<00:01:02.960> TV<00:01:03.199> besides<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:03.860> because

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
it with another TV besides that because

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.430 
it with another TV besides that because
you<00:01:04.790> want<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.119> watch<00:01:05.300> a<00:01:05.509> movie<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.200> dark

you want to watch a movie in a dark
atmosphere<00:01:06.710> usually<00:01:07.430> on<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.420> home<00:01:08.659> theater

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.840 
atmosphere usually on a home theater
type<00:01:09.200> atmosphere<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.100> of<00:01:10.220> course<00:01:10.460> if<00:01:10.670> there's

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
type atmosphere so of course if there's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.260 
type atmosphere so of course if there's
leakage<00:01:11.299> that's<00:01:11.869> annoying<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:13.190> moves<00:01:14.149> a

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
leakage that's annoying and it moves a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.999 
leakage that's annoying and it moves a
picture<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.140> with<00:01:15.290> all<00:01:15.409> that<00:01:15.440> there's<00:01:15.710> no<00:01:15.830> bad

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
picture so with all that there's no bad

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.620 
picture so with all that there's no bad
viewing<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.430> know<00:01:16.490> we<00:01:16.700> get<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.210> or<00:01:17.450> it's

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
of the screen I can stand at the edge it

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.940 
of the screen I can stand at the edge it
looks<00:01:23.929> the<00:01:24.020> same<00:01:24.170> as<00:01:24.380> if<00:01:24.560> you're<00:01:24.679> standing

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
looks the same as if you're standing

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
right in the middle with the LEDs it's

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.169 
right in the middle with the LEDs it's
not<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:27.979> looks<00:01:28.130> really<00:01:28.369> washed<00:01:28.610> out<00:01:28.820> if<00:01:29.060> you're

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
not it looks really washed out if you're

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:30.999 
not it looks really washed out if you're
from<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.509> side<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.560> just<00:01:30.590> looks<00:01:30.890> really

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
from the side and it just looks really

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.330 
from the side and it just looks really
terrible<00:01:31.280> by<00:01:31.970> comparison
