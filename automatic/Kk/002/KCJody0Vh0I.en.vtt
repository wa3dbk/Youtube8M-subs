00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 one 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.720
 well today we are willing to work 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.849
 the second day back triceps and back 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.700
 let's do four exercises and three 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.740
 of triceps back is a muscle group 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.449
 very large very large with different 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 muscle groups then you have to give it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.490
 more variety 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.439
 well prepared let's go let's go there 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.890
 let's start with a very 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.570
 basic is worth dominated there will be people who do not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.239
 can at first do dominated 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.400
 we will try to make a pulley ahead 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.680
 to the chest by open grip but in 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.629
 how much can we do at least 34 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.610
 repetitions we climb to the chin- ups 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.070
 which is the only way to get strength 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.890
 to do this exercise go up sergio is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.199
 an exercise that is handled weight 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.800
 body of each then it is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.899
 complicated we were up we played the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.239
 bar with the chin and stretch 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.610
 completely back we work the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.970
 dorsals for amplitude 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.440
 and it's a very basic exercise very well 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 sergio up we always stretch butt 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.820
 wide and complete routes we stretch 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 the arms completely and we climb so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 up as we can the second exercise 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.790
 What are we going to do? 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.680
 looks at the beginning for a little 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.870
 for expansion and so let's make a 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 flange mound low pulley more for the 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.060
 thickness and density of back we go there 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.110
 to sergio we position ourselves worth the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.940
 knees almost stretched ballet 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.150
 pulling chest up with we bring all the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.830
 school without lying down behind the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.210
 back has to be at right angles 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.080
 with the floor 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.510
 here very well we stretch the dorsal and with 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.090
 we bring our back completely here the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.070
 back completely straight and not 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.060
 pass here ok 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.560
 we press here there and stretch all 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.409
 dorsal 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.090
 very well let's continue with another 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.399
 Equal rowing exercise for density 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.340
 and thickness the dumbbell oar in this 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.599
 case let's go for the sergio throw it's about 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.760
 to keep your back completely 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:17.519
 straight to take the dumbbell to the hip 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.680
 and contract to completely stretch the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.260
 dorsal and hip 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.409
 with we bring here with we bring strong very 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.110
 well with bring and stretch 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.200
 completely the dorsal we go up with 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.849
 we bring and stretch it is now for 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.160
 finalize what we are going to do is a 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.260
 pulley back never 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.450
 above all we will work as we have 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.200
 said before for intermediates of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.090
 beginners between 8 and 12 repetitions 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.610
 this is the exercise to finish we're going to 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.060
 work between 12 and 15 repetitions and 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.830
 It's a lot that you connect the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.320
 mind with the muscle and isolate 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.690
 Muscle perfectly 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.670
 for there the jump stretches completely 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.190
 and bring me here 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.310
 stretches full travel and we tighten 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.390
 here do not raise my shoulders apriete me 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.020
 here 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.020
 okay 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.140
 it's about keeping your back straight and 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.710
 do not bend the abdominal always 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.480
 chest up and rib cage raised 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.510
 very well we have rested a 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.160
 minute a few minutes after training 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.840
 back and now we 're going to work 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.760
 the triceps 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.590
 we will work between 8 and 12 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.870
 repetitions let's make the classic the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.430
 triceps pulley shot to start we have 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.819
 warmed up a little bit let's find 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.819
 sergio a 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.670
 it's about keeping your elbows very 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.610
 glued to the body stretch completely 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.060
 the arms and 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.620
 contracts the triceps butt we keep 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.620
 a constant speed of movement 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.170
 okay 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.260
 here it contracts very well but they see 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.270
 we follow the French pre is an exercise 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.950
 very basic for triz is also very 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.350
 dangerous to the elbows why 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.850
 we left in second place to not be 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.920
 exhausted but having heated the 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.810
 triceps articulation we keep the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.780
 elbows always together that we do not know 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.640
 separate we go down to the forehead and 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.740
 we completely insert the triceps 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.740
 when we stretch our arms 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.479
 we will always work between 3 and 4 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.190
 series per exercise depends on the group 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.750
 how to play that we are working and the 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.150
 emphasis that we want to make of each 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.280
 exercise ok let's continue with the pre 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.289
 French sitting variety of sitting 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.080
 what you do is that we work more 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.840
 upper part of the triceps 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.889
 very important and visually very 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.080
 Elegant 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.280
 come on sergio let's go there it's about 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.259
 Do not detach excessively the elbows 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.150
 up here and nail completely 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:03.940
 Hold me a little upstairs we nail 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.860
 the triceps here here 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.969
 but but very well 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.549
 we keep tightening 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.829
 the one of sergio me to good we have finished 

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:18.519
 our second day in our routine 

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:20.969
 training for intermediates we have 

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:23.819
 made back triceps 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:27.180
 good above all to put a lot of emphasis 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:29.220
 which is very important 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.720
 and start training to learn to 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.860
 train correctly to avoid 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.080
 future vices of partial repetitions 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.870
 always maximum routes and especially 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.060
 make the emphasis and the emphasis on knowing 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.919
 and isolate zones and groups 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.449
 muscle we have and we are 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.120
 working at that time is super 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.560
 important for beginners good 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.820
 guys see you next day and 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.820
 we will make legs and biceps ok a greeting 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.130
