second one as you can see here adds one
more<00:04:08.150> round<00:04:08.480> but<00:04:09.320> also<00:04:09.470> as<00:04:09.770> this<00:04:10.010> giant<00:04:10.540> glob

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
more round but also as this giant glob

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.230 
more round but also as this giant glob
on<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.930> bottom<00:04:12.400> now<00:04:13.400> obviously<00:04:13.940> this<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:14.150> a

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
on the bottom now obviously this is a

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.760 
on the bottom now obviously this is a
concealed<00:04:14.660> carry<00:04:14.930> gun<00:04:14.990> so<00:04:15.290> we<00:04:15.410> don't<00:04:15.560> want

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
concealed carry gun so we don't want

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.280 
concealed carry gun so we don't want
giant<00:04:16.250> classic<00:04:16.820> globs<00:04:17.090> on<00:04:17.270> the<00:04:17.390> bottom<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.260> I

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
giant classic globs on the bottom so I

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.630 
giant classic globs on the bottom so I
would<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.830> would<00:04:19.580> much<00:04:19.760> prefer

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
would I would much prefer

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.969 
would I would much prefer

the<00:04:40.180> accuracy<00:04:40.840> range<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.409> got<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.740> car<00:04:41.979> PM<00:04:42.460> 40

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:42.939 
the accuracy range I got the car PM 40

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.749 
the accuracy range I got the car PM 40
and<00:04:43.180> I'll<00:04:43.810> be<00:04:43.900> shooting<00:04:44.229> from<00:04:44.379> 7<00:04:45.219> yards<00:04:45.550> about

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
and I'll be shooting from 7 yards about

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.029 
and I'll be shooting from 7 yards about
21<00:04:46.210> feet<00:04:46.509> and<00:04:46.810> as<00:04:47.379> you<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.650> tell<00:04:47.800> I'll<00:04:47.949> be

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
21 feet and as you can tell I'll be

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.559 
21 feet and as you can tell I'll be
shooting<00:04:48.219> from<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.669> ground<00:04:48.939> using<00:04:49.360> my<00:04:49.509> knee

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
as kind of a bench rest so we can best

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.089 
as kind of a bench rest so we can best
gauge<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.810> accuracy<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.500> gun<00:04:53.680> not<00:04:53.919> so

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
gauge the accuracy of the gun not so

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:37.619 
gauge the accuracy of the gun not so
much<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.490> axe<00:04:54.639> or<00:04:54.849> you<00:04:54.969> mean<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:55.870> here<00:04:56.199> we<00:04:56.289> go

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.920 
doesn't do a good job actuated the peg
release<00:06:20.569> but<00:06:21.880> if<00:06:22.880> I<00:06:23.000> was<00:06:23.180> going<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.389> get<00:06:23.569> a<00:06:23.599> car

release but if I was going to get a car

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.100 
release but if I was going to get a car
I<00:06:24.229> would<00:06:24.409> probably<00:06:24.830> get<00:06:25.099> the<00:06:25.250> PM<00:06:25.550> 45<00:06:26.060> since<00:06:26.599> the

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
I would probably get the PM 45 since the

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.439 
I would probably get the PM 45 since the
PM<00:06:27.349> 40<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:27.830> recoil<00:06:28.219> is<00:06:28.400> the<00:06:28.729> felt<00:06:28.940> recoil<00:06:29.000> is

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
PM 40 the recoil is the felt recoil is

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.450 
PM 40 the recoil is the felt recoil is
very<00:06:29.509> similar<00:06:29.990> it's<00:06:30.289> a<00:06:30.349> pretty<00:06:30.590> sharp<00:06:30.889> little

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
very similar it's a pretty sharp little

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.740 
very similar it's a pretty sharp little
Rico<00:06:31.789> so<00:06:31.849> you<00:06:32.090> might<00:06:32.240> as<00:06:32.330> well<00:06:32.360> just<00:06:32.599> be

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
Rico so you might as well just be

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.370 
Rico so you might as well just be
shooting<00:06:32.900> a<00:06:33.050> 45<00:06:33.500> Auto<00:06:34.150> and<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.389> forty<00:06:35.630> five<00:06:35.750> PM

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
shooting a 45 Auto and the forty five PM

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.469 
shooting a 45 Auto and the forty five PM
45<00:06:36.740> is<00:06:36.949> not<00:06:37.099> that<00:06:37.340> much<00:06:37.460> bigger<00:06:37.729> than<00:06:37.969> this<00:06:38.150> PM

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
45 is not that much bigger than this PM

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.170 
45 is not that much bigger than this PM
40<00:06:39.370> so<00:06:40.370> that<00:06:40.520> would<00:06:40.639> be<00:06:40.759> my<00:06:40.909> main

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
40 so that would be my main
