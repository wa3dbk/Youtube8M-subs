00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.599
 again changing phil nÃ© 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.000
 so i put my little pin 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.950
 wire I'm not going to use and people look at it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.230
 now you need to pay close attention 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.310
 every career 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 You see we 're increasing. 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.160
 a point before a point after the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.790
 central points then we did five 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 rates in this career and we 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.860
 1,016 toothpicks in this career and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.450
 we have increased 1,107 toothpicks in this career 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.670
 and increased one point 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.289
 we made eight toothpicks in this career and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.289
 we increased one point 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:49.230
 Of course now we want 9 toothpicks and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.359
 we will increase one point in the next 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.989
 and we will increase one point and 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.699
 so successively until you reach 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.510
 15 rows 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.269
 we have here a two three four five 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.000
 We're coming to the party we need. 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.880
 perform 10 sheep to reach the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.640
 ideal number for the size of our 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.700
 purse so let's leave, always doing 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.899
 the same amount of increases two 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.290
 every race up to our 15th 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.159
 career I've reached 16th career here 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.530
 people 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.140
 we have already made all the increases that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.829
 it was necessary at this time you 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.610
 they only worked the points sticks 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.390
 you already know in some increase 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:45.420
 Okay, so it's straight and straight working. 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.579
 you see increases you can have 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.979
 held a round of his career 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.950
 sales of a basket career 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.729
 you just have to have a little detail to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.210
 be verified that it is the following in your 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.280
 needle you should have here all 43 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.200
 points then count the amount of 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.409
 points before leaving by performing the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.110
 career back 43 points on needle in 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.920
 16th career this means that you 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.740
 realized the increases here in the way 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.450
 okay okay so take it all 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.760
 world already knows 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.870
 She only got two passes. 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.730
 2 and so on until the end of the 16th 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.920
 jewelery career 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.280
 though I then closed my 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.750
 Sixteenth, I'm going to the 17th people. 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.489
 look at one detail you need 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.819
 Static now that moment that is 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:47.590
 the following looks from increase already 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:51.489
 was made now we will work for 25 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.459
 careers in this way 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.599
 only the sticks points do not have 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.030
 increase now are 25 rows 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.840
 without jewelry increases 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.750
 we did the first 24 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.510
 Careers without increases I 'm here 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.489
 playing with the threads and everything doing a 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.840
 of one card and another of another a game 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.849
 to another j 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.889
 if you are using a thigh 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.420
 indirect raps although do not think two 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.840
 times and it 's fine and if you have 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.769
 working more colors, it's okay going 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.329
 intercalating but range 25 rows without 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:34.090
 so make some jewelry increases then 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.349
 I'm going to do 25 careers and already 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.919
 see you again 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.900
 ok after the first 15 careers that 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:44.290
 were the increasing careers 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.560
 after 25 careers in which we 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.930
 we work straight and straight without increase 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.359
 some simply performing the exchange of 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.690
 color right 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:58.660
 Now is the time for us to do the 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.040
 15 final careers that are careers 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:06.549
 dimensions where we will get the same 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.909
 15 results in initial row where 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:13.269
 We really want to do this in this 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:16.530
 moment that is the first career of 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:20.409
 decreases were 15 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.740
 simply fill the needle or 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:26.380
 I'll learn my wire here . 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.419
 different color, I'm seeing it here already 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.000
 alternating and I'll continue 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.760
 working my toothpick usually in the 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.060
 Gone career that is at the moment 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.389
 that I am filling 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.669
 my needle at this moment you do not 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.910
 increased because there is more to 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.280
 increase and did not reduce anything to the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.510
 which will be reduced will be in the 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.910
 career back 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.889
 Okay, I'll go and fill it, and I'll 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.280
 I 'm going back here to show a decrease to 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.280
 you
