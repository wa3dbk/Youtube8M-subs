00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.430
 3 649 with 2 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.320
 72 coins 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.120
 most people would have 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.219
 used the calculator to solve 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.469
 this account but samir and run it mode one 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.600
 and of 11 and 10 years old he has not needed more 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.430
 that his mind for something are the champions 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.260
 of mental calculation what started as 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.850
 something to improve the attention of the 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.760
 children has become a game with 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.760
 great rewards if you practice 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.910
 daily 510 minutes I will take you to the 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.980
 world championships and then every year I 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.629
 I have made my promise and you have been practiced and 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.059
 we have gone and the truth is that they have won 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.899
 This has motivated them more and continue 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.840
 practicing have followed and so 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.130
 they also travel and mystical they are only 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.080
 opens more the mind and 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.080
 and always study has to be 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.130
 fun in a very funny way 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.320
 different the two brothers carry 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.450
 practicing 15 minutes a day for 4 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.190
 years all kinds of accounts like this has 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.470
 become my champion and champion of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.270
 world respectively the abacus is the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.940
 favorite instrument of samir and ronny 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.710
 to perform all calculations 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.870
 they develop the right hemisphere josh and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.760
 this is visualizing the abacus they 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.030
 they started to calculate with the abacus that is 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.680
 an ancient instrument steal little 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.560
 little while calculating can 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.850
 visualize this in your head 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.610
 visualizing developing the hemisphere 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.630
 right that is more imaginative 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.060
 more and increase concentration and everything and 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.100
 the truth that I have seen much improvement in 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.810
 both in this sense although the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.430
 practice and the study both ago 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.190
 children are clear that not everyone 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.320
 can do calculations like them and with 15 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.320
 adriÃ¡n minutes 34 years I could take 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.890
 I would miss samir and ronnie is have 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.420
 demonstrated all its potential in the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.400
 inauguration of the school hosts of 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.990
 mental development many children have 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.610
 observed the show dreaming in 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.610
 become champions of calculation
