00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.450
 processed 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.160
 the protection of nature the gentle 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.810
 dealing with our resources and not 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.610
 Lastly, the environmentally friendly mobility 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.980
 of people and goods 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.990
 these are the central topics and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.630
 challenges with which the 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.020
 environmental center of the german railways since 20 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.570
 years and we are more active 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.660
 develop trendsetters in things environmental 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.930
 concepts and programs for one 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.930
 environmentally friendly company 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.260
 some would rather know us more than 20 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.120
 years we have the theme of environmental protection 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.030
 makes obama forum I believe the whole 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.590
 time accompanied and developed together 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.230
 what was the topic of environmental protection? 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.690
 the reform of the railway is the topic 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.240
 Environmental protection as such was perhaps 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.950
 not the big topic but the track 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.150
 always had problems with certain 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.950
 Today's topics are environmental protection 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.070
 First and foremost, what waste or 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.930
 and sewage plants in had it not 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.490
 everything is fine and then we have 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.600
 of course always a big topic 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.200
 The noise reduction was therefore from 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.150
 beginning with an important topic it system 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.490
 help for ten years seemed 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.950
 to calculate traffic noise and then to 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.010
 mitigate and the introduction of 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.210
 environmental management systems 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.140
 energy saving programs disposal 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.210
 concepts of green products ramzi motifs 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.860
 with particle filters are just a few 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.620
 the measures we take in the group 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.459
 many decisions have taken us forward 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 were discussed controversially 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.760
 can you still remember the first one 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.300
 environmental report remind native with how 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.670
 have made a lot of effort with that 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.200
 I think that one with the ag too 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.640
 we have an environmental report right away 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.880
 not possible we had to go first 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.160
 to process all the data and ours 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.459
 preparation of our programs something 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.950
 secure and I had the honor of the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.019
 together with mr döring with the woman 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.550
 merkel as environment minister in the 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.030
 to introduce the press that was then 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.700
 big event 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.830
 our experts work from berlin and 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.900
 frankfurt out constantly at the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.770
 Environmental advantage of the company 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.319
 expand 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.470
 Here are the environmental goals of DB for 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.200
 We offer the year 2020 developed 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.090
 comprehensive courses in environmental protection and 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.590
 support all employees in the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.110
 implementation of environmental tasks so to 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.110
 for example in kirchmöser in brandenburg 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.850
 The employees inspect the equipment 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.850
 place and carry out pollutant measurements 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.410
 They take samples of water and soil 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.560
 vehicles and analyze these in the 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.560
 laboratory 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.850
 we are here in the area tabor the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.130
 the heart of the environmental service that is 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.570
 two colleagues from our 130 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.610
 coworkers coworkers the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.790
 Every day an important contribution to 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.670
 Environmental protection in the company accomplish that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.230
 he was the big topic when we asked the question 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.890
 whether we donate again 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.870
 repurchase with the big street power 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.460
 whether we and since not shot in the 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.140
 Oven make the engine 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.270
 the train is maybe 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.190
 environmentally friendly but now they do 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.810
 again street and how could the 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.270
 with that at all cope and there I have 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.670
 said that the big chance for the 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.440
 logistic company to represent at which 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.360
 make sense that the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.040
 rail and where do I have the road 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.180
 to take 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.550
 and I found it on the other side 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.670
 well is still very often fine 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.510
 Images only projected by environmental scene 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.100
 in the inner 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.510
 the train is something good and others 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.540
 modalities are what is bad 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.130
 that is completely wrong because each 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.700
 system if it is used properly 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.729
 has his authority if it system pc 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.449
 properly used much 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.469
 In 2020, the DB Environment wants 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.270
 be a pioneer 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.069
 this includes strengthening 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.309
 environmentally friendly logistics and 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.930
 Mobility chains the db environmental center 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:00.599
 developed together with the 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.460
 business fields get there five 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.490
 action fields are set for it 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.550
 less specific co2 emissions 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.069
 worldwide and more renewable energy 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.789
 at the stream mix half of the 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.529
 rail noise and a high 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.240
 Recycling rates are the top goals 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:19.979
 next to it the db wants the 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.009
 Particulate emissions of diesel vehicles 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.559
 Lower and nature even stronger 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.629
 protect 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:29.729
 keyword destination nature that we have 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.830
 13 years ago also developed and with 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.210
 brought to life 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.860
 together with big environmental organizations 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.899
 let's go for environmentally friendly 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.909
 tourism in the protected areas 1 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:43.469
 everywhere in Germany but also in the 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:45.689
 switzerland and in austria the seventeenth 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.669
 workshop passenger environment and traffic 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.129
 hosted by the environmental center of 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.020
 German course a real highlight and 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.569
 Almost a sample example of one 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.270
 constructive and critical dialogue of 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:02.779
 environmental passenger and disabled associations 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.779
 with the db on the 17th 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:09.330
 with the donations together the train is 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.189
 Today the most environmentally friendly of the 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.319
 Motorized transport throughout 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.939
 clearly as a whole system 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.069
 But she can still be clear 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:19.469
 become more environmentally friendly that is part 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:22.020
 the pathway the positive environmental image 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.249
 they can not against the environmental image 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.689
 Of course she does that too 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.129
 but not just when it comes to environmental image 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.289
 I believe that if you're there 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.930
 ambitious would be that everything 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.150
 understanding of the world 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.070
 20 years environmental center of the German 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.419
 track is a success for us 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.030
 Company and show 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.900
 the field of ecology has great significance 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.830
 for us with the rail traffic as 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.000
 environmentally friendly transport man 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.729
 we take special responsibility 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.620
 for the society and for ours 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.300
 environment 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.910
 Therefore, we have in good reason 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.539
 the group strategy db 2020 the goal 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.340
 set environment to become a pioneer 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:01.289
 It is a sustainable one for us 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.960
 Enter the competitive advantage of 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:04.830
 rail and the china as 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.979
 environmentally friendly means of transport 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.620
 expand and thus the connected 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.610
 market opportunities 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.360
 let us share this goal together 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.360
 realize
