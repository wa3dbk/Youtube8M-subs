it which is cool makes it fair it's it's

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
it which is cool makes it fair it's it's
it's<00:01:30.630> pizza<00:01:31.020> overall<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.560> fun<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.130> we're

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's pizza overall really fun so we're

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's pizza overall really fun so we're
going<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.000> over<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.770> like

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
going on over here and I really like

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.560 
going on over here and I really like
this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> clever<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.700> called<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> 3d<00:01:36.360> printer

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
this is clever it's called a 3d printer

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.330 
this is clever it's called a 3d printer
so<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> equivalent<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> mystery

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so this is the equivalent to the mystery

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
so this is the equivalent to the mystery
box<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.790> which<00:01:38.880> was<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.180> cool<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.720> almost

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110

box and which was really cool I almost
get<00:01:40.350> destroyed<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:42.090> end<00:01:42.270> up

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
get destroyed here and I get end up

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.139 
get destroyed here and I get end up
getting<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.689> essay<00:01:43.020> C<00:01:43.079> 3<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> akimbo<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
how they made the mystery box a 3d

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
how they made the mystery box a 3d
printer<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.399> made<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> work<00:01:50.850> for

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
printer so they they made it work for

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.880 
printer so they they made it work for

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
3d printer and I actually upgraded the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.710 
3d printer and I actually upgraded the
camel<00:02:50.920> itself<00:02:51.310> looks<00:02:51.519> really<00:02:51.790> cool<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.180> it
