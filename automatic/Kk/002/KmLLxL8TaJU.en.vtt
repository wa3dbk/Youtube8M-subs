00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.350
 hi everyone has been bought we end up 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.230
 for a gameplay on black ops on 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.619
 turbine with smr diamond finder 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.660
 scanner to any voter of shooting and cross 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.180
 I believe and remember that he knows how to do 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.070
 long as I go we can see that 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.530
 I'm going to use the scanner like 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.280
 it should be and I find that this viewfinder 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.600
 really good as we have seen 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.710
 like all that look if you have 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.180
 watched competition you have not 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.440
 that a lot of products used if 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.000
 I used to know before that 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.170
 used products because I have 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.160
 noticed that it was really useful I 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.200
 had tested it like that once I 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.460
 do my fucking it's a big axis he has 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.780
 already talked about so in another 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.760
 gameplay with the woman to use the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.200
 same thing so I advise you 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.080
 to go see I'm over ringing on 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.360
 the string to the laws at the pool at the 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.530
 scope of snipers 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.940
 always so annoying but here I am 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.310
 will you talk a little bit about something 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.200
 black ops already as you know there are 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.470
 had the release of a mic from a microphone 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.570
 dlc and this micro dlc those camouflages 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.920
 and places I zapped a lot 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.480
 especially since he went out there on xbox in 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.400
 Anyway it's not going out on pc ps3 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.110
 again but I did not really give my 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.909
 personally I heard 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.710
 that elite members had to pay for 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.840
 have it he said Friday 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.820
 it's only on ps3 and xbox so me it does not 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.420
 does not concern me or always does it 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.620
 all of us today muller and had debate 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.000
 the members and finally I find that enough 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.470
 amused that elite members have to 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.170
 pay while they have already paid for 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.840
 every dlc of the year normally 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.040
 after I want to believe that here it is going 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.590
 make money I understand but 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.070
 for those who have the member 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.770
 elite 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.930
 I find it quite disrespectful and all 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.790
 that but they do what they want is 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.680
 there it's time to play their money 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.090
 finally their company and where they do this 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.159
 that they want I will not start to 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.080
 to say about that except that the snub that 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.010
 personally I will not buy it I do not 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.350
 do not think it's a big thing 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.180
 especially I'm breaking my ass to have 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 the few diamond arrows for 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.520
 all the weapons 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.470
 it's not by being 2 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.570
 two camouflets will be ice cream there 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.850
 I'm going to have fun putting graffiti 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.980
 countries like camouflage on weapons 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.470
 while I have diamonds so here we go 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.000
 a lot for that if you like if you 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.130
 buy them beating the contest but me 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.100
 I can use money for 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.060
 this in staff after for classes 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.190
 it's different I think I'm going to 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.280
 do I do not know yet but I think 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.600
 that I'm going to do I'm not sure after 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.630
 i will talk to you a little about the com ce 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.520
 and this black ops the with all the patches 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.640
 and all like that because of opportunities 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.790
 of goal at the microphone from here a patch and get 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.190
 was really finally starting to start 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.320
 lower the line smcp to double wholesale 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.000
 they are much less strong and they have 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.520
 increased some assault rifles like 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.110
 risk ripped stuff like that 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.700
 and personally I find that this 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.290
 hiding and a weapon of madness now the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.580
 even the 25th she was raised then 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.020
 that I already found it and you are 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.320
 really fast enough people sometimes 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.840
 we wanted to be on a half second 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.450
 not even while we had 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.980
 all of our life finally that's what's what 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.690
 also rages the timberlake sometimes 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.270
 when people they are not aiming for there is a 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.010
 iphone where he does not shoot he pulls 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.209
 without aiming at another but who are you 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.760
 passes in the field like that you make yourself 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.480
 kill it's pretty rolling but I 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.310
 did not want to talk about that they had 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.520
 increased the fleas of the seals and they have 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.480
 lowered would limit them submachine gun and of 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.950
 kick me what am I doing right now 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.690
 it's that I do not play any more and who 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.060
 treat me because of that because 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.400
 frankly I do not know what game it is 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.420
 really more a game of you know very 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.680
 well it's really a game of 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.820
 refuse if you're fine that for 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.060
 those who know me enough 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.400
 long time 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.780
 I am rather a player at the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.790
 submachine gun and that plays almost all the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.530
 time the same retreat 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.129
 of the coast I play but that the wise and 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.329
 u9 mine kidd with the pgw because I 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.760
 played that hassen and that I prefer 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.540
 would limit but we must believe that 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.890
 Assault rifles are almost better 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.390
 now I lean for me in everything 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.930
 case it's almost better than 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.140
 guns 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.060
 because there is just not too rough 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.260
 and as if he had a trellis of himself 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.579
 put a little further the mistress and 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.879
 other m fifteen thousand balls for everything 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.409
 right now 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.519
 besides this gameplay I did not 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.989
 said but there will be a lot of scor 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.100
 strict 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.690
 unfortunately I also do it shot 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.070
 quite quickly and I have to what has 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.370
 Accelerated parties were my 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.270
 strict scores because that's enough 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.289
 boring to watch the match so that's it 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.400
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.610
 not seen yet because I do what 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.289
 the interest before but I have not seen 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.340
 the answer with moa yesterday so 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.539
 I hope you like it 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.650
 you liked it if you did not see it I 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.509
 advise to see if tomorrow with 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.120
 a machine gun on the really don 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.229
 hair pain and then here I am 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.610
 wanted to talk to you also in the thing 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.990
 is that this weekend I will not be there 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.789
 so you will not have live stream 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.780
 this Friday as I said she has a 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.330
 program and I said that the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.470
 Fridays in the low stream this Friday 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.919
 there will not be any because I'm not 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.539
 not at my house 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.710
 maybe if you want to tell me 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.820
 if you want a livestream as I 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.419

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.530
 no i say i will not be there just not bah 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.570
 no I will not do live stream because 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.680
 that tomorrow be I do a livestream and 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.530
 ask you will not have how to play 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.400
 on mac moreover the map will be flat of 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.900
 because I'm going to start 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.820
 invent all that and everything but yeah so 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.710
 you want one and stream tomorrow at the 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.370
 place of how to do a how to play 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.630
 on a map whose place to say tomorrow 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.190
 me if you want if you prefer 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.110
 secularity or if you prefer it me that me 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.150
 do not mind I can do both and 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.380
 So here is Thursday Friday Saturday I know 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.490
 not if I would have prepared this idea in 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.449
 before I'm sure will have a game 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.919
 Armagnac weekend and maybe 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.750
 I would have made one or two videos will be 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.030
 maybe one or a day or two where I 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.199
 would not have made a video because 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.659
 since at last I have plenty of classes 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.159
 code right now and I 'm like that of 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.139
 it takes me even more time and 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.810
 I 'm not going too far to make a thousand 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.820
 videos 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.620
 day if I'll have time but I find 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.790
 that both would be a little too rocky 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.840
 and not enough not really well after 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.980
 just talk about a little thing too that's 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.860
 a guy who made me in the 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.600
 comments yeah you bump you do not know 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.250
 what here since he was saying he was saying 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.380
 after Mr. b12 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.389
 he makes videos of quality standards 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.860
 is really a huge taf he's doing 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.810
 quality videos and everything and I did not 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.610
 contrary an effect I imagine he 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.960
 is working a lot on this video and the 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.740
 riffle and activity videos I am 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.210
 Totally agree 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.010
 personally they are really long 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.979
 so I do not look at them all or part 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.290
 in any case but after that it's me 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.910
 because I'm daddy's still staying 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.320
 videos where it's too long that I 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.520
 would not like to stay that depends actually 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.410
 but I would not stay on one 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.180
 video too long like that but yeah 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.580
 and easy way you make videos like 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.930
 this kind not very good quality smart 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.130
 etc., etc 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.840
 you pay me a lot of time in your 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.370
 videos so I want to say to this 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.120
 sir is that she I answered him 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.220
 on comment but personally my 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.870
 videos I want frankly between because 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.280
 that sir v12 he's making a video by 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.900

 early videos frankly at the beginning and 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.260
 take 10 minutes to make yourself 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.729
 in as many minutes as the video there 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.990

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:34.220
 time more than 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.710
