00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello and welcome example 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.000
 with me children's toys I want you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.790
 introduce this helicopter today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.070
 that is from playmobil city action for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.560
 children from four to ten years 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.210
 the number 59 16 without yes in this set 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
 include that in the helicopter 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.029
 and the associated pilot from the special 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.580
 So you have a special unit 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.910
 even a pistol in hand and in 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.230
 This set contains 25 parts and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.230
 Let's take a look at the parts now 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:56.989
 where I already have the first helicopter 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:56.989
 Share it all out of the packaging 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:07.040
 here is already at the police officer 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 so which one schah first time as the first 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.530
 on 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.850
 He is blond and has a black vest 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.470
 He has a t 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.979
 shirt with black sleeves 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:41.530
 up here but light blue is one 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.450
 black pants blue belt and how 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.319
 usual in the playmobil figures he can 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.689
 to bend your head like this 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.689
 but move and even move your hands 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.649
 that looks a bit like 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.140
 I can already see helicopter from here 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.459
 above is equal to the propeller 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.950
 but I am now stepping for 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:10.119
 step with the instructions so the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.609
 instruction is included here 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:18.269
 and the first step is sticking it on 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.269
 from the cockpit 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:40.660
 so that's more the cop in the 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.270
 helicopter I think that's really 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.199
 a very nice toy with it 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.970
 you do a lot 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.949
 is interesting that here above 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.410
 hole is so you can too 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:54.669
 want to hang up here are the outside 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.630
 Headlights which can be in 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:01.870
 move different directions 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:05.070
 back to front down so 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.070
 for a search in the dark with the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.070
 helicopter 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:18.280
 here a small propeller and up here 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.320
 the big propeller yes that's it 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.820
 you like the video then give me 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.380
 but a thumb up there, I'm glad 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.850
 me over it 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:29.699
 I forgot one thing completely 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:39.220
 important here on those the propellers 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:41.530
 are still missing the yellow sticker if you 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.510
 So this playmobil figure pleases 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.960
 this helicopter with the playmobil 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.210
 figurine from the series city action 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.510
 then give me a thumb 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.570
 up and send me the times in the 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.180
 comments like the helicopter 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:01.120
 If he likes other things from the 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.500
 have known series city action or what 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.500
 you still like it that way 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.940
 just everything in the comments 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.520
 but our other videos we have 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.110
 already many playmobil videos or too 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.680
 many other toy videos there 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.389
 just over and if you like the video 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.280
 There have been changes here 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.630
 I've already said up there 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.630
 I would really be happy about that 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.889
 share the video with your friends and 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.889
