big it's being talked about quite a lot
but<00:01:02.550> most<00:01:02.820> pcs<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.449> don't<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
but most pcs just don't have a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.300 
but most pcs just don't have a
horsepower<00:01:04.729> capable<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.970> pushing<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.110> there

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
horsepower capable of pushing it there

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
horsepower capable of pushing it there

side we have the Asus what you'll notice
right<00:01:15.509> away<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> Dell<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.710> quite<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> bit

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
right away is the Dell is quite a bit

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.690 
right away is the Dell is quite a bit
brighter<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.909> fact<00:01:18.860> let's<00:01:19.860> take<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> washed

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
brighter in fact let's take is a washed

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.499 
brighter in fact let's take is a washed
out<00:01:20.970> look<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.869> things<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.729> noticeably

out look to things but it's noticeably

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.550 
out look to things but it's noticeably
brighter<00:01:24.720> when<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> put<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> side-by-side

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
brighter when you put it side-by-side

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
brighter when you put it side-by-side
with<00:01:26.070> another<00:01:26.310> monitor<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:27.570> even<00:01:27.930> at<00:01:28.020> 50%

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
with another monitor that's even at 50%

with another monitor that's even at 50%
brightness<00:01:28.860> level<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.380> Asus<00:01:31.380> itself<00:01:31.829> was

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
brightness level the Asus itself was

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.359 
brightness level the Asus itself was
running<00:01:32.400> at<00:01:32.780> 90%<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.189> when

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
running at 90% so you can see here when

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
running at 90% so you can see here when

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
backlight bleeding on the Dell and it's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.810 
backlight bleeding on the Dell and it's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
uneven - we left our shutter open quite

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.300 
uneven - we left our shutter open quite
a<00:01:41.880> while<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.240> our<00:01:42.299> SLR<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> see<00:01:43.950> all

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
a while in our SLR and you can see all

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
a while in our SLR and you can see all
the<00:01:44.430> white<00:01:44.640> hotspots<00:01:45.270> call<00:01:45.600> us<00:01:45.750> by<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> Dells

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the white hotspots call us by the Dells

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.969 
the white hotspots call us by the Dells
black<00:01:46.740> line<00:01:47.009> compared<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.140> Asus<00:01:49.140> a--'s<00:01:49.380> so

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
black line compared to the Asus a--'s so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.399 
black line compared to the Asus a--'s so
there's<00:01:50.640> definitely<00:01:50.909> an<00:01:51.299> advantage<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.350> terms

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
there's definitely an advantage in terms

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.069 
there's definitely an advantage in terms
of<00:01:52.740> contrast<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> dark<00:01:53.790> level<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
of contrast and dark level because of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
of contrast and dark level because of
this<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> other<00:01:56.430> thing<00:01:56.670> you'll<00:01:56.790> notice

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
this so the other thing you'll notice

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.260 
this so the other thing you'll notice
here<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.200> color<00:01:58.409> reproduction<00:01:59.270> Asus

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
props to the Asus there so we showed

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.670 
props to the Asus there so we showed
some<00:02:20.310> game<00:02:20.550> stuff<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:21.150> showed<00:02:21.330> some<00:02:21.540> video<00:02:22.200> we

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
some game stuff we showed some video we

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.590 
some game stuff we showed some video we
showed<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.340> with<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.030> lights<00:02:24.240> off<00:02:24.390> what

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
showed it with with the lights off what

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.010 
showed it with with the lights off what
look<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.500> how<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.650> emotion<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
look like but how about emotion so the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.890 
look like but how about emotion so the
big<00:02:28.200> thing<00:02:28.410> for<00:02:28.620> me<00:02:28.680> was<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.570> could<00:02:30.570> notice

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
big thing for me was I could notice

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.960 
big thing for me was I could notice
boosting<00:02:31.620> quite<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> bit<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.430> del<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.850> this

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
boosting quite a bit on the del and this

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.700 
boosting quite a bit on the del and this
is<00:02:33.090> actually<00:02:33.360> why<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:33.480> ended<00:02:34.140> up<00:02:34.230> comparing

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
is actually why we ended up comparing

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.430 
is actually why we ended up comparing
both<00:02:34.830> one<00:02:35.130> or<00:02:35.400> side<00:02:35.610> by<00:02:35.640> side<00:02:36.060> was<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.200> found

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
both one or side by side was I found

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.140 
both one or side by side was I found
myself<00:02:37.590> getting<00:02:37.860> headaches<00:02:38.250> while<00:02:38.820> playing

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.580 
myself getting headaches while playing
games<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> del<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.140> didn't<00:02:40.320> know<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.500> was

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
games on the del I didn't know if it was

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.560 
games on the del I didn't know if it was
because<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.860> was<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.010> bright<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:41.640> because<00:02:42.450> it

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
because it was so bright or because it

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.140 
because it was so bright or because it
was<00:02:42.660> from<00:02:43.040> some<00:02:44.040> kind<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.220> ghosting<00:02:44.670> despite

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
was from some kind of ghosting despite

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.840 
was from some kind of ghosting despite
the<00:02:45.330> del<00:02:45.680> only<00:02:46.680> having<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.010> 1<00:02:47.220> millisecond

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
the del only having a 1 millisecond

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.820 
the del only having a 1 millisecond
response<00:02:47.910> time<00:02:50.480> faster<00:02:51.480> than<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.290> are<00:02:52.530> slower

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
response time faster than the are slower

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.240 
response time faster than the are slower
I<00:02:52.980> should<00:02:53.250> say<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.760> Asus<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.920> reason

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
I should say that the Asus the reason

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.650 
I should say that the Asus the reason
for<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.730> actually<00:02:57.180> something<00:02:57.450> called

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
for this is actually something called

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.230 
for this is actually something called
overdrive<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.710> reason<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.310> monitor

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
overdrive and the reason that monitor

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.080 
overdrive and the reason that monitor
manufacturers<00:03:01.020> start<00:03:01.470> claiming<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:02.880> high

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
manufacturers start claiming really high

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.760 
manufacturers start claiming really high
response<00:03:03.660> times<00:03:03.990> stuff<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.590> is

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
response times stuff like that is

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.290 
response times stuff like that is
because<00:03:04.950> they<00:03:05.280> basically<00:03:05.460> overclock<00:03:06.270> the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
because they basically overclock the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.140 
because they basically overclock the
pixels<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.709> monitors<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.970> list

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
pixels on the monitors and they list

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.050 
pixels on the monitors and they list
response<00:03:09.540> times<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.050> grade<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.709> grade<00:03:11.060> ratio

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
not a white to black and what this means

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.229 
not a white to black and what this means
is<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.950> time<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.310> takes<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.640> pixel<00:03:18.060> to

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
is that the time it takes the pixel to

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.870 
is that the time it takes the pixel to
