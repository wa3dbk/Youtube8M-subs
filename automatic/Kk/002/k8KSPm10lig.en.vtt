00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.820
 I leave everything between the field of play 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.210
 although sometimes sometimes they have not 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.090
 gone things as one wants I have not 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.950
 had 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.760
 that opportunity to score goals for 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.189
 to give joys to the fans to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.290
 my family does not fail not because some 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.390
 days and I learn the day to day I learn from 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.300
 that profession 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.270
 and I hope that the next tournament 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.610
 can be claimed and can 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.920
 give him all that goal to write that for 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.870
 there no no no they have not arrived in this in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.059
 this season a frustration not to 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.620
 otherwise I feel really want to continue 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.470
 working has not been a good 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.540
 season but it's even I do not think that 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.550
 no team has not passed over 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.280
 you feel that is the culprit of the bad 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.890
 team campaign not guilty because if 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 we are all is a good team joan 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.390
 Herrera and tell us about six months 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.190
 to Mexico have reached what if 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 the country in particular the city of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.289
 of lion you already got used to talking to us 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.590
 about that and I start that has 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:10.190
 treated the country very well as well as the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.080
 country as well as the city I think that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.290
 the people here are lion 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.130
 she has been very attentive very affectionate 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 I felt the full support of them so 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.130
 I am very happy and very calm in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.810
 that part before his arrival we talked 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.160
 on a couple of occasions with you giovanni 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.560
 he told us after your enthusiasm 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.990
 coming to Mexico that you're going to bring 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 you to your family 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.450

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.240
 I am not alone with my family here with with 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.950
 they who have been very supportive 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.950
 for me 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.510
 always where where we have been that have 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.910
 been with me so that's very 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.810
 important not to have that support from them and 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:58.170
 the love that you always need as 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.900
 as a person a thing of what you have 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.720
 known lion in particular there is something 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.040
 that is assimilated with what your people are 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.990
 there in Colombia in terms of customs 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.410
 as to the kind of being in terms of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.890
 weather 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.190
 now the weather is very similar and now 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.110
 so always in colombia 'of the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.760
 city ​​where where I always live 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.440
 it's is heat people have also 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.500
 very familiar look here too 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.990
 always where I am where I have today

 I felt the support of the people and that 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.760
 It leaves me very happy and I am very 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.140
 quiet for that reason when we knew that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.120
 came to take out the lion city we 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.890
 you shared that you had great enthusiasm 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.150
 for coming to Mexico and it was all a 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.360
 challenge to show what you had done 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.400
 on other computers doing an analysis 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.610
 and a self-criticism what was your first 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.860
 season that would stand out from your person 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.350
 on the stadium and you consider 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.840
 that you missed to give a greater achievement and 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.989
 in your career highlighted the delivery that 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.340
 had because I always leave everything between 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.200
 playing field not although sometimes 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.800
 Sometimes things have not come out 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.290
 how do you like 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.490
 always always or everything in the field 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.470
 of game 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.300
 You win the enthusiasm that I give you and 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.790
 what I missed something, I think what 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.650
 I have not had 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.489
 this opportunity to score goals for 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.560
 to give joys to the fans to 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.689
 my family that is what one is for that 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.750
 work does not stop to feel good for 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.700
 be happy and make the family happy 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.819
 already already this family here l though 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.760
 I have also felt the support 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.030
 of them that is very important and I think 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.629
 that I have lacked that in within the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.670
 playing field 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.200
 score goals there is a moment that a 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.239
 server remembers quite a bit that it was the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.370
 goal that you made with treki that was a goal 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.560
 of very good manufacture and also gave 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.139
 life to the lion team in terms of 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.669
 dream of the liberators in your opinion 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.310
 personal what are those moments that 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.650
 what else have you enjoyed on the court with 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.439
 the lion team all think that I 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.909
 I really enjoy this not because it is a 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.669
 blessing that God has given me this 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:16.579
 profession so I try to enjoy the 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:19.130
 up to seize opportunities 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.950
 that I have every day of coming to train 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.810
 with joy with desire 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.570
 and feel good within the term of 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.750
 game and enjoy it always because it's my 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.240
 career and I have a lot of love for me 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.480
 race and I always give myself to myself 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.790
 for the shirt that is wearing there 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.300
 something that we can not leave out 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.610
 giovanni we saw your trajectory in some 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.440
 goals that exists on several teams the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.380
 fact that in the season you only have 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.870
 made two notes for you is a 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.000
 failure in your career as I would take it 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.490
 failure not because a few days of I learn 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.810
 the day of I learn of this profession 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.810
 I have felt 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:07.389
 with a total support of the technical staff 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.699
 directive of my colleagues so one 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.430
 learn every day not every day learn 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:17.050
 something new and I think here lion 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.629
 he learned many things learned things 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.699
 that in the end they will serve me to 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.340
 continue in my career to continue to 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:28.449
 continue to take advantage of the opportunities 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:31.780
 I have so it has been very nice and 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:35.229
 I hope that the next tournament will be 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.349
 can be claimed and can give 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.270
 all the hits that there have not been 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.039
 come on this in this season can 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.139
 because this part because one like 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:47.759
 forward lives is a moment not sometimes 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.759
 of that scoring drought 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.919
 as well as when when you have 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.229
 possibilities that you all enter 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.780
 all the goals so good so 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.550
 we hope and hope to continue working 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.310
 and keep fighting not to arms 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.590
 felt a certain frustration 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.180
 for being there looking for and that things 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.099
 have not been given to take a 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.560
 frustration not the other way 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.770
 eager to continue working 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.689
 keep fighting because I know about the 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.169
 capabilities that I have of the qualities 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:23.089
 and I know I can weapons so that 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.949
 encourage to continue working to continue 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:25.369
 struggling 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.259
 unfortunately it reaches a 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:30.169
 season that the team has also 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.679
 gone pretty bad has 13 points and is 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.719
 to a match to close the season and the 

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:37.610
 people have criticized you, you have become 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.589
 the controversial character in the mass a lot 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.269
 what feels yovanny arrechea when 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:43.219
 happens that in the field in the match 

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:45.139
 past we realized it was not enough 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.749
 evident every time he touched her when 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:52.149
 when you entered that goes through the mind of 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:52.149
 giovanni when you receive that answer
