00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.200
 awesome prices dear friends swami anti 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.310
 Well, today we talk about the hamster 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.619
 or about t-54 and one american 109 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.750
 level and if you watched my streams 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.660
 Crimea way marks you know what it is 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.000
 now my main tank for taking 3 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.149
 marks and in just one stream I almost 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.610
 took on it the second mark literally not 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.620
 there was enough 3 and 4 there and can buy and 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.149
 fighting just because it was already the second 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.180
 one o'clock in the morning and my eyes stuck together 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.570
 tired simpler speaking and up today guys 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.129
 you watch my fight so 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.260
 sit back and enjoy 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.890
 I know that you miss 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.460
 generally speaking immediately about his tank 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.050
 there is one great advantage drum 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.409
 on 4 shells with alpha one shot at 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:13.630
 390 is very nice guys this to me 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.700
 300 this to me 240 this is this 390 alpha 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.350
 just like a Soviet destructor or 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.960
 the d-25t is only breaking through here 210 and we 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.310
 inherited one major flaw 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.799
 d 69 is breaking through that tank was 173 what 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.530
 In the top , well , at least something could with 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.990
 dozens as you know it could not 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.299
 nothing here exactly 1010 also breaking through 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.520
 not enough that the government 7 0 d not 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.289
 enough that breaking 100 van ld simpler 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.200
 saying heavy tanks even weak spots 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.299
 do not make their way well into the board of the seven yet 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.640
 you can punch out just not in their ran out 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.149
 out of 100 into the board you wo nâ€™t take it only in 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.060
 stern 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.740
 I'll tell you ottyanuv average tank he does not 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.159
 should shoot in the forehead he should go 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.899
 in feed and vartan but here's the main problem 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.250
 one more of this tank 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:06.310
 maximum speed of only 43 kilometers per hour is 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.500
 almost the worst performance level already 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.300
 only the centurion, that is, such 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.130
 maximum speed is very fast moving with 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.520
 one point on the other and you just don't 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.890
 can not us 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.750
 happen and sometimes your maneuver is pretty 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.220
 just calculate because well not 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.000
 enough maximum speed to make it 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.360
 a little faster and as a result understand 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.850
 what to turn the enemy quickly before him 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.000
 get off to break into this tank and difficult 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.690
 so you have to play on Goldin and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.880
 go to the minus every fight I drive everything 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.980
 bb chic with two drums 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.880
 purely on the case when you get to the top 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.920
 and maybe my first two drums 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.810
 immediately go there on light and medium 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.300
 tanks that jump not build 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.930
 no problem but take the same 50 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.930
 Foursome 210 penetration is sometimes not enough 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.480
 to take her vld and sometimes the whole drum 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.700
 your milking in her for nothing and never 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.820
 I do not have to break through but exactly 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.600
 so in order not to tempt fate 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.830
 just playing on the gold 255 breaking through 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.470
 5 more than 69 here and podkalibery 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.480
 I like the calipers more than well 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.880
 oh well now let's talk about 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.740
 benefits as I said the main thing 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.920
 this is a drum four shots for 390 yes 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.440
 we are also not the best damage per minute and 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.980
 it is nearing the lower shelf then 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.320
 there is roughly the worst but it 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.470
 no matter and the dates are fully charged for 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.060
 you fly on the enemy and thrust him 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.790
 four shells if you're lucky with 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.360
 alpha you were over 400 and above my God 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.390
 how nice it is to demolish 1,700 drums 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.520
 if you are lucky or even more but more often 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.510
 just no luck so you demolish 1500 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.240
 thousand four hundred 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.220
 but it doesn't matter anyway it's nice 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.690
 do when reloading inside the drum 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.670
 just 2.22 seconds of this mix 50 120 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.880
 it is even faster than yours there therefore 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.470
 nice to create this but because 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.510
 what is reloading inside the gun we have 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.540
 so quick enjoy 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.750
 we are between shots 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.010
 do not have time this is another drawback 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.420
 so guys danchik turned out very 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.150
 peculiar and quite good 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.430
 balanced it is not imba i'm not counting it 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.010
 they fight but for some reason I liked it 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.840
 He has a review and the main thing is not 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.150
 make a mistake like i don't put 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.960
 optics on it, put a stabilizer and 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.000
 drives 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.410
 and of course the valves because we need 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.470
 damage per minute which is very here 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.820
 small why i play with cola in 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.730
 first to level 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.970
 the flaw that I took off his optics 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.910
 and secondly to calmly feel 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.040
 myself 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.020
 when recharge drums win 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.060
 precious time is simpler you 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.200
 tell on latin 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:09.400
 t-54 i alone burn often but i believe in 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.820
 forehead it does not burn only the word well and in the stern 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.670
 can catch fire and yes we come back to 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.830
 one drawback frequent kreed bacon 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.920
 really frequent when he shoots nld 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.610
 you 50% damage damage 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.610
 bk 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.550
 sometimes damage to the board is still frequent 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.560
 creed towers in general yes it is still that to this 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.560
 the collection is possible therefore on it 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.450
 you meet this moment a little extras and 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.290
 incomprehensible who is now rolling out on 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.700
 streams you rarely spread though not 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.460
 I know the guys I liked the tanchik 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.600
 directional and how i take three marks 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.290
 then I will calm down and will pump out already 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.340
 and the mines are next just heavy 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.230
 don't get fooled to write in 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.200
 comments your opinion about this tank 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.140
 what you don't like and what not and I forgot 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.900
 say about the armor that is it here as 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.240
 would be there but also no matter how simple 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.200
 as on all tanks she is here 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.110
 popular 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.790
 the tower makes its way through all the tanks that 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.740
 throw us into battle 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.410
 even a tank of the seventh level can her 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.870
 punch if exactly meet yes where 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.820
 Well 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.620
 and sometimes she can ricochet shells 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.370
 tanks of the tenth level 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:26.480
 here is just as lucky but if you 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:30.170
 bummed precisely the joint there between 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.700
 tower casing you guaranteed to beat out 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:36.430
 it is yours and it will break and otherwise it is of course 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.160
 another drawback 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.640
 okay enough about the merits 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.980
 limitations 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.110
 let's just look at the fight right 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.000
 Now there was last opponent and at 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.490
 I am already out of 6 frags more than three thousand 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.680
 damage and two shells in the drum why am I 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.570
 I do not recharge them well to hope that 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.340
 alpha will pass and i will take this damn in 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.470
 the form at least should have been so 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:03.770
 it will turn out but the first shot from 309 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:05.060
 and the second 330 and Fedya lives, yes I go to 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.620
 recharging itself just 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.720
 highlight for art I will not I 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.880
 perhaps still completely recharge a 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.120
 then go out capture and raise yourself 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.830
 hood dash patience yes that's such a sly 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.510
 puppey 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.430
 but generally what can I say no 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.620
 Remember to come on stream my Purim 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.270
 marks they are usually before the start 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.860
 are planned on youtube and so if you 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.650
 visit your channel more often there 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.970
 will meet without any problems either 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.570
 just visit my official one more often

 which stream will start after some 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.790
 time she either put a special 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.480
 browser extension then you for sure
