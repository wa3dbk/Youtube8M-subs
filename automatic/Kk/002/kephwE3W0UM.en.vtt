here is best like that a BD in an F
sharp<00:01:43.450> I'll<00:01:44.140> be<00:01:44.320> tempted<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.670> move<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.119> third

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
sharp I'll be tempted to move the third

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.279 
sharp I'll be tempted to move the third
up<00:01:47.679> to<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.070> 10th<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.300> get<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.810> kind<00:01:50.110> of

up to the 10th so you get this kind of
sound<00:01:50.640> which<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.670> much<00:01:52.060> nicer<00:01:52.300> then<00:01:52.720> on<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.929> G

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
sound which is much nicer then on the G

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.980

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.590 
right up and then of course on the other
C<00:02:02.530> sharp<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.759> could<00:02:03.909> do<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.060> similar<00:02:04.450> thing

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
C sharp you could do a similar thing

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.660 
C sharp you could do a similar thing
where<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.110> open<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.740> take<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> e<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.869> that

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
where you open and take the e up to that

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.830 
where you open and take the e up to that
that<00:02:09.670> makes<00:02:09.849> your<00:02:09.970> left<00:02:10.149> hand<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> sound<00:02:10.690> like

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
that makes your left hand the sound like

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:22.819 
that makes your left hand the sound like
this

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.039 

I'll<00:02:23.829> now<00:02:24.069> play<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.549> tune<00:02:24.819> with<00:02:25.810> those

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
I'll now play the tune with those

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.170 
I'll now play the tune with those
alterations<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.099> left<00:02:27.310> hand<00:02:27.549> stretching

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
alterations in the left hand stretching

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:41.460 
alterations in the left hand stretching
out<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:28.540> middle<00:02:28.780> note<00:02:40.079> now<00:02:41.079> you<00:02:41.140> can<00:02:41.319> hear

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
out that middle note now you can hear

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.170 
out that middle note now you can hear
that<00:02:41.680> really<00:02:42.099> improves<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.609> sound<00:02:42.909> that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
that really improves the sound that

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.330 
that really improves the sound that
you've<00:02:43.299> got<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.590> possibilities<00:02:45.310> are

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
you've got but the possibilities are

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.130 
you've got but the possibilities are
more<00:02:45.700> complex<00:02:46.090> but<00:02:46.390> these<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.689> be<00:02:46.780> discussed

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
more complex but these can be discussed

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.319 
more complex but these can be discussed
within<00:02:47.409> some<00:02:48.040> Skype<00:02:48.280> lessons<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.000> I'll<00:02:49.120> show
