00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:32.940

I<00:00:40.390> thought<00:00:40.960> this<00:00:41.109> thing<00:00:41.289> was<00:00:41.379> out<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.559> gear

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
I thought this thing was out of gear

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.410 
power thing well if I didn't screw this
battery<00:01:59.000> up<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.390> don't<00:01:59.990> think<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.259> though

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
battery up I don't think so though

testing<00:02:02.420> out<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.659> electric<00:02:02.990> start<00:02:05.170> okay<00:02:06.170> next

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500

testing out the electric start okay next
I'll<00:02:06.830> probably<00:02:07.159> start<00:02:07.729> working<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.299> this

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
I'll probably start working on this

carburetor<00:03:08.670> with<00:03:09.500> wd-40<00:03:10.500> when<00:03:10.829> I<00:03:10.890> got

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
carburetor with wd-40 when I got

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:20.040 
carburetor with wd-40 when I got
carburetor<00:03:11.430> cleaner<00:03:11.700> right<00:03:11.849> there<00:03:12.120> so

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.450 

I<00:03:20.140> could<00:03:20.800> probably<00:03:21.070> use<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.350> wd-40<00:03:23.350> on<00:03:24.010> the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
I could probably use the wd-40 on the

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.400 
I could probably use the wd-40 on the
springs<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:25.360> little<00:03:25.540> mechanisms<00:03:26.230> and

stuff<00:03:28.020> but<00:03:29.020> I<00:03:29.170> don't<00:03:29.440> think<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.800> want<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.100> get

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
stuff but I don't think I want to get

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.590 
stuff but I don't think I want to get
the<00:03:31.000> wd-40<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.960> inside<00:03:32.680> because<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.730> think

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
the wd-40 on the inside because I think

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.500 
the wd-40 on the inside because I think
it<00:03:35.140> WD<00:03:35.560> 40<00:03:35.890> has<00:03:36.010> an<00:03:36.130> oil<00:03:36.340> base<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> doughnut<00:03:37.330> I

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
it WD 40 has an oil base to a doughnut I

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:46.420 
it WD 40 has an oil base to a doughnut I
can't<00:03:38.380> remember

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.430 

you

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.730 

it's<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:53.010> gritty

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.510 

I<00:03:55.830> don't<00:03:56.670> think<00:03:56.820> it's<00:03:56.970> great<00:03:57.330> that's<00:03:57.600> from

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
I don't think it's great that's from

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.650 
I don't think it's great that's from
wants<00:03:59.520> dirt<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.970> stuff<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.450> looks<00:04:00.600> like

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
wants dirt and stuff but it looks like

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.270 
wants dirt and stuff but it looks like
it's<00:04:00.870> more<00:04:01.020> like<00:04:01.230> grit<00:04:01.650> that's<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.100> been

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
it's more like grit that's just been
