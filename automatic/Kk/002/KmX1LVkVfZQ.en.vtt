00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.700
 Hello everyone 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 video to show everyone 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.960
 you want to integrate 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.130
 apple systems a system called 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:27.260
 wireless sparks that new system of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.510
 charge through inductive system 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.620
 through this equipment the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.550
 which apple mainly does not have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.180
 prepared for old models and the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 possibility of integrating this system 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.540
 here is practically a system by now one 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.890
 European standard accordingly all 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.050
 platforms like the one we see 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 this ahead I will be compatible with everyone 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.660
 the systems currently on the market 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.640
 phones such as nokia samsung and others 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.120
 various models nicely the samsung 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.960
 of additional devices to put 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.960
 battery compartment 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.430
 consequently it is enough to apply it only 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.420
 put the phone down the phone comes 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.580
 loaded instead regarding i 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.820
 phones in which it was not integrated 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.740
 this system can be remedied 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.080
 this is what we say to this problem 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:39.280
 using subterfuges through 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.170
 devices for other phones e 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.690
 as complete as this case on the iPhone 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.880
 the iphone a big problem is this the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.030
 main reason to which above all 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.280
 what we have in front of this is a 4 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.300
 also identical 4s entirely for how much 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.340
 concerns the space of the problem 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.780
 main of the iPhone 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.190
 the back which is here 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.570
 we program the antenna for wifi 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.760
 and it is a metal plate that yes 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.320
 let's say it includes a whole part 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.290
 rear which does not allow the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.709
 recharge operation 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.160
 wireless with how it works 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.650
 shielding is therefore impossible 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.400
 recharge then to remedy this 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.720
 problem you need to remove a part of 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.570
 small part of this 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.270
 bush to the rear to be able to perform 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.720
 then installing the device 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.720
 the back 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:03.890
 let's say the iPhone is ours 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.900
 long device in about 4 cm is thick 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.060
 03 the smallest currently in 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.640
 trade 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.980
 and we can as you see the picture between 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.360
 little integral within ours 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.280
 removing device we say to 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.060
 interested party which is what they have 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.060
 just mentioned 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.320
 it is not the other difference from the 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.090
 other models like samsung is that 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.660
 the iphone to make one 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.380
 top-up requires a closure 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.830
 on the usb port 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.630
 between the data more or less accordingly not 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.660
 you can activate the recharge up to 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.640
 when these are not carried out 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.630
 re-closing or if the cable is connected 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.330
 usb or even wall chargers have 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.620
 already these closures 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.020
 to overcome this problem we 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.320
 we used a kind of cork 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.950
 that once you pull out of course 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.430
 once installed if we have to 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.020
 recharge enough you can leave when 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.880
 we need to connect it for the 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.680
 rome data exchange and easy to remove it 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.549
 we can use it safely on 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.280
 pc therefore once installed not 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.470
 we can see an original cover neither 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.950
 we can work on the original conero 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.050
 without any identical difference 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.040
 the only thing different then how I have it 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.710
 said this phone plug and this 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.120
 it's working perfectly 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.330
 we just have to do it after making 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.810
 to change it, place it on the 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.780
 platform the LED lights up and here 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:52.730
 we can see the battery that recharges 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:56.270
 recharge times are similar perhaps a 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.800
 change of 20 30 minutes compared to 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.940
 traditional charge through the cable 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.169
 usb 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.670
 logically because we have the 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.940
 dispersion though 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.860
 to this problem that is this system 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.280
 wireless has a percentage of 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.790
 efficiency that varies depending on the 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.360
 thickness of the distance between al 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.740
 transmitter receiver this logic 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.240
 put the receiver wrong 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.880
 passive therefore us 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.920
 we can therefore install to any 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.320
 device in this case the iphone 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.760
 even on phones we say other models 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.890
 we can install ours 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.170
 wireless device to the platform e 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.240
 it's going so we can then take advantage 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.820
 of our wireless and installed system 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.890
 for example on the iphone 4s on all 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.770
 devices currently in use in 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.930
 trade 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.460
 We have even outside Italy 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.130
 I put that system in Italy still not 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.600
 it is completely integrated into society 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.520
 today 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.600
 abroad it is already present with the idea 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.230
 also to be able to integrate on the tables 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.430
 but also which of others' restaurants 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.460
 seats 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.810
 we say that everywhere also in the house is the 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.940
 what was integral then these 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.740
 panels of stories and we smat 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.770
 logically only by supporting 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:24.440
 phone maybe on the table we can 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.890
 top up if by 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.160
 case 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.960
 you want to request information in a while 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.110
 as a scorer at the email address 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.070
 to also have information regarding 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.910
 how to have how to do it too 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.860
 inside of 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.130
 the operation a little delicate so 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.690
 make salting points 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.810
 quite important of the cut and therefore 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:50.360
 I strongly advise against whom 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:54.320
 practicality in the electronic field 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.280
 especially in the mary's camp 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.270
 therefore using smd components 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:05.419
 we can see someone came out a cover 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:08.600
 a phone and that with the cover we can 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:11.780
 certainly fit the cover and use 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.250
 the same system to recharge it i 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.050
 fittings we have difference 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.050
 logically we know that this is a lot 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.820
 thin that the cover is thicker 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.669
 the benefit of polarity was therefore 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.300
 more time for recharging then a 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:28.860
 regards to all 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.860
 for any information contact me
