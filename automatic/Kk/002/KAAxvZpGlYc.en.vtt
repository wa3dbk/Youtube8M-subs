does this say about NYPD and what's

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.569 
does this say about NYPD and what's
going<00:04:04.209> on<00:04:04.390> there<00:04:04.569> in<00:04:04.660> New<00:04:04.780> York<00:04:05.190> well<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.340> shows

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
going on there in New York well it shows

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.009 
going on there in New York well it shows
I<00:04:06.700> mean<00:04:06.819> I<00:04:06.850> think<00:04:06.970> nationally<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.660> issue<00:04:07.810> that

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
I mean I think nationally the issue that

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.379 
I mean I think nationally the issue that
police<00:04:08.260> have<00:04:08.500> with<00:04:08.859> video<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.850> mean<00:04:10.120> now<00:04:10.329> you

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
police have with video I mean now you

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.199 
police have with video I mean now you
can't<00:04:11.049> really<00:04:11.380> do<00:04:11.650> much<00:04:11.680> of<00:04:12.010> anything<00:04:12.220> without

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
can't really do much of anything without

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.059 
can't really do much of anything without
the<00:04:13.510> idea<00:04:13.630> that<00:04:13.989> there<00:04:14.139> is<00:04:14.230> someone<00:04:14.530> recording

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
the idea that there is someone recording

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.710 
the idea that there is someone recording
you<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:15.910> kind<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.150> changes<00:04:16.209> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
you and so this kind of changes the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.090 
you and so this kind of changes the
police<00:04:16.930> narrative<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.560> think<00:04:17.769> puts<00:04:17.979> the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
police narrative and I think puts the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.039 
police narrative and I think puts the
police<00:04:18.340> on<00:04:18.519> notice<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.030> they<00:04:19.450> really<00:04:19.810> need

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
police on notice that they really need

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.599 
police on notice that they really need
to<00:04:20.080> watch<00:04:20.380> out<00:04:20.680> for<00:04:20.709> what<00:04:21.039> they're<00:04:21.220> saying<00:04:21.459> in

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
to watch out for what they're saying in

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.580 
to watch out for what they're saying in
these<00:04:21.729> criminal<00:04:22.090> court

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590
