00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
quite some lag here going on and this is

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.830 
quite some lag here going on and this is
our<00:02:54.930> major<00:02:55.530> gripe<00:02:56.070> with<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.670> handset<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.690> we

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
our major gripe with this handset so we

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.050 
our major gripe with this handset so we
hope<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> problem<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.190> will<00:02:59.370> stay<00:02:59.820> in

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
hope this is a problem that will stay in

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.440 
hope this is a problem that will stay in
our<00:03:00.510> prototype<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.460> final<00:03:02.820> unit<00:03:03.030> will

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
our prototype and so the final unit will

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.840 
our prototype and so the final unit will
be<00:03:03.660> free<00:03:03.930> from<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> end<00:03:05.190> we<00:03:05.400> think<00:03:05.670> that

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
be free from it in the end we think that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.150 
be free from it in the end we think that
the<00:03:06.480> Sony<00:03:06.780> Ericsson<00:03:06.960> Yendo<00:03:07.350> has<00:03:07.980> the

the Sony Ericsson Yendo has the
potential<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.850> become<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.390> very<00:03:10.170> successful

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
touchscreen budget handset we think this

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.410 
touchscreen budget handset we think this
way<00:03:15.330> because<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.650> has<00:03:17.270> pleasant<00:03:18.270> appearance

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
way because it has pleasant appearance

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.070 
way because it has pleasant appearance
nice<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.590> compact<00:03:20.160> design<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.840> has<00:03:22.050> a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
nice and compact design and it has a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.960 
nice and compact design and it has a
capacitive<00:03:22.770> touch<00:03:23.070> screen<00:03:23.400> which<00:03:23.700> makes

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
capacitive touch screen which makes

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.350 
capacitive touch screen which makes
using<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.810> touchscreen<00:03:25.460> handset<00:03:26.460> very<00:03:27.060> fun

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360
