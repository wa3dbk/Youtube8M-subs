00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
nice to use the only thing is because

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.740 
nice to use the only thing is because
it's<00:00:46.110> quite<00:00:46.410> long<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.610> can't<00:00:48.120> use<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.570> very

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it's quite long I can't use it for very

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
it's quite long I can't use it for very
long<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.260> could<00:00:49.410> use<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.739> an<00:00:49.890> hour<00:00:50.039> or

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.700 
long I could use it for an hour or
something<00:00:50.510> because<00:00:51.510> you're<00:00:52.260> holding<00:00:52.620> your

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
something because you're holding your

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
arms out quite flat forward when you're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.810 
arms out quite flat forward when you're
shooting<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:57.920> it's<00:00:58.920> nice<00:00:59.129> magnify<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
shooting but it's nice magnify the

the<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> reason<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.650> said<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.920> first

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the the reason like I said in the first

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
the the reason like I said in the first
video<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.869> I'm<00:01:10.700> replacing<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.570> main

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
video that I'm replacing the the main

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.190 
video that I'm replacing the the main
reason<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.200> replacing<00:01:13.500> my<00:01:14.400> first<00:01:15.200> viewfinder

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
reason I'm replacing my first viewfinder

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.399 
reason I'm replacing my first viewfinder
was<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:17.700> took<00:01:18.119> too<00:01:18.180> long<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> take<00:01:19.290> on

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
was because it took too long to take on

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.880 
was because it took too long to take on
and<00:01:19.530> off<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.930> clips<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and off so this one just clips on and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.240 
and off so this one just clips on and
off<00:01:23.509> I<00:01:24.509> mean<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> prettiest<00:01:26.070> thing

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

tie<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:52.989> thing<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:53.530> its<00:02:53.560> basically<00:02:54.010> four

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
tie this thing on its basically four

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.360 
tie this thing on its basically four
strings<00:02:55.079> connected<00:02:56.079> two<00:02:56.530> loops<00:02:56.799> which<00:02:57.190> goes

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
strings connected two loops which goes

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.289 
strings connected two loops which goes
around<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.670> lens<00:02:59.549> I'm<00:03:00.549> sure<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.120> figure

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
around the lens I'm sure you can figure

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.210 
around the lens I'm sure you can figure
out<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.480> rest<00:03:01.540> from<00:03:01.780> there<00:03:01.989> but<00:03:02.170> wanna<00:03:02.739> make

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
out the rest from there but wanna make

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.300 
out the rest from there but wanna make
sure<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.670> people<00:03:03.880> are<00:03:04.060> going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.269> ask<00:03:04.359> to<00:03:04.510> see

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
sure that people are going to ask to see

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.970 
sure that people are going to ask to see
what<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.430> looks<00:03:06.609> like<00:03:07.380> from<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.650> actual

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
what it looks like from the actual

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:20.910 
what it looks like from the actual
viewfinder<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:13.920> I'm<00:03:14.920> going<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.190> go<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.630> play

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.640 

and<00:03:23.080> you're<00:03:24.080> getting<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.350> bit<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.610> glass<00:03:25.610> from

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and you're getting a bit of glass from

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:38.410 
and you're getting a bit of glass from
hold<00:03:27.650> on<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.460> like<00:03:29.350> this<00:03:34.750> there<00:03:35.750> we<00:03:35.840> go<00:03:37.420> one

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
hold on to it like this there we go one

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.940 
hold on to it like this there we go one
of<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.600> problems<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:38.990> that<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.320> moves<00:03:39.770> around

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
of the problems is that it moves around

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.990 
of the problems is that it moves around
a<00:03:40.190> little<00:03:40.310> bit<00:03:40.490> so<00:03:41.360> I'm<00:03:41.480> going<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.690> put<00:03:41.930> some

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
a little bit so I'm going to put some

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.140 
a little bit so I'm going to put some
some<00:03:44.000> rubber<00:03:44.270> behind<00:03:45.110> this<00:03:45.880> so<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.060> it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
some rubber behind this so that it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.970 
some rubber behind this so that it
doesn't<00:03:47.530> move<00:03:48.530> about<00:03:48.800> so<00:03:49.160> much<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:51.470> holds<00:03:51.650> fine

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
doesn't move about so much it holds fine

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.760 
doesn't move about so much it holds fine
it's<00:03:52.370> not<00:03:52.520> too<00:03:52.670> bad<00:03:52.700> okay<00:03:53.570> so<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:54.620> was<00:03:54.740> a

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
it's not too bad okay so that was a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.820 
it's not too bad okay so that was a
little<00:03:55.370> test<00:03:55.610> video<00:03:55.850> editor<00:03:56.240> I<00:03:56.620> can<00:03:57.620> actually

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
little test video editor I can actually

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.940 
little test video editor I can actually
make<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.040> watch<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:59.290> you<00:04:00.290> can<00:04:00.440> do<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.560> actually

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
make you watch it you can do it actually

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:11.760 
make you watch it you can do it actually
actually<00:04:01.190> quite<00:04:01.490> stable<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.980> ain't<00:04:07.160> too<00:04:07.280> bad

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.720 

and<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.890> shows<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.100> screen<00:04:13.340> is<00:04:13.490> yeah<00:04:13.640> it's

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
and it shows the screen is yeah it's

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.910 
and it shows the screen is yeah it's
quite<00:04:13.850> quite<00:04:14.330> big<00:04:15.459> this<00:04:16.459> is<00:04:16.610> about<00:04:16.850> 85<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:20.920> so

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
quite quite big this is about 85 not so

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.240 
quite quite big this is about 85 not so
yes<00:04:22.400> there<00:04:22.640> we<00:04:22.730> go<00:04:22.820> um<00:04:23.800> isn't<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:25.040> was

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
yes there we go um isn't that was

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.070 
yes there we go um isn't that was
without<00:04:25.340> image<00:04:25.850> stabilization<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.750> one<00:04:26.900> is

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
without image stabilization this one is

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.890 
without image stabilization this one is
with<00:04:27.410> image<00:04:27.890> stabilization<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.630> can<00:04:29.780> see

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
with image stabilization and you can see

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.400 
with image stabilization and you can see
that<00:04:30.020> it's<00:04:30.140> basically<00:04:30.560> motionless<00:04:32.170> until<00:04:33.170> I

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
that it's basically motionless until I

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.160 
that it's basically motionless until I
start<00:04:33.680> moving<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.090> left<00:04:37.450> so<00:04:38.450> it<00:04:38.990> does<00:04:39.140> work

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
start moving to the left so it does work

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.500 
start moving to the left so it does work
really<00:04:39.320> well<00:04:39.670> especially<00:04:40.670> when<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.240> had<00:04:41.360> some

really well especially when you had some

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.030 
really well especially when you had some
image<00:04:41.720> stabilization<00:04:42.020> if<00:04:42.530> you've<00:04:42.650> got<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> lens

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
image stabilization if you've got a lens

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.090 
image stabilization if you've got a lens
full<00:04:43.250> of<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.780> lens<00:04:44.780> that<00:04:44.930> has<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:47.530> anyways<00:04:48.530> i'm
