I<00:00:47.579> routinely<00:00:48.570> charge<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.250> charging

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
I routinely charge it are you charging

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.299 
I routinely charge it are you charging
it<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.270> way<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.780> you're<00:00:52.649> only<00:00:52.860> getting

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
it all the way if you're only getting

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.760 
it all the way if you're only getting
half<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.640> charge<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:54.899> turn<00:00:55.140> off<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
half a charge in it will turn off as the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610 
half a charge in it will turn off as the
battery<00:00:56.160> loses<00:00:56.670> power<00:00:56.910> I'm<00:00:57.570> pretty<00:00:58.289> sure

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
battery loses power I'm pretty sure

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.000 
battery loses power I'm pretty sure
since<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> charger<00:01:00.329> most<00:01:00.629> nights

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010

since it is on the charger most nights
the<00:01:02.010> battery<00:01:02.489> could<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> losing<00:01:03.149> capacity

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the battery could be a losing capacity

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.710 
the battery could be a losing capacity
shortly<00:01:04.320> before<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.769> dies<00:01:05.150> that<00:01:06.150> means<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
shortly before it dies that means it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
shortly before it dies that means it
stores<00:01:07.020> less<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.590> less<00:01:07.830> charge<00:01:08.220> causing<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
stores less and less charge causing the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.960 
stores less and less charge causing the
battery<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.840> die<00:01:10.020> sooner<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.650> sooner<00:01:10.970> then

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
battery to die sooner and sooner then

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
battery to die sooner and sooner then
I'll<00:01:12.210> need<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> new<00:01:12.960> battery<00:01:13.170> sooner

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
I'll need to get a new battery sooner

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.539 
I'll need to get a new battery sooner
rather<00:01:13.920> than<00:01:14.070> later

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
rather than later

could it be hackers you should be
