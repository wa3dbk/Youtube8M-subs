00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
my extensions because I don't want my

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.900

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
extensions to be too thin especially

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.500 
extensions to be too thin especially
because<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.630> have<00:04:13.780> mediums<00:04:14.740> that<00:04:14.920> they<00:04:15.130> care<00:04:15.460> so
