00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
up and I replanted the zucchini which

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.420 
up and I replanted the zucchini which
had<00:00:30.990> gotten<00:00:31.170> all<00:00:31.320> tore<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.309> i<00:00:32.399> also

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
had gotten all tore up and then i also

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
got eggplant and another another set of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.979 
got eggplant and another another set of
peppers<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.329> probably<00:00:36.600> looks<00:00:36.660> slightly

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
peppers so this probably looks slightly

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the biggest one and I guess why most

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.260

in<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.070> pot<00:03:29.280> or<00:03:29.310> well<00:03:29.730> obviously<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:30.209> bucket

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
in in a pot or well obviously a bucket

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.970 
in in a pot or well obviously a bucket
but<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.200> see<00:03:31.350> how<00:03:31.470> well<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.650> grows<00:03:31.950> in

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
but just to see how well it grows in

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.650 
but just to see how well it grows in
comparison<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.820> ones<00:03:33.030> kind<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.360> upside

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
comparison to the ones kind of upside

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.510 
comparison to the ones kind of upside
down<00:03:33.690> it's<00:03:34.320> not<00:03:34.440> too<00:03:34.590> scientific<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.430> an

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
down it's not too scientific of an

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.270 
down it's not too scientific of an
experiment<00:03:36.090> as<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:37.650> they're<00:03:37.800> not<00:03:37.830> grown

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
experiment as you know they're not grown

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.740 
experiment as you know they're not grown
didn't<00:03:38.610> start<00:03:38.790> at<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.880> same<00:03:39.060> time<00:03:39.300> as<00:03:39.360> this

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
didn't start at the same time as this

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.840 
didn't start at the same time as this
one<00:03:39.959> was<00:03:40.050> just<00:03:40.110> planted<00:03:40.620> actually<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.670> couple

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
one was just planted actually a couple

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.510 
one was just planted actually a couple
days<00:03:42.150> ago<00:03:42.180> but<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:42.989> one's<00:03:43.200> actually<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.530> it's

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
days ago but this one's actually I it's

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.430 
days ago but this one's actually I it's
night<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.760> day<00:03:44.910> from<00:03:45.000> when<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.750> planted<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.260> I

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
night and day from when I planted it I

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.729 
night and day from when I planted it I
think<00:03:47.120> wednesday<00:03:48.120> or<00:03:48.300> thursday<00:03:48.360> maybe<00:03:48.870> to

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
think wednesday or thursday maybe to

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.380 
think wednesday or thursday maybe to
where<00:03:49.860> it's<00:03:49.980> grown<00:03:50.130> today<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:50.730> noon<00:03:50.940> it's

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
where it's grown today so it's noon it's

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.110 
where it's grown today so it's noon it's
doing<00:03:51.630> really<00:03:51.660> well<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:53.220> soil<00:03:53.580> actually<00:03:54.030> I

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
doing really well the soil actually I

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.240 
doing really well the soil actually I
gotten<00:03:54.420> this<00:03:54.510> one<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.840> different<00:03:54.959> than<00:03:55.860> some

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
gotten this one is different than some

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.890 
gotten this one is different than some
of<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.430> soils<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.850> initially<00:03:57.270> planted<00:03:57.510> it's

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
of the soils I initially planted it's

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.240 
of the soils I initially planted it's
all<00:03:58.140> it's<00:03:58.350> still<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.680> same<00:03:58.860> miracle-gro

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
all it's still the same miracle-gro

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.370 
all it's still the same miracle-gro
moisture<00:03:59.850> control<00:04:00.120> but<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.870> ones<00:04:01.080> i

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
moisture control but the ones i

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.650 
moisture control but the ones i
originally<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:02.459> was<00:04:02.610> not<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.120> potting<00:04:03.450> soil

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
originally it was not the potting soil

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.720 
originally it was not the potting soil
type<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.110> i<00:04:04.230> didn't<00:04:04.500> notice<00:04:04.650> one<00:04:05.580> of<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
type and i didn't notice one of the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.490 
type and i didn't notice one of the
mistakes<00:04:05.850> or<00:04:06.360> not<00:04:06.600> really<00:04:06.720> mistakes<00:04:07.140> but<00:04:07.320> just

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
mistakes or not really mistakes but just

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.870 
mistakes or not really mistakes but just
things<00:04:07.680> i<00:04:07.770> didn't<00:04:07.950> even<00:04:08.100> think<00:04:08.220> about<00:04:08.340> was

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
things i didn't even think about was

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.190 
things i didn't even think about was
getting<00:04:09.000> potting<00:04:09.390> soil<00:04:09.660> when<00:04:09.780> putting<00:04:09.989> them

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
getting potting soil when putting them

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.890 
getting potting soil when putting them
in<00:04:10.410> in<00:04:10.860> pots<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.700> finally<00:04:12.480> got<00:04:12.600> potting

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
in in pots and the finally got potting

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.510 
in in pots and the finally got potting
soil<00:04:13.140> which<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.709> like<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.040> new<00:04:14.190> ones<00:04:14.370> like

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
soil which is in like the new ones like

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.979 
soil which is in like the new ones like
the<00:04:14.640> eggplant<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.120> peppers<00:04:15.390> i<00:04:15.510> planted<00:04:15.840> today

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
the eggplant the peppers i planted today

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.539 
the eggplant the peppers i planted today
and<00:04:16.290> then<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.530> one<00:04:16.680> down<00:04:16.830> there<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.190> mostly

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
and then that one down there but mostly

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.010 
and then that one down there but mostly
i<00:04:18.209> don't<00:04:18.510> think<00:04:18.630> there's<00:04:18.750> any<00:04:18.870> difference

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
i don't think there's any difference

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.170 
i don't think there's any difference
other<00:04:19.440> than<00:04:19.470> weight<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.640> so<00:04:21.000> much

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
other than weight and it is so so much

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.060 
other than weight and it is so so much
lighter<00:04:21.480> add<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.109> one<00:04:22.260> tomato<00:04:22.500> plant<00:04:22.830> fall

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
lighter add that one tomato plant fall

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.800 
lighter add that one tomato plant fall
and<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.610> probably<00:04:23.850> i<00:04:24.150> mean<00:04:24.330> probably<00:04:24.450> still

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
and it probably i mean probably still

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.800 
and it probably i mean probably still
would<00:04:24.960> have<00:04:24.990> because<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.320> screwed<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.770> into<00:04:26.070> a

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
would have because I screwed it into a

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.000 
would have because I screwed it into a
a<00:04:26.840> broken<00:04:27.139> piece<00:04:27.470> where<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.740> was<00:04:27.860> already

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
a broken piece where I was already

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.940 
a broken piece where I was already
cracked<00:04:28.340> on<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.550> wood<00:04:28.730> but<00:04:29.620> but<00:04:30.620> it's<00:04:30.770> like

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
cracked on the wood but but it's like

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.290 
cracked on the wood but but it's like
it's<00:04:31.100> literally<00:04:31.430> night<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:31.730> day<00:04:31.940> for<00:04:32.180> though

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
it's literally night and day for though

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.820 
it's literally night and day for though
for<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.570> wait<00:04:32.810> on<00:04:32.960> these<00:04:33.139> things<00:04:33.410> it's<00:04:33.620> so

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
for the wait on these things it's so

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.409 
for the wait on these things it's so
much<00:04:34.010> lighter<00:04:34.280> probably<00:04:34.790> maybe<00:04:35.240> not

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
much lighter probably maybe not

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.240 
much lighter probably maybe not
necessarily<00:04:35.540> half<00:04:36.050> but<00:04:36.440> pretty<00:04:36.770> close<00:04:36.980> to

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
necessarily half but pretty close to

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.370 
necessarily half but pretty close to
about<00:04:37.370> half<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.790> weight<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.090> seems<00:04:38.380> when

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
about half the weight it seems when

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.350 
about half the weight it seems when
these<00:04:39.530> things<00:04:39.560> are<00:04:39.860> hanging<00:04:40.190> up<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.520> put<00:04:41.180> down

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
these things are hanging up I put down

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.540 
these things are hanging up I put down
my<00:04:42.070> strawberries<00:04:43.070> they<00:04:43.190> didn't<00:04:43.340> need<00:04:43.460> to

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
my strawberries they didn't need to

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.980 
my strawberries they didn't need to
heavy<00:04:43.700> hanging<00:04:44.060> in<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.240> first<00:04:44.419> place<00:04:44.570> I<00:04:44.780> kind

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
heavy hanging in the first place I kind

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.110 
heavy hanging in the first place I kind
of<00:04:45.020> did<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.200> originally<00:04:45.950> just<00:04:46.250> for<00:04:46.520> for

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
of did it originally just for for

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.390 
of did it originally just for for
aesthetics<00:04:47.540> and<00:04:47.720> since<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.800> wanted<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.100> put<00:04:49.250> up

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
aesthetics and since I wanted to put up

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.700 
aesthetics and since I wanted to put up
I<00:04:49.550> didn't<00:04:49.790> have<00:04:49.880> another<00:04:50.060> hug<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.540> hang<00:04:50.750> both

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
I didn't have another hug to hang both

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.250 
I didn't have another hug to hang both
of<00:04:51.770> both<00:04:52.700> of<00:04:52.760> these<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.480> so<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.780> had<00:04:54.020> to<00:04:54.050> take

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
of both of these and so I had to take

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.080 
of both of these and so I had to take
the<00:04:54.560> head<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.250> take<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.460> strawberries<00:04:55.940> down

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
the head to take the strawberries down

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.280 
the head to take the strawberries down

much what's going on things are kind of
growing<00:05:05.660> slowly<00:05:06.050> but<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.410> weather<00:05:06.590> is

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
growing slowly but the weather is

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.080 
growing slowly but the weather is
finally<00:05:06.889> going<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.220> start<00:05:07.400> hitting<00:05:07.639> constant

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
finally going to start hitting constant

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.090 
finally going to start hitting constant
70s<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:08.690> in<00:05:08.810> sunshine<00:05:09.590> we<00:05:09.740> were<00:05:09.830> in<00:05:09.889> a<00:05:09.950> pretty

in a pot because I heard you could do

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.200 
in a pot because I heard you could do

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
that that way didn't have to dig a hole

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.390 
that that way didn't have to dig a hole
in<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.479> hard<00:05:32.660> Georgia<00:05:33.380> clay<00:05:33.560> which<00:05:33.890> is<00:05:34.070> it's

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
in the hard Georgia clay which is it's

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.550 
in the hard Georgia clay which is it's
pretty<00:05:34.550> tough<00:05:34.789> to<00:05:34.850> get<00:05:35.360> into<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:36.289> actually

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
pretty tough to get into and actually

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.140 
pretty tough to get into and actually
there<00:05:36.710> was<00:05:36.800> some<00:05:37.039> some<00:05:37.460> stone<00:05:37.789> underneath

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
there was some some stone underneath

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.909 
there was some some stone underneath
that<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.539> had<00:05:38.660> to<00:05:38.720> bust<00:05:38.930> through<00:05:39.080> as<00:05:39.260> well<00:05:39.440> but<00:05:39.860> I

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
that I had to bust through as well but I

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.170 
that I had to bust through as well but I
just<00:05:40.130> read<00:05:40.280> that<00:05:40.430> one<00:05:40.640> if<00:05:40.729> you<00:05:40.820> dig<00:05:40.970> a<00:05:41.000> big

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
just read that one if you dig a big

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.150 
just read that one if you dig a big
enough<00:05:41.330> hole<00:05:41.390> it's<00:05:41.810> it's<00:05:42.229> fairly<00:05:42.560> deep<00:05:42.860> I<00:05:43.010> mean

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
enough hole it's it's fairly deep I mean

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.260 
enough hole it's it's fairly deep I mean
it's<00:05:43.280> a<00:05:43.370> good<00:05:43.580> two<00:05:44.240> and<00:05:44.510> a<00:05:44.570> half<00:05:44.750> feet<00:05:45.260> deep

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
it's a good two and a half feet deep

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.730 
it's a good two and a half feet deep
this<00:05:47.270> way<00:05:47.450> it<00:05:47.960> can<00:05:48.050> make<00:05:48.169> sure<00:05:48.380> that<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.650> gets

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
this way it can make sure that it gets

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.230 
this way it can make sure that it gets
gets<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.340> roots<00:05:49.520> all<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:49.700> way<00:05:49.820> down<00:05:50.060> there

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
gets the roots all the way down there

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.840 
gets the roots all the way down there
but<00:05:50.390> anyways<00:05:50.660> I<00:05:50.810> stuck<00:05:51.020> it<00:05:51.050> in<00:05:51.490> red<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.610> put<00:05:52.760> it

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
but anyways I stuck it in red to put it

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.980 
but anyways I stuck it in red to put it
pretty<00:05:53.030> close<00:05:53.180> to<00:05:53.330> a<00:05:53.360> fence<00:05:53.630> give<00:05:53.900> it

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
pretty close to a fence give it

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.659 
pretty close to a fence give it
something<00:05:54.169> to<00:05:54.260> kind<00:05:54.410> of<00:05:54.500> grab<00:05:54.710> onto<00:05:55.039> once<00:05:55.550> it

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
something to kind of grab onto once it

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.670 
something to kind of grab onto once it
starts<00:05:55.940> growing<00:05:56.260> but<00:05:57.260> we'll<00:05:57.380> see<00:05:57.470> what<00:05:57.560> it

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
starts growing but we'll see what it

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.040 
starts growing but we'll see what it
produces<00:05:57.800> as<00:05:58.280> I've<00:05:58.460> heard<00:05:58.729> not<00:05:59.570> all<00:05:59.780> of<00:05:59.930> these

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
produces as I've heard not all of these

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.320 
produces as I've heard not all of these
produce<00:06:00.289> in<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:00.680> first<00:06:00.889> year<00:06:01.310> and<00:06:02.120> I<00:06:02.180> think

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
produce in the first year and I think

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.450 
produce in the first year and I think
it's<00:06:02.450> a<00:06:02.479> fall<00:06:02.780> it's<00:06:03.380> a<00:06:03.470> fall<00:06:03.680> producer<00:06:04.190> so<00:06:04.340> it's

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
it's a fall it's a fall producer so it's

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.529 
it's a fall it's a fall producer so it's
going<00:06:04.580> to<00:06:04.669> go<00:06:04.760> through<00:06:04.970> all<00:06:05.000> summer<00:06:05.300> probably

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
going to go through all summer probably

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.540 
going to go through all summer probably
without<00:06:05.840> any<00:06:06.050> raspberries<00:06:06.590> but<00:06:06.740> anyways<00:06:07.039> put

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
without any raspberries but anyways put

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.120 
without any raspberries but anyways put
in<00:06:07.639> the<00:06:07.729> corner<00:06:08.060> looks<00:06:08.389> okay<00:06:08.720> not<00:06:09.650> really<00:06:09.889> sore

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
in the corner looks okay not really sore

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.580 
in the corner looks okay not really sore
thumb<00:06:10.370> but<00:06:10.970> but<00:06:11.570> yeah<00:06:11.660> so<00:06:11.840> I'll<00:06:11.930> dub<00:06:12.139> probably

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
thumb but but yeah so I'll dub probably

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.840 
thumb but but yeah so I'll dub probably
update<00:06:12.710> again<00:06:13.010> in<00:06:13.130> a<00:06:13.220> couple<00:06:13.250> weeks<00:06:13.580> hopefully

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
update again in a couple weeks hopefully

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.129 
update again in a couple weeks hopefully
things<00:06:14.090> will<00:06:14.240> be<00:06:14.330> growing<00:06:14.570> a<00:06:14.660> little<00:06:14.900> bit

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
things will be growing a little bit

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.890 
things will be growing a little bit
quicker<00:06:15.380> now<00:06:15.970> my<00:06:16.970> the<00:06:17.510> only<00:06:17.690> thing<00:06:17.780> that's

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
quicker now my the only thing that's

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.100 
quicker now my the only thing that's
growing<00:06:18.080> really<00:06:18.410> fast<00:06:18.530> for<00:06:19.010> me<00:06:19.130> is<00:06:19.660> is<00:06:20.660> my<00:06:20.870> mint

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
growing really fast for me is is my mint

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.250 
growing really fast for me is is my mint
and<00:06:21.350> it's<00:06:22.010> grown<00:06:22.330> tremendously<00:06:23.330> since<00:06:24.080> it

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
and it's grown tremendously since it

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.690
