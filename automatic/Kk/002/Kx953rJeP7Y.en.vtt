couple<00:02:18.830> more<00:02:18.920> coin<00:02:19.160> making<00:02:19.430> methods<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.330> we

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
couple more coin making methods that we

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.690 
couple more coin making methods that we
could<00:02:20.630> do<00:02:20.780> but<00:02:21.110> some<00:02:22.099> people<00:02:22.370> say<00:02:22.550> they<00:02:22.670> don't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
could do but some people say they don't

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.290 
could do but some people say they don't
like<00:02:23.000> those<00:02:23.209> because<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.660> ruins<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.050> meth

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
like those because it ruins the meth

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
like those because it ruins the meth
but<00:02:24.720> again<00:02:25.620> I'm<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.130> say<00:02:26.310> that's<00:02:26.490> not

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
but again I'm going to say that's not

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.490 
but again I'm going to say that's not
true<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.420> still<00:02:27.690> use<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.080> gold<00:02:28.320> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
