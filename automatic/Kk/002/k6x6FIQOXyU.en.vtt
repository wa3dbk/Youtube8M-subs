00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.970
 let's make a blanket to which I 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.940
 I call this staircase blanket in 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.759
 several Israeli blogs and I'm going to 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:19.269
 teach to do we make a chain of 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:19.269
 13 we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.250
 789 and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:33.460
 11 12 and 13 from the crochet we count 4 and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.460
 we started doing whole 1 2 3 4 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.380
 one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.840
 2 in total we will have 10 integers 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.840
 counting from the chain we have 1 2 3 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 4 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000
 5 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.700
 7 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.609
 8 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.080
 9 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.310
 And it is 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.909
 we count again to satiate one two 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.369
 three four five six seven eight nine 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.420
 ten if we have spare chains there is no 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.980
 problem because we disarm it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:34.810
 to this we dismantle the chain and close 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.810
 here we close the fabric we cut the thread 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.290
 and we have our first part ok let's go 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.290
 to take another thread now 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.909
 here I have already prepared my other thread 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.909
 and we are going to make a ring 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.540
 this ring 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.090
 we're going to go through here here I have my 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.730
 Initial tea sing in the first 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:08.009
 chain of the beginning 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:12.709
 ie here we we put 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.709
 the little ear we adjust well 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.750
 and we do the first little pass and we're going to 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:29.880
 make 12 chains 1 2 3 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:32.340
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.110
 we count from the crochet forward 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.530
 in the fourth we make the first point 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.300
 whole one two three four here we are going to 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.910
 make the first whole 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.910
 we already have two cutting the chain 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.100
 4 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.970
 or 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.360
 t 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.650
 8 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.219
 9 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.670
 and 10 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.970
 ok up there we already have 3 we make a 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.040
 past point where our 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.740
 chains that replace the whole point 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.020
 we made a past ok 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.070
 come and there are two colors here 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.650
 we raise three chains one two three and 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.880
 we make a whole point about each point 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.380
 of color 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:50.690
 one 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.690
 2 with the chain we would have 3 4 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.760
 com 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.790
 7 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.400
 8 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.180
 9 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.180
 and 10 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:19.979
 ok we cut the thread again 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.840
 we close the fabric and we start again 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.570
 we put here the new wool we make the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.050
 12 chains we started doing the 10 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.020
 whole past 10 whole last 10 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.639
 whole and we do again and so we are going to 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.970
 follow up to the size that we 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.970
 let's want
