bit hard to make them stand up but

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
bit hard to make them stand up but
you'll<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> hang<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> trust<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.009> and

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.400 
gonna put clear about here and I'll show
you<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.100> viewfinder<00:03:32.630> she<00:03:33.630> looks<00:03:33.840> about<00:03:34.020> there

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
so she's prepped pretty much where she

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.500 
so she's prepped pretty much where she
was<00:03:37.550> so<00:03:38.550> I'm<00:03:38.610> just<00:03:38.760> gonna<00:03:38.850> take<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.300> picture

about an inch just come back take

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.770 
about an inch just come back take
another<00:03:48.930> picture<00:03:50.480> basically<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.630> most

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
another picture basically the most

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.540 
another picture basically the most
important<00:03:52.290> part<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.620> tape<00:03:52.800> making<00:03:53.130> stop

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
important part of tape making stop

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.510 
important part of tape making stop
motions<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.300> keeping<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> camera<00:03:55.590> steady<00:03:55.860> now

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
motions is keeping the camera steady now

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.220 
motions is keeping the camera steady now
if<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.760> don't<00:03:56.940> have<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> tripod<00:03:57.390> there's<00:03:57.870> tons

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
if you don't have a tripod there's tons

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.190 
if you don't have a tripod there's tons
of<00:03:58.380> alternatives<00:03:59.060> I<00:04:00.060> didn't<00:04:00.780> always<00:04:00.930> have<00:04:01.170> a

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
of alternatives I didn't always have a

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.440 
of alternatives I didn't always have a
tripod<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.040> for<00:04:02.490> alternatives<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.210> use

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
tripod and for alternatives you can use

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.800 
tripod and for alternatives you can use
things<00:04:03.630> like<00:04:03.780> tables<00:04:04.440> chairs<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:06.270> can<00:04:06.300> always

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
things like tables chairs you can always

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.230 
things like tables chairs you can always
hold<00:04:07.080> have<00:04:07.470> someone<00:04:07.830> hold<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.100> camera<00:04:08.580> but

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
hold have someone hold the camera but

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.230 
hold have someone hold the camera but
honestly<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.840> would<00:04:10.170> not<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.910> don't<00:04:11.910> think<00:04:12.150> you

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
honestly I would not I don't think you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.300 
honestly I would not I don't think you
should<00:04:12.420> use<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.600> way<00:04:12.870> because<00:04:13.260> it's<00:04:13.530> not<00:04:13.830> the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
should use that way because it's not the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.229 
should use that way because it's not the
best<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:17.250> I'm<00:04:17.340> trying<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.640> get<00:04:17.760> her<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:17.940> stand

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
best so I'm trying to get her to stand

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.789 
best so I'm trying to get her to stand
here<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.840> when<00:04:19.230> you're<00:04:19.320> doing<00:04:19.440> when<00:04:19.650> your

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
here and when you're doing when your

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.670 
here and when you're doing when your
dolls<00:04:20.190> legs<00:04:20.489> get<00:04:20.790> kind<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.090> like<00:04:21.210> loose<00:04:21.540> is<00:04:21.989> a

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
dolls legs get kind of like loose is a

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.400 
dolls legs get kind of like loose is a
lot

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
lot

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.430 
lot
harder<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.950> do<00:04:24.190> as<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:25.600> can<00:04:25.780> see<00:04:25.990> I'm<00:04:26.110> having<00:04:26.260> a

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
harder to do as you can see I'm having a

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.040 
harder to do as you can see I'm having a
little<00:04:26.560> trouble<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.850> if<00:04:28.150> you're<00:04:28.420> new<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.660> stop

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
little trouble so if you're new to stop

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.430 
little trouble so if you're new to stop
motions<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.770> really<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.610> think<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.960> best<00:04:32.170> ways

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
motions I really I think the best ways

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.680 
motions I really I think the best ways
to<00:04:32.470> have<00:04:32.830> your<00:04:33.010> doll<00:04:33.220> sit<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:33.790> just<00:04:34.150> practice

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
to have your doll sit in just practice

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.290 
to have your doll sit in just practice
making<00:04:35.110> her<00:04:35.230> wave<00:04:35.550> which<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.580> real<00:04:36.880> easy<00:04:37.120> to

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
making her wave which is real easy to

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.940 
making her wave which is real easy to
just<00:04:37.390> move<00:04:37.900> her<00:04:38.080> arm<00:04:38.290> instead<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.620> her<00:04:38.770> whole

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
just move her arm instead of her whole

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.040 
just move her arm instead of her whole
body<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.580> come<00:04:39.820> over<00:04:39.970> take<00:04:40.780> another
