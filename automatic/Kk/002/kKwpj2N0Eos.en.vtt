00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.490 
optional to have the lots of rotten on
the<00:00:44.270> rear<00:00:44.450> hatch<00:00:44.690> because<00:00:44.900> you<00:00:45.080> never<00:00:45.200> have<00:00:45.410> to

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
the rear hatch because you never have to

cares had a good life but the main
reason<00:01:00.290> I'm<00:01:00.410> pulling<00:01:00.739> off<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:00.980> road<00:01:01.160> is

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
reason I'm pulling off the road is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.910 
reason I'm pulling off the road is
because<00:01:01.550> all<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.840> wiring<00:01:03.290> is<00:01:03.379> fried<00:01:03.680> in

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
because all the the wiring is fried in

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.830 
because all the the wiring is fried in
the<00:01:04.010> car<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:04.940> nothing<00:01:05.270> really<00:01:05.300> where<00:01:05.720> it's

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
the car so nothing really where it's

the car so nothing really where it's
proper<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:07.520> if<00:01:07.759> I<00:01:07.880> don't<00:01:08.090> take<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.330> off<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
proper so if I don't take it off the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.609 
proper so if I don't take it off the
road<00:01:08.780> someone<00:01:09.229> will<00:01:09.440> I<00:01:10.990> don't<00:01:11.990> know<00:01:12.170> why<00:01:12.350> but

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.020 
at 183 kilometers it's another pit stop
but<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.540> got<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.810> get<00:03:59.900> going<00:03:59.959> as<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:01.030> sun's

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
but I got to get going as the sun's

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.190 
but I got to get going as the sun's
running<00:04:02.360> out

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
running out

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.589 
running out
I<00:04:04.230> think<00:04:05.040> at<00:04:05.220> three<00:04:05.490> hundred<00:04:05.610> two<00:04:05.970> kilometers

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
I think at three hundred two kilometers

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.930 
I think at three hundred two kilometers
in<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.810> bit<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.290> did<00:04:07.590> well<00:04:07.890> with<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.520> vegetable

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
in a bit I did well with the vegetable

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.990 
in a bit I did well with the vegetable
oil<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.630> engine<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:10.670> think<00:04:11.670> it's<00:04:11.760> safe<00:04:11.970> to

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
oil in the engine I think it's safe to

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.350 
oil in the engine I think it's safe to
say<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.660> experiment<00:04:13.410> went<00:04:13.620> pretty<00:04:13.830> good<00:04:14.360> but

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
say this experiment went pretty good but

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.030 
say this experiment went pretty good but
anyways<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.870> cars<00:04:16.139> off<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> road

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
anyways this cars off the road

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.170 
anyways this cars off the road
at<00:04:17.549> midnight<00:04:18.260> so<00:04:19.700> probably<00:04:20.700> only<00:04:20.910> future

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
at midnight so probably only future

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.060 
at midnight so probably only future
videos<00:04:21.660> will<00:04:21.870> be<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.290> car<00:04:22.530> being<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.950> the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
videos will be this car being in the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.290 
videos will be this car being in the
derby<00:04:23.520> or<00:04:23.990> having<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.230> someone's<00:04:25.680> farm

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
derby or having to that someone's farm

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.650 
derby or having to that someone's farm
so<00:04:27.380> we'll<00:04:28.380> see<00:04:28.560> what<00:04:28.680> happens

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
so we'll see what happens
