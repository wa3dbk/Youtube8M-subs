00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
allows me to put a drawing out of size

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.110 
allows me to put a drawing out of size
that<00:04:08.049> I<00:04:08.170> want<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:09.100> if<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.340> happens<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.819> go<00:04:09.940> off

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
that I want and if it happens to go off

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.179 
that I want and if it happens to go off
the<00:04:10.299> page<00:04:10.510> it'll<00:04:10.840> actually<00:04:11.680> print<00:04:11.950> out<00:04:12.040> on

the page it'll actually print out on

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.820 
the page it'll actually print out on
another<00:04:12.459> page<00:04:12.959> exactly<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.170> can<00:04:14.290> take

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
another page exactly so you can take

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.349 
another page exactly so you can take
take<00:04:15.040> them<00:04:15.220> both<00:04:15.310> together<00:04:15.519> well

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
take them both together well

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.929 
take them both together well
just<00:04:16.569> so<00:04:16.989> happens<00:04:17.439> that<00:04:17.530> this<00:04:17.769> one<00:04:18.009> works<00:04:18.669> out

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:18.939 
just so happens that this one works out

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:23.429 
just so happens that this one works out
fine<00:04:19.269> on<00:04:19.659> one<00:04:20.620> piece<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.430> paper<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.840> as<00:04:23.259> you

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:23.439 
fine on one piece of paper and as you

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.610 
fine on one piece of paper and as you
saw<00:04:23.680> yesterday<00:04:23.979> I<00:04:24.219> measured<00:04:25.349> what<00:04:26.349> I<00:04:26.379> thought

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
saw yesterday I measured what I thought

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.379 
saw yesterday I measured what I thought
the<00:04:26.770> dog's<00:04:27.009> back<00:04:27.400> should<00:04:27.729> come<00:04:27.969> to<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.330> I

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
the dog's back should come to and I

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.869 
the dog's back should come to and I
figured<00:04:28.930> about<00:04:29.080> six<00:04:29.349> lap<00:04:29.560> inches<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.729> this<00:04:30.819> is

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
figured about six lap inches and this is

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.379 
figured about six lap inches and this is
a<00:04:30.969> full-sized<00:04:31.560> ruler<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.590> I<00:04:32.919> had<00:04:33.389> scanned

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
a full-sized ruler that I had scanned

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.350 
a full-sized ruler that I had scanned
into<00:04:34.629> my<00:04:34.840> computer<00:04:36.150> before<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.919> I'm<00:04:39.069> just

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
into my computer before and so I'm just

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.839 
into my computer before and so I'm just
expanding<00:04:40.360> this<00:04:40.689> up<00:04:41.439> from<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.430> bottom<00:04:42.729> of<00:04:42.789> the

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
expanding this up from the bottom of the

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.659 
expanding this up from the bottom of the
ruler<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.780> top<00:04:44.110> of<00:04:44.259> his<00:04:44.349> back<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:45.280> six<00:04:45.520> and

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
ruler to the top of his back to six and

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.969 
ruler to the top of his back to six and
a<00:04:45.699> half<00:04:45.759> inches<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.479> that<00:04:47.169> comes<00:04:47.469> on<00:04:47.650> one

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
a half inches and that comes on one

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.839 
a half inches and that comes on one
piece<00:04:48.189> of<00:04:48.370> paper<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:48.789> I<00:04:48.849> just<00:04:48.960> printed<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:49.990> out

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.350
