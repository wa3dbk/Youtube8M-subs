00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:11.099
 It is immediately Nde Now is there a jerk's tv date of before going to bed has changed 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 12:04 am now, but how to use Wonder Link lte a fool 700 is 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.969
 Sounds good 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.969
 I will measure immediately 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.300
 Yes pin is 59 down 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.570
 How long is it? 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.880
 41 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.880
 It is true that the body of the middle of the night is too late 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:49.520
 no ice picking middle sister is yes yes it's that lt's speed of 700 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:57.010
 But in the high- speed capacity mode of the phone there is also a high-speed capacity of 1 gig at first 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.010
 At this speed, it will take about 10 minutes and measure again 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.360
 Members are 50 people down is 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.360
 How about 38 Pory 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.979
 Again Hey high-speed line's climb will feel like a little weak in 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.170
 Now in such form 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.050
 It seems that it has taken a limit by the point that exceeded 1 giga digit one by one. 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.980
 I'm trying 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.980
 This is right 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.210
 It took me exactly 1.1 I do not want to say 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:51.580
 Basically, it means that it becomes the same regulation value more than 1 giga 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:55.490
 It seems to be the form of a total of about 700 kg or so originally called regulation value 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.210
 A somewhat reassuring evaluation 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.890
 I feel like 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.790
 It may be difficult to see it 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.790

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:37.810
 Now in the morning in the not say that I would like to wait for the morning 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.810

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.409
 Wonder 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.409
 The chamber is a bit low 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.110
 Even so, I'm getting down and 1.25 buds are coming out 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.340
 The ice of

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.910

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.910
 The time we are riding now 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:01.620

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.620

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:45.050
