conjunction with brother bushcraft and I

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.970 
conjunction with brother bushcraft and I

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
think with tops really good

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.650 
think with tops really good
manufacturing<00:00:14.549> techniques<00:00:14.940> they<00:00:15.240> came<00:00:15.630> up

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
manufacturing techniques they came up

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.750 
manufacturing techniques they came up
with<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.900> pretty<00:00:16.020> solid<00:00:16.289> knife<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.460> starting

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
with a pretty solid knife so starting

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.970 
with a pretty solid knife so starting
with<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> sheath<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.750> kydex<00:00:19.140> sheath<00:00:19.199> so

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
with the sheath it's a kydex sheath so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.260 
with the sheath it's a kydex sheath so
it's<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.310> little<00:00:20.460> bit<00:00:20.550> different<00:00:20.910> from<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it's a little bit different from the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.900 
it's a little bit different from the
usual<00:00:21.300> tops<00:00:22.170> knives<00:00:22.439> ballistic<00:00:23.400> nylon<00:00:23.580> sheath

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
usual tops knives ballistic nylon sheath

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.630 
usual tops knives ballistic nylon sheath
with<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> kydex<00:00:24.570> insert<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.189> that<00:00:26.189> may<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.400> good

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
with a kydex insert and that may be good

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.040 
with a kydex insert and that may be good
that<00:00:26.849> maybe<00:00:26.970> been<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.390> don't<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.599> kind<00:00:28.019> of

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
that maybe been I don't know kind of

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
that maybe been I don't know kind of
depends<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.439> person<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:30.000> they<00:00:30.449> did<00:00:30.570> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
have the retention system which is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.870 
have the retention system which is
basically<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:03.270> spring<00:01:04.199> steel<00:01:04.409> clip<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
basically a spring steel clip and the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.640 
basically a spring steel clip and the
thing<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.780> clip<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.200> that

thing I like about this clip is that
it's<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:10.049> retaining<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.680> on

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770

alright<00:01:24.920> cool<00:01:25.920> thing<00:01:26.100> about<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.729> well<00:01:26.909> is

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
alright cool thing about this as well is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.969 
alright cool thing about this as well is
that<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.990> o-ring<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that with this o-ring that they kind of

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069 
that with this o-ring that they kind of
put<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:30.360> fasten<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> really

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
put in there and they fasten it really

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
put in there and they fasten it really
well<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:32.430> takes<00:01:32.640> quite<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> bit<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.090> force<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
well it takes quite a bit of force to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.990 
well it takes quite a bit of force to
turn<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> clip<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.520> probably<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> good

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
turn the clip but that's probably a good

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.609 
turn the clip but that's probably a good
thing<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.840> knife<00:01:37.049> isn't<00:01:37.259> changing

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
thing so that your knife isn't changing

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.880 
thing so that your knife isn't changing
position<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.110> turn<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
position on you and you can turn it to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
position on you and you can turn it to
pretty<00:01:41.430> much<00:01:41.549> 360<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> carry

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
pretty much 360 so if you want to carry

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.380 
pretty much 360 so if you want to carry
it<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.649> an<00:01:43.740> angle<00:01:43.890> depending<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.119> else

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it on an angle depending on what else

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.260 
it on an angle depending on what else
you<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.990> belt<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.740> know

change<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.240> even<00:01:51.420> carry<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
change that and you can even carry it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.399 
change that and you can even carry it
all<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> way<00:01:52.729> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.479> scout<00:01:54.689> positions<00:01:55.170> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
all the way in the scout positions so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
all the way in the scout positions so
you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.890> across<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> bottom<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.700> your<00:01:56.729> back

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
you know across the bottom of your back

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.530 
you know across the bottom of your back
pretty<00:01:57.600> cool<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.670> yeah<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> think<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.420> did

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
pretty cool and yeah so I think they did

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.149 
pretty cool and yeah so I think they did
a<00:02:00.570> pretty<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.869> job<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.259> sheath<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.979> also

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
a pretty good job on the sheath it also

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.340 
a pretty good job on the sheath it also
has<00:02:02.460> two<00:02:03.180> little<00:02:03.270> holes<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.229> put

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
has two little holes here so you can put

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.260 
has two little holes here so you can put
a<00:02:04.380> lanyard<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.979> whatever<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.820> want<00:02:06.030> through

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
a lanyard or whatever you want through

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.290 
a lanyard or whatever you want through
there<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:08.700> into<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> blade<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:11.760> knife

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
there so go into the blade the knife

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.510 
there so go into the blade the knife
for<00:02:13.420> all<00:02:13.570> 10<00:02:14.080> inches<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:15.220> blade

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
for all 10 inches and the blade

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.640 
for all 10 inches and the blade
thickness<00:02:15.760> or<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.660> blade<00:02:16.840> length<00:02:17.080> sorry<00:02:17.440> is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
thickness or the blade length sorry is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.010 
thickness or the blade length sorry is
four<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.730> half<00:02:18.790> inches<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.840> blade

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
four and a half inches the blade

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.600 
four and a half inches the blade
thickness<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.590> three<00:02:20.830> sixteenth<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.370> an<00:02:21.490> inch

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
thickness is three sixteenth of an inch

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.660 
thickness is three sixteenth of an inch
which<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.180> think<00:02:22.810> four<00:02:23.170> knives<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:24.040> general<00:02:24.580> is

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
which I think four knives in general is

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.150 
which I think four knives in general is
probably<00:02:24.970> like<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.300> perfect<00:02:25.480> spot<00:02:25.810> between

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
probably like the perfect spot between

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.450 
probably like the perfect spot between
strength<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.340> slice<00:02:28.090> ability<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.460> steel

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
strength and slice ability and the steel

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.090 
strength and slice ability and the steel
is<00:02:30.730> 1095<00:02:31.270> they<00:02:32.080> differentially<00:02:32.680> temper<00:02:32.950> this

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
is 1095 they differentially temper this

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.950 
is 1095 they differentially temper this
blade<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.970> RC<00:02:34.390> 56<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.170> 58<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:37.210> handle<00:02:37.780> is

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
blade to RC 56 to 58 and the handle is

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.070 
blade to RC 56 to 58 and the handle is
black<00:02:38.260> canvas<00:02:38.650> micarta<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.580> one<00:02:40.510> thing<00:02:40.810> that

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
black canvas micarta and one thing that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.800 
black canvas micarta and one thing that
Joe<00:02:41.620> flowers<00:02:41.980> did<00:02:42.220> was<00:02:42.940> integrate<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.540> design

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
Joe flowers did was integrate the design

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.990 
Joe flowers did was integrate the design
of<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.170> Shango<00:02:44.470> notch<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.160> I'll<00:02:45.520> show<00:02:45.550> that<00:02:45.760> in

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
of the Shango notch so I'll show that in

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.120 
of the Shango notch so I'll show that in
a<00:02:46.120> later<00:02:46.240> video<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:47.740> know<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.010> it's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
a later video but just know that it's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.820 
a later video but just know that it's
there<00:02:48.840> cool<00:02:49.840> things<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.200> they<00:02:50.290> put<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.530> this

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
radiused kind of similar to what they

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.170 
radiused kind of similar to what they
have<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.580> wilderness<00:03:43.000> guide

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
have on the wilderness guide

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.060 
have on the wilderness guide
four-point-oh<00:03:43.930> which<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.350> probably<00:03:44.770> one<00:03:45.040> of

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
four-point-oh which is probably one of

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.910 
four-point-oh which is probably one of
my<00:03:45.160> favorite<00:03:45.459> nights<00:03:45.640> for<00:03:45.820> sure<00:03:45.850> and<00:03:46.770> let's<00:03:47.770> go

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
my favorite nights for sure and let's go

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.590 
my favorite nights for sure and let's go
on<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.250> actual<00:03:48.370> blade<00:03:48.670> from<00:03:49.330> far<00:03:49.570> away

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
on to the actual blade from far away

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.630 
on to the actual blade from far away
this<00:03:50.050> looks<00:03:50.350> like<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.860> traditional<00:03:51.280> scandi

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
this looks like a traditional scandi

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.330 
this looks like a traditional scandi
grind<00:03:51.880> but<00:03:52.540> because<00:03:53.230> scandi<00:03:53.860> grinds<00:03:54.100> are

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
grind but because scandi grinds are

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.370 
grind but because scandi grinds are
often<00:03:54.790> pretty<00:03:55.000> hard<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.480> take<00:03:55.690> care<00:03:55.720> of<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.140> the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
often pretty hard to take care of in the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.720 
often pretty hard to take care of in the
field<00:03:58.290> they<00:03:59.290> decided<00:04:00.070> to<00:04:00.220> go<00:04:00.370> with<00:04:00.580> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
field they decided to go with the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.030 
field they decided to go with the
modified<00:04:01.150> skinny<00:04:01.390> grinds<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:01.930> it's<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.709> scandi

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
modified skinny grinds so it's a scandi

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.030 
modified skinny grinds so it's a scandi
grind<00:04:03.310> with<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.970> very<00:04:04.840> micro<00:04:05.590> bevel<00:04:05.800> right

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
grind with a very micro bevel right

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.080 
grind with a very micro bevel right
there<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.989> reason<00:04:08.170> for<00:04:08.350> that<00:04:08.530> is<00:04:09.090> just

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
there and the reason for that is just

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.360 
there and the reason for that is just
fueled<00:04:10.570> maintenance<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.680> if<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.160> have

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
fueled maintenance so if you have

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.780 
fueled maintenance so if you have
something<00:04:12.670> like<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> smaller<00:04:13.959> field<00:04:14.260> sharpener

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
something like a smaller field sharpener

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.699 
something like a smaller field sharpener
instead<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.820> like<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.030> nice<00:04:16.299> big<00:04:16.750> Japanese

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
instead of like a nice big Japanese

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.949 
instead of like a nice big Japanese
whetstone<00:04:18.190> it's<00:04:19.180> going<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.390> be<00:04:19.510> easy<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.810> touch

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
whetstone it's going to be easy to touch

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.770 
whetstone it's going to be easy to touch
at<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.140> blade<00:04:20.380> say<00:04:20.890> if<00:04:21.190> you're<00:04:21.400> out<00:04:21.789> for<00:04:22.360> you

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
at the blade say if you're out for you

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.930 
at the blade say if you're out for you
know<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.930> week<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:23.800> can't<00:04:24.039> have<00:04:24.280> all<00:04:24.640> this

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
know a week and you can't have all this

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.280 
know a week and you can't have all this
gear<00:04:25.150> with<00:04:25.330> you

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
gear with you

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.220 
gear with you
that's<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.650> pretty<00:04:26.830> good<00:04:26.950> option<00:04:27.480> so<00:04:28.480> yeah<00:04:29.050> I

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
that's a pretty good option so yeah I

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.950 
that's a pretty good option so yeah I
really<00:04:29.500> like<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.800> knife<00:04:29.950> a<00:04:30.070> lot<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.810> from<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
really like the knife a lot and from the

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.120 
really like the knife a lot and from the
factory<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.920> comes<00:04:33.220> pretty<00:04:33.760> darn<00:04:34.030> sharp<00:04:34.300> and

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
factory it comes pretty darn sharp and

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.230 
factory it comes pretty darn sharp and
one<00:04:36.130> thing<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.550> also<00:04:36.730> liked<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.180> they

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
one thing that I also liked that they

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.120 
one thing that I also liked that they
did<00:04:37.450> about<00:04:37.540> this<00:04:37.810> plate<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.200> they<00:04:38.470> decided<00:04:38.950> not

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
did about this plate is they decided not

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.330 
did about this plate is they decided not
to<00:04:39.250> put<00:04:39.430> any<00:04:40.090> traction<00:04:40.450> coating<00:04:41.020> on<00:04:41.340> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
to put any traction coating on the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.360 
to put any traction coating on the
actual<00:04:42.760> cutting<00:04:43.750> edge<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.860> reason<00:04:45.160> that

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
actual cutting edge and the reason that

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.070 
actual cutting edge and the reason that
they<00:04:45.670> didn't<00:04:45.940> do<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.240> think<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.840> cut

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
they didn't do that I think is to cut

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.050 
they didn't do that I think is to cut
down<00:04:47.230> on<00:04:47.290> friction<00:04:47.740> so<00:04:48.250> if<00:04:48.670> you're<00:04:48.820> doing<00:04:49.030> a

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
down on friction so if you're doing a

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.330 
down on friction so if you're doing a
lot<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.240> we're<00:04:49.450> working<00:04:49.860> it's<00:04:50.860> going<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.130> be<00:04:51.310> a

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
lot of we're working it's going to be a

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.050 
lot of we're working it's going to be a
lot<00:04:51.610> less<00:04:51.940> you<00:04:52.660> know<00:04:52.750> bind<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.380> grab<00:04:53.650> but<00:04:54.460> from

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
lot less you know bind and grab but from

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.260 
lot less you know bind and grab but from
the<00:04:55.180> factory<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:56.260> comes<00:04:56.500> pretty<00:04:56.680> sharp<00:04:57.040> and

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
the factory it comes pretty sharp and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.710 
the factory it comes pretty sharp and
surprisingly<00:04:58.270> so<00:05:00.060> yeah<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:02.320> yeah<00:05:03.690> overall<00:05:04.690> I

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
surprisingly so yeah so yeah overall I

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.210 
surprisingly so yeah so yeah overall I
think<00:05:04.900> this<00:05:05.110> map<00:05:05.290> is<00:05:05.320> pretty<00:05:05.620> cool<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.980> can't

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
think this map is pretty cool I can't

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.130 
think this map is pretty cool I can't
wait<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.400> test<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.760> out<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:06.910> kind<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.750> give<00:05:07.960> you

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
wait to test it out and kind of give you

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.530 
wait to test it out and kind of give you
my<00:05:08.380> fueled<00:05:08.920> impressions<00:05:09.310> on<00:05:09.460> it<00:05:09.580> but<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.450> know

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
my fueled impressions on it but you know

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.420 
my fueled impressions on it but you know
it's<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:10.750> really<00:05:10.930> solid<00:05:11.170> knife<00:05:11.470> I<00:05:11.770> like

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
it's a really solid knife I like

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.710 
it's a really solid knife I like
everything<00:05:12.640> they<00:05:12.880> did<00:05:12.940> from<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:13.540> fit<00:05:13.690> and

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
everything they did from it the fit and

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.570 
everything they did from it the fit and
finish<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:14.140> really<00:05:14.170> good<00:05:14.560> from<00:05:14.890> you<00:05:15.310> know<00:05:15.430> the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
finish is really good from you know the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.660 
finish is really good from you know the
liners<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:17.100> rivets<00:05:18.100> or<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.430> screws

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
liners to the rivets or the screws

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.630 
liners to the rivets or the screws
actually<00:05:19.120> all<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.290> way<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:21.130> micro<00:05:21.490> edge

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
actually all the way to the micro edge

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.410 
actually all the way to the micro edge
and<00:05:21.910> it's<00:05:22.660> very<00:05:22.930> even<00:05:23.380> very<00:05:23.890> uniform<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.670> it

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
and it's very even very uniform and it

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.950 
and it's very even very uniform and it
feels<00:05:25.630> like<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.810> really<00:05:26.050> solid<00:05:26.380> knife<00:05:27.600> so<00:05:28.600> hope

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
feels like a really solid knife so hope

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.540 
feels like a really solid knife so hope
you<00:05:28.990> guys<00:05:29.140> look<00:05:29.440> forward<00:05:29.740> to<00:05:29.860> my<00:05:30.040> field<00:05:30.310> review
