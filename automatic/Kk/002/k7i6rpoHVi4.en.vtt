 I'll show you the garden buscardi 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.710
 top sound and accessories because when the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.540
 people talk about sound quality without 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.610
 No doubt any of us talking about tops are 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.130
 accessories one hour understands everything knows 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.450
 All Sound Makes Sealed Boxes Does 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.160
 that sound of your car stay 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.790
 extraordinary beauty point everyone 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.529
 know this 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.239
 you may not know that now the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.489
 evil is also doing maintenance 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.980
 cleaning and sanitation installation 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.649
 complete air conditioning both from 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.570
 rural vehicles and vehicles that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.350
 you have in your home your car your 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.480
 pickup truck 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.550
 take a look to show you and when 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 we speak here of the certainly option 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 no more the guy who understands only one 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.800
 city we already said this to you 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.870
 We are not seeing a box here but we are not 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.489
 It's not even reversed if you do the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.890
 People make the fight here. 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.499
 the total application here you made the box 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.570
 did the oracle tell you what it is like 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.660
 its name is 12 speaker size 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.179
 inches speaking bravox speaks of 350 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 watts rms will be accommodated these boxes 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.830
 of serious paper 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.930
 This is it, it's sparrow gravo subgrave ta 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.690
 here we are going to see the show that Luis we 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.400
 Let's put it here that the two are 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.510
 two things white ac are two 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.710
 amplifiers 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.410
 one is for two 12-inch box and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.480
 another search engine for the voice then the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.860
 find the lowest rate with these 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.870
 equipment here I can have that 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.330
 sound quality but if not 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.310
 you have heard good and 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.130
 real knowledge will not be good 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.440
 We value the sound quality. 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.940
 brings a good regulation that the guy 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.750
 can identify frequencies are 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.370
 playing 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.620
 I remember that it used to be a 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.360
 was the pioneer of the 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.740
 that kill only this divisor of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.050
 frequency no longer needs 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 today is not as necessary modes today 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.330
 the amplifiers already come with the cuts 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.100
 we then need and and got a 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.600
 little aside the frequency divisions but 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.700
 exist within the modules 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.960
 We are saying this by the following 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.810
 situation for you to see that really 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.850
 who understands is mauro business pioneer 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.069
 no doubt understands only one 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.479
 barbarity knows everything, it takes a 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.400
 sound quality 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.770
 the accessories now also air option 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.180
 condition that you come here 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.100
 it is not new here of the top sound and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.470
 accessories that is 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.770
 swimming in the air kit installation 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.330
 conditioner in your car 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.250
 maintenance and cleaning of air 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.320
 your car's condition or 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.420
 recharge as we are seeing here all 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.110
 the system for recharging the gas in the air 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.580
 conditioning 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.740
 there happens next I talk to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.780
 Mauro because something that calls me 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.670
 attention at the time you do not just do this 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.470
 recharge this installation this 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.350
 hygienization of air conditioning in 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.340
 cars we do in cars 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.930
 and also in the agricultural area of that 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.820
 tractors those harvesters who 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.440
 have conditioned you are also fit 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.630
 Yes, we'll keep the maintenance. 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.630
 in this line of heavy duty personnel 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.790
 flame trucks and tractors machines 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.230
 cane harvesters all here 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.240
 that you have in your hand that shows me 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.000
 here we want this demand 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.360
 this is a cabin filter is a filter 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.850
 which is to filter the air that neither external 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.010
 and internal, which is what protects the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.650
 guaranty breathes inside the car is 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.350
 but here it lasts as much as I pilot more or 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.450
 less sure is to change every 20 thousand 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.430
 9 to Sunday 11 and changed the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.350
 acceleration of the internal system of the car 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.450
 Let's see what league we're going to see. I'll show you. 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.640
 How does this hygiene show? 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.950
 that this machine here 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.490
 We turn this machine on and it gives us a 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.980
 look 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.720
 us links that machine is the car 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.520
 on how long the air conditioner 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.890
 of the car is connected with this machine 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.160
 doing the organization 40 minutes in the 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.970
 minimum 40 minutes she stays is steaming year 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.070
 the liquid is the organizer 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.240
 This makes the whole organization 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.310
 car internal system 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.630
 I mean who has a child who goes out with 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.370
 child in the car has air conditioning 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.000
 necessarily every 20 thousand 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.890
 kilometers 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.750
 You have to come here to change the 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.070
 pass this machine let the 40 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.500
 minutes at least to do 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.230
 cleanliness and protection of the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.850
 health of car occupants without a doubt 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.070
 none is conditioned is very good for 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.560
 The city marvels everything else only if it 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.780
 It does not make things right. It gets weird. 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.359
 for heavy also this 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.190
 sanitation with certainty in cases weighing 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.200
 also the tractors are all 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.290
 come with the cabin filter and have to be 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.840
 Angolan swapped in even better intervals 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.910
 because they work in the area 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.919
 where there is a lot of dust in the agricultural area 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.110
 then a slightly shorter interval 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.669
 making options and accessories is the 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.830
 really sound top that we already 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.710
 You know I told you, it 's raining there. 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.210
 wet to speak well of evil is is is normal and 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.860
 everybody knows this quality 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.270
 now also with air conditioning 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.060
 let's go to the telephone address 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.840
 mobile is the 1,237 itÃ¡polis here in the village 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.310
 search on the phone 3384 3268 want to move 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.750

 Decent in your car 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.669
 I'll repeat make a decent sound in your 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.010
 car thing good option and accessories either 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.560
 fiddle with air conditioning and the top sound and 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.430
 is able to do with the workforce 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.530
 specialized 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.650
 I'm just glad you 're waiting for 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.650
