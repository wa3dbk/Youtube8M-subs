savanna habitat some of the animals that

savanna habitat some of the animals that
we<00:03:12.110> find<00:03:12.140> here<00:03:12.710> are<00:03:12.920> Alliance<00:03:13.690> elephants

this<00:03:20.690> brings<00:03:21.020> us<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.380> end<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.710> our<00:03:21.860> journey

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
this brings us to the end of our journey

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.010 
this brings us to the end of our journey
hopefully<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.150> journey<00:03:23.420> through<00:03:23.630> animal

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
hopefully this journey through animal

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.330 
hopefully this journey through animal
habitats<00:03:24.500> has<00:03:24.740> given<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.160> better

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
habitats has given you a better

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.310 
habitats has given you a better
understanding<00:03:26.210> of<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.540> different<00:03:26.930> types<00:03:27.140> of

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
understanding of the different types of

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.470 
understanding of the different types of
animals<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.250> different<00:03:28.670> habitats<00:03:29.210> in

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
animals and the different habitats in

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.020 
animals and the different habitats in
which<00:03:29.510> they<00:03:29.840> live<00:03:30.130> not<00:03:31.130> every<00:03:31.460> animal<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:31.880> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
which they live not every animal is the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.480 
which they live not every animal is the
same<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.540> as<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.690> result<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:33.590> animals<00:03:34.280> have

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
same and as a result all animals have

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.580 
same and as a result all animals have
different<00:03:34.970> needs<00:03:35.090> next<00:03:35.990> time<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.290> see<00:03:36.500> an

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
different needs next time you see an

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.290 
different needs next time you see an
animal<00:03:37.010> think<00:03:37.400> about<00:03:37.610> what<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:37.970> needs<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
animal think about what it needs to

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.130 
animal think about what it needs to
survive<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:39.080> where<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.650> might<00:03:39.830> live
