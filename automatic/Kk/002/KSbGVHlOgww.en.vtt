00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
bundle is like a spiral or whatever I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.530 
bundle is like a spiral or whatever I
didn't<00:02:20.580> take<00:02:20.670> any<00:02:20.879> pictures<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.360> hair

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
didn't take any pictures of the hair

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.229 
didn't take any pictures of the hair
when<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.720> first<00:02:21.989> received<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.489> you'll<00:02:23.970> see

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
when I first received it but you'll see

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.080 
when I first received it but you'll see
um<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:25.200> should<00:02:25.379> see<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.430> site<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.909> has

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
um you should see on the site it has

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.690 
um you should see on the site it has
like<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.629> spiral<00:02:28.590> curl<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:29.190> or<00:02:29.489> whatever

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
like this spiral curl to it or whatever

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.530 
like this spiral curl to it or whatever
and<00:02:30.150> then<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.959> just<00:02:31.110> took<00:02:31.260> my<00:02:31.349> wand<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.549> did

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
and then I just took my wand and did

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.569 
and then I just took my wand and did
kind<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.230> right<00:02:34.530> here<00:02:34.799> just<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.459> would

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
kind of this right here just so it would

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.309 
kind of this right here just so it would
match<00:02:35.849> because<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.269> was<00:02:36.390> still<00:02:36.599> like<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:37.200> was

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
match because it was still like it was

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.330 
match because it was still like it was
kind<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:37.860> side<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.159> was<00:02:38.220> like

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
kind of like on this side it was like

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.160 
kind of like on this side it was like
really<00:02:38.640> flat<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.599> went<00:02:39.750> into<00:02:40.049> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
really flat and then and went into it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.380 
really flat and then and went into it
and<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.379> don't<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.860> when<00:02:41.790> they<00:02:41.879> gave<00:02:42.120> me

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
and I don't like that when they gave me

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.449 
and I don't like that when they gave me
when<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> came<00:02:43.079> they<00:02:43.379> came<00:02:43.590> with<00:02:43.739> these<00:02:43.920> flexi

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
when it came they came with these flexi

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.819 
when it came they came with these flexi
rods<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:45.120> free<00:02:45.390> these<00:02:45.900> are<00:02:46.079> just<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.349> smaller

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
rods for free these are just the smaller

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.089 
rods for free these are just the smaller
ones<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.519> don't<00:02:48.480> use<00:02:48.870> these<00:02:49.200> kind<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.829> actually

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
ones I don't use these kind I actually

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.280 
ones I don't use these kind I actually
use<00:02:51.230> more<00:02:52.230> these<00:02:52.859> so<00:02:53.730> these<00:02:54.329> but<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:54.870> see<00:02:55.170> why

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
use more these so these but I see why

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.720 
use more these so these but I see why
they<00:02:55.410> put<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.739> for<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.129> if<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.459> want<00:02:56.640> like

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
they put them for this if you want like

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.759 
they put them for this if you want like
a<00:02:56.760> tighter<00:02:57.060> curl<00:02:57.209> that's<00:02:57.629> kind<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.900> last<00:02:58.140> then

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
a tighter curl that's kind of last then

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.520 
a tighter curl that's kind of last then
yeah<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.010> was<00:02:59.370> most<00:02:59.609> likely<00:02:59.819> wear<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.269> use<00:03:00.530> these

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
yeah I was most likely wear it use these

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.349 
yeah I was most likely wear it use these
opposed<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.099> these<00:03:02.250> these<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.879> probably<00:03:03.209> when

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
opposed to these these is probably when

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.490
