00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.940
 and in different applications, nothing else 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.360
 here but in almost all those that 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.970
 they have things to sell but they can 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.420
 buy airplanes and airports 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.350
