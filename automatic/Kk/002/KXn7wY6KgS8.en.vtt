where<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> Alabama<00:02:18.420> River<00:02:19.370> was<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.400> grandpa<00:02:20.910> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
where the Alabama River was a grandpa I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.750 
where the Alabama River was a grandpa I
don't<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.510> what<00:02:21.630> Alabama's<00:02:22.200> record<00:02:22.730> said<00:02:23.730> I

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
don't know what Alabama's record said I

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.570 
don't know what Alabama's record said I
don't<00:02:24.090> know<00:02:24.270> we<00:02:24.590> we've<00:02:25.590> had<00:02:25.770> great<00:02:26.280> players

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
don't know we we've had great players

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
don't know we we've had great players
down<00:02:26.910> there<00:02:27.240> over<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.810> years<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:29.600> think

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
down there over the years and I think

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.070 
down there over the years and I think
it's<00:02:30.870> probably<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> best<00:02:31.290> overall<00:02:31.920> record<00:02:32.430> in

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it's probably the best overall record in

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.990 
it's probably the best overall record in
the<00:02:34.080> conference<00:02:34.560> I'm<00:02:34.650> not<00:02:34.830> sure<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.459> it's<00:02:35.910> not

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the conference I'm not sure but it's not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.180 
the conference I'm not sure but it's not
as<00:02:36.240> good<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.570> should<00:02:36.600> be<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.290> not<00:02:37.530> good<00:02:37.830> me

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
as good as it should be it's not good me

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.080 
as good as it should be it's not good me
if<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.400> did<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.640> good<00:02:38.700> job
