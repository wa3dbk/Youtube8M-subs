00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
the distractions you can really just

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.840 
the distractions you can really just
focus<00:04:59.380> on<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.620> game<00:04:59.740> if<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.430> food<00:05:00.610> is<00:05:00.729> bad

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
that becomes a distraction if there's

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.570 
that becomes a distraction if there's
other<00:05:02.440> events<00:05:02.770> going<00:05:02.800> on<00:05:03.040> at<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.250> hotel<00:05:03.400> that

other events going on at a hotel that

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.100 
other events going on at a hotel that

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.719 
becomes a distraction if there's a delay
on<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.350> ground<00:05:05.530> with<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.770> airplane<00:05:06.100> those

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
on the ground with the airplane those

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.400 
on the ground with the airplane those
things<00:05:06.970> all<00:05:07.150> come<00:05:07.330> back<00:05:07.360> on<00:05:07.690> on<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.110> travel

coordinator<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.889> that's<00:05:09.010> why<00:05:09.160> we<00:05:09.310> need<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.520> be

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
coordinator and that's why we need to be

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.950 
coordinator and that's why we need to be
consistent<00:05:09.940> with<00:05:10.180> those<00:05:10.300> things<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:10.720> that<00:05:10.840> way

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
consistent with those things so that way

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.430 
consistent with those things so that way

they can

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.750 
they can
strictly<00:05:11.800> focus<00:05:12.100> on<00:05:12.220> getting<00:05:12.430> ready<00:05:12.520> for<00:05:12.669> the
