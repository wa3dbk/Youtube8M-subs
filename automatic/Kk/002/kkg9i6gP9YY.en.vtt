00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.750
 soja that should be a little video for 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.830
 Being a stefan I'm just here 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 stefanie that would have me 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.800
 borrowed around the galleon we slip 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.349
 to test a bit 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:31.340
 and yes I have to admit that the beefy 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.340
 address yourself a little easier though 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.150
 not much 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:50.339
 So I think the fact is in the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:52.949
 nothing is needed a little less 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.379
 I have less feeling than wearing 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.260
 with what you need a little less 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.100
 power with gear as with the case 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:13.470
 thus occurs 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:15.320
 yes, which I do not find so nice for me 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.780
 is that the knife is not me somehow 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.730
 I'm not feeling well in hand 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.800
 not as good as the fuck in any case 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.830
 So I had better location 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.330
 worse in the hand yes I think so 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.130
 example the first hit went better 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.380
 in the hand it may never be 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.400
 you really removed the paint that then 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.010
 nice in the hand is that it has 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.250
 always something artificial for me 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:46.860
 example here that the theater that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.770
 somehow does not know that I have 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.770
 I feel the impression as me 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.510
 Somehow there would be something artificial in it 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.930
 hand crack a bun could or something 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.490
 so i dont know i like those 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.810
 surface not that varnished and that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.820
 Fact is just a bit full 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.720
 as these are definitely the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.459
 Advantages of facc but I'm really too 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.019
 give that sacred scripture to me really 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:19.790
 I like it a lot and yes it does on everyone 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.530
 case fun with the fair to work 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.880
 and yes that should already be for 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 Rifles are therefore a stefan right 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.250
 good knife i can not 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.000
 why do you imagine that you like me 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:40.730
 it would be mine too 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.080
 and that 's it already 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.260
 I sent the knife still working 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:52.069
 too windy and thanks for looking 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.069
 people are doing well
