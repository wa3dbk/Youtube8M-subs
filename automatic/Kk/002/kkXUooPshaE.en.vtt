00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.870
 and France 3 would not be the same thing in conformity but by clicking 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.809
 on then in mode this is 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:39.830
 exactly 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.219

 in charente the realities 5 in 1 59 point to 80 3% yesterday 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.509
 I mean when you went to get her so lobbying 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.349
 so why his special 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.349
 if you have water two players online 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.430

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.909
 okay ok I'm surprised in fashion 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.719
 So here is 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.599
 magnificent firms joined 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.629
 he arrived on 1 12 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:14.860
 we have exactly 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.100
 so it remains only 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.909
 how does this operation 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.089
 small loads 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.340
 Like every year 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.769
 20 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.289
 Moinard 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:26.779
 but here in the game 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:30.269
 that's saying so that's for sure the state is going to be on the net 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.369
 and so here is lucas tradition 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.279
 r I do not want to kill atwater for others are loaded 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.589
 entry 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.960
 I think the abortion that recovers the ball 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.589
 I'm still preferring a flagship event 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:50.929
 so here it was the method to play 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:53.969
 six 6 modern warfare 2 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.969
