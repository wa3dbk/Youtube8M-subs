00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
through a Wi-Fi network but this one

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.479 
through a Wi-Fi network but this one
connects<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.680> Bluetooth<00:00:41.370> speaker

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
but because it's airplay it actually

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.670 
but because it's airplay it actually
sounds<00:00:44.730> better<00:00:45.090> than<00:00:45.239> Bluetooth<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.260> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
sounds better than Bluetooth and this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.459

obviously it can go on the floor can go

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.830 
obviously it can go on the floor can go
on<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> table<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.090> sounds<00:00:57.360> very<00:00:57.480> different
