00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 marcelo is an entrepreneurial project 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.189
 for patricia amorím in the second week of march 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.759
 today we are going to continue with a topic that we had rooms has seen in the past the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.910
 theme of the drawings 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.250
 the theme to work monochrome for the drawings 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.130
 We were abandoning the same thing that also moved in painting gesture of wealth 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.169
 of the monochrome for some kind of injury 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.769
 one of the things that we can start with is lowering the sheet 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.079
 have a color prepared with a tiempazo durant with life that is given to me 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.480
 one said razzano month takes it from me currency 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.300
 and they'll see that when you start working with the cake above 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.239
 jumping to with lights as shadows seeps part of the background 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.870
 I was going to see in the middle are the cars 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.350
 but if this is not enough to finish land 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.570
 finished the woman we voted flowers in the head so I'm preparing broseta 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.560
 crazy 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.020
 if this enough his people for the platenses 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.309
 that is not shared the chalk add land 6 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.360
 and very similar about the hard because 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.530
 because that painted above 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.480
 usually you do not expect to see there 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.500
 na skill the proposal 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.850
 maple abbot I paint above 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.100
 and vanished with the fulminating ibil taking with very beautiful the monocolor 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.440
 then we go back to what we already knew for again 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.480
 in what way something that just plan mining only with wealth so you have 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.420
 some kind of sensitivity maybe not seen in the first 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.640
 in the first impression pressures to be evacuated if someone 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 we devote seconds to observe it will start to see the richness of this picture 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.040
 let it be boring let it be a percent box although it has little to say and 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.750
 they begin to sensitize us for this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.550
 subtlety of the punches 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.160
 It will not be a bigger sector to be seen by me, for example, which means that 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.220
 there is a trail 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.420
 then already prepared all the areas with declared 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.430
 with the iphone and the app today to work 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.970
 preparing also the area 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.700
 see how the network 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.929
 the background is not come back 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.979
 next to ruiz to his knees catarroso background but that can deny him 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.999
 when you loose a land in black river 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.759
 or a flower was drawn 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.099
 2 so yes model because I know it was not a bit fictitious 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:33.929
 in which it is illuminated we had no intention of negotiating a point and a goal 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.749
 de eliseu see how you are going to create a flower tax 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.709
 regarding the head specifically the face we are in crisis 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.030
 this though not the monochrome villagers 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.399
 make the picture much more interesting 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.779
 more indecent to paint because it proposes a challenge to be studied 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.629
 adding all and more interesting to the viewer because well a picture without 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.419
 color is apparently going to be able 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:00.729
 from the interpol 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.799
 the subtlety of temperature 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.420
 the same then that we can apply in painting with these resources give it melted 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.139
 inclusive of the brush 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.119
 also candle very well 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:17.729
 we can start to apply it live a bill that eliminates some 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:23.759
 products of executive interest a council when they have to apply 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.880
 the color and do not want what has happened 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.890
 can pass it through a sandpaper rasam another sandpaper both be 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.540
 latinos as navarra the tone that they want to do yes the bunches of paper 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.179
 of sandpaper puts it in the brush and they pass it as if it were a glaze with a brush 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.149
 and it is totally subtle to achieve a girl 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:47.429
 and the drawing seems done 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:49.359
 as material other than pencil 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.639
 and that does not imply your heap look for example all the shadows that you are going to 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.309
 give on the top part but that location but I want that I broke the 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.450
 just like the really month of March 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.999
 the brush 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:02.579
 and the cake stirred 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.019
 we devour my allies as if it were a final 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.719
 and this line was toned down, it's much more honest and there was not the 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.840
 fire is chile 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.840
 since then none of these efforts are very important to work on 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.879
 contractor especially on the track 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.120
 that war 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.499
 what kind of force will I print when drawing 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:30.229
 the stronger 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.499
 if it succumbs white to leave because the issue is how much adheres 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:38.360
 the dust because you do not let a policeman how many to leave by myself 

00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:39.330
 sheet 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.349
 the more I land afp - madrid the stronger they will do it and 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.349
 madrid I'm making a crucible 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.770
 in the petals third 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.129
 let's finish 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.129
 the center cut so I really liked it 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.110
 reddish 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:04.839
 a little slow 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.260
 sun 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.280
 If you want to consult urban areas 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.150
 and lanús has to match the one that gives the face 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
 then this flotilla that carried a shadow 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.439
 in nothing believable these are the streets 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.300
 but of course both the ballplayer know how marked 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.339
 what kind of shadow do you want to cease 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.339
 until he presents lazio 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:36.520
 it means a lot of tulum 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:45.469
 no club to see how fast you need been the contractor 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.120
 then very quickly and very simply 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.520
 we can move forward in the work 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.589
 in this case Monaco 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:06:00.789
 Giuliani last Sunday last Sunday 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.770
 said encounter that confronted them with both materials 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.650
 as of colors at that time the wealth of the west did not fulfill 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:18.759
 we are going to be possible from uruguay do not originate and since 2000
