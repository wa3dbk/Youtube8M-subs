00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
video but personally I found that the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
video but personally I found that the
herbs<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.130> pretty<00:01:11.369> rare<00:01:11.729> they

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
herbs are actually pretty rare they

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
herbs are actually pretty rare they
don't<00:01:12.630> seem<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> drop<00:01:13.140> very<00:01:13.350> frequently<00:01:13.979> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
don't seem to drop very frequently I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.620 
don't seem to drop very frequently I
think<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> whole<00:01:14.580> time<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> got<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.299> drop

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
think in the whole time I got one drop

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.050 
think in the whole time I got one drop
but<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.080> actually<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.500> noted<00:01:16.950> drop<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> 37

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
but it was actually a noted drop of 37

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
but it was actually a noted drop of 37
toadflax<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:19.170> resources

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
toadflax which is really good resources

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
toadflax which is really good resources
I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.689> could<00:01:21.810> tell<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.170> was

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
I think from what I could tell it was

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.249 
I think from what I could tell it was
mostly<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.680> bars<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.250> occasional<00:01:23.729> rooms

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
mostly just bars the occasional rooms

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.420 
mostly just bars the occasional rooms
but<00:01:25.259> things<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:25.950> high<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.220> my

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
but things like that and then high up my

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.890 
but things like that and then high up my
favorites<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.240> basically<00:01:27.509> meant<00:01:27.689> was

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
favorites what they basically meant was

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
favorites what they basically meant was
rune<00:01:28.259> items<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.979> few<00:01:29.130> addy<00:01:29.310> items<00:01:29.700> which

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
rune items and a few addy items which

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
rune items and a few addy items which
added<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.509> quite<00:01:30.720> nicely<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:31.680> heads-up

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
added up quite nicely little heads-up

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
added up quite nicely little heads-up
though<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.189> actually<00:01:32.460> took<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.759> war<00:01:32.939> tortoise

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
though I actually took a war tortoise

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810 
though I actually took a war tortoise
and<00:01:33.740> well<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:34.920> things<00:01:35.100> actually<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.759> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and well two things actually is that you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.550 
and well two things actually is that you
can't<00:01:36.090> put<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.509> many<00:01:36.570> items<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.990> such<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.320> rune

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
can't put so many items in such as rune

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.550 
can't put so many items in such as rune
legs<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.840> water<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.170> died

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
legs and also that my water just died

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.350 
legs and also that my water just died
while<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.400> which<00:01:41.850> create<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.299> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
while I was there which create a bit of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200 
while I was there which create a bit of
a<00:01:42.420> panic<00:01:42.950> because<00:01:43.950> they<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.939> don't

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
a panic because they actually I don't

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.490 
a panic because they actually I don't
quite<00:01:45.420> remember<00:01:45.479> how<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.930> turn<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.290> off<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
quite remember how you turn it off I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.420 
quite remember how you turn it off I
think<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> way<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> make<00:01:47.340> you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
think there is a way to make you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.030 
think there is a way to make you
familiar<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.329> passive<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.350> basically<00:01:49.799> he

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
familiar go passive but basically he

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770 
familiar go passive but basically he
attacks<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> enemy<00:01:50.729> sir<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> enemy's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
attacks the enemy sir then the enemy's

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.080 
attacks the enemy sir then the enemy's
attacked<00:01:52.200> my<00:01:52.380> war<00:01:52.530> tortoise<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.189> waters

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
attacked my war tortoise and the waters

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.480 
attacked my war tortoise and the waters
just<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.479> died<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.110> lost<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:55.920> my<00:01:56.009> stuff<00:01:56.189> but

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
just then died and lost all my stuff but

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.490 
just then died and lost all my stuff but
that's<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.570> that's<00:01:57.810> how<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.259> guess

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that's just that's how it is I guess

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
that's just that's how it is I guess
also<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.460> final<00:01:59.790> note<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.060> you're<00:02:00.180> killing

also one final note if you're killing

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
thing they've actually added is they've

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.770 
thing they've actually added is they've
added<00:02:24.560> charms<00:02:25.100> something<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.210> really

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
added charms something that I really

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.000 
added charms something that I really
surprised<00:02:27.110> they<00:02:27.260> didn't<00:02:27.470> have<00:02:27.590> chance<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.950> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
surprised they didn't have chance in the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.860 
surprised they didn't have chance in the
first<00:02:28.160> place<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.940> ones<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.240> was<00:02:29.420> killing<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
first place the ones I was killing the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.510 
first place the ones I was killing the
the<00:02:30.050> gladdie<00:02:30.290> ones<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.830> teleporting<00:02:31.370> ones

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
the gladdie ones the teleporting ones

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.040 
the gladdie ones the teleporting ones
they<00:02:31.910> seemed<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.150> drop<00:02:32.360> Crim's<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.810> drums

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
they seemed to drop Crim's and drums

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.990 
they seemed to drop Crim's and drums
pretty<00:02:33.590> often<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.040> i<00:02:34.430> think<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.850> was<00:02:34.910> about

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
pretty often so i think it was about

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.310 
pretty often so i think it was about
half<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.300> time<00:02:35.390> they<00:02:35.660> were<00:02:35.690> dropping<00:02:35.960> crimson

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
half the time they were dropping crimson

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.230 
half the time they were dropping crimson
charms<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.400> really<00:02:37.640> good<00:02:37.850> for<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.060> Crimson

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
charms so really good for the Crimson

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.600 
charms so really good for the Crimson
trom<00:02:38.570> hunting<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.100> bosses<00:02:40.100> although<00:02:40.580> I

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
trom hunting and the bosses although I

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.010 
trom hunting and the bosses although I
didn't<00:02:40.820> kill<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.030> bosses<00:02:41.300> myself<00:02:41.690> because<00:02:41.960> I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
didn't kill the bosses myself because I

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.220 
didn't kill the bosses myself because I
have<00:02:42.260> 95<00:02:42.560> Slayer<00:02:42.830> sadly<00:02:43.280> but<00:02:43.790> they<00:02:44.000> drop<00:02:44.480> charm

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
have 95 Slayer sadly but they drop charm

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.140 
have 95 Slayer sadly but they drop charm
six<00:02:45.590> at<00:02:45.740> a<00:02:45.830> time<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.670> don't<00:02:46.910> know<00:02:47.000> what

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
six at a time so I don't know what

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.210 
six at a time so I don't know what
charms<00:02:47.450> they<00:02:47.540> do<00:02:47.600> drop<00:02:47.960> but<00:02:48.320> them<00:02:48.650> they<00:02:49.040> drop

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
charms they do drop but them they drop

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.590 
charms they do drop but them they drop
six<00:02:49.400> at<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.550> time<00:02:49.580> which<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.910> really<00:02:50.180> good<00:02:50.420> a

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
six at a time which is really good a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.560 
six at a time which is really good a
nice<00:02:51.200> change<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.550> think<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.180> general<00:02:53.330> this

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
nice change so I think in general this

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.000 
nice change so I think in general this
is<00:02:53.630> all<00:02:53.960> going<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.200> become<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.620> lot<00:02:54.980> more

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
is all going to become a lot more

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.560 
is all going to become a lot more
worthwhile<00:02:55.460> to<00:02:55.640> go<00:02:55.760> there<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.000> if<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.390> got<00:02:56.450> as

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
worthwhile to go there so if you got as

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.780 
worthwhile to go there so if you got as
a<00:02:56.630> slayer<00:02:56.900> task<00:02:57.080> don't<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.800> put<00:02:57.950> off<00:02:57.980> although

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
a slayer task don't be put off although

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.580 
a slayer task don't be put off although
maybe<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.270> sour<00:02:59.450> XP<00:02:59.660> isn't<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.050> brilliant<00:03:00.260> I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
maybe the sour XP isn't that brilliant I

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.500 
maybe the sour XP isn't that brilliant I
actually<00:03:01.430> had<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.730> get<00:03:01.910> arranged<00:03:02.150> level<00:03:02.390> while

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
actually had to get arranged level while

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.330 
actually had to get arranged level while
I<00:03:02.540> was<00:03:02.690> there<00:03:02.750> they<00:03:02.930> at<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.530> layer<00:03:03.710> XP<00:03:04.040> it's

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
I was there they at this layer XP it's

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.920 
I was there they at this layer XP it's
not<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:05.090> best<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.390> world<00:03:05.450> from<00:03:05.660> what<00:03:05.840> I've

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
not the best in the world from what I've

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.080 
not the best in the world from what I've
heard<00:03:05.960> I<00:03:06.350> didn't<00:03:06.770> actually<00:03:06.830> counter<00:03:07.700> anything

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
heard I didn't actually counter anything

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.000 
heard I didn't actually counter anything
well<00:03:08.750> I'd<00:03:08.930> sorry<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.290> would<00:03:09.590> didn't<00:03:09.740> have<00:03:09.950> a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
well I'd sorry I would didn't have a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.280 
well I'd sorry I would didn't have a
slayer<00:03:10.220> task<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.730> have<00:03:10.850> no<00:03:10.970> way<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.210> knowing

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
slayer task so I have no way of knowing

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.470 
slayer task so I have no way of knowing
but<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.250> whole<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.610> still<00:03:14.000> think<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:14.270> is

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
but on the whole I still think this is

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.240 
but on the whole I still think this is
actually<00:03:14.870> quite<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:15.020> lot<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.170> fun<00:03:15.350> sometimes<00:03:16.160> I

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
actually quite a lot of fun sometimes I

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.500 
actually quite a lot of fun sometimes I
found<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.520> way<00:03:16.610> they<00:03:16.760> stunned<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.210> is<00:03:17.330> quite

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
found the way they stunned you is quite

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.940 
found the way they stunned you is quite
frustrating<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.320> mechanic<00:03:18.680> for<00:03:18.830> that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
frustrating and the mechanic for that

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.220 
frustrating and the mechanic for that
was<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.100> bit<00:03:19.250> annoying<00:03:19.460> but<00:03:19.640> on<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.450> how<00:03:20.570> it's

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
was a bit annoying but on the how it's

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.390 
was a bit annoying but on the how it's
pretty<00:03:21.380> good<00:03:21.530> it's<00:03:21.680> pretty<00:03:21.860> good<00:03:22.010> Luke<00:03:22.220> and

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
pretty good it's pretty good Luke and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.500 
pretty good it's pretty good Luke and
I'm<00:03:22.700> actually<00:03:22.820> now<00:03:23.030> going<00:03:23.210> to<00:03:23.270> really<00:03:23.390> quickly

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
I'm actually now going to really quickly

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.030 
I'm actually now going to really quickly
switch<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.020> runescape<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.530> show<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:24.890> what

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
loser did get okay so I'm in game now

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.770 
loser did get okay so I'm in game now

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
it as you can see pretty reasonable

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.060 
it as you can see pretty reasonable

stack of items here bear in mind this

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.400 
stack of items here bear in mind this
was<00:03:34.310> about<00:03:34.730> an<00:03:34.880> hour<00:03:35.000> worth<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.390> hunting<00:03:36.170> so

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
was about an hour worth of hunting so

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.990 
was about an hour worth of hunting so
before<00:03:36.680> we<00:03:36.740> actually<00:03:36.860> do<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> price<00:03:37.760> check

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
before we actually do the price check

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.780 
before we actually do the price check
blue<00:03:38.570> charms<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:39.050> only<00:03:39.290> got<00:03:39.410> 30<00:03:39.860> i<00:03:40.070> also<00:03:40.220> got<00:03:40.400> 42

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
blue charms I only got 30 i also got 42

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.430 
blue charms I only got 30 i also got 42
Crimson's<00:03:41.240> there<00:03:41.720> are<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.840> few<00:03:41.960> are<00:03:42.110> there<00:03:42.380> are

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
Crimson's there are a few are there are

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.200 
Crimson's there are a few are there are
times<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.740> think<00:03:42.800> I<00:03:42.950> started<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.340> miss<00:03:43.700> them<00:03:43.970> but

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
times I think I started to miss them but

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.060 
times I think I started to miss them but
oh<00:03:44.390> well<00:03:44.600> that's<00:03:44.780> just<00:03:44.870> me<00:03:45.470> being<00:03:45.500> distracted

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
oh well that's just me being distracted

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.280 
oh well that's just me being distracted
from<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.310> game<00:03:46.460> I<00:03:46.580> guess<00:03:46.730> also<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.750> Ascension

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
from the game I guess also the Ascension

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.570 
from the game I guess also the Ascension
shot<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.770> didn't<00:03:49.010> bother<00:03:49.100> picking<00:03:49.310> up<00:03:49.520> the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
shot I didn't bother picking up the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.150 
shot I didn't bother picking up the
fragments<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.510> also<00:03:50.690> after<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.500> while<00:03:51.710> I<00:03:51.920> am

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
fragments and I also after a while I am

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.380 
fragments and I also after a while I am
I<00:03:52.310> kept<00:03:52.610> on<00:03:52.700> forgetting<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:53.060> pick<00:03:53.180> up<00:03:53.300> the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
I kept on forgetting to pick up the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.110 
I kept on forgetting to pick up the
shards<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:55.250> probably<00:03:55.280> would<00:03:55.700> get<00:03:55.880> more

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
shards so you probably would get more

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.340 
shards so you probably would get more
than<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.330> number<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.540> shells<00:03:56.750> I've<00:03:56.960> got<00:03:57.110> here

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
than the number of shells I've got here

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.690 
than the number of shells I've got here
cuz<00:03:57.650> i<00:03:57.770> think<00:03:57.920> i<00:03:57.950> actually<00:03:58.040> banked<00:03:58.490> some

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
cuz i think i actually banked some

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.880 
cuz i think i actually banked some
halfway<00:03:59.090> through<00:03:59.330> so<00:03:59.600> ignore<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.590> value

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
halfway through so ignore that value

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830 
halfway through so ignore that value
that's<00:04:01.010> pretty<00:04:01.250> misrepresentative<00:04:01.940> but

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
that's pretty misrepresentative but

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.200 
that's pretty misrepresentative but
let's<00:04:02.990> price<00:04:03.470> check<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:04.040> things<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.640> yeah

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
let's price check the things and yeah

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.550 
let's price check the things and yeah
once<00:04:05.390> again<00:04:05.570> once<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:05.900> add<00:04:05.990> these<00:04:06.110> in<00:04:06.290> pairing

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
once again once I add these in pairing

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.800 
once again once I add these in pairing
mode<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.770> will<00:04:06.800> get<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.070> little<00:04:07.190> bit<00:04:07.400> more<00:04:07.810> but

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
mode you will get a little bit more but

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.180 
mode you will get a little bit more but
on<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.140> whole<00:04:09.260> I'm<00:04:09.440> pretty<00:04:09.680> happy<00:04:09.920> with<00:04:10.070> how

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
on the whole I'm pretty happy with how

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.860 
on the whole I'm pretty happy with how
much<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.550> got<00:04:10.730> for<00:04:11.000> probably<00:04:11.390> what<00:04:11.510> was<00:04:11.630> around

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
much I got for probably what was around

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.300 
much I got for probably what was around
an<00:04:12.080> hour<00:04:12.200> maybe<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.500> little<00:04:12.650> bit<00:04:12.800> less<00:04:12.980> than<00:04:13.220> an

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
an hour maybe a little bit less than an

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.700 
an hour maybe a little bit less than an
hour<00:04:13.430> worth<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.180> killing<00:04:14.450> these<00:04:14.540> things<00:04:14.810> but

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
hour worth of killing these things but

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.349 
hour worth of killing these things but
on<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.980> whole<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.460> what<00:04:16.820> have<00:04:16.910> we<00:04:16.940> got<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.330> far

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
on the whole so what have we got so far

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.380 
on the whole so what have we got so far
we've<00:04:18.350> got<00:04:18.790> set<00:04:19.790> ascending<00:04:19.970> up<00:04:20.150> quite<00:04:20.359> nicely

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
we've got set ascending up quite nicely

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.710 
we've got set ascending up quite nicely
and<00:04:21.370> they<00:04:22.370> were<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.820> coin<00:04:23.210> drops<00:04:23.479> I<00:04:23.600> would

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
and they were so the coin drops I would

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.240 
and they were so the coin drops I would
recommend<00:04:23.960> taking<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.560> coin<00:04:24.830> drops<00:04:25.070> because

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
recommend taking the coin drops because

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.490 
recommend taking the coin drops because
it's<00:04:25.520> quite<00:04:25.700> a<00:04:25.729> lot<00:04:26.000> they<00:04:26.479> do<00:04:26.660> seem<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.050> drop

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
it's quite a lot they do seem to drop

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.230 
it's quite a lot they do seem to drop
why<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.620> found<00:04:27.860> my<00:04:28.010> other<00:04:28.040> time<00:04:28.460> as<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:29.030> can<00:04:29.090> see

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
why I found my other time as you can see

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.730 
why I found my other time as you can see
I've<00:04:29.330> got<00:04:29.360> 45<00:04:29.810> k<00:04:29.930> until<00:04:30.110> they<00:04:30.230> seem<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.530> quite

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
I've got 45 k until they seem to quite

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.710 
I've got 45 k until they seem to quite
often<00:04:30.920> drop<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.340> K<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.120> they<00:04:32.270> go<00:04:32.390> three

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
often drop to K so they go three

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.750 
often drop to K so they go three
quarters<00:04:33.050> of<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.230> mil<00:04:33.440> for<00:04:34.010> an<00:04:34.100> hour<00:04:34.250> worth<00:04:34.550> of

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
quarters of a mil for an hour worth of

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.060 
quarters of a mil for an hour worth of
justice<00:04:35.420> over<00:04:35.720> what<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.320> low<00:04:36.500> people<00:04:36.650> just<00:04:37.010> sort

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
justice over what a low people just sort

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.100 
justice over what a low people just sort
of<00:04:37.190> called<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.430> mid-level<00:04:37.820> enemy<00:04:38.270> that's<00:04:38.960> not

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
of called a mid-level enemy that's not

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.230 
of called a mid-level enemy that's not
bad<00:04:39.260> really<00:04:39.410> yes<00:04:39.590> that's<00:04:39.860> not<00:04:40.760> perhaps<00:04:40.970> not

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
bad really yes that's not perhaps not

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.220 
bad really yes that's not perhaps not
quite<00:04:41.330> as<00:04:41.420> good<00:04:41.570> as<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:41.780> get<00:04:41.900> from<00:04:42.050> things

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
quite as good as you get from things

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.750 
quite as good as you get from things
that<00:04:42.260> automate<00:04:42.740> ins<00:04:42.920> but<00:04:43.130> there's<00:04:43.310> still<00:04:43.400> a

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
that automate ins but there's still a

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.300 
that automate ins but there's still a
pretty<00:04:44.360> good<00:04:44.570> amount<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.870> loot<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:45.410> I<00:04:45.620> would

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
pretty good amount of loot so I would

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.500 
pretty good amount of loot so I would
recommend<00:04:46.550> killing<00:04:46.910> those<00:04:47.000> now<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> lot<00:04:47.420> people

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
recommend killing those now a lot people

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.050 
recommend killing those now a lot people
haven't<00:04:47.960> one<00:04:48.470> thing<00:04:48.680> that<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:49.040> didn't<00:04:49.790> get<00:04:49.910> in

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
the hour is I didn't get any of the new

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.200 
the hour is I didn't get any of the new
keys<00:04:51.950> so<00:04:52.460> I'll<00:04:52.790> actually<00:04:52.970> been<00:04:53.180> really

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
keys so I'll actually been really

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.420 
keys so I'll actually been really
unlucky<00:04:53.780> I've<00:04:54.050> killed<00:04:54.320> them<00:04:54.470> for<00:04:54.500> probably

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
unlucky I've killed them for probably

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.010 
unlucky I've killed them for probably
getting<00:04:55.880> on<00:04:55.970> for<00:04:56.120> three<00:04:56.300> or<00:04:56.390> four<00:04:56.450> hours<00:04:56.600> now

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020

and I've only had two keys I don't want
just<00:04:59.360> been<00:04:59.540> unlucky<00:04:59.660> or<00:05:00.020> whether<00:05:00.860> that's<00:05:01.070> just

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
just been unlucky or whether that's just

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.400 
just been unlucky or whether that's just
what's<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.520> be<00:05:01.580> expected<00:05:01.790> so<00:05:02.270> factor<00:05:03.169> that<00:05:03.260> in

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
what's to be expected so factor that in

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.780 
what's to be expected so factor that in
you<00:05:03.560> might<00:05:03.680> get<00:05:03.830> keys<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.280> that's<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.580> little

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
you might get keys and that's a little

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.850 
you might get keys and that's a little
bit<00:05:04.970> extra<00:05:05.090> my<00:05:05.390> butt<00:05:05.690> there<00:05:06.260> you<00:05:06.320> go<00:05:06.410> that's<00:05:06.740> a
