&gt;&gt;Nelly: 
I got, you know, an open heart free hands and a voice so I’m, I’m here 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.980
[Girls Singing]

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly:
Once you plant a seed, 
it does keep growing, 
no matter what it is: 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.980
if it’s – 
if it’s a song, 
if it’s poem, 
if it’s a dream, 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.980
Once you – 
once you plant the seed 
it just keeps growing 
and the fruits, 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.980
the fruits are boundless, 
especially when the seed 
comes from the purest place. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:55.980

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly:
The song that stuck in their head is “Powerless” 
and I think that makes me so incredibly happy 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly [singing "Powerless"]: 
Paint my face in your magazines, Make it look whiter than it seems 
Paint me over with your dreams, Shove away my ethnicity 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.980
Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight 
And say just what is on my mind 
Without offending your might 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:22.980
Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.980
And when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.980
So say what you want
Woo!
Say what you want

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly:
I fully realize the power of art 
and the fact that art is 
a thread that runs through all 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly [singing "Powerless"]: 
Now it’s moccasins we sport 
We take the culture and contort 
Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.980
&gt;&gt;Woman: 
We have been taught 
by our grandmothers and our mothers, 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.980
beadings, a source of income, 
so they have started to produce 
for different markets in Kenya. 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.980
The money we get we use for 
educate our kids, 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.980
buy food, 
buy clothes for our families. 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.980
&gt;&gt;2nd Woman: 
Me I did not finish my school, 
uh but now a days the girls 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.980
are finishing their school and they 
are getting their work 
and they are hard working - 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.980
maybe I can be a good example 
for working hard in the whole community. 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:45.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly [singing]:
Cuz this life is too short to live it just for you 
But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.980
But say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you want to...

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.980
Say what you want
Say what you want

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:10.980
Say - Say - Say - Say - Say - Say - Say - 
Say - Say - Say - Say - Say - Say - Say - 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly:
My uh voice, 
I think has been healed, 
you know, 
by being here. 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly and Girls [singing]
Who am I, Who am I, Who am I not to praise the lord...

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.980
Who am I, Who am I, Who am I not to praise the lord...

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:42.980
&gt;&gt;Girl [singing]
When I was walking along the road
I met a young girl chasing gold

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.980
And if a young girl can praise the Lord
Who am I

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:58.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly and Girls [singing]
Who am I not to praise the lord...
Who am I, Who am I, Who am I not to praise the lord...

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.980
Who am I, Who am I, Who am I not to praise the lord...

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly: 
I really believe that art 
can help break the cycle of poverty 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.980
&gt;&gt;Nelly and Girls [singing]
Who am I not to praise the lord...

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.980
I can do everything, with the Lord to stand by me

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.980
