Hey guys,

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:06.610
Welcome to another What I Ate Wednesday, where
I show you what I ate on Tuesday, on Wednesday.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.950
As usual, I started with a big mug of tea.
This morning, I'm having this Very Berry organic

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.170
herbal tea by Stash. I love that it has rooibos
and that it's super duper fruity. It just

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.689
makes me feel like summer is coming. It's
snowing today so I need to do things to keep

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.789
hope in my heart.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.060
For breakfast, I was excited to have avocado!
I haven't had it for a while as they have

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.970
been pretty expensive so I've avoided buying
them until this past weekend.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.230
The cubed avocado went in my brown rice and
lentil congee. There's also some seitan strips

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.629
in there too. It's an unusual combination
but it's actually my take on one of my favourite

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.210
types of congee from my pre-vegan days which
involved lean meat and Century egg. The seitan

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.640
stands in for meat perfectly and avocado does
a great job at replacing the century egg with

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.360
it's creamy texture, especially with a tiny
sprinkle of black salt.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.409
On the side, I have some stir fried pea greens
with garlic.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.129
I was pretty busy today so I didn't do any
snacking so by lunchtime I was pretty hungry

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.860
and wanted to make something quick.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.620
On this roll that I baked last night, I laid
out some avocado, some strips of beefy beefless

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.950
seitan that had been baked with some not-honey
sesame garlic sauce, some tomato slices and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.950
lettuce.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.030
I'm getting pretty low on vegenaise, but that's
ok. I only needed enough to help the nutritional

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.870
yeast stick.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.020
That was a pretty kick butt sammich.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.320
For dinner, I made some leek soup. It's a
really simple soup with just leeks, garlic,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.470
some salt and pepper, vegetable broth and
some cashew cream. The recipe's in the description

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.100
box if you want it.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.659
I also made some crispy fried fresh sage to
top them off. I love this garnish so much.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.549
I never really worked with fresh sage before
I watched a Pumpkin Mac and Cheese video from

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.570
the Edgy Veg. She tops her mac and cheese
with fried sage and I just never encountered

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.039
that before and had to try it. It's so good
crumbled over..well everything, pasta, soup,

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.659
in sandwiches, I love it!

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.380
So here's our delicious, creamy leek soup
with crispy sage. And some garlic bread with

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.380
that.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.050
And that was my food day. How was yours?

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.330
