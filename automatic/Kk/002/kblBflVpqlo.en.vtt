going to be going pretty stoked about

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.440 
going to be going pretty stoked about
this<00:02:10.500> there's<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.670> thing<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.970> need<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
this there's one thing I need you to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.570 
this there's one thing I need you to
take<00:02:12.599> into<00:02:12.780> consideration<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.680> new<00:02:14.160> doctor

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
take into consideration the new doctor

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580 
take into consideration the new doctor
terror<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.030> only<00:02:15.300> going<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.840> seven<00:02:16.290> stages

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
terror is only going to be seven stages

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.760 
terror is only going to be seven stages
but<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.550> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.990> difficulty<00:02:19.530> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
but it is going to be the difficulty is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.300 
but it is going to be the difficulty is
going<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.370> increasing<00:02:21.030> drew

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
going to be increasing drew

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.010 
going to be increasing drew
matically<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.239> keep<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.660> mind<00:02:22.780> because

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
matically so keep that in mind because

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.530 
matically so keep that in mind because
it's<00:02:23.410> very<00:02:23.620> important<00:02:24.160> no<00:02:24.310> longer<00:02:24.819> 20<00:02:25.270> stages

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
it's very important no longer 20 stages

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.320 
it's very important no longer 20 stages
but<00:02:26.290> instead<00:02:26.709> seven<00:02:27.220> stages<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.849> four<00:02:28.090> times

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
but instead seven stages and four times

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.990 
but instead seven stages and four times
a<00:02:28.540> week<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.840> think<00:02:29.110> that's<00:02:29.230> pretty<00:02:29.380> awesome

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
a week I think that's pretty awesome

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.580 
a week I think that's pretty awesome
then<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.270> daily<00:02:31.569> events<00:02:31.780> are<00:02:32.140> starting<00:02:32.500> at

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
then the daily events are starting at

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.890 
then the daily events are starting at
six<00:02:32.830> a.m.<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.310> they<00:02:33.760> end<00:02:33.940> at<00:02:34.150> 3am<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:34.780> they're

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
six a.m. and they end at 3am so they're

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.660 
six a.m. and they end at 3am so they're
going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.080> be<00:02:35.140> for<00:02:35.319> 21<00:02:35.739> hours<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.220> really

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
going to be for 21 hours it really

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.640 
going to be for 21 hours it really
depends<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.300> where<00:02:37.569> you're<00:02:37.720> living<00:02:37.900> obviously

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
depends on where you're living obviously

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.870 
depends on where you're living obviously
that<00:02:38.890> they're<00:02:39.040> going<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.430> starting<00:02:39.670> I

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
that they're going to be starting I

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.420 
that they're going to be starting I
think<00:02:40.239> I'm<00:02:40.840> not<00:02:41.110> entirely<00:02:41.380> sure<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.250> think

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
think I'm not entirely sure but I think

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.030 
think I'm not entirely sure but I think
that<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:42.970> way<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.269> works<00:02:43.630> out<00:02:43.930> then<00:02:44.739> we<00:02:44.890> got

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
that is the way it works out then we got

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.229 
that is the way it works out then we got
some<00:02:45.190> new<00:02:45.340> stuff<00:02:45.580> we're<00:02:45.819> going<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.090> getting

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
some new stuff we're going to be getting
