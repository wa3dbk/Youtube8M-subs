00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.690
 hello everyone is magic box and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.640
 today we find ourselves in a 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.070
 video a little bit special since 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.590
 this is a video where I present the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.580
 number of zombies per round and that makes 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.779
 a little while that I had to do it 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.140
 so sorry for the delay 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.190
 e and there you are now 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.489
 to see that I'm trying to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.470
 download the uprising pack of black 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.690
 ops two with ms oboeuf the dead and I 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.000
 would of course make thousands of videos 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 on it with records but by 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.010
 against the records I will do them sooner 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 during the holidays because I can 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.650
 not go the week because I have not 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 home 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:01.650
 so here we go hop steam on 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.210
 do not care a little helpless sorry it's a 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.620
 little brothel 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.470
 hop there so so I'll do you 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.450
 so see this information then I 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.310
 I had one on a site I know more 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.110
 too much which sorry it's a big 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.870
 moment so then a little zoom 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.260
 so in their first column it's the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.080
 sleeves 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.320
 after that is the total number of zombies 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.550
 since the heat 1 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.040
 after that is the number of zombies per 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.330
 sleeve and after that is the number of 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.370
 waves and I remember that in a wave 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.620
 of zombies at age 24 10th 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.210
 so that's the number of zombies 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.550
 maximum on the map 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.030
 so then to the sleeve cow 1 like 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.560
 you see ci zombies per sleeve up 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.100
 apprehended without sleeves Thursday 6 1 to 33 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.229
 per sleeve 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.160
 on the ten since the sleeve 1 that 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.850
 does 214 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.950
 good then by cons I stopped at 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.100
 the 300 because well it had to be a 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.900
 little bit boring and so at the 300 you 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.190
 can see that there are still 8 1124 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.259
 zombies per sleeve 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.850
 so that's a lot and since the 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:09.590
 walk 1 it's 8 8 oula 821 1025 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.850
 Zambia and in the sleeve that binds to 338 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.330
 wave of 24 bis brief it's a little 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.850
 a lot in the description I you 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.299
 will put the link of an image that I have 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.799
 fact that groups all the data by 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.280
 against I did not find the formula 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.900
 exact which allows to calculate all that 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.549
 but in any case these data they are 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.010
 sure and some because I have me 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.019
 even test test in the high 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.209
 eating the 150 and I had the number 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:44.720
 exact of zombies so here is already the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.150
 sleeve 209 we can see that there 3955 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.900
 zombies per sleeve and that makes a little 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.690
 much the same time it's sleeve 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.280
 209 of the effect in 1h10 so it includes 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.390
 Why 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.680
