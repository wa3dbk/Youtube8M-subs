what views because I wife I fly quite a
lot<00:00:33.030> at<00:00:33.270> dusk<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.550> that's<00:00:35.550> when<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.790> nice

and calm and as it starts to get dusk as
you<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.300> difficult<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you know it's very difficult to see the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810 
you know it's very difficult to see the
orientation<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> aircraft<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.579> times

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
orientation of the aircraft at times

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.400 
orientation of the aircraft at times
since<00:00:42.180> I've<00:00:42.390> almost<00:00:42.570> lost<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> couple<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
since I've almost lost it a couple of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.209 
since I've almost lost it a couple of
times<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:45.600> how<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.960> aids<00:00:46.800> me<00:00:47.070> with

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
times so see how this aids me with

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.569 
times so see how this aids me with
vision<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.730> how<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> test<00:00:51.090> goes<00:00:51.270> now

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
vision so see how the test goes now

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
vision so see how the test goes now
right<00:00:53.579> testing<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> lights<00:00:55.309> seeing<00:00:56.309> what

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
right testing out the lights seeing what

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.600 
right testing out the lights seeing what
it's<00:00:56.550> like

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
it's like

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.990 
it's like
as<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.300> plane<00:00:58.450> gets<00:00:59.280> further<00:01:00.280> away<00:01:00.490> from<00:01:00.670> you

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
as the plane gets further away from you

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.490 
as the plane gets further away from you
as<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.210> gets<00:01:01.360> dusk<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:01.780> gets<00:01:01.930> harder<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.350> see

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
as it gets dusk it gets harder to see

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.860 
as it gets dusk it gets harder to see
obviously<00:01:03.150> difficult<00:01:04.150> know<00:01:04.420> which<00:01:04.570> way<00:01:04.720> it's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
obviously difficult know which way it's

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.420 
obviously difficult know which way it's
facing<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:05.650> is<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:05.830> trial<00:01:06.160> and<00:01:06.340> leave

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
facing and this is a trial and leave

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:20.250 
facing and this is a trial and leave
little<00:01:06.580> night

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.680 

okay<00:01:21.260> I<00:01:21.650> get<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:21.860> long<00:01:21.979> way<00:01:22.159> away<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:23.479> probably

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
okay I get a long way away it's probably

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.830 
okay I get a long way away it's probably
too<00:01:23.869> far<00:01:24.140> for<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.440> see<00:01:24.710> now<00:01:25.780> they<00:01:26.780> are

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
too far for you to see now they are

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.660 
too far for you to see now they are
getting<00:01:27.140> hard<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.440> tell<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:27.770> wait<00:01:27.920> spacing

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.609 

and<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:31.850> turning<00:01:32.030> round<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:35.350> there<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.440> see

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
and it's turning round and there you see

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.899 
and it's turning round and there you see
them<00:01:36.770> well<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:36.979> can<00:01:37.190> see<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.490> modern<00:01:37.700> if<00:01:37.790> you

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
them well I can see the modern if you

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.960 
them well I can see the modern if you
can<00:01:38.030> actually<00:01:38.149> see<00:01:38.390> them<00:01:42.640> quite<00:01:43.640> clear<00:01:43.940> that

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
can actually see them quite clear that

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.460 
can actually see them quite clear that
it's<00:01:44.210> actually<00:01:44.360> coming<00:01:44.600> back<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.050> walls<00:01:45.229> me

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
it's actually coming back to walls me

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:57.999 
it's actually coming back to walls me
now<00:01:56.050> I've<00:01:57.050> sleeping<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.410> little<00:01:57.530> bit<00:01:57.710> further

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
now I've sleeping a little bit further

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:10.999 
now I've sleeping a little bit further
away<00:01:58.160> this<00:01:58.429> time

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.009 

okay<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.939> I<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.420> lights<00:02:12.599> quite

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
okay and I can see the lights quite

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:34.309 
okay and I can see the lights quite
clear

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.840 

turning<00:02:35.099> again

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.840 

gain<00:02:39.540> i<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.870> see<00:02:40.050> them<00:02:40.260> very<00:02:40.530> clearly<00:02:40.850> and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
gain i can see them very clearly and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.400 
gain i can see them very clearly and
it's<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.780> dark<00:02:43.050> yet

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.410 

so<00:02:51.040> from<00:02:51.250> my<00:02:51.280> point<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.760> view<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:51.970> think<00:02:52.120> that's

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
so from my point of view I think that's

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:03.589 
so from my point of view I think that's
a<00:02:52.600> successful<00:02:53.140> test

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:12.890 

going<00:03:04.599> a<00:03:04.840> long<00:03:05.290> way<00:03:05.530> off<00:03:08.400> turning<00:03:09.400> now

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:22.920 

and<00:03:13.110> lights<00:03:13.739> visible

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.839 

I<00:03:23.019> used<00:03:23.620> green<00:03:23.980> because<00:03:24.489> for<00:03:24.670> some<00:03:24.819> reason

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
I used green because for some reason

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.390 
I used green because for some reason
green<00:03:25.480> LEDs<00:03:26.019> show<00:03:26.379> up<00:03:26.500> much<00:03:26.709> clearer<00:03:27.069> than<00:03:27.250> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
green LEDs show up much clearer than the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.360 
green LEDs show up much clearer than the
Raven<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.849> white<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.359> Blues<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.950> can<00:03:30.159> get

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
Raven of white and the Blues you can get

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.610 
Raven of white and the Blues you can get
these<00:03:30.519> in<00:03:30.670> all<00:03:30.790> colors<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.689> verme<00:03:31.900> should<00:03:32.530> we

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
these in all colors of a verme should we

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:49.339 
these in all colors of a verme should we
say<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> well-known<00:03:33.219> auction<00:03:33.400> site

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.770 

it's<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.470> key<00:03:50.680> ring<00:03:50.860> light<00:03:51.239> just<00:03:52.239> taped<00:03:52.569> onto

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
it's the key ring light just taped onto

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.559 
it's the key ring light just taped onto
the<00:03:52.989> wing<00:03:53.140> very<00:03:53.560> very<00:03:53.799> lightweight<00:03:54.569> doesn't

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
the wing very very lightweight doesn't

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.000 
the wing very very lightweight doesn't
affect<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.930> weight<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.290> at<00:03:56.440> all<00:03:56.590> or<00:03:56.769> the
