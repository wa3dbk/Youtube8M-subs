00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.810
 first of all how is it different from 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.990
 the car was originally designed for 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.099
 preferential movement around the city 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.290
 respectively in the city like you all 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.770
 know we often get into traffic we 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.949
 very often we slow down 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.930
 switch and gears have nothing to pull and 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.820
 we want to spend as much as possible 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.340
 less fuel respectively in order 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.830
 to provide this mode by us 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.170
 sequential hybrid selected 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.059
 that is, the scheme at which the car 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.649
 the movement is driven by electric motors 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.050
 one front and one rear axle 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.840
 engines we have and energy for them 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 produces not a big power station in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.829
 the composition of the internal combustion engine 2 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 fuel that runs on gasoline and 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 on natural gas which twists at 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.090
 this generator and between all this good 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.980
 located such a small electric 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.300
 Super Capacitor Drive 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.699
 which allows us to effectively 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.829
 collect braking energy and so 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.379
 effectively give it up when overclocking 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.840
 when the power of our generator is not for us 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.119
 grabs any car consists of 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.369
 compromises in this case we 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.500
 do you understand that all the same we are building 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.780
 a car for a city dweller was given 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.610
 maximum comfort to passengers in this 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.250
 probably were able to notice sitting on the back 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.680
 having given up this we might 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.549
 increase the amount of luggage but considered 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.790
 It is less interesting for buyer than 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.130
 traveling comfort is greater than 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.380
 together most manufacturers go 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.240
 according to the scheme when they want to provide 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.130
 long enough movement 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.590
 car on the electro go we do not 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.650
 sought we sought the first place 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 obtaining efficient fuel consumption 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.430
 but did not want 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.400
 take expensive car 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.340
 unnecessarily that is, all the same batteries are capacious 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.070
 especially lithium-ion batteries they cost 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.850
 serious enough money 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.280
 supercapacitors cost substantially 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.440
 cheaper and allow us a car 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.970
 will release to the market for substantially more 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.080
 low stronger than traditional 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.479
 hybrid cars 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.770
 approximate price want may yes no no 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.770
 next year in church
