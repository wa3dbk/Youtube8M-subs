00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 protection and recovery technologies 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.960
 the environment has been able to 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.859
 revolutionary results in Brazil and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.530
 in the world 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.049
 the reporter andré trigueiro shows a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.080
 of them the liquid 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.810
 resulting from waste decomposition already 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.449
 can be transformed into pure water 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.400
 the bulk of garbage generated in Brazil is 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.689
 organic matter mainly residues 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 of food 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.340
 decomposition of these wastes 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.679
 the appearance of the slurry the juice of the garbage 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 a toxic dark liquid that can 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.120
 contamination of groundwater in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
 Most landfills in the country are 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 appropriate treatment for manure is not 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.950
 It is possible that we will continue to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.750
 for slurry treatment plants 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.180
 sewers that do not treat the name of louis 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.700
 only one of the exceptions is the landfill of 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.579
 cariacica in the holy spirit here a 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.710
 totally Brazilian technology 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.610
 transforms 130 thousand liters of manure into 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 day in treated water and fertilizer 95% manure 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.070
 turn the water and the other 5% are 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.309
 transformed into waste in the form of a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.960
 solid mud being this residue 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.360
 can be used in the process of 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 composting for processing 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.020
 in organic fertilizer in são gonçalo na 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.939
 metropolitan river region 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.549
 the treatment of slurry even more 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.070
 is cheaper to treat the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.930
 slurry by this German technology than 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.189
 take the material for treatment in a 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.530
 sewer station 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.390
 the collected slurry from the landfill is pumped 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.450
 for this mini-treatment plant that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.110
 fits in a container here equipment 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.939
 state-of-the-art filter leachate 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.590
 micro-membrane only let pass the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.150
 water molecules 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.250
 the result of this process is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.680
 awesome and also here for us 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.500
 see looks like a pool of water 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.700
 transparent and it really is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.820
 look at pure distilled water what it was 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.880
 problem solution turned an economy of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.729
 300 thousand reais in just two months 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.189
 I think it's a first step is to 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.710
 that the country evolves in the treatment of 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.780
 manure is for all time 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.569
 the challenge now is to find out what to do 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 with 80 thousand liters of distilled water per 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.410
 day the most noble judge of this water 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.270
 should be use 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.610
 industrial industries that have 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.700
 need for water with a high standard of 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.260
 demineralization 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.720
 distillation 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.640
 for the time being the distilled water is being 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.670
 used to lower the dust inside the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.040
 own a luxurious bath until 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.380
 new businesses turn this water into 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.800
 a source of income for those who care for 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.800
 trash
