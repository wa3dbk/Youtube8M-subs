00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.210
 Blowin 'in the wind, which becomes energy again as renewable energy 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.480
 in principle very positively received unlike other forms of energy it is 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.980
 but by its typical foreshortening that he helps on the one hand his 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.800
 On the other hand, however, the great symbolic power of all new developments becomes 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.820
 also the use of wind energy arguments in public 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.820
 forwarded 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.770
 as the population in the planning process of wind turbines 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.740
 Also included is the acceptance as the example helpful resistance stimulates 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.840
 the pilgrims are super c today 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.150
 that secures the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.679
 environmentally conscious behind 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.849
 that is true and not indulging every sound but with the money they want 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.660
 prevent you 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.950
 even more nuclear power was not quite right and it was in my view the 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.900
 Main motivation for the participation that Bilfinger Berger held a minute 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.970
 which is from the Upper Austrian operation of the Yaris money is not obtained 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.710
 Wind power changed percent most promising a variety of 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.530
 companies 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.320
 and for us, Cie means 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.020
 the killing 11 percent the whole world 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.000
 meter 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.900
 supply environmentally friendly energy 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.390
 and to continue to offer on a global basis with our material one 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.890
 is certain - power has a future 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.590
 in Austria, 612 million CHF with a capacity of 180 megawatts were built 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.789
 they supply electricity for 560 000 households it rips 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 alone in Upper Austria 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.599
 There are 23 plants with 26 Kohmann 4 Niederberg performance 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.770
 I work with the future prospects of the results 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.430
 we just want to get great 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.890
 Energy guzzlers rarely and the cutlery still would this Cottbus and 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.520
 That's why we already know today 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.340
 with the Nati Press of Windenergie are in the future 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.840
 Lindenberg is already the deepest in Europe and now the strongest 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200
 will be expanded before the power plants 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.850
 and he will meet in Vilnius himself 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.540
 Concept and in Upper Austria just a great future ahead 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.450
 By the year 2020, the power of wind power in Austria could 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.779
 of currently around one thousand megawatts 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.539
 3500 be increased 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.829
 he only carries more an increase in investments paid by 18 percent 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.549
 required 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.909
 because modern facilities 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.930
 The electricity yield of wind power brings a breath of fresh air into our lives and away 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.489
 we all benefit
