and with the assistance of Merlin's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.940 
and with the assistance of Merlin's
incredible<00:01:12.420> powers<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:13.290> could<00:01:13.530> attempt<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.010 

I<00:01:26.850> didn't<00:01:27.850> like<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.090> fact<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.720> they<00:01:28.900> have

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
I didn't like the fact that they have

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.630 
I didn't like the fact that they have
changed<00:01:29.410> out<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:29.710> history<00:01:30.070> by<00:01:30.220> killing<00:01:30.550> off

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
changed out this history by killing off

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.150 
changed out this history by killing off
Lancelot<00:01:31.240> here's<00:01:32.140> an<00:01:32.260> integral<00:01:32.710> part<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:33.040> the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
Lancelot here's an integral part of the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.650 
Lancelot here's an integral part of the
whole<00:01:33.310> Arthur<00:01:33.700> in<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.880> round<00:01:34.060> table<00:01:34.420> thing

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
whole Arthur in the round table thing

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.930 
whole Arthur in the round table thing
and<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.230> was<00:01:35.350> really<00:01:35.500> upset<00:01:35.620> to<00:01:36.250> see<00:01:36.370> him<00:01:36.520> die<00:01:36.700> I

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
and I was really upset to see him die I

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.400 
and I was really upset to see him die I
think<00:01:37.300> Merlin's<00:01:37.600> very<00:01:37.750> clever<00:01:38.020> in<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.230> fact

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
think Merlin's very clever in the fact

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.750 
think Merlin's very clever in the fact
that<00:01:38.470> it<00:01:38.620> does<00:01:38.800> give<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.340> bits<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.670> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
that it does give you the bits of the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.670 
that it does give you the bits of the
legend<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.150> you<00:01:40.330> expect<00:01:40.690> i<00:01:40.780> mean<00:01:40.930> land<00:01:41.110> /<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
legend that you expect i mean land / the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.060 
sword in the stone you know the lady
that<00:01:43.450> like<00:01:43.570> they're<00:01:43.750> all<00:01:43.870> there<00:01:44.200> they're<00:01:44.890> all

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
that like they're all there they're all

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.530 
that like they're all there they're all
part<00:01:45.370> for<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.610> legend<00:01:45.910> it<00:01:46.000> does<00:01:46.180> tell<00:01:46.420> you

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
part for the legend it does tell you

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.390 
part for the legend it does tell you
that<00:01:46.690> but<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:46.960> tells<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.740> new<00:01:48.280> and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
that but it tells you in a new and

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.000 
that but it tells you in a new and
unexpected<00:01:48.790> way<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.420> i<00:01:49.540> think<00:01:49.600> i<00:01:50.080> think<00:01:50.770> for

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
unexpected way and i think i think for

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.219 
unexpected way and i think i think for
the<00:01:51.100> purists<00:01:51.580> yes<00:01:52.420> i<00:01:52.510> understand<00:01:52.930> why<00:01:53.050> they're

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
the purists yes i understand why they're

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.540 
the purists yes i understand why they're
upset<00:01:53.260> but<00:01:53.800> then<00:01:53.920> i<00:01:53.950> think<00:01:54.070> they<00:01:54.280> should<00:01:54.430> look

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
upset but then i think they should look

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.370 
upset but then i think they should look
at<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.729> amount<00:01:54.910> of<00:01:55.060> people<00:01:55.120> that<00:01:55.600> tune<00:01:56.080> in<00:01:56.260> and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
at the amount of people that tune in and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.780 
at the amount of people that tune in and
are<00:01:56.470> now<00:01:56.590> interested<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.400> legends<00:01:57.729> and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
are now interested in the legends and

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.490 
are now interested in the legends and
the<00:01:57.880> myths<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.300> i<00:01:58.360> think<00:01:58.630> i<00:01:58.900> think<00:01:59.290> if<00:01:59.410> it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
the myths and i think i think if it

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.780 
the myths and i think i think if it
makes<00:01:59.650> it<00:01:59.770> popular<00:02:00.009> than<00:02:00.340> i<00:02:00.400> think<00:02:00.580> that's<00:02:00.700> a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
makes it popular than i think that's a

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.590 
makes it popular than i think that's a
good<00:02:00.910> thing<00:02:00.970> i<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:03.729> my<00:02:03.820> character<00:02:03.880> from
