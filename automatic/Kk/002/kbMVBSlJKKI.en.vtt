listening<00:00:57.539> experience<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:58.469> by<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.649> time

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
listening experience but by the time

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
radio and I can definitely see why they

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the album it's pretty sparse in terms of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.609 
the album it's pretty sparse in terms of
production<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> amount<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> instruments

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
production and the amount of instruments

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
production and the amount of instruments
that<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.770> used<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.430> very<00:01:38.549> big<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.180> in

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
that are used but it's very big and in

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.330 
that are used but it's very big and in
that<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> fills<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.110> space<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.740> well<00:01:40.920> with

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that it fills the space really well with

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.969 
that it fills the space really well with
the<00:01:41.460> strategic<00:01:42.030> use<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> reverb<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.500> big

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the strategic use of reverb and the big

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
the strategic use of reverb and the big
chords<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.640> played<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.240> chorus<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
chords that are played in the chorus it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
chords that are played in the chorus it
really<00:01:45.990> fills<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> space<00:01:46.740> nicely<00:01:47.280> this

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
really fills out the space nicely this

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.710 
really fills out the space nicely this
is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> really<00:01:47.850> great<00:01:47.970> song<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.570> it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
is a really great song and I think it's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.480 
is a really great song and I think it's
something<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.140> will<00:01:49.259> live<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> classic

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
something that will live on as a classic

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.240 
something that will live on as a classic
in<00:01:50.670> Beck's<00:01:51.360> career<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.170> song<00:01:52.380> wave<00:01:52.649> brings<00:01:53.070> in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
in Beck's career the song wave brings in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
in Beck's career the song wave brings in
the<00:01:53.399> string<00:01:53.729> section<00:01:54.090> once<00:01:54.270> again<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.840> very

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the string section once again it's very

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.929 
the string section once again it's very
slow<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.649> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> haunting<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.670> just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
slow and kind of haunting with just

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.459 
slow and kind of haunting with just
Beck's<00:01:57.180> boys<00:01:57.450> playing<00:01:57.810> over<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> string

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
Beck's boys playing over a string

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.050 
Beck's boys playing over a string
quartet<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.640> playing<00:01:59.880> these

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
quartet that's kind of playing these

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.899 
quartet that's kind of playing these
sustained<00:02:00.990> droning<00:02:01.829> notes<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.700> song

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
sustained droning notes it's a song

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.700 
sustained droning notes it's a song
that's<00:02:03.090> got<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> lot<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> intensity<00:02:04.079> behind<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that's got a lot of intensity behind it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.440 
that's got a lot of intensity behind it
but<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.159> clouded<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.729> heavy<00:02:06.030> guitars

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
but it's not clouded with heavy guitars

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.749 
but it's not clouded with heavy guitars
or<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.380> lot<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.590> percussion<00:02:08.129> or<00:02:08.280> anything

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
or just a lot of percussion or anything

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.430 
or just a lot of percussion or anything
like<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.239> pretty<00:02:09.450> simple<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.259> song

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
like that it's pretty simple it's a song

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.229 
like that it's pretty simple it's a song
that's<00:02:10.560> very<00:02:10.800> soothing<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.550> creates<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.090> lot

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
that's very soothing but creates a lot

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.200 
that's very soothing but creates a lot
of<00:02:12.330> tension<00:02:12.720> at<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.840> same

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
of tension at the same

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.700 
of tension at the same
time<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.450> found<00:02:13.720> myself<00:02:13.900> playing<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.470> song

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
time I found myself playing the song

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.140 
time I found myself playing the song
over<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.160> over<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.670> think<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:16.000> probably

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
over and over and I think it's probably

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150 
over and over and I think it's probably
my<00:02:16.390> favorite<00:02:16.750> song<00:02:16.960> on<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.380> album<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.950> song

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
Blackbird chain is a very interesting

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.170 
Blackbird chain is a very interesting
song<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.470> almost<00:02:20.710> has<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.160> country<00:02:21.670> kind<00:02:22.090> of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
song it almost has a country kind of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.730 
song it almost has a country kind of
feel<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.600> with<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.110> sort<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.470> distant

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
feel to it with this sort of distant

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.290 
feel to it with this sort of distant
gretsch<00:02:24.160> guitars<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.000> overall

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
gretsch guitars and the overall

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.880 
gretsch guitars and the overall
structure<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.990> song<00:02:26.200> really<00:02:26.500> harkens

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
structure of the song really harkens

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.010 
structure of the song really harkens
back<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.070> something<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.580> gram<00:02:28.120> parsons<00:02:28.420> or

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
back to something that gram parsons or

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.200 
back to something that gram parsons or
later<00:02:29.560> incarnation<00:02:30.220> as<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.550> birds<00:02:30.760> would<00:02:31.030> do

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
later incarnation as the birds would do

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.610 
later incarnation as the birds would do
the<00:02:31.450> thing<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.780> really<00:02:31.990> like<00:02:32.260> about<00:02:32.290> this

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
the thing that I really like about this

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.200 
the thing that I really like about this
song<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.130> sort<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.580> intricate<00:02:34.060> guitar

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
song is sort of the intricate guitar

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.180 
song is sort of the intricate guitar
work<00:02:34.690> there's<00:02:35.170> these<00:02:35.410> lines<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.860> sort<00:02:36.100> of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
work there's these lines that sort of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.220 
work there's these lines that sort of
work<00:02:36.700> as<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> Collin<00:02:37.300> response<00:02:37.720> with<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
work as a Collin response with the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470 
work as a Collin response with the
vocals<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.920> during<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.910> course<00:02:40.150> there's

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
vocals and during the course there's

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.510 
vocals and during the course there's
these<00:02:40.720> bended<00:02:41.170> notes<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.650> sort<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.070> work<00:02:42.310> to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
these bended notes that sort of work to

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.580 
these bended notes that sort of work to
accent<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.090> vocals<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:43.870> well<00:02:44.080> towards

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
accent the vocals really well towards

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.140 
accent the vocals really well towards
the end<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:45.070> string<00:02:45.310> section<00:02:45.700> shows<00:02:45.940> up

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
the end the string section shows up

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.760 
the end the string section shows up
again<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.870> sort<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.140> works<00:02:47.530> as<00:02:47.740> a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
again and it sort of works as a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.890 
again and it sort of works as a
juxtaposition<00:02:48.070> between<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.330> country<00:02:49.720> and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
juxtaposition between the country and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.720 
juxtaposition between the country and
the<00:02:49.960> classical<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.980> really<00:02:51.250> creates<00:02:51.550> this

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the classical that really creates this

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.700 
the classical that really creates this
interesting<00:02:52.300> texture<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.200> little<00:02:53.350> odd

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
interesting texture it's a little odd

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.710 
interesting texture it's a little odd
and<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.070> little<00:02:54.340> weird<00:02:54.580> if<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:54.880> look<00:02:55.060> at<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.600> on

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
and a little weird if you look at it on

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.690 
and a little weird if you look at it on
paper<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.470> hear<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:56.980> just<00:02:57.010> works

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
paper but to hear it it just works

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.790 
paper but to hear it it just works
really<00:02:58.000> beautifully<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.780> these<00:02:58.930> sort<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.260> two

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
really beautifully and these sort of two

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.190 
really beautifully and these sort of two
very<00:03:00.400> different<00:03:01.000> styles<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.510> music<00:03:01.660> coming

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
very different styles of music coming

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.870 
very different styles of music coming
together<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.860> create<00:03:03.040> something<00:03:03.220> very<00:03:03.820> unique

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
together to create something very unique

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.990 
together to create something very unique
it's<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.990> a<00:03:05.140> really<00:03:05.680> cool<00:03:06.280> thing<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.880> I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
it's just a really cool thing and I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.250 
it's just a really cool thing and I
don't<00:03:07.180> think<00:03:07.360> any<00:03:07.540> other<00:03:07.630> artists<00:03:08.170> could

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
don't think any other artists could

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.020 
don't think any other artists could
really<00:03:08.530> pull<00:03:08.710> anything<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.280> off<00:03:09.670> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
really pull anything like that off the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.850 
really pull anything like that off the
album<00:03:10.180> ends<00:03:10.540> with<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.750> song<00:03:11.050> waking<00:03:11.620> light

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
album ends with the song waking light

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.190 
album ends with the song waking light
which<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.340> slow<00:03:12.730> piano<00:03:13.060> ballad<00:03:13.570> that<00:03:13.600> ncl

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
which is a slow piano ballad that ncl

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.320 
which is a slow piano ballad that ncl
long<00:03:14.380> exactly<00:03:14.800> when<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.160> needs<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.490> this<00:03:16.150> is

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
long exactly when it needs to this is

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.060 
long exactly when it needs to this is
the<00:03:16.540> perfect<00:03:16.840> song<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.200> end<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.650> album<00:03:17.920> with

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
the perfect song to end the album with

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.590 
the perfect song to end the album with
because<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.520> kind<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.760> captures<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.450> spirit

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
because it kind of captures the spirit

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.360 
because it kind of captures the spirit
and<00:03:20.050> sort<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> essence<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.190> whole

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
and sort of the essence of the whole

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.520 
and sort of the essence of the whole
record<00:03:21.640> just<00:03:22.390> right<00:03:22.690> at<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.930> end<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.290> sort<00:03:23.470> of

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
record just right at the end it sort of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.200 
record just right at the end it sort of
works<00:03:23.770> as<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.010> conclusion<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.030> whole<00:03:25.180> thing

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
works as a conclusion to the whole thing

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.390 
works as a conclusion to the whole thing
the<00:03:25.720> song<00:03:25.900> has<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.110> very<00:03:26.380> cinematic<00:03:26.770> feel<00:03:27.130> too

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the song has a very cinematic feel too

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.100 
the song has a very cinematic feel too
and<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:27.610> can<00:03:27.760> definitely<00:03:27.880> see<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.540> song<00:03:28.870> being

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
and I can definitely see the song being

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.290 
and I can definitely see the song being
played<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.590> movie<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.220> sort<00:03:30.460> of<00:03:30.490> emphasize<00:03:30.700> a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
played in a movie to sort of emphasize a

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.390 
played in a movie to sort of emphasize a
scene<00:03:31.750> or<00:03:31.780> something<00:03:32.410> like<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:33.010> really

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
scene or something like that I really

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.490 
scene or something like that I really
like<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.790> extended<00:03:34.720> instrumental<00:03:35.260> part

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
like the extended instrumental part

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.860 
like the extended instrumental part
towards<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.950> ANA<00:03:36.100> really<00:03:36.430> kind<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.760> works<00:03:37.720> to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
towards the ANA really kind of works to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.170 
towards the ANA really kind of works to
leave<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.530> listener<00:03:38.710> behind<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.550> a<00:03:39.670> way<00:03:39.850> that

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
leave the listener behind in a way that

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.270 
leave the listener behind in a way that
kind<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.510> want<00:03:41.200> leaves<00:03:41.530> you<00:03:41.680> wanting<00:03:41.830> more<00:03:42.220> but

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
kind of want leaves you wanting more but

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.390 
kind of want leaves you wanting more but
also<00:03:42.670> with<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.000> sense<00:03:43.330> of<00:03:43.570> conclusion<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.470> sort

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
also with a sense of conclusion and sort

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.060 
also with a sense of conclusion and sort
of<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:45.580> sense<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.960> album<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.740> over

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
of a sense that this the album is over

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.890 
of a sense that this the album is over
but<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.060> kind<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.330> want<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.570> hear<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.840> again

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
but you kind of want to hear it again

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.750 
but you kind of want to hear it again

different from song to song sometimes
it's<00:03:54.340> washed<00:03:54.580> in<00:03:54.850> huge<00:03:55.180> instruments<00:03:55.810> and

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960
