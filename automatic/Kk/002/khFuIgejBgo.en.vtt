 the only features of freddie which 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.829
 can see on the camera is it 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.340
 animatronic eyes or some of his 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.430
 poorly lit parts of the body it has 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.420
 human hand prints on face though 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.880
 they are very difficult to notice its rainbow 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.700
 the shell has a light blue tint 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.430
 but he usually looks with his eyes up 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.640
 skeleton on camera 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.850

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.110
 there is first his ways with his group 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.090
 Bonnie and Chika mates after activation 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:33.259
 he will follow the established path 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:36.270
 from the stage of the exhibition to the office that is to the office 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.439
 the song will be played when it's on 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.799
 the kitchen coming to stay in the dark 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.570
 places 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.240
 rooms and in other rooms leave 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.250
 see only his eyes it means u 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.430
 freddie runs off cameras as far as 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.380
 maybe among will not be seen if 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.009
 another animatronic is in the same 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.290
 the room that he is viewing freddy on 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.790
 security cameras slow it down on your 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.799
 the way even if he doesn't see in the room in 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.679
 the first part of the week Freddy is not very 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.850
 active he usually remains on stage 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.200
 and watching the cameras 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.030
 periodically it will be activated in 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.500
 the beginning of the week only if the player 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.170
 electricity is over at this time 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.230
 Player of the meeting in the lit eyes and music 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.750
 before his attack if the player at this time 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.390
 don't move the camera left and right 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.810
 a higher ring he usually plays 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.090
 Long version of the ringing let's grunts a little 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.270
 more time to hold out until 6 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.610
 am explanation of no movement 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.370
 Freddy on the first two nights according to 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.070
 the developer is learning style 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.670
 games to adapt to it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.130
 accordingly from 3 nights later he 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.230
 will become active usually when frenay 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.050
 starting to move with higher deep laughter 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.080
 Freddy moves only when his 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.570
 intersects the cameras so that if the player 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.820
 looking straight at him then he won't 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.360
 move at a time when the player doesn't 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.820
 noticed Freddie's behavior completely 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.040
 depends on the player 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.500
 Freddy can enter the office through 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.840
 the east hall his movement seems not 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.300
 have strict rules and almost instantly 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.830
 he our often appear to have 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.290
 opportunity to teleport 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.140
 this question is complicated by the fact that he does not 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.180
 always laughs when he moves it 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.950
 means that the player must constantly look for 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.920
 him and ensure that freddie but not 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.260
 is near his office the best 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.870
 way to stop freddie often watch 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.940
 on the camera braking his movements if 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.940
 Freddy can be seen on camera 4b 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.200
 always closing the camera looking at him 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:02.310
 if a player doesn't look at freddie while he 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:04.430
 is in reproach the world loud laughter will 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.290
 I heard pointing out that he had entered the room 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.060
 after that the real fun begins 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.540
 of course here for him 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.900
 Ivana beats player Freddie does not appear in 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.250
 blind spot and its eastern position 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.860
 the hall indicates that he is only one step away 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.430
 from entering the office and ending the game 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.870
 go yourself dangerous and unpredictable 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.469
 character in the game he can go to any 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.780
 a door 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:34.060
 will appear out of nowhere quickly 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.400
 teleport cameras he doesn't 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.590
 reacts to light 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.699
 if you notice it in one of the four 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.849
 closest cameras close the door well here 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:48.879

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:55.539
