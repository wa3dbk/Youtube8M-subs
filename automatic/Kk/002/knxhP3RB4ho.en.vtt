always start with the smallest detail so

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.330 
always start with the smallest detail so
in<00:01:32.170> here<00:01:32.380> i'm<00:01:32.469> looking<00:01:32.740> at<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.920> turkey<00:01:33.310> and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
in here i'm looking at the turkey and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.340 
in here i'm looking at the turkey and
i'm<00:01:33.520> looking<00:01:33.789> at<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.939> feathers<00:01:34.359> so<00:01:34.990> I'm<00:01:35.139> going

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
i'm looking at the feathers so I'm going

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.840 
i'm looking at the feathers so I'm going
to<00:01:35.380> turn<00:01:35.649> this<00:01:35.829> over<00:01:36.039> now<00:01:36.369> that<00:01:36.520> I've<00:01:36.609> looked

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
to turn this over now that I've looked

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.609 
to turn this over now that I've looked
at<00:01:37.029> it<00:01:37.209> and<00:01:37.359> I've<00:01:37.719> decided<00:01:37.749> that<00:01:38.170> I<00:01:38.289> want<00:01:38.319> to<00:01:38.529> do

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.139 
at it and I've decided that I want to do
the<00:01:38.740> yellow<00:01:38.979> fur<00:01:39.279> so<00:01:39.520> if<00:01:39.609> you<00:01:39.700> can<00:01:39.850> see<00:01:40.029> this

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
the yellow fur so if you can see this

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.459 
the yellow fur so if you can see this
from<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.450> front<00:01:40.749> I've<00:01:40.990> already<00:01:41.139> done<00:01:41.350> the

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
from the front I've already done the

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.559 
from the front I've already done the
yellow<00:01:41.740> there<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.249> then<00:01:42.819> I<00:01:42.850> just<00:01:43.179> have<00:01:43.329> little

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
yellow there and then I just have little

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:44.910 
yellow there and then I just have little
bits<00:01:43.749> of<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.020> sweet<00:01:44.229> wise<00:01:44.380> melting<00:01:44.829> wafers

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
bits of the sweet wise melting wafers

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.389 
bits of the sweet wise melting wafers
here<00:01:45.520> melted<00:01:45.999> and<00:01:46.149> I'm<00:01:47.079> going<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.649> do<00:01:48.369> my

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
here melted and I'm going to do my

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.449 
here melted and I'm going to do my
orange<00:01:48.909> next<00:01:49.469> and<00:01:50.469> I<00:01:50.829> just<00:01:50.979> AM<00:01:51.039> lt's<00:01:51.279> in<00:01:51.399> a

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
orange next and I just AM lt's in a

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.129 
orange next and I just AM lt's in a
little<00:01:51.729> bitty<00:01:51.849> glass<00:01:52.090> container<00:01:52.569> and<00:01:52.689> then<00:01:53.079> I

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
little bitty glass container and then I

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:55.529 
little bitty glass container and then I
go<00:01:53.289> in<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.560> paint<00:01:53.770> them<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:55.270> doesn't

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
go in and paint them and it doesn't

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.929 
go in and paint them and it doesn't
matter<00:01:55.719> if<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:55.959> layer<00:01:56.439> over<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.159> color<00:01:57.549> i<00:01:57.639> did

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
matter if I layer over the color i did

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.029 
matter if I layer over the color i did
just<00:01:57.969> before<00:01:58.299> like<00:01:58.689> that<00:01:58.719> because<00:01:59.499> it's<00:01:59.979> not

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
just before like that because it's not

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.160 
just before like that because it's not
going<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.369> be<00:02:00.459> seen<00:02:00.759> because<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.719> front<00:02:02.079> part

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
going to be seen because that front part

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.649 
going to be seen because that front part
went<00:02:02.649> down<00:02:02.859> first<00:02:03.279> so<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.149> just<00:02:04.359> do<00:02:04.539> the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
went down first so you just do the

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.289 
went down first so you just do the
orange<00:02:05.049> all<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.469> way<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.770> front<00:02:06.240> all<00:02:07.240> the

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
orange all the way to the front all the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.499 
orange all the way to the front all the
way<00:02:07.479> down<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.840> feathers<00:02:08.170> where<00:02:08.380> this<00:02:08.470> shows<00:02:08.830> a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
way down the feathers where this shows a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.820 
way down the feathers where this shows a
nice<00:02:10.509> pretty<00:02:10.869> color<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.410> then<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.680> turn

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
nice pretty color and then you can turn

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.080 
nice pretty color and then you can turn
it<00:02:11.950> over<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.190> look<00:02:12.370> at<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.520> again<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:12.910> make

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
it over and look at it again and make

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.940 
it over and look at it again and make
sure<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:13.390> got<00:02:14.170> enough<00:02:14.410> layering<00:02:14.709> you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
sure that's got enough layering you

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.229 
sure that's got enough layering you
layer<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.340> one<00:02:15.489> more<00:02:15.610> time<00:02:15.670> if<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.060> want<00:02:16.090> a

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
layer that one more time if you want a

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.690 
layer that one more time if you want a
deeper<00:02:16.360> color<00:02:16.659> but<00:02:17.560> that's<00:02:17.950> that's<00:02:18.489> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
deeper color but that's that's the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.230 
deeper color but that's that's the
premise<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:19.959> you

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
premise of that and then you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
premise of that and then you
go<00:02:20.300> behind<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:22.670> red<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.360> here<00:02:24.110> I've

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
go behind that with red and here I've

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.200 
go behind that with red and here I've
got<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.440> little<00:02:24.830> bitty<00:02:25.310> Goblin<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.000> did

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
got a little bitty Goblin that I did

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.910 
got a little bitty Goblin that I did
hear<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.690> little<00:02:26.900> gobbler<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:27.470> under<00:02:27.800> his

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
hear a little gobbler there under his

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.340 
hear a little gobbler there under his
under<00:02:28.460> his<00:02:28.550> chin<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:29.810> going<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> do<00:02:30.230> is

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
under his chin and I'm going to do is

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.730 
under his chin and I'm going to do is
feet<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.920> red<00:02:31.160> as<00:02:31.370> well<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.320> then<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.410> can<00:02:33.560> do

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
feet and red as well and then you can do

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.450 
feet and red as well and then you can do
the<00:02:35.140> last<00:02:36.140> layer<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.650> feathers<00:02:36.860> up<00:02:37.160> here<00:02:37.370> in

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
the last layer of feathers up here in

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:47.590 
the last layer of feathers up here in
red<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:42.610> then<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:44.720> go<00:02:44.870> behind<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:46.600> fill

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
red and then you go behind and just fill

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.970 
red and then you go behind and just fill
with<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.810> little<00:02:48.080> bit<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.200> chocolate<00:02:48.470> now<00:02:48.740> again

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
with a little bit of chocolate now again

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.680 
with a little bit of chocolate now again
a<00:02:49.010> secret<00:02:49.520> on<00:02:49.610> these<00:02:49.790> molds<00:02:50.270> making<00:02:50.570> them

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
a secret on these molds making them

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.350 
a secret on these molds making them
really<00:02:51.020> pretty<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.620> not<00:02:52.310> over<00:02:52.730> filling<00:02:53.150> them

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
really pretty is not over filling them

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.080 
really pretty is not over filling them
once<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.930> make<00:02:54.140> them<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> little<00:02:54.470> too<00:02:54.710> full

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
once you make them a little too full

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.060 
once you make them a little too full
then<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:57.020> just<00:02:57.140> kind<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.320> dribbles<00:02:57.680> over<00:02:57.920> and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
then it just kind of dribbles over and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.340 
then it just kind of dribbles over and
it<00:02:58.130> makes<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.460> not<00:02:58.760> very<00:02:58.820> clean<00:02:59.360> so<00:02:59.660> again<00:02:59.930> how

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
it makes it not very clean so again how

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.720 
it makes it not very clean so again how
you<00:03:00.380> use<00:03:00.740> these<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.130> just<00:03:01.310> tap<00:03:01.460> them<00:03:01.640> on<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
you use these you just tap them on the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.360 
you use these you just tap them on the
counter<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> few<00:03:02.300> times<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:03.950> really<00:03:04.130> helps

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
counter a few times and it really helps

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.920 
counter a few times and it really helps
spread<00:03:04.580> out<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.910> chocolate<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.510> makes<00:03:05.750> it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
spread out that chocolate and makes it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.110 
spread out that chocolate and makes it
nice<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.410> even<00:03:06.770> now<00:03:07.340> I've<00:03:07.460> got<00:03:07.610> one<00:03:07.790> here

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
nice and even now I've got one here

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.210 
nice and even now I've got one here
again<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.750> goes<00:03:08.990> in<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.230> refrigerator

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
again this goes in the refrigerator

to use do the fun part is actually

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.710 
to use do the fun part is actually
assembling<00:03:21.890> these<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:22.940> can<00:03:23.120> kind<00:03:23.390> of<00:03:23.480> look

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
assembling these so you can kind of look

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.490 
assembling these so you can kind of look
and<00:03:23.930> how<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.740> is<00:03:25.640> going<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.910> go<00:03:26.000> together

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
and how this is going to go together

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.950 
and how this is going to go together
basically<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.560> want<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:27.830> attach<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:29.210> bigger
