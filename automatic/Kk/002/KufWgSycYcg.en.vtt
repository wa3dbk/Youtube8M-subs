00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.619
 pear tree 3 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.390
 and for him 3 is a rare case where a franchise swims against the tide and the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.309
 technological innovation ignoring all the elements that have made the fame of its 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.689
 previous chapters 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.889
 and presenting technical aspects of the past 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.590
 until the second game in parellheiros conquered fans due to its high 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.440
 complexity despite the rather intuitive mechanics 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.780
 what was done in this sequel 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.290
 the producer finished with all the complexity with blessing of the several 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.700
 nations in only three major civilizations in main mode 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.590
 the accident 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.200
 with more technological resources in more expensive units far east 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.950
 lesser degree of technology but large and cheap troops and middle east more 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.469
 exotic communities of more specific actions 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.520
 regardless of the chosen civilization, the scheme works the same way 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.570
 in battle mode and we have the basics 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.310
 with building of basins the creation of armies the collection of resources and the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.510
 conquest of new territories 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.600
 to the end of a given objective 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390
 a world mode emerges 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 with a strategic global map in which it is possible to see the passage of serasa 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.370
 do research 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.690
 and administering diplomatic actions in addition to sending spies 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.730
 routes commercial routes 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.560
 nothing goes beyond what is necessary 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.130
 it takes for example 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.880
 manage only three types of resources 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.659
 but the outcome of the match becomes so slow 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.859
 that the player spends more time increasing their margins in 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.520
 explore maps 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.510
 the battle system also contributes to this, since even in the face of a 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.990
 relative variety 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.190
 if it exists in three types of moisture 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.200
 infantry 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.740
 long distance and special 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.510
 balancing the three forces it is very difficult to lose any battle 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.430
 since the game is in charge of even organizing the formation of units 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.830
 in the field during conflicts the disorganization of the enemy troops in 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.299
 Combat also gives a little help 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.010
 difficult battles, and a slow system has few 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 management options and evolution in pailles 3 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.829
 soon becomes boring 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.879
 I'm like an old game made for several years even with the option of matches 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.329
 multiplayer with open modes that month only gives a small survival to the 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.239
 title 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.959
 the technical aspects also cooperate a lot and give a beat the title 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.420
 since it does not mark there is absolutely nothing that draws attention 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.020
 either in the visual sound aspect or in the general disarmament 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.059
 a few days of a million simple sounds and phrases said 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.690
 by his soldiers some even funny 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.849
 but that with the passage of time in the face of such repercussion 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.680
 becomes extremely irritating 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.989
 and creates a strange contrast with an air of seriousness that the game proposes to 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.019
 market 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.379
 stylized and extremely colorful graphics give the impression of trying 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.829
 hide the poverty with which they were created displaying buildings and troops 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.680
 Yemeni women without personality and who make their identification difficult 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:25.579
 there are however some good weather effects there during combat as 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.029
 explosions but can not divert attention from the truncated animations and 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.169
 of repetitive scenarios 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.270
 it arrives to be amazing 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.270
 that to generate of suarez so old-fashioned the game presents / displays heavy in several 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.420
 moments in pear 3 is the low point of a promising franchise 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.379
 and decided to discard just everything that it hits interesting 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.330
 its high level of complexity has been left aside 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.500
 to give place to a basic system that today no longer has place 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.959
 the new direction taken also seems to have affected the game technically 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.499
 which is so podium 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:06.549
 and with some design choices questionable mainly in a 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.819
 strange sense of humor and in the design of some units and their functions
