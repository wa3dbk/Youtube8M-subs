00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.780
 then entering a ship step to 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.670
 another side and he came to his city and here he 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.340
 they brought a paralytic lying in a 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.359
 bed and watching jesus in their faith 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.480
 He told the paralytic, trust your son 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.609
 sins are forgiven and behold 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.210
 some of the scribes said inside 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:31.359
 yes this blaspheme and seeing Jesus his 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.360
 thoughts said why you think bad 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.820
 things in your hearts that is more 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.320
 easy to say the sins are you 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.970
 forgiven or say get up and walk then 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.520
 so that you may know that the son of man 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.720
 has power in the land to forgive 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.950
 sins then says to the paralytic 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.110
 get up take your bed and go home 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.650
 then he got up and went to his 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.830
 home and the crowd watching it marveled 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.040
 and glorified God who had given such 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.710
 power to men 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.870
 and happening Jesus from there saw a man 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.570
 who was sitting at the bank of the 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.400
 public tributes which was called 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.370
 I kill and he says follow me and he got up and 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.460
 followed him and it happened that while he was 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.770
 sitting at the table in his house here 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.680
 many publicans and sinners who had 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.010
 come they sat together at the table 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.400
 with jesus and his disciples and seeing this 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.930
 the Pharisees said to his disciples 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.200
 because your teacher eats with the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.140
 publicans and sinners more by hearing what 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.479
 Jesus told them those who are healthy do not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.990
 they need a doctor but the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.340
 sick people, well, if you learn what 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.840
 it is mercy I want and not sacrifice 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.240
 because I have not come to call the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 just but to sinners to 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.200
 repentance 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.790
 then the disciples of John came 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.850
 to him saying 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.570
 because we and the Pharisees fast 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.320
 many times and your disciples do not fast 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.440
 and Jesus told them can the children of the 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.350
 bridal chamber have meanwhile mourning 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.080
 that the husband is with them, more will come 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.530
 days when the husband will be taken away and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.500
 then they will help and nobody throws patch 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.680
 of new cloth in old dress because the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.740
 such a patch pulls the dress and it is done 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 worse break or throw new wine in 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.920
 old wineskins otherwise the wineskins will 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.560
 they break and the wine spills and they get lost 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.110
 us more made in new wine in 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.330
 new wineskins and the one and the other 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.390
 preserves together 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.170
 speaking in these things to them that here 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.800
 a ruler came and worshiped him saying 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.490
 just died more come and put your hand 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.550
 over it and Jesus will live and rise and 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.800
 he followed him with his disciples and here a 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.920
 sick woman with blood flow to 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.620
 twelve years approaching from behind touched the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.920
 stripe of her dress because she said between 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.280
 yes if touching is only his dress I will be 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.200
 free more jesus turning around and looking at her 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.330
 said trusting daughter your faith has delivered you and 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.640
 the woman was free from that hour 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.040
 and come Jesus to the main house 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.150
 watching the flute holders and the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.370
 crowd that was making a buzz told 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.420
 keep away that the girl is not dead 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.400
 they sleep more and mocked him but 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.120
 when the crowd was thrown out 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.420
 came in and took her hand and got up 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.720
 the girl and spread this fame by 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.360
 all that land and passing Jesus from 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.240
 there followed him two blind men shouting 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.150
 and saying have mercy on us 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.730
 son of david I have come to the house 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.360

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.440
 He says think I can do this they 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.739
 they say yes sir then touched the eyes of 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.709
 they saying according to your faith or 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.570
 it has been done and their eyes were 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.260
 open and Jesus commissioned them 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.770
 rigorously saying look no one 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.590

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.350

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.300
 and they went out and they brought him a 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.599
 mute man possessed 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.300
 and found out the devil the mute spoke 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:47.569
 and the crowd marveled saying 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.050
 It never has been so seen in 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:53.870

 villages teaching in the synagogues of 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.740

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.880
 crowd had mercy on her 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:19.000
 because it was spilled and scattered like 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.240
 sheep that have no shepherd then 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.320
