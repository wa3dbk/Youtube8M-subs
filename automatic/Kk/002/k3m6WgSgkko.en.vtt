of my gargoyle the next one that i use

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.080 
of my gargoyle the next one that i use
is<00:00:42.450> call<00:00:42.750> off<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> purpose<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is call off the purpose of this is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.779 
is call off the purpose of this is
basically<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:47.010> you're<00:00:47.160> getting<00:00:47.579> ready

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
basically so when you're getting ready

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.290 
basically so when you're getting ready
to<00:00:47.879> line<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.420> null<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.559> turn<00:00:49.770> your

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
to line up a null you can turn your

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.029 
to line up a null you can turn your
cloth<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.860> wait

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
cloth this way you don't have to wait

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
cloth this way you don't have to wait
for<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.460> pets<00:00:54.120> energy<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.079> can

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
for your pets energy to get up you can

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.010 
for your pets energy to get up you can
just<00:00:55.460> use<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.879> null<00:00:57.329> whenever<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:57.899> ready

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
just use your null whenever you're ready

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.270 
just use your null whenever you're ready
I<00:00:58.910> used<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> use<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.500> claw<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> whole

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
I used to use a claw on as a whole

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
I used to use a claw on as a whole
different<00:01:02.579> button<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.120> incorporated<00:01:03.750> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
different button but I incorporated that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.120 
different button but I incorporated that
into<00:01:05.030> my<00:01:06.030> dark<00:01:06.299> transformation<00:01:07.130> this

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
into my dark transformation this

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.500 
into my dark transformation this
basically<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.610> simplifies<00:01:09.030> things<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.479> i

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
basically just simplifies things so i

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.060 
basically just simplifies things so i
can<00:01:09.689> very<00:01:09.840> easily<00:01:09.930> turn<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> off<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.040> then

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
can very easily turn it off and then

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.120 
can very easily turn it off and then
right<00:01:11.280> back<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.330> uh<00:01:12.680> yeah<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.890> two

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
right back on all with uh yeah just two

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.710 
right back on all with uh yeah just two
buttons<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
buttons and then not have to have a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.920 
buttons and then not have to have a
third<00:01:16.170> button<00:01:16.770> um<00:01:17.040> these<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.540> exist

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
third button um these are all exist

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.719 
third button um these are all exist
macros<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.950> one<00:01:20.220> set<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.549> for

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
macros right here I have one set up for

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.789 
macros right here I have one set up for
an<00:01:20.790> all<00:01:20.939> 14<00:01:21.810> sim<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.619> for

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
an all 14 sim and then one for

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.429 
an all 14 sim and then one for
strangulate<00:01:23.420> if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.570> very<00:01:24.840> cautious<00:01:25.320> with

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
strangulate if you very cautious with

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
strangulate if you very cautious with
using<00:01:25.799> these<00:01:25.920> macros<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> have

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
using these macros because when you have

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.160 
using these macros because when you have
a<00:01:27.720> focus<00:01:28.340> it'll<00:01:29.340> only<00:01:29.490> use<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> ability<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
a focus it'll only use the ability to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
a focus it'll only use the ability to
that<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:31.950> focus<00:01:32.340> they're<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.759> modifiers

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that to your focus they're not modifiers

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660 
that to your focus they're not modifiers
so<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> target<00:01:34.829> it'll<00:01:35.220> use<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so if you have a target it'll use the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.850 
so if you have a target it'll use the
target<00:01:36.090> without<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.689> focus<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.409> when<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.680> have

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
target without a focus but when you have

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
target without a focus but when you have
a<00:01:37.890> focus<00:01:38.250> it'll<00:01:38.490> use<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> focus<00:01:39.329> every

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a focus it'll use it on the focus every

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.390 
a focus it'll use it on the focus every
single<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.920> very<00:01:40.950> careful

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
single time you have to be very careful

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.060 
single time you have to be very careful
with<00:01:41.640> using<00:01:41.970> these<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.710> basically<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.890> for

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
with using these so basically like for

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.050 
with using these so basically like for
strangulate<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> suggest<00:01:45.090> either<00:01:46.549> having<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
strangulate I suggest either having the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300 
strangulate I suggest either having the
target<00:01:48.630> arenas<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.110> through<00:01:49.259> five<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
target arenas one through five but I

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
target arenas one through five but I
also<00:01:50.490> suggest<00:01:51.030> having<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.720> bars<00:01:51.930> if

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
also suggest having it on your bars if

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.359 
also suggest having it on your bars if
you're<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> use<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> focus<00:01:53.009> exist

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you're going to use the focus exist

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.399 
you're going to use the focus exist
because<00:01:53.600> for<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.720> battlegrounds<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
because for like battlegrounds you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.959 
because for like battlegrounds you
obviously<00:01:55.770> can't<00:01:55.979> use<00:01:56.280> target<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.790> through

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
obviously can't use target one through

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.609 
obviously can't use target one through
five<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.920> yeah<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> suggest<00:01:59.430> having<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.619> by

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
five so yeah I suggest having it a by

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.209 
five so yeah I suggest having it a by
itself<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.490> having<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.119> exist<00:02:03.509> macro<00:02:03.899> I

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
itself and then having the exist macro I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.920 
itself and then having the exist macro I
then<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.399> null<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:06.180> through<00:02:06.390> five<00:02:06.540> for

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
then have null one through five for

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.759 
then have null one through five for
arenas

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:07.769 
arenas

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:09.930 
arenas
really<00:02:08.769> don't<00:02:08.920> use<00:02:09.069> four<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.399> five<00:02:09.519> that<00:02:09.789> much

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
really don't use four and five that much

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.040 
really don't use four and five that much
to<00:02:10.060> be<00:02:10.090> honest<00:02:10.300> because<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.539> really<00:02:10.780> don't<00:02:10.929> do

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
to be honest because I really don't do

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.830 
to be honest because I really don't do
five<00:02:11.319> but<00:02:12.040> they<00:02:12.550> are<00:02:12.700> extremely<00:02:12.940> helpful<00:02:13.420> for

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
five but they are extremely helpful for

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.759 
five but they are extremely helpful for
uh<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:14.730> arenas<00:02:15.730> one<00:02:15.819> through<00:02:16.000> three<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:17.650> is

really don't think you need to focus
chains<00:02:53.799> too<00:02:54.069> often<00:02:54.400> but<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.640> focus<00:02:55.090> group<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
chains too often but a focus group of

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.339 
chains too often but a focus group of
focus<00:02:55.690> interrupt<00:02:56.349> is<00:02:56.500> very<00:02:56.709> variable<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:59.230> have
