on a website and you know just through a
little<00:00:27.130> little<00:00:27.790> bit<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:27.970> deductive<00:00:28.509> logic

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
little little bit of deductive logic

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.269 
little little bit of deductive logic
deductive<00:00:29.860> logic

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
deductive logic

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.900 
deductive logic
it's<00:00:30.790> just<00:00:31.029> paracord<00:00:31.450> not<00:00:31.719> rocket<00:00:32.079> surgery

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910

need about 4.5 feet or four and a half
feet<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.910> gutted<00:00:51.910> 550<00:00:52.420> paracord<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.960> for<00:00:53.890> the

skinny mummy about three feet but that

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.639 
skinny mummy about three feet but that
again<00:00:56.620> depends<00:00:57.130> on<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.850> length<00:00:58.660> at<00:00:58.989> which<00:00:59.320> you

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
again depends on the length at which you

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.380 
again depends on the length at which you
want<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.829> make<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.130> body<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.880> this<00:01:00.970> is<00:01:01.030> about

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
want to make the body and this is about

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.850 
want to make the body and this is about
an<00:01:02.170> inch<00:01:02.380> and<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.579> half<00:01:03.610> I<00:01:04.030> believe<00:01:04.269> so

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
an inch and a half I believe so

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.679 
an inch and a half I believe so
but<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.250> can<00:01:06.369> play<00:01:06.490> with<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.759> so<00:01:07.000> you<00:01:07.270> can

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
but you can play with that so you can

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.060 
but you can play with that so you can
always<00:01:07.780> adjust<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.290> length<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.649> paracord<00:01:08.950> you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
always adjust the length of paracord you

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.039 
always adjust the length of paracord you
work<00:01:09.250> with<00:01:09.399> if<00:01:09.520> you<00:01:09.640> want<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> longer<00:01:10.149> body<00:01:10.360> okay

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
work with if you want a longer body okay

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.730 
work with if you want a longer body okay
so<00:01:11.770> first<00:01:12.159> things<00:01:12.310> first<00:01:12.450> let's<00:01:13.450> get<00:01:13.810> this

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
so first things first let's get this

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.249 
so first things first let's get this
bead<00:01:15.009> thread<00:01:15.579> it<00:01:15.729> onto<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.090> paracord<00:01:16.539> so

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
bead thread it onto the paracord so

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.950 
bead thread it onto the paracord so
easiest<00:01:17.649> way<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.770> found<00:01:18.069> is<00:01:18.369> by<00:01:19.270> taking<00:01:19.689> one<00:01:19.929> of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
easiest way I found is by taking one of

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.069 
easiest way I found is by taking one of
the<00:01:20.139> inner<00:01:20.319> threads<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:21.039> your<00:01:21.069> 550<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:22.090> just

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
the inner threads of your 550 and just

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.669 
the inner threads of your 550 and just
going<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.259> double<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:23.709> over<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:25.060> this

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
going to double it over like this

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.590 
going to double it over like this
and<00:01:26.679> then<00:01:26.829> you're<00:01:26.950> going<00:01:27.069> to<00:01:27.159> feed<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.700> through

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.770 

feed<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.749> through<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.380> middle<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:34.889> your<00:01:35.889> 550

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.969 

okay<00:01:43.260> like<00:01:44.260> this<00:01:44.409> right<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.190> then<00:01:46.979> we're

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
okay like this right and then we're

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.060 
okay like this right and then we're
going<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.190> take<00:01:49.590> these<00:01:50.590> two<00:01:50.650> ends<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.350> insert

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
going to take these two ends and insert

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.260 
going to take these two ends and insert
it<00:01:54.250> through<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.610> top<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.330> skull<00:01:55.600> okay

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it through the top of the skull okay

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.010 
it through the top of the skull okay
just<00:01:58.270> like<00:01:58.720> that<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:01.090> now<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:01.540> can<00:02:01.690> do<00:02:01.840> that

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
just like that this now we can do that

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.690 
just like that this now we can do that
to<00:02:02.229> drag<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:03.159> rest<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.840> core<00:02:04.840> through<00:02:05.700> okay<00:02:08.700> so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
to drag the rest of core through okay so

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.300 
to drag the rest of core through okay so
from<00:02:10.179> there<00:02:10.450> it's<00:02:11.319> going<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.530> use<00:02:11.620> my<00:02:11.770> one<00:02:12.220> I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
from there it's going to use my one I

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.590 
from there it's going to use my one I
already<00:02:12.520> made<00:02:12.640> for<00:02:12.790> reference<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:16.060> there<00:02:16.510> we

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
already made for reference so there we

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.320 
already made for reference so there we
go<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:17.620> from<00:02:17.950> here<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.190> here<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.640> about<00:02:18.790> an<00:02:19.120> inch

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
go so from here to here is about an inch

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.110 
go so from here to here is about an inch
and<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.600> half<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:20.170> here<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.550> course<00:02:21.700> of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
and a half and here this is of course of

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.340 
and a half and here this is of course of
course<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.540> adjust<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:22.900> if<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.170> want<00:02:23.320> a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
course you can adjust this if you want a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.050 
course you can adjust this if you want a
longer<00:02:23.530> loop<00:02:23.769> I<00:02:24.040> think<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.580> also<00:02:24.850> about

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
longer loop I think this is also about

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.800 
longer loop I think this is also about
in<00:02:25.480> age<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> half<00:02:26.280> okay<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.540> there<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:28.780> go

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
in age and a half okay so there we go

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.130 
in age and a half okay so there we go
we've<00:02:29.170> got<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.440> set<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.510> next<00:02:31.780> step<00:02:31.930> is

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
we've got it set up now the next step is

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.300 
we've got it set up now the next step is
