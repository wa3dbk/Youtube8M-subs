00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.410
 hello in this tutorial we will learn to 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.480
 make these pretty ali the crazy ones that 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.330
 I'm sure the millions will love it and 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.880
 I hope that you also good 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.150
 does only with two clean pipes and the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.180
 we are going to need moving eyes of these 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.920
 big 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.920
 and well let's start doing it 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 let's first double it what are the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.540
 little tips of our clean pipes 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.780
 then we are going to fold them in half 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.489
 let's rotate those a bit in this part 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.489
 of the child 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.410
 calculating more or less the size of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.650
 our finger from our finger 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.650
 boy 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.690
 now if we measure it and we are going to turn 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.820
 A) Yes 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.220
 Once that 's what the ring is 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.830
 what we are going to do is the following 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.790
 let's put two clean pipes like this and two 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.220
 upwards now 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.750
 we take our movable eye and 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.909
 let's take it to measure the circle 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.020
 what are we going to do with the pipes 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.020
 that would be like that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.140
 we dry the size well 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.929
 and what we are going to do now is the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.560
 bit of pipe cleaner that we had left 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.229
 here we will cross over to this part to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.300
 that is fixed good and it was then 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.879
 what is going to be the circle of the first 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.879
 eye and we do the same with this other 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.740
 here are the two circles that 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.150
 corresponds to the eyes and you are clean 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.569
 guys that we left are going to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.200
 roll up 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.200
 A) Yes 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.640
 and we have our ring of this 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.500
 way now now we're just going to place 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.740
 a little bit of glue in what is the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.740
 ojito 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.440
 here around has like a bit 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.580
 an eyebrow an edge quoted there we're going to 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.580
 place the glue 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.830
 and we do the same thing on the other side 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.580
 we press well to make it look good 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.060
 stuck the pipes clean the eyes and not 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.060
 detach 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.480
 and let it dry for about two minutes 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.480
 approximately to be ready 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.190
 and look like that we've already been 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.940
 completely formed 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.360
 our 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.810
 and crazy ring can do it in colors 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.810
 most striking 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.770
 and here you can add some accounts 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.810
 pearls I do not know or some feather 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.550
 and ornaments that you will be creating 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.860
 to make them even more crazy 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.350
 Well, I hope this video was 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.240
 of your liking if it was fidel they give you like and 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.360
 see you in the next tutorial up 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360
 then
