00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.099
 the fact that the sofas in the life of the doctors have 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.099
 one more minute 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.120
 the doctors performed a miracle and after a few 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.170
 days we can talk to Ivan to 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.920
 find out what is there outside of the earth 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.920
 being running forward let's say that the case with 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.270
 Ivano radically changed the view 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.370
 resuscitators of this clinic about what 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.540
 feels and experiences the patient 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.540
 survivors of clinical death 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:26.030
 I remember getting out of the subway started 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.030
 cross the road and as if stumbled 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.740
 your eyes a sharp flash is very bright and 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.260
 swiftly 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.260
 with great speed began to fall down 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.540
 I remember very well the feeling of wet 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.540
 wet asphalt 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 people around the ambulance drove up very clearly 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.549
 saw everything I put on a stretcher bear 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:03.200

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.200

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.910

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:15.260
 This nickname is not yet realized 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.959

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.049
 not dead and should be near 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.360
 with our body as we remember during 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.370
 resuscitation the moment of clinical death 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.940
 the decision was made 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.400
 it was possible to tube the patient 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.599
 save the very next day when 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.489
 the nurse delivered medicine to the wards 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.250
 the resurrected told her how he saw his 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.770
 body lying on the operating table 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.830
 as if he soared over him 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.390
 details described the ward and the behavior of all 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.280
 present moment unconditional death 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.030
 told how feared doctors would stop 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.650
 resuscitation and how desperately tried them 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.650
 convince that still alive 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:14.069
 everything happened very quickly remember how 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.769
 carried in the car as carried by the mountains 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.810
 gurney in resuscitation 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:26.280
 I run after them all and behind me bill 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:30.650
