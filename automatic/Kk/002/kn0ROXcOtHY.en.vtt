00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.950
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.320
 to the first minecraft tutorial hodzic 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.300
 Today I'll show you as you one 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.900
 can minecraft for or build circuit 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.850
 so if you have two signals that 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.550
 only if these two signals are activated 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.220
 are a signal activated output 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.320
 Let's say we want one here 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.500
 Run out of slopes only if both 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.739
 lever 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:44.329
 Shaping here are when you are here 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.700
 then just merge then 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.500
 it would not matter which one presses 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.629
 because you would be pressed at the same 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.190
 come out as if only one activated 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.360
 would he would be able to say 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.969
 but now we want that both 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.410
 have to be activated that here 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.570
 signal comes out just build it 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.310
 Here stepped blocks toward 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.390
 then here the Redstone needs to go in 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.740
 So here on the blog here as do not 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:20.960
 touch and here in the middle 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:23.730
 Redstone and here so if he 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.100
 now one activated 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.180
 the signal still stays here 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 disabled in the second activates the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.910
 signal that is because that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.280
 signal is always invested so 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.430
 is reversed because such a red 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 Location means that if they are different here 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.990
 go out of this and if they are here too 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.690
 out is no signal on it 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 and if there is a signal on it 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.530
 invested this torch and thus 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.620
 one of then here is no signal here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.230
 more is reversed here again and again 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.300
 already you have a switch that was 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.300
 it already is how it is
