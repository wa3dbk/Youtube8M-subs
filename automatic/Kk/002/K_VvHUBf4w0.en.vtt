probably the first ever fake player
actually<00:02:15.720> signed<00:02:16.140> through<00:02:16.410> my<00:02:16.560> Scout<00:02:16.800> system

that<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.290> honest<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.010> might<00:02:20.190> be<00:02:20.220> wrong

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
that to be honest so it might be wrong

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.190
