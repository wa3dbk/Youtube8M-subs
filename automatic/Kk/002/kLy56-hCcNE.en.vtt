00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.190

 everyone I hope like that 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.690
 new video we could say the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.220
 cooking recipes videos for 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.560
 simply because 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.960
 we worked with a kit for 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.790
 to make little apples of love 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.940
 is safe with the complicity of my friend 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.010
 lots two ideas guinea pigs lots are going 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.850
 analyze that so why are you 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.809
 little recipe 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.390
 of course, the famous kit I like 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.780
 approach a little bit to predict so 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.489
 in heat you have 6 sticks but 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.159
 to put in the apples while 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.760
 you just have the little one more 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:56.540
 retouching to color and caramel 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.530
 you have of course the recipe the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.420
 no one for you waiting behind 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.460
 of course it's my son here is not it 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.960
 had known we failed to fit him 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.550
 so if you wait for some noises 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.229
 during the video it's normal it's my 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.250
 security blanket 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.409
 after moussa that you need easy or 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.650
 difficult assistant of the sugar there you 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.200
 must you need 600 g of sugar 1 I 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.390
 want to be there you need a glass of water 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.010
 announced that will arouse year by year it will 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.320
 need a lemon juice we do not have 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.990
 if so do we learn juice buy 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.730
 already closely and we need but on a 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.810
 glass of water to bar the duck she 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.090
 so on 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.160
 oh yes gentlemen but if I put the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.660
 apples you are going serious you need 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.210
 is not my red so lots will you 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.620
 show how to do to have 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.150
 vertigo that of the form almost 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.260
 impossible then to remove that because 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.970
 that of course we will plant the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.040
 boat in the place what do we do elodie 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.080
 have shot but it's the taf abcdef 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.520
 gh 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.260
 so of course you have to give a name 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.260
 h wonder 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.119
 well we'll show you also after we go 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.800
 plant the sticks in the apples on 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.600
 show you how it looks in planted wood 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.979
 you have your little red apple that's 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.380
 preferably it takes poor people where the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.420
 little stick on the side or of course we 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.030
 have removed there that we complain about 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.720
 stick it's to jean claude dusse and the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.420
 plant stick 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.780
 so here she has managed the trick one 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.830
 little little hair menus better I know 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.569
 not how do you say it's actually 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.130
 they could have made a little bit of a side 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.290
 more pointed to get to the student in 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.989
 apples so here are your apples are 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.550
 ready we'll put them aside time 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.800
 to be able to make the caramel you can 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.920
 see elodie behind who is exercising at 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.420
 do not plant it in 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.160
 the hand it was a little crank that 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.290
 that's what we're going to put in 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.700
 color we will put powder 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.580
 of love it is something very very 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.720
 rare it is very difficult to find 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.470
 so here we are going to make caramel 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:02.890
 so we're going to pour the 600 g 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:07.410
 we go there two of sugar go on the water so 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.410
 600 g of sugar with a glass of water 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.300
 so we'll admit against that a little 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.239
 little huge that for six apples here and 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.950
 you have to add the lemon juice 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.330
 so I do not know how much actually 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.810
 unfair lemon we 'll do that to vista 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.810
 nacelles 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.920
 we've done it really well 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.720
 there we are going to put it on a it's a 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.650
 little bit less strong because he 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.300
 dials during the bubbles 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.940
 however, it would be nice if you were 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.630
 I'm here so while the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.850
 caramel continues to try to brown 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.420
 you can see that's it 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.640
 do not forget to think about taking 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.810
 parchment paper for but everything 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.520
 just to put the apples a 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.190
 once we have them to soak in the 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.830
 caramel 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.030
 good it's even more than 25 minutes 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.860
 Farmers must half hour we 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.170
 try to sauté this caramel 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.410
 so yes in my opinion there is really too much 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.310
 do not put so much water so 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.180
 what we are going to do is we go from 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.000
 mix the powder 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.200
 elodie month mix in Toulouse if he 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.590
 is of course the powder we want 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.590
 go out 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.420
 good I'm going to stir an outsider this is in 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.570
 get back quickly the same 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:34.360
 go ahead lots then we will yield with a 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.280
 paoli you cure teeth because that's it 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.370
 she sees that we poured the powder 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.290
 love let it rest for 5 minutes 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.700
 so I look well on earth they 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.110
 be well mixed by support and their 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.610
 at best we do not go that's it 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.200
 very jam when we look at it like 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.750
 so we say let's rest 5 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.340
 minutes so let's rest 5 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.390
 minutes 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.390
 there too the creator 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.490
 good here to let you rest 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.320
 after half an hour of cooking for 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:35.050
 get on board and they were going to us 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:36.870
 have left we put there and we 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.870
 let's rest for 5 minutes 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.870
 now 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:50.800
 now we will put this now 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:56.080
 gather the apples in order so 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:58.240

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.300
 leaning may not be all and not 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.810
 only committed to medical sintra 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.430

 once you've done 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.700
 the coating but it is necessary to wait for a 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.610
 half an hour before you can copy them 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.080
