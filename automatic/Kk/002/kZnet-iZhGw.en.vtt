00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.920
 Well, I was received as a queen 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.920
 the advisors who lent them the material 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.079
 or coordinated then well I delighted 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.910
 to visit happy good morning very 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.149
 good morning thousands as you are welcome 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.520
 we have to receive them now and 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.920
 great states is that they are here and so 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.470
 today we want to talk about what would be very 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.739
 classic in the wardrobe of any 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.879
 perfect person who is the raincoat 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.670
 three ladies and girls and gentlemen another like that 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.649
 which is a garment that is also not 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.210
 obviously for women but what I'm going 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.730
 to talk now is that they are specific 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.320
 for girls perfect and also good that 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.320
 they already started in addition cold this after 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.850
 you have to start using them only 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.859
 of buying the new ones we can 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.050
 dust off some and happy I want is 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.850
 a classic garment in the wardrobe 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.409
 then it was not fashionable I have them these 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.530
 good news yet 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.420
 waterproof will not go out of style in 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.210
 many years then 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.060
 Now, yes, if you're going to buy one for 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.740
 that brings you two important breakthroughs 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.580
 for this autumn-winter season 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 excel 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:30.869
 this for example that this is red 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:34.090
 exactly to color lines and letters 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.950
 where we could use it with 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.399
 different touches for example we could 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.299
 lift what would be the neck these 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.210
 they have a belt where it is not necessary 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:52.690
 tie as a belt we can 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:55.569
 make a knot really a knot that 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.210
 is designed for the two functions and 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.960
 play in the same way then you can 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.060
 have your buckle up so that not all 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.280
 the belts that have to take advantage 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.080
 as belt agree 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 another detail that we could add 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.880
 had the sleeves we could give him a 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.250
 cool touch to our trench coats and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.519
 let's use with goods for example and 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.690
 we bend our fists a little bit towards 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.340
 above 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.370
 I am this is going to give a look that 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.070
 you can take to the newspaper or remove 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.630
 the elements that I did for example and 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.670
 leave it more formal towards the night 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.410
 perfect then very good option and apart 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.080
 of color for ours that with 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.250
 other massages primitively with the 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.650
 neutral can make a great 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.930
 combination without any risk but 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.800
 we can also talk about contrasts of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.350
 purple blacks or creating effects of 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.520
 color for this I have another option 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.520
 with graphics 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.640
 Thank you 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.930
 I get along very well in this option 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.060
 this is a trend is a breakthrough 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.390
 autumn-winter where we're going to see a lot 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.390
 influence of the 60s lowers these 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.480
 graphics of its pretty prints 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.270
 retro and fun they agree their 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.160
 paper is a nice option for 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.380
 let's buy in this season of 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.900
 autumn-winter the same thing we have 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.050
 that the belt then this we can 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.080
 wear from with a simple black dress 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.150
 and take it to a penalty or really 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.140
 some event at night or also 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.690
 because not with his days 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.590
 the colors where we are going to do 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.840
 total is a very very cheerful piece very 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.880
 fun 60s inspiration then 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.709
 really with the 60 they had fun 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.180
 a lot of contributors lady you 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.000

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.890
 funny and you can invite them 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.810
 to go back to buy these graphics 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.069
