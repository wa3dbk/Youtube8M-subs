with<00:01:42.049> three<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.009> be<00:01:43.130> simple<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.700> not

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
with three so it be simple and not

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.920 
with three so it be simple and not
really<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:44.990> hard<00:01:45.770> design<00:01:46.070> on<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.280> back<00:01:46.310> here

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
really a hard design on the back here

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.560 
really a hard design on the back here
you<00:01:47.930> could<00:01:48.079> probably<00:01:48.229> make<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.470> more<00:01:48.770> compact

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
you could probably make it more compact

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.859 
you could probably make it more compact
but<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.600> just<00:01:51.470> do<00:01:51.619> this<00:01:51.799> because<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.549> be<00:01:53.270> hidden

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
but I just do this because it be hidden

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.100 
but I just do this because it be hidden
with<00:01:54.049> inside<00:01:54.680> like<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:56.299> mountain<00:01:56.600> if<00:01:56.960> you're

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
with inside like the mountain if you're

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.230 
with inside like the mountain if you're
whatever<00:01:57.409> you're<00:01:57.710> building<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.520> this

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
whatever you're building in and this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.210 
whatever you're building in and this
could<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.540> be<00:01:59.630> like<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.960> out<00:02:00.110> wall<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:01.070> it

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
could just be like the out wall to it

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.490 
could just be like the out wall to it
and<00:02:01.369> just<00:02:01.430> have<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:01.880> random<00:02:02.750> thing<00:02:03.290> that

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
and just have this random thing that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.580 
and just have this random thing that
goes<00:02:03.590> there<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:05.299> all<00:02:05.479> this<00:02:05.659> does<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:06.259> when

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
goes there it so all this does is when

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.580 
goes there it so all this does is when
this<00:02:06.770> switch<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.850> flicked<00:02:08.119> it'll<00:02:08.929> power<00:02:09.289> it

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
this switch is flicked it'll power it

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.220 
this switch is flicked it'll power it
all<00:02:09.709> off<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.369> I'll<00:02:10.909> pull<00:02:11.209> down<00:02:11.480> that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
all off and I'll pull down that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.790 
all off and I'll pull down that
and<00:02:13.599> then<00:02:14.599> when<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.050> this<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.440> flicked<00:02:15.680> on

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
and then when it this is flicked on

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.850 
and then when it this is flicked on
it'll<00:02:16.220> power<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:17.569> because<00:02:18.290> i<00:02:18.319> have<00:02:18.650> this

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
it'll power this because i have this

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.570 
it'll power this because i have this
torch<00:02:19.159> place<00:02:19.459> there<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.299> that<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.750> will

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
torch place there so that it will

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.780 
torch place there so that it will
reverse<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.640> current<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.280> other

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
reverse the current of that of the other

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.430 
reverse the current of that of the other
redstone<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.690> will<00:02:26.810> open<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.230> door<00:02:27.260> for

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
redstone and it will open the door for

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.009 
redstone and it will open the door for
us<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:30.470> will<00:02:30.769> work<00:02:31.310> together<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.870> same

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
us so it will work together in the same

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.660 
us so it will work together in the same
combination<00:02:33.730> now<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.790> do<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:37.340> not<00:02:37.519> very

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
combination now to do this it's not very

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.780 
combination now to do this it's not very
long<00:02:38.739> let<00:02:39.739> me<00:02:39.799> just<00:02:39.950> close<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.340> up<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.700> we

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
long let me just close this up so we

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.149 
long let me just close this up so we
don't<00:02:40.849> fall<00:02:41.390> back<00:02:41.599> in<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:42.110> you're<00:02:42.950> just

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
don't fall back in here you're just

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.030 
don't fall back in here you're just
going<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.370> need<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.519> door<00:02:43.849> a<00:02:44.120> wall<00:02:45.040> that's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
going to need a door a wall that's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.250 
going to need a door a wall that's
really<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.989> all<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.680> Redstone<00:02:49.129> requirements

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
really and all the Redstone requirements

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.830 
really and all the Redstone requirements
this<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.379> typically<00:02:51.769> better<00:02:52.040> if<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.910> can<00:02:53.239> put

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
this is typically better if you can put

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.599 
this is typically better if you can put
it<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.049> stone<00:02:54.440> so<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.859> kind<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.069> blends<00:02:55.400> in

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
it on a stone so it kind of blends in

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.630 
it on a stone so it kind of blends in
more<00:02:55.819> as<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:56.870> see<00:02:57.200> here<00:02:57.829> kind<00:02:58.549> of<00:02:58.579> just

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
more as you can see here kind of just

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.180 
more as you can see here kind of just
blends<00:02:58.940> in<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.359> it<00:02:59.530> but<00:03:00.530> if<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.709> can't<00:03:00.980> that's

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
blends in on it but if you can't that's

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.460 
blends in on it but if you can't that's
fine<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.970> then<00:03:02.599> just<00:03:02.810> what<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.989> like<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.260> do<00:03:03.349> is

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
fine and then just what I like to do is

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.860 
fine and then just what I like to do is
I<00:03:03.560> just<00:03:03.620> couldn't<00:03:04.040> cut<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> notch<00:03:05.239> in<00:03:05.269> there<00:03:05.660> so

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
I just couldn't cut a notch in there so

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.960 
I just couldn't cut a notch in there so
I<00:03:05.900> know<00:03:05.989> where<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.230> put<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.650> then<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.489> get<00:03:07.819> my

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
I know where to put it and then I get my

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.000 
I know where to put it and then I get my
room<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.329> little<00:03:08.510> bit<00:03:08.629> far<00:03:08.989> away<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.290> can<00:03:09.560> do<00:03:09.890> it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
room a little bit far away you can do it

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.770 
room a little bit far away you can do it
however<00:03:10.250> far<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.730> want<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.569> just<00:03:11.690> have

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
however far you want you you just have

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.550 
however far you want you you just have
to<00:03:11.900> know<00:03:11.959> how<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.230> hook<00:03:12.620> up<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:13.310> redstone<00:03:14.560> you

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
to know how to hook up the redstone you

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.190 
to know how to hook up the redstone you
have<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.829> be<00:03:15.890> able<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.129> extend<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.609> pattern

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
have to be able to extend the pattern

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.229 
have to be able to extend the pattern
then<00:03:18.200> you're<00:03:18.319> going<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.500> dig<00:03:18.910> right<00:03:19.910> where<00:03:20.150> you

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
then you're going to dig right where you

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.250 
then you're going to dig right where you
want<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.450> door<00:03:20.690> you're<00:03:20.870> going<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.049> dig<00:03:21.169> it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
want the door you're going to dig it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.059 
want the door you're going to dig it
down<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.650> put<00:03:22.489> two<00:03:22.669> sticky<00:03:22.970> pistons<00:03:23.299> there

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
down to put two sticky pistons there

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.370 
down to put two sticky pistons there
grab<00:03:25.069> some<00:03:25.459> wood<00:03:25.700> or<00:03:26.079> whatever<00:03:27.079> which<00:03:27.230> are

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
grab some wood or whatever which are

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.640 
grab some wood or whatever which are
using<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.609> then<00:03:28.760> fill<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.599> in<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.900> then

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
using and then fill it in and then

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.440 
using and then fill it in and then
you're<00:03:30.709> going<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.010> we're<00:03:31.639> going<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.790> start<00:03:32.180> on

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
you're going to we're going to start on

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:42.490 
you're going to we're going to start on
the<00:03:33.230> redstone<00:03:35.680> yeah<00:03:37.359> we<00:03:38.359> can<00:03:38.510> do<00:03:38.599> it<00:03:38.720> here<00:03:41.500> ok

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
the redstone yeah we can do it here ok

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.330 
the redstone yeah we can do it here ok
so<00:03:43.310> then<00:03:43.459> for<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:44.450> sold<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.340> Redstone

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
so then for this sold that the Redstone

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.710 
so then for this sold that the Redstone
doesn't<00:03:46.609> all<00:03:46.669> get<00:03:46.849> hooked<00:03:47.090> up<00:03:47.209> like<00:03:47.329> that<00:03:47.480> and

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
doesn't all get hooked up like that and

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.890 
doesn't all get hooked up like that and
we<00:03:47.989> need<00:03:48.169> it<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.349> lead<00:03:48.709> into<00:03:48.919> that<00:03:49.250> as<00:03:49.900> like

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
we need it to lead into that as like

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.500 
we need it to lead into that as like
that<00:03:51.380> you're<00:03:52.250> going<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.430> have<00:03:52.669> to<00:03:52.940> do<00:03:53.269> a<00:03:53.299> bit<00:03:53.480> of

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
that you're going to have to do a bit of

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.170 
that you're going to have to do a bit of
digging<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.989> bit<00:03:54.319> more<00:03:54.639> you're<00:03:55.639> going<00:03:55.849> to<00:03:55.910> dig

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
digging a bit more you're going to dig

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.559 
digging a bit more you're going to dig
two<00:03:56.989> out<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.980> just<00:03:58.549> so<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.790> can<00:03:58.910> go<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.329> this

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
two out and just so you can go like this

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.720 
two out and just so you can go like this
put<00:04:00.260> one<00:04:00.410> there<00:04:00.440> then<00:04:01.160> continue<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:01.910> down<00:04:02.379> and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
put one there then continue it down and

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:12.119 
put one there then continue it down and
around<00:04:04.730> like<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:06.129> so<00:04:07.129> if<00:04:07.220> we<00:04:07.250> power<00:04:07.609> it<00:04:11.049> and

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
around like that so if we power it and

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.349 
around like that so if we power it and
work

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.110 

and<00:04:16.959> then<00:04:17.799> what<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.219> have<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.699> basic<00:04:18.969> red

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
and then what you have the basic red

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.719 
and then what you have the basic red
zone<00:04:19.329> tryto<00:04:20.319> first<00:04:20.709> make<00:04:20.949> sure<00:04:20.979> it<00:04:21.189> works<00:04:21.430> and

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
zone tryto first make sure it works and

repeaters down so that there's a delay I

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.050 
repeaters down so that there's a delay I
need<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.240> go<00:04:43.330> in<00:04:43.419> this<00:04:43.539> way<00:04:44.639> we'll<00:04:45.639> just<00:04:45.669> do
