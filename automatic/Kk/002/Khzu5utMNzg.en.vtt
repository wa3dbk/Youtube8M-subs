00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.280

 I was a little less 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.439
 chicken fillet so the next customer is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.189
 you are probably already familiar and seasoning 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.650
 turmeric 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.780
 or turmeric naturally do not know so here 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.640
 here sold in all stores but in 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.270
 many at least legs in general can 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.329
 find her 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.299
 then garlic I took 4 heads can 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.539
 like and more salt up here at 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.999
 us salt cheese is necessary such a piece but i 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.719
 just took something to tell you and the most 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:43.759
 the main ingredient is bamboo leaves 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.200
 also besides bamboo leaves us 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.520
 need ground black pepper 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 standard, too, take it and put it to 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.210
 our ingredients 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.740
 Here are all the main ingredients that 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.140
 today we are fingers start cooking 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.299
 start take our chicken fillet namely 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.119
 gram one piece cut it in half 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.510
 then take the second slice and cut 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.319
 he also did not get that is now with us 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.569
 4 pieces we get here such here. 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.100
 and now we will beat this one 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.100
 side of our chicken 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.180
 why do we beat meat can ask 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.239
 to make it more gentle and 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.040
 soft 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:44.160
 Naturally need to beat as with this 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:49.380
 parties so with this let's start 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.900
 at three o'clock and so here we started garlic 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.380
 set aside for now 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.380
 one piece of chicken and so take a pinch 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.099
 salt about here and sprinkle 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.790
 our chicken take very very little 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.950
 turmeric 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.720
 reminds we choose only for the color they are 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.180
 for taste a little bit to taste and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.329
 sprinkle on top here about as much 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.340
 further we take pepper and sypem it too 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.380
 quite a bit because it is very acute 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.870
 will be if you overdo it we smear 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.380
 what we have for qq 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.739
 salt and pepper then take the garlic and also 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.040
 we sprinkle it on top like the old whole 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.790
 spread all over the chicken to everywhere 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.370
 there was garlic 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.920
 they only in one place further take our 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.989
 the walnut broke it a little but 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.060
 no less when we pour yet 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.209
 a little bit like that with your fingers 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.650
 and sypte top can be even two hands 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:49.410
 shake hands a little 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.600
 then we take the cheese we cut it down take the cheese 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.769
 as much as you like i like y 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.260
 stop I live on top take a chicken and 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.150
 we roll it around neatly 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.940
 like this to happen and so turned 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.810
 we have such a roll left us all 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.810
 three pieces 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.739
 do the same thing that we have here 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.739
 these three pieces 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.410
 and so here we made 4 rolls take 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.400
 not yet touched today where exactly 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.150
 bamboo leaf 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.250
 we take scissors and we cut off the end we put 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.560
 like this sheet take one of the pieces 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.460
 for example raccoon and neat and 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.570
 wrapped in a bamboo sheet so he 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.870
 was not too fat 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.910
 in this thing you can cut it live in 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.400
 we put the side and you take it here 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.980
 one more sheet and since they are very good 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.510
 rush off tearing off like this 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.730
 small pod 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.890
 further invested under what we have done 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.350
 in advance and set up like this 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.580
 neatly on the bundle so that we have 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.680
 cooking time he didn't fall apart 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.480
 here we need 4 things 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.480
 already made one left 3 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.170
 Well, dear factory we have turned 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.160
 four of these rolls for me is not very 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.020
 they usually look 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.910
 agree with something they resemble not 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.190
 cabbage rolls that are cooked in Russia 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.380
 already quite a long time but it we have not 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.440
 cabbage rolls 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:35.330
 Grannies will continue to cook them burn 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:39.470
 gas take sunflower oil pour 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.780
 it is natural to distribute the griddle 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.280
 all over the pan of our butter what 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.540
 im back and and our baboon color and 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:53.810
 unfold neatly 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:56.120
 turn in any way vyatich us alright 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.620
 then take another one not affected 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.210
 today where 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:08.650
 namely soy sauce and neatly 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.650
 a little bit we pour it on our fighters 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:17.750
 here and close all this cap and 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:20.289
 we put on the small she is about such and 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.869
 wait 20 minutes 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.879
 the cooking process can be this liquid 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:30.639
 which we have stood out to fuck so and 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:33.700
 water our rolls so they still 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.280
 better soaked 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.940
 the plot and guild that's gone 20 minutes and 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.880

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.800
 took the side 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:10.469
 we also give meat a little unusual 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.819
