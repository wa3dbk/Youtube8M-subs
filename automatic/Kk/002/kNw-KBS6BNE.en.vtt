in this video i think with a delay see
on<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.830> squad<00:02:35.190> i'm<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.459> total<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:36.000> eight<00:02:36.180> and

one<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.020> i<00:02:37.140> gotta<00:02:37.320> say<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.590> feels<00:02:37.709> really<00:02:37.950> good

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
one and i gotta say it feels really good

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.510 
one and i gotta say it feels really good
but<00:02:38.610> plays<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:40.050> what<00:02:40.800> really<00:02:41.280> makes

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
but plays like this is what really makes

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.490 
but plays like this is what really makes
me<00:02:41.790> salivate<00:02:42.060> when<00:02:42.360> i<00:02:42.480> think<00:02:42.600> about<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.170> card

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
i'm not a fan of the higher speed

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.930 
i'm not a fan of the higher speed
receivers<00:02:46.410> as<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:46.830> main<00:02:47.130> receiver<00:02:47.610> because<00:02:47.850> i

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
receivers as my main receiver because i

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.340 
receivers as my main receiver because i
like<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.209> receiver<00:02:48.690> that's<00:02:48.810> gonna<00:02:48.990> give<00:02:49.260> me

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
like a receiver that's gonna give me

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.350 
like a receiver that's gonna give me
something<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:49.860> sustainable<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.090> feel

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
something that's sustainable and I feel

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.250 
something that's sustainable and I feel
like<00:02:51.390> long<00:02:52.070> break<00:02:53.070> away<00:02:53.360> speed<00:02:54.360> plays<00:02:54.810> are<00:02:55.200> not

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
like long break away speed plays are not

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.010 
like long break away speed plays are not
something<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.550> can<00:02:56.760> sustain<00:02:57.300> game<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.870> and

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
something that I can sustain game in and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.820 
something that I can sustain game in and
game<00:02:58.050> at<00:02:58.410> however<00:02:59.190> tough<00:02:59.580> yards<00:02:59.910> is

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
game at however tough yards is

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
game at however tough yards is
definitely<00:03:01.830> something<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.670> always

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850
