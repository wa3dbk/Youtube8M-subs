00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
training space you'll see it as a

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.170 
training space you'll see it as a
helicopter<00:05:23.510> instead<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.169> that<00:05:24.580> f-35<00:05:25.580> there

helipad<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:43.300> yeah<00:05:44.300> so<00:05:44.510> this<00:05:44.630> is<00:05:44.690> a<00:05:44.870> conflict

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
helipad and yeah so this is a conflict

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.240 
helipad and yeah so this is a conflict
canyon<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:47.080> if<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.229> know<00:05:48.410> me<00:05:48.620> you<00:05:48.830> get<00:05:49.070> back
