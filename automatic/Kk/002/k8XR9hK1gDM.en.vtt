00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.380 

before<00:02:35.340> being<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.580> podium<00:02:36.700> which<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.300> a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
before being on the podium which is a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.150 
before being on the podium which is a
combination<00:02:37.870> there's<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.560> many<00:02:38.740> years<00:02:39.010> of

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
combination there's so many years of

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.070 
combination there's so many years of
hard<00:02:39.280> work<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.120> many<00:02:40.330> people<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.810> helped

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
hard work and so many people and helped

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.590 
hard work and so many people and helped
us<00:02:41.200> get<00:02:41.410> there<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:42.370> think<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.210> took<00:02:43.330> several

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
us get there I think it took several

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.750 
us get there I think it took several
months<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:44.830> didn't<00:02:45.070> have<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.370> deal<00:02:45.490> with<00:02:45.520> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
months we didn't have to deal with the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.910 
months we didn't have to deal with the
games<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.360> really<00:02:46.510> have<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.900> sink<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.290> what<00:02:47.770> we

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
games to really have it sink in what we

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.100 
games to really have it sink in what we
had<00:02:48.040> accomplished<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:51.450> yeah<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
had accomplished and just have yeah you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.450 
had accomplished and just have yeah you
know<00:02:53.200> leading<00:02:53.440> into<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.830> Olympics

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
know leading into the Olympics

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.190 
know leading into the Olympics
you<00:02:54.790> don't<00:02:54.940> really<00:02:55.060> allow<00:02:55.240> yourself<00:02:55.780> think

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
you don't really allow yourself think

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.590 
you don't really allow yourself think
too<00:02:56.350> much<00:02:56.500> what<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.920> would<00:02:57.040> be<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:58.210> win

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
too much what it would be like to win

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.240 
too much what it would be like to win
that<00:02:58.750> medal<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:59.380> know<00:02:59.500> you're<00:02:59.740> driven<00:02:59.980> only

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
that medal you know you're driven only

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.130 
that medal you know you're driven only
by<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.580> thought<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.660> gotta

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
by the thought that you know you gotta

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.500 
by the thought that you know you gotta
practice<00:03:02.410> harder<00:03:02.920> every<00:03:03.070> day<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.880> even<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.420> an

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
practice harder every day to even get an

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.560 
practice harder every day to even get an
opportunity<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:05.550> put<00:03:06.550> yourself<00:03:06.820> up<00:03:06.970> there<00:03:07.150> and

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
opportunity to put yourself up there and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.710 
opportunity to put yourself up there and
so<00:03:08.410> when<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.520> finally<00:03:09.730> got<00:03:10.030> there<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.360> think<00:03:10.480> it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
so when we finally got there I think it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.150 
so when we finally got there I think it
was<00:03:10.780> almost<00:03:10.959> like<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.200> shock<00:03:11.500> like<00:03:11.740> something

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
was almost like a shock like something

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.590 
was almost like a shock like something
that<00:03:12.190> we<00:03:12.370> hadn't<00:03:12.670> considered<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.300> that

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
that we hadn't considered that that

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.860 
that we hadn't considered that that
closely<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:16.000> know<00:03:16.090> because<00:03:16.420> we<00:03:16.600> were<00:03:16.690> so

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
closely you know because we were so

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.680 
closely you know because we were so
focused<00:03:17.020> on<00:03:17.320> our<00:03:17.440> training<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:19.390> know<00:03:19.510> it
