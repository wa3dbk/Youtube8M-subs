of<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> little<00:00:36.270> bunch<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
of these here is a little bunch of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.319 
of these here is a little bunch of
grapes<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.730> while<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:38.910> happy<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> see

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
grapes and while you're happy to see

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.229 
grapes and while you're happy to see
those<00:00:39.800> you<00:00:40.800> can't<00:00:41.129> keep<00:00:41.399> every<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.000> them

those you can't keep every one of them

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.959 
those you can't keep every one of them
because<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.739> vine<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.280> can't<00:00:44.520> support<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
because the vine just can't support that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.029 
because the vine just can't support that
much<00:00:45.329> growth<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.680> through

day so to me I come out here and I look
at<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> vine<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> look<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
at a vine like this and I look at a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
at a vine like this and I look at a
little<00:01:15.810> bunch<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.110> grapes<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.040> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
little bunch of grapes like this and I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.270 
little bunch of grapes like this and I
hate<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.850> idea<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.750> throwing<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.259> away<00:01:19.380> but

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
hate the idea of throwing it away but

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.999 
hate the idea of throwing it away but
you<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:22.020> what

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
fruit instead of just a small amount of

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
fruit instead of just a small amount of
really<00:01:32.310> good<00:01:32.490> stuff<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.140> we're

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
really good stuff which is what we're

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:43.010 
really good stuff which is what we're
after<00:01:39.979> see<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.450> all<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.689> mess

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
after see so you can see all this mess

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.899 
after see so you can see all this mess
that's<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> ground<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.880> just

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
that's on the ground that's what I just

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
that's on the ground that's what I just
took<00:01:45.240> off<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.899> half<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.530> grape

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
took off this one half of this grape

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.080 
took off this one half of this grape
vine<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.850> also<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:49.939> things<00:01:50.939> are

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
vine and you can also see now things are

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
vine and you can also see now things are
pretty<00:01:51.240> evenly<00:01:51.570> spaced<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.560> could<00:01:52.950> maybe

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
pretty evenly spaced out I could maybe

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.730 
pretty evenly spaced out I could maybe
even<00:01:53.460> take<00:01:53.640> off<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.299> more<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:55.409> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
even take off a little bit more but you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.560 
even take off a little bit more but you
look<00:01:55.950> first<00:01:56.189> these<00:01:56.549> are<00:01:56.670> called<00:01:56.909> Spurs<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
look first these are called Spurs and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.030 
look first these are called Spurs and
you<00:01:57.630> look<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> spur<00:01:58.229> position<00:01:58.649> about<00:01:58.829> every

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you look for a spur position about every

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.219 
you look for a spur position about every
six<00:01:59.280> inches<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.759> nice<00:02:00.540> separation<00:02:01.140> in

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
six inches and nice separation in

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.709 
six inches and nice separation in
between<00:02:01.530> them<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:03.030> these<00:02:03.240> bunches

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
between them and now all these bunches

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.149 
between them and now all these bunches
of<00:02:03.810> grapes<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> left<00:02:04.439> will<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.950> plenty

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
of grapes to the left will have plenty

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.609 
of grapes to the left will have plenty
of<00:02:05.280> room<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:06.090> grow<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.659> plenty<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.259> plenty<00:02:07.320> of
