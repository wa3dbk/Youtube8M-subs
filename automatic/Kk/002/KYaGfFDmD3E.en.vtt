00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hey people today i show you like you 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.319
 free of charge from your mac partition 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.389
 that is from your watch six that means 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.460
 access your windows disk 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.900
 that is especially here I would 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.369
 let's say for the hackintosh users 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.510
 right makes sense because yes you have here 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.920
 your windows partition but we can 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.650
 do not write and read 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.699
 I have only the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.000
 paid version and indeed 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 if tsf for mac os ickx and indeed of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.679
 Paragon would cost the whole I have 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 that tested now 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.540
 the free version found and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.840
 All you need is these two files 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.309
 one-time views and ntfs 3g as well as both 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.770
 files the cameras open only once 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.200
 mountain that does not take long took 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.199
 these two files and lead first 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.860
 We stay where it excuse from exactly 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.820
 Continue reading the last time so 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.260
 made kaida and then here all three 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.780
 select points then goes too 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.570
 going on can install 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 also installation folder of course 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.680
 choose or where to install it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.500
 want to have then we go on 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.479
 to install 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 then we install this ennstal 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.710
 ntfs-3g ntfs course, too 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.229
 continue proceeding genius proceed 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.840
 continue accepting and then go 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.610
 we adapt to that is important to us 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.009
 make this hook all the way out too 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.540
 important should not be forgotten then 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.540
 enter your password again 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.060
 we install the whole 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.829
 that should not take too long either 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.869
 so the whole thing is finished and then click 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.640
 you click on no caching very important 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.380
 this goes on to continue with the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.820
 password is all well done as 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.250
 would have to restart then but can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.570
 we skip 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.340
 that sounds good again if you do 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.890
 You 've been able to say that you can do it all 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.850
 manually enable cache yes so that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.429
 whole much faster and that goes 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.039
 go into your system settings everyone 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.830
 on ntfs 3g and he is this castle 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.650
 down here 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.180
 Just make a password 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.940
 and now yes if system caching 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.810
 enabled here just clicks on it 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.030
 then again euro closed and can do that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.820
 whole close because now guests stop 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.430
 in a nutshell, simply the simplified one 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.980
 data catalog of the hard disk thus can 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.690
 the operating system then knows faster 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.280
 you keep what sectors freisinn up 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.800
 the hard disk can do things faster 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.030
 copy the now little time 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.800
 Simplified to say then we look 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.180
 but in our hard disks 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.780
 utility whether it is so 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.860
 we could do that here 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.040
 below 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.480
 we no longer need since the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.930
 example up here a usb stick up 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.880
 tradition a partition and see here 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.290
 her then windows nt file system ntfs 3g 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.020
 and yes, that's really a good one 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.370
 free version 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.080
 we can stick to the usb or something 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.300
 always format and you can 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.820
 your hard drive as your partition here 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.760
 So read and write your windows 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:23.080
 partition that one can test the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:26.200
 bootmanager shift is over too 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.209
 So everything you see is really easy 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.880
 no problem 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.470
 works fine and yes that 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.570
 it was from me to the markets 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.190
 program not to say i hope it has 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.930
 you fell again and was 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.410
 helpful for you then look up 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.410
 next time
