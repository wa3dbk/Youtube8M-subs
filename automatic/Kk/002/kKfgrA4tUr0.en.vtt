00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.430
 while at its youtube channel magazine.it 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.380
 I'm luca figini we've just been to 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.790
 samsung press conference 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.680
 the most awaited we say this Sunday 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.530
 antecedent to the mobile world congress 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.090
 2015 Barcelona is once finished 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.539
 press run we came to the area 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.730
 where the new galaxy s6 s6 e are exhibited 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.409
 g which then to say then another video 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.849
 and the accessories that are dedicated to 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.519
 new top-of-the-range smartphone series 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.130
 of samsung top of the range that marks a 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.500
 path interrupted with respect to the past 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.600
 substantial or samsung with s6 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.940
 totally abandons qualcomm i 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.980
 qualcomm professors to put 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.660
 finally the processors is xenos that already 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.300
 we have seen on other models of the range 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.640
 lower in Italy because elsewhere j ax 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.710
 lost animated the band process 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.400
 high of samsung in this case the same 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.710
 to an action 64 20 oct accorsi jumps 4 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.960
 acta core bit including four cores 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.910
 2 1 gigahertz and four cores work 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.579
 they work at 15 gb 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.280
 the scheme is the standard ticket or 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.750
 the four that now 2 1 gigahertz enter 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.730
 in action when it is necessary to have 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.950
 processing power as in the case of the 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.640
 play a multimedia playback 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.860
 present in 4k the 1.5 g cores towards an i 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.630
 little or integration when it is 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.820
 need to think about the battery 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.060
 battery which in this case is integrated 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.890
 and this is the other substantial novelty 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.150
 of the change of pace of samsun 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.979
 compared to the past 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.040
 the battery is no longer removable is 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.140
 integrated and samsung so its choice 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.420
 first of all because according to the company 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.250
 Korean time has come for those 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.920
 bacteria can be integrated not 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.780
 they are more listened to because they have one 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.790
 efficiency and reliability in any case 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.060
 such that it no longer needs to be 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.140
 removed when the other one breaks 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.610
 necessity to which samsung wants to meet 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.430
 use the wireless charger 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 that this black base to which it rests 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.940
 the phone 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.800
 initial charge in this case is 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.570
 purely beauty does not charge it 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.910
 but this is what will happen 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.880
 in the reality of the facts when 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:08.000
 you will buy the samsung s6 bakkies and sen 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.180
 the need to make a phone 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.680
 unibody with non-removable battery has 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.239
 necessarily obliged to a 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.390
 change of direction also on the design 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.650
 this s5 this rs6 flat let's call it 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.040
 so unlike the law you have e 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.540
 rounded edges because changes 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.300
 the back surface is no longer in 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.950
 plastic but is in gorilla glass quattro 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.370
 exactly like the one it covers of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.709
 21-inch still spend ourselves in this 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.870
 case the plastic shell was in 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.590
 some way rounded rounded way 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.540
 such as to compensate for the bulk of the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.519
 optical sensor in this case the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.819
 surface affected the optics is 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.610
 slightly and have also moved the 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.769
 group of sensors such as flash and sensor 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.380
 to measure the pulse they have it 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.120
 moved from the bottom to the position 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.720
 sideways the frank and remaining brooch 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.299
 equal in most is no longer integrated into 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.880
 this way but it is written stylized into 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.440
 that way we put back in this case 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.930
 body unibody what changes changes that 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.000
 while in the five there was a body in 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.980
 plastic painted in imitation metal in 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.989
 this case is real aluminum e 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.040
 also some finishes I remember a 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.510
 phone that we have already seen in 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.069
 past or back 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.260
 runs the whole wing the whole body in 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.609
 aluminum on stage ii of what i do 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.620
 has already seen for example on the series 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:32.480
 galaxy alfa but improved usb port 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.319
 speaker rear speaker and external e 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.519
 jeda 35 mm 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.400
 and again the room for the penalty for the sim 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.290
 and the dialog keys in this case the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.700
 barbell was divided into two in two 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 separate keys 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.819
 I stop and still lingers on the part 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.930
 back because I sowed the 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.519
 16 megapixel camera with af 1.9 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.829
 exactly like the front camera 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.230
 f 1.9 to ensure the best performance 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.959
 even in conditions of and minor 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.340
 brightness foods instead 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.410
 remain unchanged compared to the series 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.900
 previous in the galaxy series are the 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.699
 physical rom key here we are hello the 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.009
 key a physicist with biometric sensor 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:18.259
 integrated to store fingerprints 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.570
 biometric as you could see the 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.830
 back button and the one to activate the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.300
 multitasking and android 3.0 android 5.0 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.000
 which is not new because the ball 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.300
 visure s5 in this variation is a lot 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.310
 simpler and much more linear have 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.430
 graphical events clearly erased and 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.720
 20 16 to prefer a part more 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.270
 most essential linear of the interface 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.310
 and on balance it is much more elegant and 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.680
 much nicer to see and much more 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.660
 modern also to see I would say that why 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.810
 stay before you if you are everything 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.910
 refer to the next south direct video 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.009
 from the mo baloo kong hsi from luca figini to 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.150

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.150
