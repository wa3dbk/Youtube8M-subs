00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.069
 ready when you're there okay 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.070
 Rick Karsdorp winning Ajax is there 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.599
 always nice no, just for three times 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.099
 once in the cup 2 times in the 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.019
 competition ranges 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.320
 these are not really very good and 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.060
 everyone is driven and ajax-home 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.580
 then you see that your top line came in 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.460
 so nice victory in such a match 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.990
 more driven than usual well me 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.250
 personally no i am going to the competition itself 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.900
 others might do if he had the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.820
 boys did stay with this week 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.230
 training everyone is a bit further so and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.680
 You also saw packs of obstruction in the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.940
 competition so yes how did that law 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.590
 setting your eyes in the first half 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.579
 it went a bit difficult I had the idea and 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.770
 in the second half 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.860
 yes what better I think for both sides 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.170
 difficult opportunities 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.960
 So that was matched second 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.250
 derivative citizen and see that 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.430
 he also from the store 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.899
 earn 20, then that will decide 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.050
 that fight today 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.460
 yes I think it is straight yes she must 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.230
 having it liked football 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.360
 so will not know very well that too 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.649
 in advance so you know you are fighting 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.020
 and we have done better 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:12.139
 ajax and then you saw the second half too 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.520
 those things that belong to such classic 

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.259
 occasional ups and downs occasionally 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.469
 together what find that belongs there too 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.299
 at 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.039
 yes we said it to each other in the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.869
 changing room occasionally you just have to 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.310
 kick a part over a bump 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.039
 the cause and then the second happens 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.170
 and they only look beautiful 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.999
 this way one end of a whole comes to you 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.090
 beautiful week you signed your this week 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:35.060
 first professional contract how was that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.069
 yes a bit unexpected I was called 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.459
 and for a year and a half with option for 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.319
 another year 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:44.869
 it is naturally beautiful and I have one 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.249
 Greek means what do you say that 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.639
 happens that you are on the right track 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.289
 apparently yes apparently ar i feel fit 

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:54.709
 I always played with Dutch 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.270
 I also play EK qualifying so that is 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.549
 just beautiful and hereby goes fine 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.990
 also excellent now something for you 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.600
 change that you now have such a contract 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.520
 terminate 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.750
 no for me personally not no and me 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.720
 think for the other guys don't have it 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.850
 to see we the same so stay for just 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.790
 so the status has increased in the dinners 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.200
 I usually have a dressing room 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.520
 now chat room sounds so that 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.130
 just stayed the same 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.690
 I'm not going to do anything else or anything 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.310
 This is one of the last competition in 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.840
 the first half of the season and you sail 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.670
 does not go very well how you look back on 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.790
 your first half of the season 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.760
 we do not give much away 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.709
 few clothes goals offensive 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.870
 create how that always many some 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.730
 matches are very changeable 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.530
 mind is friends the top another 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.640
 time and again we play less and then is 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.890
 it totally nice right for night 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.140
 go ice for the winter break and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.060
 that you earn a win with a good 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.690
 feeling the winter break 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.690
 hell yes
