00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 on the grand prix formula 1 and which 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.790
 here is well tried to limit to 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.100
 maximum damage as part of this 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.200
 prologue of paris dakar 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.080
 do extra work for 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 the whole team of chaunac hugues who 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.740
 prove his lada and patrick we see 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.570
 very well 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.550
 that the car carries some light 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.200
 traces of actual contact if he 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.460
 we will know the past just now 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.779
 certainly on arrival if he wants 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.369
 give a few words to christmas that is going 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.290
 expect him anyway patrick who in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 more obviously has trouble flying 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.009
 since the door and it seems to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 the inside on the knees of his 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.890
 copilot 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.480
 so it's not easy at all 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.670
 philippe lemoine you see him saying 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.080
 door he has or would like dash 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 more exactly no it's not the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.870
 door is the dashboard 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.190
 got stuck inside the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.690
 nick car of me who is who and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.970
 his old friend gave up his mechanic 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.729
 children of formula 3 donation the war to the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.170
 the first shock image of this paris 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.430
 tripoli dakar because as at 11 while 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.780
 we are still in clermont ferrand 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.449
 is still in 90 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.059
 the last meters of this prologue 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.530
 patrick tambay patrick who continue to 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.030
 attack you ives despite these conditions 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.200
 a little bit difficult that's going 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.380
 pass in front of us the time has arrived 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.549
 in a few seconds it's up to you christmas 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.690
 probably to collect the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.280
 impressions of patrick typed at 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.280
 the front right seems slightly 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.649
 intrigue fallen to the 8th time four 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.840
 backgrounds tell you basta good results 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.710
 in these circumstances the wicca type in 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.899
 the right front actually it's yes 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.640
 christian today apparently good 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.619
 it's that your sheet metal guys 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.720
 we're going to ask patrick to drop what 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.869
 happened on that side well there are more than 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.130
 two doors then first the little ones 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.369
 glitches for you that's happening 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.369
 exactly 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.039
 the plaque 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.850
 Ouch Ouch O Coma I Listened Christmas Made 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.220
 a new test christmas carles with patrick 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.720
 tambay christmas maybe you can 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.369
 collect the impressions of patrick and 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.540
 we communicate them because we do not hear 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.920
 in the car we hear you at 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.979
 outside but we do not hear patrick 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.509
 in the car although they have us 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.190
 will be stuffed in a moment 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.590
 do not doubt it and we are with 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.760
 now the lada of hubert auriol she 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.520
 in perfect condition 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.959
 she's whole creation is 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.310
 always the same vatanen before ericsson 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.100
 lartigue and val de garde 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.620
 hubert auriol who wants to be first 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.230
 driver to win the dakar at the wheel 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.090
 of a car after winning on a motorcycle 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.310
 he supported did twice on motorcycle 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.660
 it's the hacker of the last big rally 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.190
 which preceded the dakar namely the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.019
 rally of the pharaohs not organized by 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.440
 fennel 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.910
 yes christmas yes christmas it's up to you to talk to 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.930
 the outside of the car are you 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.930
 hear very bad just now 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.730
 yeah the carver 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.800
 good little technical problem that we 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.330
 are probably going to put in 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.160
 a few seconds the technicians are going 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.480
 fix this little hf problem and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.819
 we follow hubert's efforts 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.110
 auriol driving the second of lada 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.030
 Samara winner of the parents' rally 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.470
 in a few moments and here we are 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.150
 to use auriol now course 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.780
 without fail in any case in what 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.100
 concerned 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.810
 so we'll be able to compare with the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.790
 time 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.290
 so from patrick tambay who was 4 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.569
 minutes 10 then we have now 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.940
 on track there two senses of river jérôme 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.610
 light 4,02 sixth time 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.190
 for orioles 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.450
 so the lada for now recessed 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.130
 compared to the buildings it is relative 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.470
 to the vigils to see what will do 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.830
 jérôme river which also started the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.830
 last to brugnaut the board yes 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.350
 1 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.629
 what can happen at any moment 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.879
 in any competition and therefore in the 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.050
 dakar race queen marathon 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.470
 Jerome 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.600
 river that will try and well to do 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.070
 better than vatanen of course but better 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.290
 also that his auriol friends is down 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.240
 but Jerome who must nevertheless 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.400
 content for the moment to play this 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.170
 very fast assist role of course 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.630
 men of boxes that did not 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.460
 really the flange on the neck normally 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.150
 normally and there are they are all 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.910
 three tied 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.590
 normally it's true that the past is 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.030
 this is rather to prove that 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.060
 the true assistance of patrick tambay 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.570
 of hubert pride jérôme river 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.760
 excellent pilot 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.090
 he almost won the rally place this 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.740
 year he finished second 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.410
 Jerome who is a former motorcycle rider who 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.420
 always practice the enduro is a driver 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.650
 very fine who studies very very well the 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.670
 field and that it exploits the best you 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.670
 see it no
