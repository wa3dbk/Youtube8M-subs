00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 this is the heated market for games and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.390
 February already many new things 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.919
 weightlifting for you that you find there 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 we start slowly 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.330
 It's cool and as always we had 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.130
 another showing you study throwing 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 Everything for you is keeping your 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.699
 Do not spend your money conscious 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 I have had the humility to know what is 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.510
 Nice to see that it is not the first game and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.279
 it rains in the north is 500 net 2 is that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.439
 then just hit business here that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.340
 I've never really seen an anime face 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.360
 of the 90's has this fighter there all 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.510
 destroyer that has to turn this 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.270
 in this world that the middle world 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.030
 post-apocalyptic as well as sly cooper 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 take on the team you want and your 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.539
 friends are other animals they have to 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.760
 the world to recover a 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 relic and different from other games 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 of this franchise now they have some 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 special clothes that give some powers 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.719
 different but reinforcements in things that 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.070
 each outfit will give new mobility to 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.439
 make the game a little more fun 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.380
 but spends more cool is that we like 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.680
 these scenarios such cute now 10 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.869
 made three guys this one is monstrous and if it gives 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.460
 fear and if it will leave you goin 'go 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.170
 scare everything else 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.350
 this game that will have that fight for 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.070
 survival as in other games 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.350
 series 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.330
 then in this sixth version has the mode 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.580
 cooperative she will have other players 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 Are you going to be alone then a little bit? 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.250
 quieter, throw him talking to 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.100
 carlos guedes at thawra here with so much 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.799
 fear that the game aliens colonial marines 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.450
 which is a totally inspired game 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.869
 in that garlic movie so many characters 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.869
 tell the story to the allen themselves 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.759
 that movie is expected and stronger 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.310
 descent of these inspirations from the film 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.170
 alien 2 who included his mission 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 recover a ship that was well 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.380
 present in this film that she was 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.420
 disappeared and you have to get 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.299
 to recover this not all of them install themselves and 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.000
 such a guy I liked mass graphic nÃ© 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.890
 but the size of the animals are not afraid 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.720
 I also have some of these things. 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.680
 of fear of business and good to wish 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.850
 anda nation the game was released there the 15th 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.280
 of February 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.730
 then the next the protagonist of the game 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.530
 daniel garnero and broadcast to hard 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.530
 mission to save his wife and also 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.100
 rid the world of the claw of these monsters and 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.190
 Are you seeing a game there? 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.930
 perfectionist so very very real and 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.120
 see that the most expensive deal captured 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.330
 there the monsters but it will have several weapons 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.510
 different ugly animals and the game 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.700
 presents a copy of hype revedin and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.209
 sells this difficult to say 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.310
 It's difficult to talk about the game, the guy does not have it. 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.209
 a lot to talk about is simply playing 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.610
 Who brings some news? 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.770
 interesting and the coolest part of this 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.700
 and the part of cutting everything the way 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.020
 you want 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.410
 You see, he shows some points. 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.940
 weaknesses of your enemies and you can 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.980
 pass the sword only by controlling with the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.870
 logic goes far from one side to 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.510
 the other is going to control exactly the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.200
 sword but hated it including the 20th 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.780
 past crisis 3 and and feel like vaccine goes 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.690
 given this game revolutionizes this game 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.070
 always shows the new indy and causing 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.170
 I learned in 3 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.720
 so you saw the one to qualify 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.280
 showing the child only then you go 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.440
 see that customizable bow is to let him 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.040
 to implode things to change the bow enough 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.780
 and the game is set in new york all 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.709
 destroyed then you see these parts of 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.320
 grass came flooding in the post 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.180
 apocalyptic very cool and taking you 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.070
 have to have a perception in case you get the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.170
 computer who wants to be gross and elect him 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.790
 always the last one shows that another game 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.980
 very fun platform 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.450
 only now to the river because it speaks only 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.130
 to the river because it will 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.650
 because this game has several interactions 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.540
 with new controls wilton that 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.269

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.190
 control the game just because there helping 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.010
 change these obstacles to doing things 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.290
