00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
plant tissue analysis most farmers don't

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.600 
plant tissue analysis most farmers don't
do<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.540> personally<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.169> think<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.799> have<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.460> do

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
do it personally I think you have to do

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.340 
do it personally I think you have to do
it<00:00:08.790> if<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.030> want<00:00:09.330> higher<00:00:09.510> yields<00:00:10.020> it's<00:00:10.170> made<00:00:10.320> a

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
it if you want higher yields it's made a

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.320 
it if you want higher yields it's made a
huge<00:00:10.470> difference<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.460> our<00:00:11.550> farm<00:00:11.850> well<00:00:12.090> it

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
huge difference in our farm well it

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.970 
huge difference in our farm well it
really<00:00:12.570> has<00:00:12.750> improved<00:00:12.960> things<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.590> actually

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
really has improved things and actually

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
really has improved things and actually
a<00:00:14.040> couple<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.400> weeks<00:00:14.550> ago

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
a couple of weeks ago

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.820 
a couple of weeks ago
we<00:00:15.360> even<00:00:15.480> get<00:00:15.690> started<00:00:15.750> pulling<00:00:16.349> some<00:00:16.619> tissue

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
we even get started pulling some tissue

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.489 
we even get started pulling some tissue
analysis<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.669> our<00:00:17.880> pastures<00:00:18.599> to<00:00:19.109> try<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:19.499 
analysis in our pastures to try and do a

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.040 
analysis in our pastures to try and do a
better<00:00:19.589> job<00:00:20.060> with<00:00:21.060> nutrition<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.929> our

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
better job with nutrition for our

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.939 
better job with nutrition for our
animals<00:00:22.470> too<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.249> we're<00:00:23.999> at<00:00:24.179> our<00:00:24.359> animals

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
animals too so we're at our animals

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.589 
animals too so we're at our animals
we're<00:00:25.949> actually<00:00:26.099> renting<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.060> pasture

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
we're actually renting out the pasture

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.089 
we're actually renting out the pasture
but<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.230> something<00:00:28.499> that<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.710> want<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> learn

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
but it's something that we want to learn

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.829 
but it's something that we want to learn
more<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.759> we<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:29.999> share<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.419> you

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:30.839 
more about so we can share that with you

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.510 
more about so we can share that with you
hopefully<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.380> fall<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.859> into<00:00:32.009> next<00:00:32.220> year

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
hopefully this fall and into next year

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
hopefully this fall and into next year
we'll<00:00:32.640> talk<00:00:32.850> about<00:00:33.060> what<00:00:33.900> we're<00:00:34.050> learning<00:00:34.230> in

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
we'll talk about what we're learning in

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.140 
we'll talk about what we're learning in
pastures<00:00:35.160> how<00:00:35.640> we're<00:00:35.820> getting<00:00:35.910> better

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
pastures how we're getting better

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.930 
pastures how we're getting better
protein<00:00:36.720> content<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.320> grasses<00:00:37.730> both<00:00:38.730> with

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
protein content and grasses both with

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.610 
protein content and grasses both with
fertilization<00:00:39.660> techniques<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.590> also

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
fertilization techniques but also

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.890 
fertilization techniques but also
finding<00:00:41.400> out<00:00:41.490> when<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.000> need<00:00:42.150> those<00:00:42.360> nutrients

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
finding out when we need those nutrients

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.690 
finding out when we need those nutrients
with<00:00:43.380> our<00:00:43.500> plantation<00:00:43.980> ok<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.220> let's<00:00:44.490> give<00:00:44.670> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
with our plantation ok so let's give you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.550 
with our plantation ok so let's give you
a<00:00:44.820> couple<00:00:45.060> of<00:00:45.210> examples<00:00:45.570> first<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> all<00:00:46.350> in

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
a couple of examples first of all in

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.410 
a couple of examples first of all in
wheat<00:00:46.860> I'll<00:00:47.340> show<00:00:47.580> you<00:00:47.640> some<00:00:47.880> tests<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.240> we

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
wheat I'll show you some tests that we

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.480 
wheat I'll show you some tests that we
ran<00:00:48.660> last<00:00:48.960> year<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.500> our<00:00:49.530> farm<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.280> take<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
ran last year on our farm if you take a

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.460 
ran last year on our farm if you take a
look<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.000> you'll<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.230> went<00:00:52.380> out

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
look at this you'll see that we went out

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.560 
look at this you'll see that we went out
there<00:00:52.680> every<00:00:53.010> single<00:00:53.040> week<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:54.030> field<00:00:54.360> in

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
there every single week in one field in

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.870 
there every single week in one field in
one<00:00:54.750> spot<00:00:55.080> so<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.500> realize<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> lot<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
one spot so I realize it's not a lot of

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.360 
one spot so I realize it's not a lot of
area<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:57.930> anything<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.380> that<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:59.100> ends

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
area or anything like that but it ends

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.120 
area or anything like that but it ends
up<00:00:59.460> being<00:00:59.700> a<00:01:00.060> pretty<00:01:00.390> good<00:01:00.480> idea<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.290> what<00:01:02.010> we

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
up being a pretty good idea of what we

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.590 
up being a pretty good idea of what we
need<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> change<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.880> our<00:01:02.940> farm<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.390> here's

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
need to change on our farm so here's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.389 
need to change on our farm so here's
what<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.840> found<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.530> time<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.100> found<00:01:05.249> that

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
what we found over time we found that

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.980 
what we found over time we found that
our<00:01:05.519> phosphorus<00:01:05.969> levels<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.390> dropping<00:01:06.509> that

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
our phosphorus levels are dropping that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
our phosphorus levels are dropping that
our<00:01:07.140> nitrogen<00:01:07.499> was<00:01:07.799> excessive<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.399> whole<00:01:08.609> way

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
our nitrogen was excessive the whole way

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.940 
our nitrogen was excessive the whole way
through<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.990> example<00:01:10.409> let's<00:01:10.590> say<00:01:10.679> we<00:01:10.829> took

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
through so for example let's say we took

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010 
through so for example let's say we took
$20<00:01:11.609> out<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.850> our<00:01:11.939> nitrogen<00:01:12.270> program<00:01:12.719> put<00:01:12.929> it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
$20 out of our nitrogen program put it

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.719 
$20 out of our nitrogen program put it
into<00:01:13.229> our<00:01:13.259> phosphorus<00:01:13.799> program<00:01:14.189> would<00:01:14.579> we

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
into our phosphorus program would we

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.029 
into our phosphorus program would we
have<00:01:14.820> had<00:01:14.969> higher<00:01:15.179> yields<00:01:15.740> absolutely<00:01:16.740> would

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
have had higher yields absolutely would

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.190 
have had higher yields absolutely would
we<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.310> known<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.909> had<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.509> not<00:01:18.719> run<00:01:18.929> tissue

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we have known this had we not run tissue

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.039 
we have known this had we not run tissue
samples<00:01:19.710> no<00:01:20.429> way<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.359> big<00:01:21.539> thing<00:01:21.569> here

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
samples no way that's the big thing here

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.539 
samples no way that's the big thing here
we<00:01:22.200> used<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.649> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> end<00:01:23.039> of<00:01:23.189> every<00:01:23.520> year

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we used to get to the end of every year

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.309 
we used to get to the end of every year
and<00:01:24.060> say<00:01:24.210> oh<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.569> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.869> disappointed<00:01:25.259> in

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:25.319 
and say oh I'm a little disappointed in

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.809 
and say oh I'm a little disappointed in
yield<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.859> gonna<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.159> next<00:01:26.340> year<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
yield what are we gonna do next year and

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.190 
yield what are we gonna do next year and
we'd<00:01:26.999> say<00:01:27.149> well<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.990> maybe

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
we'd say well I don't really know maybe

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.989 
we'd say well I don't really know maybe
we<00:01:28.409> need<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.619> nitrogen<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.609> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.850> what

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
we need more nitrogen and you know what

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:31.459 
we need more nitrogen and you know what
the<00:01:30.119> status<00:01:30.479> quo<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.689> doesn't<00:01:31.170> work<00:01:31.289> anymore

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
the status quo just doesn't work anymore

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.440 
the status quo just doesn't work anymore
if<00:01:31.799> you've<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.130> anything<00:01:32.639> in<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:32.999> farming

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
if you've got anything in your farming

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.969 
if you've got anything in your farming
operation<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> say<00:01:34.259> well<00:01:34.469> I<00:01:34.679> guess

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
operation that you say well I guess

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
operation that you say well I guess
that's<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.460> how<00:01:35.609> it<00:01:35.789> is<00:01:35.819> we'll<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that's just how it is we'll just have to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.910 
that's just how it is we'll just have to
wait<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:36.990> how<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.229> turns<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.649> you<00:01:37.829> don't

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
wait and see how it turns out you don't

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
wait and see how it turns out you don't
have<00:01:38.069> to<00:01:38.399> have<00:01:38.609> those<00:01:38.850> things<00:01:39.119> anymore<00:01:39.359> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
have to have those things anymore you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.569 
have to have those things anymore you
can<00:01:39.810> find<00:01:40.139> out<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:40.859> there's<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.490> many

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
can find out right now there's so many

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.919 
can find out right now there's so many
things<00:01:41.819> you<00:01:41.969> can<00:01:42.179> do<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.450> every<00:01:42.689> pass

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
things you can do with every pass

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.389 
things you can do with every pass
through<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.380> field<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.039> there's<00:01:44.219> also

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
through the field but there's also

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
through the field but there's also
things<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.999> do<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.209> analysis<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> plant

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
things you can do with analysis of plant

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.709 
things you can do with analysis of plant
tissue<00:01:46.679> and<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.280> soils<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.969> are<00:01:48.119> way<00:01:48.509> above

the<00:01:49.020> last<00:01:49.170> generation<00:01:49.799> ok<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.219> now<00:01:50.429> take<00:01:50.639> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the last generation ok so now take a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.429 
the last generation ok so now take a
look<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:50.969> some<00:01:51.179> corn<00:01:51.479> samples<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.200> ran

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
look at some corn samples that we ran

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.649 
look at some corn samples that we ran
last<00:01:52.740> year<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.249> our<00:01:53.280> farm<00:01:53.639> and<00:01:53.819> you'll<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.359> as

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
last year on our farm and you'll see as

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.840 
last year on our farm and you'll see as
time<00:01:55.079> went<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.499> we<00:01:55.829> ended<00:01:56.009> up<00:01:56.100> being<00:01:56.310> short<00:01:56.700> on

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
time went on we ended up being short on

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.480 
time went on we ended up being short on
potassium<00:01:57.359> a<00:01:57.959> bunch<00:01:58.319> of<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> time<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.130> where

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
potassium a bunch of the time so where

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
potassium a bunch of the time so where
should<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.179> spend<00:02:00.539> our<00:02:00.869> fertilizer<00:02:01.229> dollars

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
should we spend our fertilizer dollars

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.459 
should we spend our fertilizer dollars
going<00:02:02.340> into<00:02:02.639> 2009<00:02:03.359> now<00:02:03.509> hold<00:02:03.749> up<00:02:03.929> our<00:02:04.200> soil

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
going into 2009 now hold up our soil

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.499 
going into 2009 now hold up our soil
tests<00:02:04.859> they<00:02:04.979> were<00:02:05.130> high<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.670> potassium<00:02:05.850> know

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
tests they were high in potassium know

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.869 
tests they were high in potassium know
what's<00:02:06.810> right<00:02:07.139> are<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.950> parts<00:02:08.250> per<00:02:08.489> million

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
what's right are the parts per million

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.330 
what's right are the parts per million
say<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.599> we're<00:02:09.750> high<00:02:09.929> base<00:02:10.349> saturation<00:02:11.129> does

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
say that we're high base saturation does

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.070 
say that we're high base saturation does
not<00:02:11.610> say<00:02:11.879> we're<00:02:12.060> high<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.629> you've<00:02:12.900> got

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
not say we're high you know you've got

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.980 
not say we're high you know you've got
to<00:02:13.170> look<00:02:13.349> at<00:02:13.500> every

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
to look at every

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.690 
to look at every
the<00:02:14.260> soil<00:02:14.470> test<00:02:14.710> not<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:14.920> parts-per-million

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
the soil test not just parts-per-million

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.490 
the soil test not just parts-per-million
you<00:02:15.940> also<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.390> look<00:02:16.540> at<00:02:16.630> base<00:02:16.810> saturation

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
you also have to look at base saturation

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500 
you also have to look at base saturation
that<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.890> actually<00:02:18.400> more<00:02:18.790> important<00:02:19.390> than

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that is actually more important than

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.090 
that is actually more important than
parts<00:02:19.810> per<00:02:19.990> million<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:20.500> anyway<00:02:20.800> coming<00:02:20.980> back

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
parts per million but anyway coming back

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.920 
parts per million but anyway coming back
to<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.490> whole<00:02:21.610> plant<00:02:21.880> tissue<00:02:22.120> analysis<00:02:22.720> thing

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
to the whole plant tissue analysis thing

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.050 
to the whole plant tissue analysis thing
you<00:02:23.320> need<00:02:23.650> plant<00:02:23.980> tissue<00:02:24.220> analysis<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:24.940> to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
you need plant tissue analysis just to

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.670 
you need plant tissue analysis just to
prove<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.270> yourself<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:26.260> does<00:02:26.320> your<00:02:26.500> crop

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
prove to yourself what does your crop

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.350 
prove to yourself what does your crop
really<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.220> what<00:02:27.730> does<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.120> need

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
really have what does it really need

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.850 
really have what does it really need
what<00:02:28.660> should<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.900> be<00:02:29.050> spending<00:02:29.200> my<00:02:29.620> fertilizer

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
what should I be spending my fertilizer

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.070 
what should I be spending my fertilizer
dollar<00:02:30.400> on<00:02:30.670> well<00:02:30.940> my<00:02:31.060> point<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.630> there<00:02:31.900> are<00:02:31.930> two

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
dollar on well my point is there are two

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.050 
dollar on well my point is there are two
separate<00:02:32.500> things<00:02:32.560> soil<00:02:33.130> analysis<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.760> great

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
separate things soil analysis is great

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.520 
separate things soil analysis is great
and<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.390> need<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.840> but<00:02:35.050> plant<00:02:35.320> tissue

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
and you need that but plant tissue

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.500 
and you need that but plant tissue
analysis<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.220> also<00:02:36.610> great<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.150> need<00:02:37.300> that

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
analysis is also great and you need that

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.150 
analysis is also great and you need that
too<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.050> can't<00:02:38.260> say<00:02:38.440> wait<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.680> minute<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.950> did<00:02:39.130> a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
too you can't say wait a minute I did a

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.100 
too you can't say wait a minute I did a
soil<00:02:39.460> test<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.000> told<00:02:40.180> me<00:02:40.270> this<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.780> don't

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
soil test and it told me this I don't

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.780 
soil test and it told me this I don't
need<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.380> do<00:02:41.500> plant<00:02:41.770> tissue<00:02:41.980> test<00:02:42.310> that's<00:02:42.520> not

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
need to do plant tissue test that's not

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.250 
need to do plant tissue test that's not
true<00:02:43.060> at<00:02:43.180> all<00:02:43.330> you're<00:02:43.690> gonna<00:02:43.780> find<00:02:44.050> there<00:02:44.230> are

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
true at all you're gonna find there are

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.960 
true at all you're gonna find there are
some<00:02:44.440> tremendous<00:02:44.650> differences<00:02:45.520> out<00:02:45.730> there

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
some tremendous differences out there

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.550 
some tremendous differences out there
maybe<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.390> say<00:02:46.540> okay<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.840> do<00:02:46.930> have<00:02:47.050> lots<00:02:47.380> of

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
maybe you say okay I do have lots of

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.230 
maybe you say okay I do have lots of
potassium<00:02:47.830> but<00:02:48.310> I'm<00:02:48.430> not<00:02:48.580> getting<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.060> my

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
potassium but I'm not getting it in my

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.970 
potassium but I'm not getting it in my
crop<00:02:49.510> or<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:49.930> have<00:02:50.170> lots<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.470> phosphorous

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
crop or I do have lots of phosphorous

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.470 
crop or I do have lots of phosphorous
but<00:02:51.220> it's<00:02:51.370> not<00:02:51.520> getting<00:02:51.790> into<00:02:52.000> my<00:02:52.180> crop

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
but it's not getting into my crop

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.000 
but it's not getting into my crop
there's<00:02:52.810> something<00:02:53.200> else<00:02:53.380> that's<00:02:53.530> holding<00:02:53.920> me
