00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.710
 with you sl and I was asked to tell 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.780
 what did we do today 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.770
 we were up in the morning 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.199
 still early 630 I still have 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.789
 the vessels in the head are so constricted that they are not 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.920
 Can you imagine how much I'm not used to? 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.830
 Now get up and page after 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.769
 we got up at 6:30 here in this terrible hour 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.740
 tattered confiscated sandwiches format 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.320
 and rushed to Domodedovo arrived 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.050
 boarded the plane with a bunch of waterways 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.690
 which you have either seen or which 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.120
 still see on our channels including 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.290
 on the channel here's a fan and maybe even on 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.410
 main site 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.770
 world of tanks so here we are all this crowd 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.719
 arrived here in Minsk sat then waited 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.309
 when will the strange driver arrive 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.739
 which in Minsk is probably exactly the same 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.289
 first time like most waterways 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.270
 because he was lost and we were looking for our 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.520
 hotel exemplary 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.640
 20 this is the hotel where we are renting now 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.690
 this video and after that we went on 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.610
 lines of stalin if you omit the detail this in 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.750
 most of it is partially 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.780
 artificially created line of defense 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.720
 fortified areas and Minsk fortified area 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.610
 one of the parts of the line of stalin that is 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.710
 defense line which was called not 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.640
 left she proceeded on the big 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.619
 throughout 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.140
 that is, it covered the entire border 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.979
 soviet union before it was 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.869
 moved to western Ukraine not on 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.119
 Baltic states 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.490
 especially there we were what we did there 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.860
 Well, besides the fact that we just went there 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.830
 fotkali looked whether Cosimo Cosimo 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.050
 recorded the video on a little bit managed 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:54.560
 ride t-34 76 and t-44 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.190
 serial version I will say right away not 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.160
 everyone managed to ride them some 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.319
 a little scared hardly hurt 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.750
 well, just okay but not injured 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.259
 morally a little scared and therefore 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.899
 got off the tanks and refused to ride but 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.420
 those who survived 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.150
 brought with them a gigantic amount 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.329
 I mean, for example, I put on dust 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.150
 fresh beacon and after pokatushek on 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.549
 Tankah friends this simply from T-shirt can be 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.030
 feel free to donate to the Sahara Desert Museum 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.489
 as if it was there that she was 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.609
 impressions good dust swallowed all 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.739
 my cameras never have much dust 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.620
 did not see though she traveled on 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.180
 a bunch of desert hot countries 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.819
 sand climate me 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.260
 that is, it was really 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.870
 unforgettable how much dust i never 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.700
 seen in my life a unit of time 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.849
 this is probably the strongest thing 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.220
 remember well and of course there were others 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.680
 things plus but now here we are on 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.230
 golden league and I hope there is still too 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.010
 there will be something interesting i should be 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.109

 on this video we will now finish 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.609

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.510
