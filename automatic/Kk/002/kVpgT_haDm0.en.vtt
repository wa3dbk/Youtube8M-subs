that's caused by is a little is an area
right<00:00:51.190> here<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.909> terms<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.540> tear<00:00:52.720> trough<00:00:53.019> and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
right here the terms of tear trough and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.859 
right here the terms of tear trough and
also<00:00:53.799> this<00:00:53.979> region<00:00:54.460> which<00:00:55.030> outlines<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.629> bone

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
also this region which outlines the bone

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.979 
also this region which outlines the bone
the<00:00:56.440> volume<00:00:56.860> in<00:00:57.220> that<00:00:57.339> region<00:00:57.519> is<00:00:57.909> is<00:00:58.150> lost<00:00:58.629> and

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
the volume in that region is is lost and

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.200 
the volume in that region is is lost and
it<00:00:59.799> creates<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.489> look<00:01:00.699> of<00:01:00.970> fatigue<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:02.790> an<00:01:03.790> age

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
it creates a look of fatigue and an age

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.480 
it creates a look of fatigue and an age
to<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.629> I've<00:01:04.750> admit<00:01:05.199> in<00:01:05.440> her<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.890> woman<00:01:06.220> of

her age you know it's premature so a lot

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.670 
her age you know it's premature so a lot

doesn't look as prominent because really
in<00:01:37.750> my<00:01:38.020> opinion<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.590> is<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:39.310> real<00:01:39.550> defect

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
in my opinion that is the real defect

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.640 
in my opinion that is the real defect
it's<00:01:40.270> it's<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.720> loss<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.140> volume<00:01:41.290> in<00:01:41.530> this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
it's it's the loss of volume in this

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.700 
it's it's the loss of volume in this
area<00:01:41.950> not<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:42.310> much<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.700> idea<00:01:43.500> having<00:01:44.500> too

procedures<00:03:57.380> on<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.530> regular<00:03:57.770> basis<00:03:58.340> and

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
procedures on a regular basis and

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.490 
procedures on a regular basis and
they're<00:03:59.510> getting<00:03:59.660> consistently<00:04:00.350> good

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
they're getting consistently good

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.070 
they're getting consistently good
outcomes<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.940> know<00:04:02.030> talking<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.510> two

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
outcomes so you know talking to two

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.620 
outcomes so you know talking to two

screamed out rhinoplasty which which is
naturally<00:05:00.230> you<00:05:01.130> know<00:05:01.190> would<00:05:01.340> detract<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.940> think

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
naturally you know would detract I think

from from from her looks and as well as
a<00:05:04.940> professional<00:05:05.419> sort<00:05:05.690> of<00:05:05.860> image<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.280> what<00:05:07.970> we

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
a professional sort of image so what we

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.990 
a professional sort of image so what we
what<00:05:09.140> we<00:05:09.169> did<00:05:09.830> in<00:05:09.919> Brianna's<00:05:10.280> cases<00:05:10.640> we<00:05:10.760> did<00:05:10.910> an

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
what we did in Brianna's cases we did an

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.520 
what we did in Brianna's cases we did an
open<00:05:11.270> structure<00:05:11.510> rhinoplasty<00:05:11.870> where<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.350> small

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
open structure rhinoplasty where a small

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.560 
open structure rhinoplasty where a small
incision<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:13.100> made<00:05:13.130> basically<00:05:14.120> underneath

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
incision is made basically underneath

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.570 
incision is made basically underneath
here<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.050> then<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.590> cartilages<00:05:16.130> in<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.340> tip

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
here and then the cartilages in the tip

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.450 
here and then the cartilages in the tip
were<00:05:16.730> refined<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:18.410> create<00:05:18.650> us<00:05:18.770> a<00:05:18.800> little<00:05:19.280> bit

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
were refined to create us a little bit

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.250 
were refined to create us a little bit
more<00:05:19.550> refinement<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.120> tip<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.480> then<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.810> the

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
more refinement the tip and then the the

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.140 
more refinement the tip and then the the
tip<00:05:21.470> was<00:05:21.620> elevated<00:05:22.280> ever<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:22.700> slightly<00:05:23.000> to

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
tip was elevated ever so slightly to

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.420 
tip was elevated ever so slightly to
create<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.540> little<00:05:23.870> bit<00:05:23.990> more<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.530> of<00:05:24.950> a<00:05:25.100> cuter

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
create a little bit more of a of a cuter

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.790 
create a little bit more of a of a cuter
sort<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:25.790> attitude<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.419> to<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:27.320> nasal

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
sort of attitude to the to the the nasal

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.250 
sort of attitude to the to the the nasal
tip<00:05:27.830> region<00:05:28.160> and<00:05:28.460> a<00:05:28.910> small<00:05:29.690> amount<00:05:30.080> of

tip region and a small amount of

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.290 
tip region and a small amount of
refinement<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.430> upper<00:05:31.850> portion<00:05:32.180> of<00:05:32.210> the

refinement to the upper portion of the

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.719 
refinement to the upper portion of the
nose<00:05:32.479> to<00:05:32.510> create<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:32.990> nice<00:05:33.229> gentle<00:05:33.729> profile

nose to create a nice gentle profile

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:35.890 
nose to create a nice gentle profile
let's<00:05:34.940> take<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.090> look<00:05:35.300> from<00:05:35.390> that<00:05:35.479> from<00:05:35.810> the

let's take a look from that from the

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.830 
let's take a look from that from the
side<00:05:36.110> here<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:37.150> one<00:05:38.150> of<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.300> most<00:05:38.450> important

side here and one of the most important

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.880 
side here and one of the most important
things<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.200> when<00:05:39.350> you're<00:05:39.530> when<00:05:39.770> you're

things is when you're when you're

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.340 
things is when you're when you're
evaluating<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.940> nose<00:05:41.150> is<00:05:41.180> is<00:05:41.510> trying<00:05:42.140> to<00:05:42.229> keep
