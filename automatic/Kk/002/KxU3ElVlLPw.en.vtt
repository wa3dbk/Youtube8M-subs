okay I kind of lost track of time a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.039 
okay I kind of lost track of time a
little<00:00:02.610> bit<00:00:02.790> on<00:00:02.970> my<00:00:03.149> six<00:00:03.480> minute<00:00:03.810> cooldown

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049

I'm going to natter to you a little bit

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.939 
I'm going to natter to you a little bit
about<00:00:11.599> prior<00:00:12.599> art<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.710> field<00:00:14.099> oh<00:00:14.900> yeah<00:00:15.949> so

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
about prior art in this field oh yeah so

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.890 
about prior art in this field oh yeah so
the<00:00:17.130> part<00:00:17.340> gets<00:00:17.520> done<00:00:17.670> there<00:00:23.359> yeah<00:00:24.359> prior<00:00:24.630> art

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the part gets done there yeah prior art

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
the part gets done there yeah prior art
in<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.320> field<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> notepad<00:00:28.019> had<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:29.070> good<00:00:29.699> look

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
in this field so notepad had a good look

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.450 
in this field so notepad had a good look
at<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.869> trying<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> implement<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.309> with

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
at this with trying to implement it with

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.930 
at this with trying to implement it with
a<00:00:32.489> vacuum<00:00:33.140> bed<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:35.149> I<00:00:37.040> never<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.370> saw<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
a vacuum bed and I never really saw that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.360 
a vacuum bed and I never really saw that
that<00:00:39.090> came<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.629> much<00:00:39.930> fruition<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.860> his<00:00:41.070> blog

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
that came to much fruition on his blog

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.310 
that came to much fruition on his blog
he<00:00:41.550> had<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:41.820> good<00:00:41.940> stab<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.719> eventually

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
he had a pretty good stab but eventually

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.319 
he had a pretty good stab but eventually
I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.010> forces<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.550> warping<00:00:44.940> were<00:00:45.090> just

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I think the forces of warping were just

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.709 
I think the forces of warping were just
too<00:00:45.629> much<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.110> overcome<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.360> vacuum<00:00:48.360> held

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
too much to overcome with a vacuum held

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.200 
too much to overcome with a vacuum held

eject system MakerBot also had a go at

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.170 
eject system MakerBot also had a go at
it<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.920> system<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.760> called<00:00:57.030> their

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it with a system that they called their

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
a BP Auto build plate and although that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.729 
a BP Auto build plate and although that
was<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> commercial<00:01:02.969> product<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.930> didn't

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
was a commercial product it didn't

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.510 
was a commercial product it didn't
really<00:01:04.949> work<00:01:05.070> very<00:01:05.580> well<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.040> drops<00:01:08.310> down

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
really work very well it just drops down

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.780 
really work very well it just drops down
into<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and from right here people never really

and from right here people never really
got<00:01:13.710> along<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.159> them<00:01:14.280> I've<00:01:14.400> never<00:01:14.640> actually

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
got along with them I've never actually

Ultimaker<00:01:22.200> had<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> preview<00:01:23.250> crack<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
Ultimaker had a preview crack at it and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990 
Ultimaker had a preview crack at it and
they<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.200> doing<00:01:25.500> pretty<00:01:26.100> much<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.850> I'm

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
they are doing pretty much what I'm

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.819 
they are doing pretty much what I'm
doing<00:01:27.270> they're<00:01:27.420> printing<00:01:27.750> PLA<00:01:28.140> onto<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> blue

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
doing they're printing PLA onto a blue

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.359 
doing they're printing PLA onto a blue
tape<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:31.049> use<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> head<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.100> knock

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.910 
tape they and they use the head to knock
the<00:01:32.579> parts<00:01:32.939> off<00:01:33.409> but<00:01:34.409> because<00:01:34.799> they're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the parts off but because they're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and you're not gonna be able to knock it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.050

without<00:02:00.299> damaging<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:00.960> head<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.500> they<00:02:01.619> are

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
without damaging your head so they are

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.490 
without damaging your head so they are

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
bracelets that have a single wall

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.639 
bracelets that have a single wall
thickness<00:02:08.789> adherence<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.599> bed<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.440> by

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
thickness adherence to the bed but by

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.720 
thickness adherence to the bed but by
using<00:02:10.860> glass<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
using glass and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.610 
using glass and
use<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.909> little<00:02:13.180> bit<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.360> hairspray<00:02:13.599> on<00:02:14.290> my

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
use a little bit of hairspray on my

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.820 
use a little bit of hairspray on my
glass<00:02:15.360> things<00:02:16.360> stick<00:02:16.659> really<00:02:17.049> well<00:02:17.170> when<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
glass things stick really well when the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.960 
glass things stick really well when the
bed<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.129> hot<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:18.940> as<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.390> bed<00:02:19.599> cools<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.970> then

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
bed is hot but as the bed cools and then

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.699 
bed is hot but as the bed cools and then
I<00:02:22.030> think<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.659> to<00:02:22.870> deal<00:02:23.049> with<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.290> with<00:02:23.379> glass

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
I think it's to deal with it with glass

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.070 
I think it's to deal with it with glass
contraction<00:02:24.659> differentials<00:02:25.659> the<00:02:25.780> parts

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.720 
contraction differentials the parts
basically<00:02:26.290> pop<00:02:26.739> off<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.159> become<00:02:27.400> entirely

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.160 
loose and here we go second part on the
way<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:36.069> nozzle<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.849> as<00:02:37.480> much<00:02:37.840> as<00:02:38.049> as

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
leak out you never need to prime so as

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.039 
leak out you never need to prime so as
long<00:02:51.489> as<00:02:51.579> you're<00:02:51.819> conscientious<00:02:52.569> about<00:02:52.840> the

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
about the sort of g-code that you insert

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.569 
about the sort of g-code that you insert
into<00:02:58.000> your<00:02:58.209> printer<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:59.129> then<00:03:00.129> you're<00:03:00.340> never

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
into your printer and then you're never

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.979 
into your printer and then you're never
going<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.819> get<00:03:01.000> leaking<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.660> will<00:03:01.780> never

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
going to get leaking so you will never

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.949 
going to get leaking so you will never
require<00:03:02.470> priming<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.329> kind<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.660> means

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
require priming what this kind of means

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.170 
require priming what this kind of means
and<00:03:05.440> what<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.590> hope<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.829> get<00:03:06.040> set<00:03:06.340> up<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.879> that

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and what I hope to get set up is that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.050 
and what I hope to get set up is that
you<00:03:07.989> could<00:03:08.260> have<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.799> printer<00:03:09.340> that's<00:03:09.549> remotely

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
you could have a printer that's remotely

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.910 
you could have a printer that's remotely
accessible<00:03:10.450> either<00:03:10.840> something<00:03:11.349> like<00:03:11.379> octo

print<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.629> could<00:03:13.989> literally<00:03:14.829> send<00:03:15.160> it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
print and you could literally send it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000 
print and you could literally send it
g-code<00:03:15.940> files<00:03:16.180> obviously<00:03:16.540> g-code<00:03:17.470> files<00:03:17.769> that

are specifically set for this type of
printing<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.280> would<00:03:21.430> print<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.760> object

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
printing and it would print the object

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.110 
printing and it would print the object
eject<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.690> out<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:24.220> sit<00:03:24.639> and<00:03:24.790> then<00:03:24.910> wait

special<00:04:15.280> hardware<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.139> most<00:04:17.139> of<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.410> the

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
special hardware and most of the the

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.819 
special hardware and most of the the
efforts<00:04:18.130> done<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.459> GK<00:04:18.910> all<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.419> need<00:04:19.599> is<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:20.049> bit

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
efforts done in GK all you need is a bit

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.510 
efforts done in GK all you need is a bit
of<00:04:20.919> paper<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.539> something<00:04:22.539> to<00:04:22.750> stick

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
of paper and something to stick

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.129 
of paper and something to stick
the<00:04:23.610> front<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:23.970> your<00:04:24.180> ex<00:04:24.270> parish<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:25.020> that

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
the front of your ex parish and that

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.770 
the front of your ex parish and that
could<00:04:25.259> be<00:04:25.319> a<00:04:25.349> printed<00:04:25.770> part<00:04:26.009> or<00:04:26.849> whatever<00:04:27.330> you

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
could be a printed part or whatever you

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.050 
could be a printed part or whatever you
knock<00:04:28.110> up<00:04:28.259> my<00:04:28.440> hand<00:04:28.710> at<00:04:28.830> home<00:04:29.009> really<00:04:29.280> not<00:04:29.910> much

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
knock up my hand at home really not much

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.589 
knock up my hand at home really not much
to<00:04:30.120> it

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
to it

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.059 
to it
so<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:31.110> hate<00:04:31.289> that<00:04:31.410> give<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.620> guys<00:04:31.770> some<00:04:31.919> ideas

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
so I hate that give you guys some ideas

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.600 
so I hate that give you guys some ideas
and<00:04:33.289> hopefully<00:04:34.289> we'll<00:04:34.770> see<00:04:34.919> it<00:04:35.009> integrated

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
and hopefully we'll see it integrated

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.939 
and hopefully we'll see it integrated
into<00:04:35.970> some<00:04:36.599> sort<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:36.930> slice<00:04:37.440> or<00:04:37.650> something

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
into some sort of slice or something

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.610 
into some sort of slice or something
like<00:04:38.039> that<00:04:38.099> to<00:04:38.460> make<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.759> little<00:04:38.879> bit<00:04:39.090> easier

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
like that to make it a little bit easier

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.999 
like that to make it a little bit easier
one<00:04:40.620> problem<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:40.949> did<00:04:41.129> encounter<00:04:41.639> is<00:04:41.699> that<00:04:41.819> M

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
one problem I did encounter is that M

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.129 
one problem I did encounter is that M
190<00:04:44.009> which<00:04:44.310> is<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> set<00:04:44.970> bear<00:04:45.330> temperature<00:04:45.930> and

for<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.860> lower<00:04:50.490> temperature<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:51.449> you<00:04:52.110> can't<00:04:52.530> use

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740
