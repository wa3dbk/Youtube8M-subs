00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.670
the Chrysler 200 is all new for 2015
we've driven it we found to be

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.530
refined comfortable and affordable but
in with a slew of new features a nice

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.170
touches

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.779
it is in perfect in terms of exterior
styling the 200 F lee is that

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.150
made in Detroit feel looks like the big
brother to the dark but

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.900
ironically it has more European feel the
many of its competitors

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.250
just like our long-term Cherokee

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.550
this from the four-cylinder engine
paired with the 9 speed transmission

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.860
inside the 200

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.120
all-new and all better on the materials
are much nicer to look a lot like the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.920
rest of the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.940
Dodge and Chrysler family on the inside
its have the great you connect system

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.300
that we really enjoy although

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.790
to be honest it like a lot of other
systems my Ford touch

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.040
a should be linked all those there are
still some wags but by large or

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.600
pretty well couple cool things in here
that are unique because they've gone to

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.080
electronic gear shift the other space
underneath

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.509
for storage here we've got a smartphone
calm and cool there's a pass-through

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.020
positive charge that are taboo as you
need to that sexual thing

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.300
there are couple to hear that you can
work out on the way when any

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.150
access to the storage now if you're like
me and you can't live without that diet

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.580
coke

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.980
you can access that stored back here in
typical midsize sedan fashion the back

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.790
seat rule is not too bad and he's going
to just about enough space to bolt I

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.450
love top

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.100
but I'm about 61 I put two adults
comfortably back here you could probably

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.900
fit a kid

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.729
in the middle seat but why would you
wanna views on like that the truck is

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.790
also better than new 200 you'll see that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.860
about 20 percent more space than the
previous one but there's a couple things

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.870
to watch out for

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.049
want your was at their plan can intrude
the past there which means that if

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.580
you're trying to put really long

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.090
items and you may be stuck in addition
the swing arms

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.620
intrude into that space so you can stack
you they are too high

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.180
is the 200 the right car for you well
the 1i

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.549
midsize sedan that's has distinctive
styling the class where the lobby in 10

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.299
to look like

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.750
it might be but if your gonna pick one
we are provide more powerful v6 engine

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.849
over the four-cylinder

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.849
on the flip side to get that power you
have to pay for it

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.959
and
