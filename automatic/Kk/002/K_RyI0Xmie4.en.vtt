00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.350
 well then having been in 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.380
 moncayo and on land and we have 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.389
 taken a turn with my human friend and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.790
 we have collected some of the mushrooms 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.670
 that we can find for these dates 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.380
 in the upland area by 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.770
 example in the pine forest where we have been 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.740
 before we picked up rebollo or speaks to us 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.330
 what's ours is a pinewood mushroom 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.449
 correct since we have effectively gone down 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 the moncayo and different altitude now 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.590
 then depending on the term 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.510
 municipal is so broad that it gives us 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.670
 Add we can find species of 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 all types are concretely we have 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.469
 found in the pine forests at an altitude 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
 more or less than 1100 meters and good 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.460
 we can find deeds of all kinds of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.460
 riverside of prairie dogs 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.239
 exact thistle mushroom we have started to 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.100
 collect a little variety of all 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.610
 for of all mushrooms for you to see 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.040
 the nÃ­scalo appreciated in catalonia we have 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.020
 caught boletus we have caught two types of 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.000
 boletus that there is now the pin and tail and the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.119
 edulis there is a difference between one and 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.920
 another in which this one has a brownish color 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.320
 more reddish and this is more more brown and the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.100
 edge of the hat has as well as a 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.540
 kind of white sheet if this one 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 mainly in a lledo 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.280
 in mixed forests in leafy pine forests 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.680
 hayedo oaks robledal 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.380
 they are fungi because very pink the foot is very 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 Thick the hat there is also another type 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.130
 of the family it has appeared that this is 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.660
 I ask you a les and dunn that is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.820
 edible although of less interest 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.510
 culinary that we find it also in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 oak clear the boletus family 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.720
 of such store all eat 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 there is practically one that is dangerous 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.110
 is the satanas ticket that differs 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.000
 in which the hat is white 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.240
 and we have taken other types of 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 mushroom species amanita had handyman 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.830
 phalloides amanita muscaria 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.710
 concretely is this differentiation a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.440
 dangerous mushroom has the white vulva 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.900
 the white plate and the forgiveness the ring 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.580
 white and the white sheets when 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.930
 give these three characteristics these 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.240
 three conditions to be discarded 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.250
 immediately a hallucinogenic mushroom does not 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.260
 It is deadly but it is very toxic in consumption 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.300
 of large quantities the amanita 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.580
 phalloides is similar to the hat 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.230
 only that it is green green 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.909
 as well as an olive 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.049
 yes / brownish and green but let's go 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.790
 mainly has the pump too 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.209
 the white plates and the white ring 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.069
 we have found an ashram arias beards 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.819
 of goat that are also edible 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.840
 little already damaged by frost 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.790
 we have found agaricus already in meadow 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.620
 they are very good edibles you have to have 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.610
 be careful because there is a lot of much 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.860
 variety to differentiate it by touch 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.080
 rub yellows and then has a smell 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.720
 also sulfur very very intense very 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.970
 bad these must be discarded 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.470
 we have found cantharellus the family 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.960
 of the songs the chanterelle fresh and 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:18.030
 are sheets of current is edible in 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:20.190
 cook then that for exact desserts 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.110
 and good mainly here the mushroom more 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.880
 characteristic and the most valuable 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.050
 culinary and the most appreciated is the mushroom 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.700
 of thistle and we enjoy in agreda of some 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.430
 very good meadows to catch good 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.850
 Amounts of thistle mushrooms an aroma 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.450
 very good and a very intense taste 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.450
 cook it 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.310
 the sensations that we are going to feel is 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:47.389
 especially fine looks very exquisite for 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.970
 do it on any plate 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.280
 mainly good is used in 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.280
 in scrambled egg with a little garlic 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.860
 and complaint does not accept a very very very 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.180
 good 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.020
 product when the product is good 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.420
 Exactly it is not necessary ha ha 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.490
 well we have also seen the truffle is the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.570
 fungus most appreciated without a doubt in the 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.690
 province of soria in agreda much much 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.030
 culinary interest is 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.980
 a value economic amounts that 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.830
 can rub between 900 and 1,000 euros 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.130
 the truffle selected the truffle the tuber 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:27.580
 melanosporum had it this well is of 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.410
 lower value and both intensity in the 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.780
 aromas as in the price we stick to 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.240
 to lose 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.440
 yes but good either of the two 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:43.620
 we go a value highly in this case 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.340
 would be the least if it was if that was what 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.090
 most appreciated comes out in the months of 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.760
 December January or February is a fungus 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.230
 with the test that veins are given 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.110
 although in this one we can not appreciate it 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.240
 very good but good is the fungus more 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.960
 appreciated and of greater value both 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.490
 gastronomically as economically 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.060
 we have a bit of variety of all kinds 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.040
 mushrooms season t-shirts mushrooms 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.470

 we have been able to collect are these good 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.830
 and now we will start cooking a 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.470
 dish with any of the products 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.000
 that we have been collecting 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.010
 In the woods 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.860
 we will appreciate the taste of the 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:36.750
 forests inside 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:39.900
