look it up but I got this one mainly for

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.340 
look it up but I got this one mainly for
parts<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.040> some<00:00:41.399> other<00:00:41.550> ones<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.350> which

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
parts for some other ones I have which

warped crank shafts and stuff and this
one's<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> think<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> 5<00:00:52.469> horse<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.219> come

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
one's a I think it's a 5 horse to come

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.770 
one's a I think it's a 5 horse to come
so<00:00:53.870> because<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.910> snowblower<00:00:57.510> right

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
so because on that snowblower right

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.740 
so because on that snowblower right
there<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> same<00:00:59.010> engine<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.600> we've

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
there it's the same engine and we've

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.590 
there it's the same engine and we've
been<00:01:00.870> having<00:01:01.109> trouble<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
leaked all over the place so it's

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.040

which the whole tags there the bottoms a
little<00:03:15.640> dirty<00:03:16.209> but<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:17.620> can<00:03:17.769> still<00:03:17.980> pretty

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
little dirty but you can still pretty

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.479 
little dirty but you can still pretty

much read the whole thing and the
numbers<00:03:21.820> are<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.180> side<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.690> over<00:03:22.900> there

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
numbers are on the side of it over there

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.080 
numbers are on the side of it over there
in<00:03:25.060> all<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.360> linkages<00:03:26.610> they're<00:03:27.610> still<00:03:27.910> on

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
in all the linkages they're still on

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.940 
in all the linkages they're still on
here<00:03:28.390> for<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.660> throttle<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.290> everything<00:03:29.709> and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
here for the throttle and everything and

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.340 
here for the throttle and everything and
they<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:30.580> still<00:03:31.000> move<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.510> whatnot<00:03:31.840> so

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
they all still move and whatnot so

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.390 
they all still move and whatnot so
that's<00:03:33.220> always<00:03:33.430> good<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.920> one<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:36.310> a

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
that's always good this one is a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.120 
that's always good this one is a
four-horse<00:03:37.060> Briggs<00:03:38.190> which<00:03:39.360> isn't<00:03:40.360> see<00:03:41.130> it's

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
four-horse Briggs which isn't see it's

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.070 
four-horse Briggs which isn't see it's
got<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> ton<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:42.670> shellac<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.450> gas<00:03:43.660> tank

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
got a ton of shellac in the gas tank

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.690 
got a ton of shellac in the gas tank
it's<00:03:44.350> really<00:03:45.100> really<00:03:45.519> nasty<00:03:45.730> stuff<00:03:47.700> linkages

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
it's really really nasty stuff linkages

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.130 
it's really really nasty stuff linkages
are<00:03:48.850> on<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.209> like<00:03:49.390> this<00:03:49.630> engine<00:03:49.989> though

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
are on it I like this engine though

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.509 
are on it I like this engine though
because<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:50.650> got<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.920> throttle<00:03:51.190> where<00:03:51.459> you

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
because it's got the throttle where you

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.910 
because it's got the throttle where you
can<00:03:51.670> just<00:03:51.850> set<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.299> run<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.620> it's<00:03:53.769> good

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
can just set it and run it so it's good

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.979 
can just set it and run it so it's good
for<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.130> stationary<00:03:54.700> object<00:03:55.269> like<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.600> 8<00:03:55.750> horse

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
for a stationary object like the 8 horse

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.759 
for a stationary object like the 8 horse
I<00:03:56.200> had<00:03:56.410> in<00:03:57.220> an<00:03:57.340> earlier<00:03:57.640> video<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:59.500> got<00:03:59.620> this

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
I had in an earlier video it's got this

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.090 
I had in an earlier video it's got this
nifty<00:04:00.040> little<00:04:00.340> shutoff<00:04:00.820> on<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.239> top<00:04:02.100> that

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
nifty little shutoff on the top that

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.640 
nifty little shutoff on the top that
slides<00:04:03.519> up<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:03.850> down<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.390> don't<00:04:05.350> know<00:04:05.470> if<00:04:05.530> you

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
slides up and down I don't know if you

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.210 
slides up and down I don't know if you
can<00:04:05.769> read<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.160> but<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.459> says<00:04:07.799> start<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:08.950> stop

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
can read it but it says start and stop

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.449 
can read it but it says start and stop
on<00:04:09.489> there<00:04:09.730> or<00:04:09.910> start<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.329> run

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
on there or start and run

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.030 
on there or start and run
which<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.150> kind<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.420> cool<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:12.900> never<00:04:13.590> seen<00:04:13.860> one

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
which is kind of cool you never seen one

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:33.529 
which is kind of cool you never seen one
like<00:04:14.189> that<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.020> tags<00:04:31.880> still<00:04:32.880> on<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.360> for

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.969 
air intake for the air which this is the
same<00:04:56.430> one<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:57.000> little<00:04:57.449> older<00:04:57.750> though<00:04:57.930> that's<00:04:58.620> on

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
same one a little older though that's on

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.629 
same one a little older though that's on
that<00:04:59.760> Toro<00:05:00.210> powershift<00:05:00.690> over<00:05:01.260> there<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:01.860> that

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
that Toro powershift over there and that

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.580 
that Toro powershift over there and that
one<00:05:02.789> doesn't<00:05:03.000> run<00:05:03.270> good<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:03.960> figured<00:05:04.440> I'd

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
one doesn't run good so I figured I'd

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.080 
one doesn't run good so I figured I'd
buy<00:05:04.770> this<00:05:04.830> one<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:06.270> fix<00:05:06.479> it<00:05:07.639> and<00:05:08.639> this<00:05:08.880> is<00:05:09.060> a

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
buy this one to fix it and this is a

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.230 
buy this one to fix it and this is a
governed<00:05:09.570> one<00:05:10.160> and<00:05:11.160> all<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.490> linkages<00:05:11.910> are<00:05:11.970> on

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
governed one and all the linkages are on

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.540 
governed one and all the linkages are on
it<00:05:12.449> all<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.380> butterflies<00:05:13.889> moving<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
it all the butterflies moving the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.779 
it all the butterflies moving the
carburetor<00:05:15.090> for<00:05:15.389> the<00:05:15.449> most<00:05:15.660> part<00:05:16.550> choke<00:05:17.550> and

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
carburetor for the most part choke and

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.790 
carburetor for the most part choke and
everything<00:05:20.449> gas<00:05:21.449> tanks<00:05:21.780> got<00:05:21.900> some<00:05:22.139> gas<00:05:22.380> it's

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
everything gas tanks got some gas it's

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.629 
everything gas tanks got some gas it's
actually<00:05:23.130> really<00:05:23.849> clean<00:05:25.070> not<00:05:26.070> rusty<00:05:26.520> which

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639

I'm<00:05:26.789> pretty<00:05:27.210> surprised<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.830> it<00:05:29.039> does<00:05:29.190> turn

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
I'm pretty surprised and it does turn

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.250 
I'm pretty surprised and it does turn
over

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.540

three<00:06:07.310> all<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.480> linkages<00:06:08.900> are<00:06:08.960> still<00:06:09.320> there

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
three all the linkages are still there

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.110 
three all the linkages are still there
for<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.770> most<00:06:09.980> part<00:06:11.980> and<00:06:12.980> uh<00:06:13.280> well<00:06:13.850> you<00:06:13.970> can

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
there something down the head free up

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.130 
there something down the head free up
but<00:06:30.320> it<00:06:30.410> does<00:06:30.530> have<00:06:30.740> oil<00:06:30.980> in<00:06:31.130> it<00:06:31.870> which<00:06:32.870> I<00:06:32.990> don't
