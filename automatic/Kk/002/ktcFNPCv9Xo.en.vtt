00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.589
 ok hey people and would you come back 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.870
 to another minecraft video 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.400
 today the net is already 12 39 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.290
 appeared and I show you now the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.790
 Updates the download link to this 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.380
 slot is down as usual 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.849
 description was the first 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.289
 written that the light system of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.119
 minecraft has been overhauled 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.859
 this should be less in minecraft 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.420
 For example, light grows on such 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.070
 or in such heights 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.779
 You can see that at Bergen or you have it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.160
 Seen so often at Bergen and I think 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.930
 It is a very good improvement 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.880
 besides, the sounds and again 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.289
 that improves or amounts to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.270
 no longer means that you now this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.980
 You'll probably have bugs if you have a blog 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.050
 placed the wrong sound comes 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.399
 Furthermore, the lighting was added 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.170
 different blocks like stairs or 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.149
 half stood improved that shows up 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.379
 Best here at night and that can 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.360
 you actually recognize yourself very well 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.289
 this all this stairs and pipes 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.510
 you can see that there are none here 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.750
 light bugs are not more here everywhere 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.300
 more 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.649
 formerly from time to time as and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.100
 Should he be better for general lighting? 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.449
 his 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.860
 I once briefly a whole list 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.690
 reduce me to something else 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.949
 to share and that one knows that yes 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.930
 maybe from earlier that one if you are 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.090
 under a staircase a light source 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.589
 had like this here then a funny 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.240
 lighting off that will be a little bit now 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.909
 changed and indeed comes here anyway 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.860
 a little bit of light through but it could 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.900
 half by so here by the small one 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.400
 slit and a lot more realistic 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.189
 and actually pulls a bit too 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.680
 more and more beautiful were generally still one 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.380
 few bugfixes made around minecraft for 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 the version 1.4 to halloween ready to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.320
 do that is because I could then 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.360
 most likely about the update 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.490
 happy if not somehow wrong 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.750
 the western actually this snapshot 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.220
 you can tell that no new ones 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.409
 features more are just added 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.420
 bugfixes and that means minecraft 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.189
 1.4 really comes into the final phase 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.840
 and we hope that it will be back this time 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.140
 will be freer than minecraft 1 point 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.970
 ran 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.939
 well then you now says times how her 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.020
 with the light bugs and stuff like that 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.670
 double as the tube was whether the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.340
 Solution well you think that was done 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 and on the other hand, if I have anything else 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.909
 but that can happen well 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.619
 that any new news about 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.329
 So let this step out already 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.740
 it almost knows me otherwise 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.729
 I'll see you next time 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.729
 another minecraft video
