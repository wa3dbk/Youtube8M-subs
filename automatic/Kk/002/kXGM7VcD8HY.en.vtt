well<00:00:11.549> vthb<00:00:12.120> one<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:12.750> we<00:00:13.650> are<00:00:13.830> now<00:00:13.980> starting

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
well vthb one here we are now starting

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.300 
well vthb one here we are now starting
on<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> tractor<00:00:14.879> itself<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:16.500> thought<00:00:17.250> I

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
on the tractor itself and I thought I

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.339 
on the tractor itself and I thought I
would<00:00:17.490> once<00:00:17.910> again<00:00:18.180> pick<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> hardest<00:00:19.140> thing

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
would once again pick the hardest thing

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.859 
would once again pick the hardest thing
to<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.619> first<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.250> then<00:00:20.550> your<00:00:20.820> things<00:00:21.660> get

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
to do first and then your things get

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.130 
to do first and then your things get
easier<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.200> you<00:00:22.230> go<00:00:22.520> alright<00:00:23.520> now<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.660> have

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
easier as you go alright now I just have

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.380 
easier as you go alright now I just have
to<00:00:25.169> move<00:00:25.380> through<00:00:25.529> changing<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.400> main<00:00:27.090> belt

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
to move through changing the main belt

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.330 
to move through changing the main belt
drive<00:00:27.800> /<00:00:28.800> clutch<00:00:30.469> assembly<00:00:31.469> it's<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.129> belt

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
drive / clutch assembly it's the belt

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
drive / clutch assembly it's the belt
that<00:00:32.550> pulled<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> around<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> hole<00:00:33.559> through

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that pulled it around the hole through

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.740 
that pulled it around the hole through
the<00:00:34.649> flexion<00:00:35.070> from<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> front<00:00:36.180> pulley<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the flexion from the front pulley to the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.380 
the flexion from the front pulley to the
back<00:00:36.989> transmission<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:39.030> idea

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
back transmission and I have an idea

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.170 
back transmission and I have an idea
that<00:00:39.660> I'd<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> try<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.820> belt<00:00:42.030> is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that I'd like to try because the belt is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.630 
that I'd like to try because the belt is
really<00:00:42.210> hard<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.870> off<00:00:43.190> it<00:00:44.190> has<00:00:44.339> to<00:00:44.489> come

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
really hard to get off it has to come

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.229 
really hard to get off it has to come
around<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.269> front<00:00:45.570> pulley<00:00:46.429> and<00:00:47.429> the<00:00:47.820> PTO

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
around the front pulley and the PTO

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.139 
around the front pulley and the PTO
assembly<00:00:48.839> and<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> instructions<00:00:50.819> are<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
assembly and the instructions are to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.020 
assembly and the instructions are to
remove<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.600> PPO<00:00:52.050> assembly<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.679> it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.030> 26

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
remove that PPO assembly but it's a 26

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
remove that PPO assembly but it's a 26
year<00:00:54.239> old<00:00:54.359> piece<00:00:54.839> of<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.679> know

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
year old piece of you know

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.059 
year old piece of you know
electromechanical<00:00:57.260> hardware<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.010> don't

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
electromechanical hardware and I don't

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.919 
electromechanical hardware and I don't
really<00:00:59.339> want<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> play<00:01:00.269> with<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
really want to play with it because it

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.079 
really want to play with it because it
still<00:01:01.019> works<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.159> I<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.339> an<00:01:02.429> idea

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
still works so I have an idea

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.649 
still works so I have an idea
and<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> works<00:01:04.159> it'll<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.850> good<00:01:06.090> I'm

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and if it works it'll be really good I'm

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.310 
and if it works it'll be really good I'm
just<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:07.500> my<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:08.780> hand<00:01:09.780> grinder

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
just going to take my my hand grinder

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.860 
just going to take my my hand grinder
for<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.190> half-inch<00:01:11.580> grinder<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> nip<00:01:12.659> off<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
for a half-inch grinder and nip off a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.770 
for a half-inch grinder and nip off a
corner<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.650> frame<00:01:13.950> only<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.760> half<00:01:15.510> an<00:01:15.690> inch

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
corner of the frame only a half an inch

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
corner of the frame only a half an inch
so<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.650> sit<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.010> belt<00:01:17.190> past<00:01:17.460> so

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so that I can just sit the belt past so

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.030 
so that I can just sit the belt past so
I<00:01:18.270> will<00:01:18.510> show<00:01:18.690> you<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.740> we'll<00:01:19.890> get

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I will show you that and then we'll get

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.810 
I will show you that and then we'll get
to<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:27.870> close<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.700> the

have to remove this whole PTO assembly

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.580 
have to remove this whole PTO assembly
here<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.560> a

here and so it's just going to be a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.020 
here and so it's just going to be a
quick<00:01:55.800> try<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:56.460> doesn't<00:01:56.730> work<00:01:56.820> we'll

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
quick try and if it doesn't work we'll

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.230 
quick try and if it doesn't work we'll
go<00:01:57.090> back<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:57.750> book<00:01:57.900> says<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.240> so

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
go back to what the book says and so

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.780 
go back to what the book says and so
that'll<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.510> right<00:02:00.720> there
