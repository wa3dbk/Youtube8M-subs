00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.430
 hallowed cep welcome to fÃ¼le gotti 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.110
 life for a little gameplay commented on 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:14.299
 hitman absolution this gameplay is the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.289
 first part of fight night 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.740
 so we end up in a 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.029
 environment stuffed with pnj 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.289
 we are in normal costume so we have to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.449
 really be careful not to get 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.460
 locate here I show you the good little 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.619
 way one has to hurry squatting himself 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.980
 stick to the tires are waiting for the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.899
 pressure went down and go away quickly 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.640
 behind the caravan the caravan the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.040
 early I wanted to go back in fact it's 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 impossible we do not know how to get into the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.180
 caravan unfortunately so here I do 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.980
 a little diversion 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.700
 simply to show you that 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.320
 the eye a disguise he a disguise 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.910
 which is not necessarily necessary 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.410
 it was just to show you if you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.430
 want to continue the continuation of the adventure 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.309
 like that because it's not this 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 disguise too i'm going to use 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.090
 it's not this disguise I have 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.770
 reminded mace also in passing a map 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.030
 access that would allow me to return 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.290
 in the building but I'm going back 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.390
 by the big door and not by the little 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.439
 door 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 simply because I'm going to go 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.510
 fried with sanchez in the arena so 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.140
 following the level is a fight of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.450
 catch and you have to succeed in murder 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.159
 sanchez simply without getting 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.530
 locate a cache not a small object 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.729
 to make diversions 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.320
 I do not like a lot of diversion 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.310
 but that's the only way I've found 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.979
 for to enter the arena 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.329
 directly inherited with sanchez and I 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.759
 you may be doing the mission by 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.310
 after in a second time not all of 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.560
 after 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 other than by selling these diversions 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.400
 so in fact the goal is to attract the 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.619
 wrestler so that I can disguise myself 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.840
 in him but before it is he who 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.380
 moves to a crowd of other individuals 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.369
 Who is gonna come 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.740
 finally a crowd not especially a 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.350
 mans crowd so if you want 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.090
 neutralize the normally it happens 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.450
 more or less well there are not too many 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.450
 problems 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:14.970
 Just follow up to stay well against 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.560
 the chest of stamps right away so 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.860
 you run the key around here it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.450
 will 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.340
 on the other hand what am I going to make a mistake 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.170
 in its gameplay seems to me but I 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.150
 did not pick up the right object that's 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.349
 the key that I need I believe I 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.330
 go a little too far ago 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.090
 it's another guy who goes here it's 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.410
 besides I think if I have good memories 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's been a while since I'm recording 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.380
 gameplay that's another guard who's going 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.980
 who will present unfortunately it 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.980
 I was a little disgusted 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.670
 what am I going to do that is wasting me 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.130
 elsewhere suddenly not what will happen 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.630
 on the other side I'm sorry for this 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.850
 small fail that makes you lose a little 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.890
 of time if not advance a little video 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.319
 for the rest but basically I 'm going 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.110
 re-roll the key the 2 3 times story that 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.220
 whether it's the wrestler who gets 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.010
 move so that I can take his 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.209
 costume simply but with the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.380
 suit I'm just going is 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.350
 quiet and able to return by the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.370
 main door 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.400
 so as I wanted to explain I had 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.489
 picked up an access card to pass 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.079
 through the secondary door there by this 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:27.750
 door there I was no longer at 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:29.700
 infiltrations but it was a lot more 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.590
 hard to approach sanchez like that and then 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.470
 you do not have a lot of challenges doing it 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.609
 in this way so that's why 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.010
 I decided to do it like this 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.239
 just for you to see 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.859
 the video you were pushing release a 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.859
 maximum challenge maximum points 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.609
 you also saw that near the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.630
 disguise doubt on time when I 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.859
 took the disguise there was evidence 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.880
 next door that's why we had to do 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.500
 diversion on the guard 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.530
 it's better to go through all of 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.100
 simply because 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.440
 after there are other pnj that comes here 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.840
 I took the opportunity that everyone is 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.709
 busy to hide it here because 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.170
 I need the other chest for 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.610
 the last of the people you go 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.930
 see another way to attract NPCs 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.730
 it's cutting off the flow of 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.260
 caravan only you are a lot 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.239
 more blatant when you're here you 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.600
 are really quiet and one of that is 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.690
 the right target that will come down the 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:35.990
 patriot you will see how I have the 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:35.990
 class in my tights and wec 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:42.070
 sorry for what's happening to you but it's 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.930
 it's better that it's me who 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.539
 you choke that you make sprayed by 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.490
 sanchez 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.840
 what the poor if you want if you 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.699
 leave him there he goes he'll pick up a 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.320
 little beating at least like that you him 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.530
 save life in some way it's not 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.530
 very bad 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.850
 and that's disguised like that I have too much 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.780
 class 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.919
 what a nice kid no you have to do a little 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.900
 the great torment for not doing you 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.460
 for not getting fucked by your friends 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.699
 that's why I passed behind the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.699
 truck 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.060
 here and it's this entry 6 that I 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.060
 chosen by donation 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.100
 so we meet for the second 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.610
 video for the suite right away 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.610
 ciao
