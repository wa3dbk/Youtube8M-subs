in<00:00:55.950> these<00:00:56.340> two<00:00:56.610> candles<00:00:57.200> here<00:00:58.200> with<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> upper

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
in these two candles here with the upper

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
in these two candles here with the upper
tails<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.880> really<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.270> our<00:01:00.420> signal<00:01:00.840> this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
tails and that really is our signal this

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.039 
tails and that really is our signal this
is<00:01:01.050> how<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> read<00:01:01.470> price<00:01:01.739> action<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:03.049> we're

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
is how you read price action and we're

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.109 
is how you read price action and we're
looking<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.860> short<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.489> let's<00:01:05.790> say<00:01:05.939> we're

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
looking to go short so let's say we're

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
looking to go short so let's say we're
short<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.840> 130<00:01:07.649> to<00:01:08.399> 90<00:01:09.210> or<00:01:09.240> 130<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.899> 95<00:01:10.610> my

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
short here 130 to 90 or 130 to 95 my

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
short here 130 to 90 or 130 to 95 my
strategy<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.299> place<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> stop<00:01:13.020> above<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
strategy is to place a stop above the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
strategy is to place a stop above the
signal<00:01:14.460> bar<00:01:14.719> or<00:01:15.719> the<00:01:15.840> most<00:01:16.020> relevant<00:01:16.259> high

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
signal bar or the most relevant high

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
signal bar or the most relevant high
which<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.159> really<00:01:17.520> through<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.749> your

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
which is really through here so your

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
which is really through here so your
stop-loss<00:01:19.139> is<00:01:19.350> somewhere<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.280> this

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
stop-loss is somewhere up here now this

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.069 
stop-loss is somewhere up here now this
is<00:01:20.429> a<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:20.759> basic<00:01:20.999> setup<00:01:21.569> I<00:01:21.689> don't<00:01:21.929> often

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079
