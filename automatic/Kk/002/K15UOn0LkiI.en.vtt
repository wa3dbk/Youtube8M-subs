00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
doing just that it's also really quick

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.889 
doing just that it's also really quick
and<00:00:46.159> easy<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:46.640> set<00:00:46.820> up<00:00:46.850> let<00:00:47.510> me<00:00:47.600> show<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:47.809> how

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
and easy to set up let me show you how

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.980 
and easy to set up let me show you how
it<00:00:48.109> works<00:00:49.570> basically<00:00:50.570> put<00:00:51.350> on<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.589> table

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.270 

but<00:00:54.560> each<00:00:54.770> of<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.040> handles<00:00:55.340> up<00:00:55.460> like<00:00:55.640> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.720 

then<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.829> make<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.640> longer

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.060 

each<00:01:07.480> of<00:01:07.690> these<00:01:07.840> are<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.710> side

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.460 

they<00:01:11.700> want<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.150> attach<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> camera<00:01:12.840> so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
they want to just attach the camera so

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:24.840
