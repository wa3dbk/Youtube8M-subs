what<00:00:22.560> we're<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> do<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.760> concentrate<00:00:24.750> on

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
what we're going to do is concentrate on

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
what we're going to do is concentrate on
the<00:00:25.199> mute<00:00:25.439> points<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.519> play<00:00:26.730> with<00:00:27.180> with

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the mute points that you play with with

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
the mute points that you play with with
when<00:00:27.660> you're<00:00:27.779> playing<00:00:27.930> slide<00:00:28.369> one<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> which

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
when you're playing slide one of which

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.470 
when you're playing slide one of which
is<00:00:29.789> behind<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.330> bar<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.969> makes<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
is behind the bar it just makes the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.319 
is behind the bar it just makes the
transition<00:00:34.070> smoother<00:00:35.070> between<00:00:35.790> notes<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.210> if

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
transition smoother between notes so if

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.090 
transition smoother between notes so if
I<00:00:36.450> played<00:00:36.750> without<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.140> mute<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:37.950> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
I played without a mute and it's this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.639 
I played without a mute and it's this
finger<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.570> does<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> mute<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.410> left

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
finger that does the mute on the left

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:53.810 
finger that does the mute on the left
hand<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.160> play<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> little<00:00:42.149> line<00:00:42.329> without<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.920 

however<00:00:54.820> if<00:00:54.910> you<00:00:55.000> can<00:00:55.150> hear<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.450> it<00:00:55.660> clearly

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
however if you can hear it it clearly

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.250 
however if you can hear it it clearly
but<00:00:56.230> basically<00:00:56.830> that<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.160> sort<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.460> sound

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.860 

behind<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:03.610> wisping<00:01:04.210> kind<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.720> noise

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
behind this wisping kind of noise

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.290 
behind this wisping kind of noise
happening<00:01:05.260> if<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.310> place<00:01:06.580> your<00:01:06.729> finger<00:01:06.909> on

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
happening if you place your finger on

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:33.080 
happening if you place your finger on
the<00:01:07.810> string<00:01:08.080> behind<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.830> bar

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.850 

the<00:01:34.090> next<00:01:34.420> one<00:01:34.600> you've<00:01:34.780> got<00:01:34.990> is<00:01:35.200> your<00:01:35.500> your

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
the next one you've got is your your

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.510 
the next one you've got is your your
right<00:01:36.010> hand<00:01:36.280> that's<00:01:36.820> just<00:01:37.119> as<00:01:37.270> important<00:01:37.750> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
right hand that's just as important and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.780 
right hand that's just as important and
that<00:01:39.520> one<00:01:39.790> is<00:01:40.210> actually<00:01:41.130> stopping<00:01:42.130> strings

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
that one is actually stopping strings

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.910 
that one is actually stopping strings
ringing<00:01:43.090> out<00:01:43.300> when<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.110> don't<00:01:44.320> want<00:01:44.530> them<00:01:44.680> so

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
ringing out when you don't want them so

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.219 
ringing out when you don't want them so
again<00:01:45.490> if<00:01:46.150> we<00:01:46.240> play<00:01:46.450> something<00:01:46.720> over<00:01:47.020> two

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
again if we play something over two

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.149 
again if we play something over two
strings<00:01:48.780> these<00:01:49.780> these<00:01:50.290> two<00:01:50.350> fingers<00:01:50.830> will

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
strings these these two fingers will

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:05.539 
strings these these two fingers will
stay<00:01:51.659> touching<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.810> top<00:01:52.990> two<00:01:53.200> strings

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.800 

it's<00:02:06.539> a<00:02:06.630> good<00:02:06.810> one

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 

to<00:02:10.440> show<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> about<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.580> open

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
to show that see you about this open

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.600 
to show that see you about this open
second<00:02:12.480> string

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:27.160 

on<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.210> second<00:02:17.540> string<00:02:19.180> fret<00:02:21.430> fifth<00:02:22.430> fret<00:02:26.170> in

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
on the second string fret fifth fret in

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:39.060 
on the second string fret fifth fret in
between

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.880 

we<00:02:40.070> don't<00:02:40.280> do<00:02:40.490> it<00:02:41.200> then<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.230> get<00:02:42.590> quite<00:02:42.860> a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
we don't do it then you get quite a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.950 
we don't do it then you get quite a
little<00:02:43.100> excess<00:02:43.460> noise<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.750> don't

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
little excess noise that you don't

00:02:44.960 --> 00:03:08.010 
little excess noise that you don't
really<00:02:45.140> want<00:02:49.810> if<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.960> want<00:02:51.200> clean<00:02:51.470> lines

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
presumably you do you've got to get the

presumably you do you've got to get the
mutant<00:03:11.660> thing<00:03:11.840> at<00:03:11.990> me

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
mutant thing at me

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.290 
mutant thing at me
there<00:03:12.650> are<00:03:12.740> those<00:03:13.070> two<00:03:13.310> things<00:03:13.490> mutant<00:03:14.180> with

there are those two things mutant with
you<00:03:14.390> right<00:03:14.600> mutant<00:03:15.080> with<00:03:15.200> your<00:03:15.320> left<00:03:15.580> okay

you right mutant with your left okay

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.130 
you right mutant with your left okay
right<00:03:16.850> there's<00:03:17.060> no<00:03:17.150> probably<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.690> two<00:03:17.870> things

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
right there's no probably to two things

the ring finger just follows the bar

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.390 
the ring finger just follows the bar
around<00:03:23.230> making<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.320> nice<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.500> smooth<00:03:24.920> over

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.220 
thing is that aren't doing anything are
just<00:03:37.430> sitting<00:03:37.700> there<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.570> string<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.870> mute

out any excess noise hopefully giving

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.760 
out any excess noise hopefully giving
you<00:03:42.230> some<00:03:42.380> nice<00:03:42.590> clean<00:03:43.270> nice<00:03:44.270> lines<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:45.230> that

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
you some nice clean nice lines and that

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.070 
you some nice clean nice lines and that
line<00:03:46.010> we<00:03:46.190> played<00:03:49.270> certainly<00:03:50.270> benefits<00:03:50.810> from

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
line we played certainly benefits from

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.800 
line we played certainly benefits from
that<00:03:51.350> muting<00:03:52.070> thing<00:03:52.280> with<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.550> right<00:03:52.730> hand

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
that muting thing with the right hand

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.570 
that muting thing with the right hand
why<00:03:54.470> should<00:03:54.709> mention<00:03:54.920> is<00:03:55.130> that<00:03:55.160> there<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.550> a

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
why should mention is that there is a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.490 
why should mention is that there is a
hammer<00:03:55.940> on<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.480> purring<00:03:56.750> happening<00:03:57.290> down<00:03:57.470> here

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
hammer on a purring happening down here

hammer on a purring happening down here
just<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.430> same<00:03:58.459> as<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.880> would<00:03:59.030> do<00:03:59.180> on<00:03:59.209> an

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
just the same as you would do on an

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.699 
just the same as you would do on an
electric<00:03:59.750> guitar<00:03:59.990> you<00:04:00.170> could<00:04:00.350> do<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.560> with

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
electric guitar you could do that with

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.370 
electric guitar you could do that with
the<00:04:00.770> slide<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:02.510> where<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.810> pick<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.140> string

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
the slide is where you pick the string

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.420 
the slide is where you pick the string
just<00:04:03.560> once<00:04:03.830> open<00:04:04.610> second<00:04:04.970> string<00:04:05.920> then<00:04:06.920> our<00:04:07.100> on

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
just once open second string then our on

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.920 
just once open second string then our on
the<00:04:07.459> slide<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.330> third<00:04:08.570> fret

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
the slide to the third fret

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:20.499 
the slide to the third fret
okay<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.799> same<00:04:11.950> time<00:04:12.159> coming<00:04:12.400> down<00:04:12.459> my<00:04:12.730> mute

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:27.210 

tell<00:04:21.509> me

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.409 

Oh

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.540 

okay<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:30.750> there's<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.020> little<00:04:31.199> light<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:32.400> next

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
okay so there's a little light the next

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.210 
okay so there's a little light the next
most<00:04:33.240> important<00:04:33.780> thing<00:04:33.990> about<00:04:34.650> playing

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
most important thing about playing

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.520 
most important thing about playing
something<00:04:35.520> like<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:35.940> is<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.990> introduce<00:04:37.110> some

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
something like this is to introduce some

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.930 
something like this is to introduce some
base<00:04:37.740> motion<00:04:38.280> because<00:04:38.460> you're<00:04:38.580> not<00:04:38.699> really

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
base motion because you're not really

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.140 
base motion because you're not really
going<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.210> be<00:04:39.440> strumming<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:41.160> strings<00:04:41.580> much

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
going to be strumming the strings much

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.030 
going to be strumming the strings much
many<00:04:42.600> playing<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:43.020> this<00:04:43.470> style<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:43.979> not

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
many playing this this style it's not

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.250 
many playing this this style it's not
that<00:04:44.280> doesn't<00:04:44.430> really<00:04:44.639> work<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.090> way<00:04:45.419> so

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
that doesn't really work that way so

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.629 
that doesn't really work that way so
you've<00:04:46.410> got<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> bit<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:47.010> independence<00:04:47.550> between

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
you've got a bit of independence between

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.520 
you've got a bit of independence between
your<00:04:47.850> thumb<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.060> fingers<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:49.260> do<00:04:49.410> that

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
your thumb and fingers and to do that

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.159 
your thumb and fingers and to do that
you<00:04:49.710> need<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.889> be<00:04:50.070> able<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.280> pick<00:04:50.720> in<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.930> kind

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
you need to be able to pick in that kind

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.390 
you need to be able to pick in that kind
of<00:04:52.229> stylus<00:04:52.710> or<00:04:52.860> mild<00:04:53.130> Travis<00:04:54.919> picking<00:04:55.919> style

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
of stylus or mild Travis picking style

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.640 
of stylus or mild Travis picking style
alternate<00:04:57.030> thumb<00:04:57.240> in<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.479> bass<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:58.440> then

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
alternate thumb in the bass and then

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.040 
alternate thumb in the bass and then
we'll<00:04:58.919> add<00:04:59.100> real<00:04:59.850> some<00:05:00.210> depth<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.690> any<00:05:00.810> riff

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
we'll add real some depth to any riff

we'll add real some depth to any riff
that<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.320> play<00:05:01.560> because<00:05:02.370> you've<00:05:02.490> got

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
that you play because you've got

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.550 
that you play because you've got
something<00:05:02.910> going<00:05:03.030> on<00:05:03.120> underneath<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:04.290> can<00:05:04.470> be

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
something going on underneath it can be

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.200 
something going on underneath it can be
just<00:05:04.770> three<00:05:04.919> notes<00:05:05.100> like<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.550> is<00:05:05.639> here<00:05:05.880> some

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
just three notes like it is here some

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
faith in this texture through now it'll

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:33.400 
faith in this texture through now it'll
be<00:05:09.060> fine<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.600> we'll<00:05:09.690> play<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.080> riff<00:05:10.320> we<00:05:11.040> did

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:41.960 

there<00:05:34.410> was<00:05:39.710> and<00:05:40.710> that's<00:05:40.889> it<00:05:41.160> really<00:05:41.280> really

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
there was and that's it really really

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.060 
there was and that's it really really
slow<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.479> what<00:05:42.630> would<00:05:43.020> advisor<00:05:43.410> do<00:05:43.710> is<00:05:43.860> just

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
slow and what would advisor do is just

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.120 
slow and what would advisor do is just
play<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.430> over<00:05:45.060> over<00:05:45.360> over<00:05:46.169> again<00:05:46.590> until

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
play that over over over again until

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.090 
play that over over over again until
you've<00:05:47.310> got<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.580> groove<00:05:47.850> really<00:05:48.449> swinging

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100
