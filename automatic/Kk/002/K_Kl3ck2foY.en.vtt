00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
have a duo cavity more the way that it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.520 
have a duo cavity more the way that it
works<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.420> four<00:00:57.420> parts<00:00:57.720> you<00:00:58.200> start

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
works is we have four parts you start

works is we have four parts you start
with<00:00:58.770> three<00:00:59.340> parts<00:01:00.500> put<00:01:01.500> them<00:01:01.680> together<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
with three parts put them together this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.729

works<00:01:03.329> together<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.589> see

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
works together like this and you can see

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.240 
works together like this and you can see
there's<00:01:04.949> two<00:01:05.009> pins<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.329> one<00:01:06.659> came<00:01:06.960> here

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
there's two pins here and one came here

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.469 
there's two pins here and one came here
so<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.520> light<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.909> perfectly<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.900> match<00:01:11.479> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
so it's light in perfectly to match and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
so it's light in perfectly to match and
they<00:01:12.960> mold<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.350> place<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:15.350> then<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.800> you<00:01:16.920> do

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
they mold in place and then what you do

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.980 
they mold in place and then what you do
is<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.490> start<00:01:18.030> by<00:01:18.180> filling<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:20.990> exterior

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

is you start by filling in the exterior
diameter<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.370> dual<00:01:23.580> core<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:25.979> do

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
diameter of the dual core and you can do

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.940 
diameter of the dual core and you can do
it<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.580> by<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.780> some<00:01:28.020> melted<00:01:28.470> lipstick

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
lip here you come back in and you scrape

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.320 
lip here you come back in and you scrape
out<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> excess<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.640> something<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.299> a
