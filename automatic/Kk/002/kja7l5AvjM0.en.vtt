00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.759
 I greet everyone with you Pavel Strona and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.050
 today we talk about typing 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.150
 voice means it can be done on in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.219
 principle any devices under android 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 this can be done on tablets on 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:22.080
 smartphones now I will do it on 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:29.660
 smartphone means we need to do this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.660
 will the internet connect now so 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:40.590
 Here he found the Internet is for this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.440
 need to have on your device 2 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.000
 applets 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.300
 the fact is that now 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 there are almost no programs 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.100
 that could cognize the human 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.420
 voice and quality transform it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.590
 convert it to text 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 but local programs to install on 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.059
 device 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.159
 but fortunately it learned to do google 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.549
 it was implemented by them for voice 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.820
 search on your device should be 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.909
 installed voice search from google and 2 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.979
 speech, I choose it and I offer 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.580
 speak 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.090
 once in a cold winter time i am from the forest 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.659
 released 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:38.070
 It was bitter cold all my software is 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.020
 wrote click continue i'm talking 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
 I look at individual sentences 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:50.420
 rises slowly uphill horse 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:54.360
 carrying tail 8 recognizes we continue and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.939

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.860
 I get basically normal text 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.300
 which I did not type on the keyboard 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.310
 which I said in a voice but the only thing 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.140
 that the program itself does not arrange characters 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.540
 punctuation will need to do 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.459
