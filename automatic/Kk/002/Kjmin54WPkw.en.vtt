alright<00:00:01.530> well<00:00:01.770> I'm<00:00:01.890> doing<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.340> review<00:00:03.259> small

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
alright well I'm doing this review small

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.170 
alright well I'm doing this review small
kind<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.529> review<00:00:04.890> are<00:00:05.279> not<00:00:05.520> review<00:00:05.879> but<00:00:06.029> in<00:00:06.150> a

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
kind of review are not review but in a

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.950 
kind of review are not review but in a
box<00:00:06.779> opening<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.730> my<00:00:08.730> new<00:00:08.760> amplifier<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.929> I

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
box opening of my new amplifier that I

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.860 
box opening of my new amplifier that I
got<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:11.090> weighted<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> minute

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
got it's weighted this for a minute

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.400 
got it's weighted this for a minute
to<00:00:13.590> get<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.130> found<00:00:14.670> picked<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.030> up<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
to get it and found picked it up it's a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:27.450 
to get it and found picked it up it's a
sound<00:00:16.800> string<00:00:18.199> and<00:00:20.029> it's<00:00:21.029> Picasso

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.740 

the<00:00:28.460> PCX<00:00:29.710> 1500<00:00:30.710> d<00:00:32.199> you<00:00:33.199> have<00:00:33.230> some<00:00:33.590> good<00:00:34.750> specs

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
the PCX 1500 d you have some good specs

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.280 
the PCX 1500 d you have some good specs
on<00:00:35.989> it<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.320> stuff<00:00:39.250> cooling<00:00:40.250> fan<00:00:41.050> MOSFET<00:00:42.050> power

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
on it and stuff cooling fan MOSFET power

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.079 
on it and stuff cooling fan MOSFET power
supply<00:00:42.769> bass<00:00:43.699> boost<00:00:44.089> and<00:00:44.890> ant<00:00:45.890> protection<00:00:46.489> and

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
supply bass boost and ant protection and

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.229 
supply bass boost and ant protection and
whatnot<00:00:48.670> that's<00:00:49.670> kind<00:00:49.909> of<00:00:49.940> funny<00:00:50.120> because

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
whatnot that's kind of funny because

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.420 
whatnot that's kind of funny because
I've<00:00:50.479> I<00:00:50.570> couldn't<00:00:51.350> wait<00:00:51.500> actually<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.370> I

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
I've I couldn't wait actually and I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.700 
I've I couldn't wait actually and I
already<00:00:52.670> opened<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:53.089> up<00:00:53.229> and<00:00:54.229> it's<00:00:54.470> sitting

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
already opened it up and it's sitting

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:15.850 
already opened it up and it's sitting
over<00:00:54.769> here<00:00:54.890> but<00:01:12.820> there<00:01:13.820> she<00:01:14.090> is

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
over here but there she is

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
over here but there she is
Picasso<00:01:16.760> sound<00:01:17.210> Street

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.290 

mucousy<00:01:31.680> has<00:01:31.890> these<00:01:32.070> ancap<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.880> make<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.150> all

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
mucousy has these ancap to make it all

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.000 
mucousy has these ancap to make it all
nice<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.690> clean<00:01:34.760> on<00:01:35.760> both<00:01:35.940> sides<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.950> you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
nice and clean on both sides if you

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.860 
nice and clean on both sides if you
could<00:01:38.220> read<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.700> says<00:01:38.730> kind<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.450> Picasso

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
could read that it says kind of Picasso

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.330 
could read that it says kind of Picasso
in<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:41.280> cost<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.120> I<00:01:42.800> like<00:01:43.800> hidden<00:01:44.070> it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
in there it cost so I like hidden it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:56.560 
in there it cost so I like hidden it's
kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.550> cool<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:50.700> has<00:01:53.660> all<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:55.350> four<00:01:56.160> gage

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
kind of cool it has all the four gage

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.230 
kind of cool it has all the four gage
connections<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.780> believed<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:59.240> can't

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
connections I believed in there I can't

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
connections I believed in there I can't
see<00:02:00.450> very<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.590> uh<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:06.470> has<00:02:07.470> all<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.130> ways

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
see very well but uh it has all the ways

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.889 
see very well but uh it has all the ways
you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.850> hook<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> up<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.420> you're<00:02:09.570> gonna<00:02:09.690> hook

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
you can hook it up if you're gonna hook

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.570 
you can hook it up if you're gonna hook
it<00:02:09.990> up<00:02:10.250> by<00:02:11.250> itself<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.190> single

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
it up by itself and just a single

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.290 
it up by itself and just a single
amplifier<00:02:19.220> there<00:02:20.220> or<00:02:20.550> if<00:02:20.760> you're<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> do

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
amplifier there or if you're going to do

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.430 
amplifier there or if you're going to do
dual<00:02:21.950> amplifiers<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.870> their<00:02:25.080> bridge

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
dual amplifiers for their bridge

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.100 
dual amplifiers for their bridge
together<00:02:26.070> for<00:02:26.850> one<00:02:27.060> sub<00:02:27.360> which<00:02:27.630> that's<00:02:27.900> what

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
together for one sub which that's what

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.260 
together for one sub which that's what
I'm<00:02:28.200> gonna<00:02:28.320> do<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:29.190> another<00:02:29.400> amplifier<00:02:29.730> that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
I'm gonna do have another amplifier that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.790 
I'm gonna do have another amplifier that
sounds<00:02:30.630> stream<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.020> I'm<00:02:31.110> gonna<00:02:31.200> hook<00:02:31.410> up<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
sounds stream that I'm gonna hook up to

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.030 
sounds stream that I'm gonna hook up to
and<00:02:36.380> apart<00:02:37.380> from<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:38.130> also<00:02:38.310> has<00:02:40.040> came

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
and apart from that it also has came

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.120 
and apart from that it also has came
with<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:42.000> leads<00:02:42.269> here<00:02:44.989> there<00:02:46.070> looks<00:02:47.070> like

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
with the the leads here there looks like

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.150 
with the the leads here there looks like
a<00:02:47.220> telephone<00:02:47.790> cord<00:02:48.150> kind<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.600> deal<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.160> it's

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
a telephone cord kind of deal but it's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.860 
a telephone cord kind of deal but it's
for<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.700> bass<00:02:50.880> boost<00:02:51.150> which<00:02:51.420> I'm<00:02:51.570> not<00:02:51.720> really

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
for the bass boost which I'm not really

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.210 
for the bass boost which I'm not really
going<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.200> use<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.800> already<00:02:53.070> have

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
going to use this one I already have

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.610 
going to use this one I already have
another<00:02:53.489> one<00:02:53.760> from<00:02:54.690> my<00:02:54.750> old<00:02:55.019> one<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.260> says

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
another one from my old one that says

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.140 
another one from my old one that says
you<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:55.860> only<00:02:56.720> use<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:57.750> other<00:02:58.170> one<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.940> bass

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
you can only use one other one the bass

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.400 
you can only use one other one the bass
boost<00:03:00.480> knob<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.230> here<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:05.480> also<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
boost knob is in here and I also have a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.600 
boost knob is in here and I also have a
manual

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
manual

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.940

soon stream yep and so most people don't
know<00:03:24.670> what<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.850> bass<00:03:25.030> knob<00:03:25.360> looks<00:03:25.660> like<00:03:25.840> I'll<00:03:26.050> go

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
know what a bass knob looks like I'll go

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.340 
know what a bass knob looks like I'll go
ahead<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.440> open

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:48.820 

oh<00:03:46.510> my<00:03:47.510> geez<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:47.870> one<00:03:48.080> doesn't<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.380> little<00:03:48.710> bit

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
oh my geez this one doesn't a little bit

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.310 
oh my geez this one doesn't a little bit
beefier<00:03:49.510> it's<00:03:50.510> pretty<00:03:50.810> too<00:03:52.600> more<00:03:53.600> depends<00:03:54.230> I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
beefier it's pretty too more depends I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.080 
beefier it's pretty too more depends I
don't<00:03:54.500> know
