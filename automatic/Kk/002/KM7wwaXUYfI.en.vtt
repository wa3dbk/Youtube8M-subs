00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.730
 parts of the digital camera 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.240
 first the internet 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.439
 It is one of the most important and fragile pieces 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:15.119
 from that place it will be sent to the use to the scene will photograph towards the 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.249
 camera sensors 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.099
 flacso 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.769
 allows you to shoot an artificial light to illuminate the scenes correctly 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.789
 his shot is caused by an electric shock inside a tube full of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.789
 Halogen gas is usually huge 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.800
 trigger 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.190
 is the one that will allow us to focus on a motive and take the photograph 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.480
 pixels 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.079
 usually in front of the camera 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.559
 we find the reference about the megapixel definition of the camera 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 5 viewer 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.310
 we can see the photograph to be taken directly from the viewer 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
 6 screen the sd 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.469
 from the screen we can also see the picture 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.539
 before making the inter inter of the final result 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.540
 7 panel controls 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.950
 they allow us to access the options menus 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.950
 8 distance reproduction mode 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 in digital cameras there are two modalities 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.870
 one to take the photo shoots and another to view the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.930
 stored photos 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.720
 generally we can move from one we save variety through a 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 small lever or motorcycle 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.510
 9 days of temuco 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.600
 allows to choose the automatic or personalized mode of photography 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
 10 power button turned off 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.700
 to turn on the camera 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.380
 most cameras have a configurable off-line adult system 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.840
 so as not to drain the batteries while the camera is not used 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.980
 11 speaker 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.409
 some cameras are able to reproduce the recorded sounds 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.409
 during a filming through a small speaker 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.729
 2 sum 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.729
 enlarges or reduces the focal length of the camera 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.069
 basically allows you to zoom in on the picture 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.299
 forget the image we see on the screen 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.629
 we will find two types 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.629
 analog sun and they are digital 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.109
 13 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.109
 connection vs by di bello 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.739
 to download the photos stored to a computer or viewed to the blackboard is 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.979
 directly on a TV 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.309
 14 compartment for batteries 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:48.129
 in this place the batteries that feed the camera are housed 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.839
 There are different types 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:51.710
 fifteen 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.809
 tripod support 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.589
 practically all compact digital cameras have a 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.659
 support for tripod installation 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:01.890
 16 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.339
 memory compartment 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.869
 in this place the memory is placed in where they will be stored 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.709
 photographic 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.549
 what is a camera reflex 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.060
 an SLR camera 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.089
 It is a photo machine in which the image that the photographer sees through the viewfinder 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.089
 is exactly the same as it will be captured 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:24.860
 this is achieved 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.860
 using a mirror system hence the name 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.480
 since what the observer sees through the viewer 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.700
 it is reflection of the image
