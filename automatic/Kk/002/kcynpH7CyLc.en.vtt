West and it is really long hair so that

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.279 
West and it is really long hair so that

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
class to class or I thought was that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.210 
class to class or I thought was that
worth<00:02:39.110> doing<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.500> lot<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.799> hands-on<00:02:40.160> stuff

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
worth doing a lot of hands-on stuff

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.309 
worth doing a lot of hands-on stuff
which<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.849> do<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.299> hair<00:02:41.480> would<00:02:41.690> tangle<00:02:41.989> in<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
which I do the hair would tangle in the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.449 
which I do the hair would tangle in the
nape<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.739> wasn't<00:02:43.010> something<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.310> I

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
nape but it wasn't something that I

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.339 
nape but it wasn't something that I
needed<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.879> like<00:02:44.030> carry<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.450> brush<00:02:44.720> around<00:02:45.049> for

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
needed to like carry a brush around for

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.970 
needed to like carry a brush around for
it<00:02:45.890> wasn't<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.489> know<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.879> that<00:02:47.660> bad

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
it wasn't you know that that bad

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.069 
it wasn't you know that that bad
as<00:02:49.220> far<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.459> holding<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.880> curl<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.480> hair<00:02:50.690> held<00:02:50.989> a

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
as far as holding a curl the hair held a

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.900 
as far as holding a curl the hair held a
curve<00:02:51.319> really<00:02:51.500> really<00:02:51.769> well<00:02:51.920> with<00:02:52.130> wand<00:02:52.700> curls

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
curve really really well with wand curls

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.330 
curve really really well with wand curls
like<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.209> stated<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.810> my<00:02:53.959> two-week<00:02:54.260> update<00:02:54.650> but

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
like I stated in my two-week update but

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.160 
like I stated in my two-week update but
for<00:02:55.610> some<00:02:55.760> reason<00:02:56.329> whatever<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.660> reason<00:02:56.959> is

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
for some reason whatever the reason is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.860 
for some reason whatever the reason is
the<00:02:57.440> hair<00:02:57.620> does<00:02:57.799> not<00:02:57.980> fall<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.310> curl<00:02:58.610> with<00:02:59.209> like

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
the hair does not fall to curl with like

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.050 
the hair does not fall to curl with like
a<00:02:59.900> curling<00:03:00.230> iron<00:03:00.410> or<00:03:00.590> flat<00:03:00.680> iron<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.459> curls

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
a curling iron or flat iron the curls

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.850 
a curling iron or flat iron the curls
would<00:03:02.239> drop<00:03:02.510> within<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:03.049> five<00:03:03.319> minutes<00:03:03.560> so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
would drop within like five minutes so

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.259 
would drop within like five minutes so
that's<00:03:04.040> why<00:03:04.160> I've<00:03:04.280> been<00:03:04.400> wearing<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:05.090> hair

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
that's why I've been wearing the hair

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.850 
that's why I've been wearing the hair
straight<00:03:05.569> for<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.840> past<00:03:06.049> two<00:03:06.260> weeks<00:03:06.290> because

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
straight for the past two weeks because

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.280 
straight for the past two weeks because
it<00:03:07.340> just<00:03:07.790> didn't<00:03:08.120> really<00:03:08.420> make<00:03:08.569> any<00:03:08.720> sense<00:03:08.870> to

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
it just didn't really make any sense to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.140 
it just didn't really make any sense to
curl<00:03:09.500> hair<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:10.010> wasn't<00:03:10.340> gonna<00:03:10.430> stay<00:03:10.730> curled

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
curl hair that wasn't gonna stay curled

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.140 
curl hair that wasn't gonna stay curled
but<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.260> hair<00:03:12.440> also<00:03:12.650> did<00:03:12.980> straighten<00:03:13.910> really

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
but the hair also did straighten really

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.809 
but the hair also did straighten really
really<00:03:14.390> well<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:16.069> hair<00:03:16.220> straightened<00:03:16.579> really

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
really well the hair straightened really

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.759 
really well the hair straightened really
really<00:03:17.150> really<00:03:17.690> well<00:03:17.870> for<00:03:17.900> body<00:03:18.379> wave<00:03:18.590> hair

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
really really well for body wave hair

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.140 
really really well for body wave hair
and<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.040> feel<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.370> this<00:03:19.519> hair<00:03:19.670> was<00:03:19.790> more<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.060> a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and I feel like this hair was more of a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.020 
and I feel like this hair was more of a
loose<00:03:20.329> leave<00:03:20.540> because<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.500> was<00:03:21.829> real<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.519> did

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
loose leave because it was real it did

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.090 
loose leave because it was real it did
instead<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.840> just<00:03:23.989> like<00:03:24.139> a<00:03:24.170> body<00:03:24.470> wave<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.920> did

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
instead of just like a body wave it did

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.449 
instead of just like a body wave it did
have<00:03:25.280> some<00:03:25.489> curl<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.750> um<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:28.220> was

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
have some curl to it and um I was

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.500

surprised<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.880> hair<00:03:29.030> straighten<00:03:29.389> as

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
surprised that the hair straighten as

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
I said I've been flat ironing hair and

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.680 
I said I've been flat ironing hair and
sometimes<00:03:46.519> when<00:03:46.819> you<00:03:46.880> flat<00:03:47.060> iron<00:03:47.090> hair<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.480> lot

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
sometimes when you flat iron hair a lot

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.839 
sometimes when you flat iron hair a lot
you<00:03:48.260> lose<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.709> curl<00:03:48.889> pattern<00:03:48.919> or<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.549> does<00:03:49.669> not

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
you lose the curl pattern or it does not

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.940 
you lose the curl pattern or it does not
curled<00:03:50.150> up<00:03:50.269> like<00:03:50.299> it<00:03:50.569> did<00:03:50.599> when<00:03:51.349> you<00:03:51.530> first<00:03:51.739> got

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
curled up like it did when you first got

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.800 
curled up like it did when you first got
it<00:03:52.099> in<00:03:52.190> its<00:03:52.340> natural<00:03:52.489> state<00:03:52.700> but<00:03:53.090> every<00:03:53.599> time<00:03:53.750> I

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
it in its natural state but every time I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.960 
it in its natural state but every time I
wash<00:03:54.079> this<00:03:54.290> hair<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.799> let<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.400> dry<00:03:55.669> I<00:03:55.700> would

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
wash this hair and let it dry I would

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.089 
wash this hair and let it dry I would
wear<00:03:56.359> it<00:03:56.389> that<00:03:56.690> way<00:03:56.870> because<00:03:57.079> it<00:03:57.560> curled<00:03:57.919> back

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
wear it that way because it curled back

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.129 
wear it that way because it curled back
up<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.459> it<00:03:58.549> dried<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.060> beautifully<00:03:59.660> like<00:03:59.690> nice

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139

Beach<00:04:00.500> wavy<00:04:00.950> curls<00:04:01.489> so<00:04:02.299> that's<00:04:02.599> what<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.870> really

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109
