00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.600
 nowadays video games are 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.429
 getting graphics I did not want 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.719
 imagine it is clear that as the graphics and 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.599
 sound also evolves 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.610
 now we have a stereo round in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.289
 of the game we can define which side 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 sound is coming y'know so you can 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.699
 protect yourself in case of an attack or 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 You can help your friend with more 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.430
 speed if it is a cooperative game and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.779
 scepter 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.519
 but it was not always so and when the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.830
 Next let's go back there in the temple 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.510
 16-bit in the 90's to remember 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
 as it was the sound of the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 video game as it influenced our 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 culture nerd binds 4 cut cuts looks 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.610
 champion production champion 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.920
 look only the games up to 16 bits of a sound 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.050
 very precarious then they wanted to pass 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.239
 sound information for people but for the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.059
 original precariousness of the graphics 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.250
 sounds but the box that is also good 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.570
 precarious the sound would come in another way 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 our ears we would listen 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.320
 another thing that had nothing to do with 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.359
 that cordless phone started 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.160
 with paçoca and finished with padoca and 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.809
 still the old man travels with me if we 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.489
 examples there very well at the time 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.400
 climbing the old are there and want 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.299
 know who remembers the mimi taxi as 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.119
 You could see that we 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.979
 we called the blows and the narrations 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.960
 by the names we listened to did not 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.920
 what they were talking about and inside the street 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:30.720
 fighter also had the cloud also the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:33.600
 father who is fruit italy robocop alex south 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.869
 I left with grease or some spoke out 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.869
 for free 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:45.689
 technical fábio already had a website or e 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.860
 they had also left the cup delicious 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.860
 had hana and 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.869
 like Johnny the guy was with the 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.759
 The ball was stolen, it was dead. 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.140
 arrival and when the ball out in the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.210
 goalkeeper exit 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.610
 and if you will remember you put 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.080
 I judged one video game appeared there and another 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.630
 and sports 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.370
 I played and it's a sport that there are few 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.650
 examples of the many nicknames that we 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.060
 the names of the blows or new 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.040
 narratives right 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.750
 the games that we played because the sound 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.940
 it was bad if you identified yourself 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.320
 liked and remembers someone who does not 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.450
