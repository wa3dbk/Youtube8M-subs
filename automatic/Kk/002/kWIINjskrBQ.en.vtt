00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 as I was in science and the girl in the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.089
 Fortune of the draws of the clover and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.460
 while they know the new girl wins 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.530
 goal to all my friends win goleros them 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.570
 I will be giving suggestions so that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.599
 they can put their pools 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.680
 this is the 148 I hope you serve them my 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.770
 comments ok 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.689
 so the group was already defined 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.880
 and they will play the quarterfinals 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.550
 toluca was as leader in general 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.189
 we also have the final phase of the league 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.500
 of promotion mx and also participation 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 of Mexicans in europe so 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 we started with the first locker of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.239
 this quiniela 148 match 1 match 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.879
 return of the liguilla the Toluca leader 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.270
 bonbon receiving the Bombonera 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.539
 the chivas of guadalajara híjole good 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.489
 toluca is burning it did not lose the eight 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.770
 matches he played in his own stadium 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.510
 so he will try to keep this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.420
 positive streak that brings dragging and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.829
 that has worked super well 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.780
 will face some chivas that go to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.090
 need to be concentrated the 90s 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.370
 minutes that the game lasts because if not 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.310
 they are the clown 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.870
 literal because with just gave chance and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.330
 well the two minutes already have a 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.490
 score of 2 0 losing chivas 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.980
 obviously that's good there as I already 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.020
 It started to go pretty bad I did not really 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.080
 I think he loses the toluca so we 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.260
 we go for a local match us another 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.500
 Dueling quarterfinals are 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.660
 alone against the striped of the monterrey 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.790
 this confrontation is already historic 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.070
 the 2012 closing tournament will 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.920
 they faced in this same instance and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.400
 grated came out victorious with a marker 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.890
 of 4-3 global say that revenge is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.940
 bad is sweeter let's see if here 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.740
 apply and see if tijuana if you just went down 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.140
 a little bit of the guard and there they go 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.730
 the striped of the monterrey but who 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.060
 you know I do it a little bit complicated 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.980
 so we go for the local team 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.680
 match 3 another league duel the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.110
 newly promoted lion receives the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.600
 cemetery blue cross machine 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.860
 come I think that the party that is going to 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.080
 see here in lion will be very good 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.020
 the two teams will give everything 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.330
 another duel with him is on his side 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.390
 history because blue cross is champion or by 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.360
 last time in 1997 precisely playing 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.310
 before the lyon both technicians like 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.410
 play off the side of the offensive so 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.950
 it's going to be a round-trip duel 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.980
 die in the tournament both tied a 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.020
 goal in the blue so better not to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.170
 take risks if it was a little further 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.470
 let's go let's go with a triple then 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.420
 match 4 of return of the group in the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.150
 america the eagles receive the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.880
 monarchy one duel between two teams 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.680
 They are bringing the school as lavolpista 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.959
 Miguel Herrera of the Eagles and Rubén 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.959
 roman omar of the morelia tend to play 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.930
 with that style let's see if christian 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.630
 benitez passes and can stop and can 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.970
 mark but on the other side was 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.920
 also who closed in good shape 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.860
 the best Mexican goal scorer with eight 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.350
 so many so this is going to be very close 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.590
 a very close duel therefore 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.710
 attention as I go to a double 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.890
 local and visitor match 5 in the league 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.290
 of climb the wolves uap 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.420
 poor things to the merida of truth that 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.260
 the uap wolves have a good test 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.080
 hard have been playing 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.010
 wrong 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.750
 and I really do not see anything anything that 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.570
 they are going to enter him as well as with all 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.360
 the kilos in this game lost the 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.980
 first leg by 3-0 and additional this 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.930
 released the dismissal of his 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.360
 technical director sergio orduña what 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.870
 can hurt the team even more 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.210
 so wolves uap of my people and others 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.660
 but I think they're going down so 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.830
 so much I go with the visiting team 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.920
 match 6 also in the league of promotion 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.650
 Tecos students to pity the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.570
 tecos from the hand of the pony ruiz go to 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.700
 be able to take advantage of closing your 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.240
 stadium since they arrive with a minimum 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.270
 2-1 advantage so the 1 with the 10 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.600
 already go through the goal of visitor so 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.340
 we go by the local team on 7 the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.100
 last match of our league of 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.410
 climb the table bulls face 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.390
 the golds in the first leg 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.090
 golden ones got the minimum advantage that 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.310
 it was 1-0 with a goal from cuauhtémoc 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.200
 white you also have to remember that the 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.910
 Golds were proclaimed champions with the 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.250
 copa mx 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.040
 front they will attend a month to that alone 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.080
 is below the necaxa in the table and 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.480
 he only lost two games in the league 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.060
 will be very quarreled but to score 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.430
 Golden Visits would complicate the 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.960
 things in that therefore I believe that 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.660
 the two are going to give a good game and we 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.370
 let's go with the match 8 in the league 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.990
 Spanish the saved valence is 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.200
 faces Espanyol by Héctor Moreno 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.610
 are the two Mexicans there in Europe 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.650
 the European leagues that are going to 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.440
 face the valencià saved comes 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.390
 playing better not so the Spanish that 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.120
 lost to the last the league osasuna the 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.770
 last day on this occasion I think that 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.980
 the cheers are going to win so we're going 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.690
 by a local winner match 9 other than 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.740
 the Spanish league the realsociety of 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.750
 carlos vela receives the thunderbolt vallecano 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.420
 only three air points unlike 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.620
 in what the vallecano leads to the real 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.030
 society so it's going to be something strong the 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.730
 local party I believe so the 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.860
 carlos vela team should come out with 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.350
 three points and I think they're going to 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.280
 achieve we give local team match to 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.400
 day is the apprentice 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.500
 of the classic London arsenal receives the 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.260
 tottenham good this gets crazy 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.010
 we know that england all london is 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:53.590
 paralyze to see this this encounter 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.790
 so the party in the English capital 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.970
 and the last time they met 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.460
 They were at the Emirates Stadium Arsenal 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.260
 thrashed 5 to 2 to the spurs there is difference 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.410
 of a point in the table in favor of 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:09.760
 tottenham and they do not usually tie but for 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:12.640
 do not miss it we go for double room and 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.820
 visitor has now split 11 in the 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.060
 calcium the leader the juventus will receive 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.340
 to lazio so much attention because 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.830
 the juve came unbeaten until the inter 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.710
 he lowered it from his cloud and took it off and goes 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.350
 all well but he fell a little good 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.540
 there won the Roman classic 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.240
 it will definitely be a match that is going to 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.090
 take sparks but juventus is going to be what 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.130
 that is to defend the locality so 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.350
 we go for the last local team 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.960
 match the number 12 other of calcium 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.780
 Italian we continue with the European leagues 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.860
 you receive the milan milan are still not 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.810
 the unbeatable team that was still like that with 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.330
 his thirteenth place he has in the 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.060
 table was already confirmed its technical director 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.639
 edison cavani Uruguayan striker 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.039
 napoles coming from scoring four 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:06.069
 so many in a match I think the Milan 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:08.590
 going to lose again so we 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.120
 let's go around the place and remember that 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.340
 also for only five more pesitos 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.039
 can participate with millionaire goal yo 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.490
 I predict for this pool that they are 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:21.130
 that beats them according to me more are rings 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.750
 about 33 goals hopefully this data 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.669
 and win goals has many surprises 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.789
 apart they can put their pools 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:29.710
 through the internet www.goal.com x 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:32.349
 also be very pending because 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.810
 soon very soon winner has them a 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:37.349
 great surprise very much luck to all and 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.349
 until next time
