stand plate from tilt now this works

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.630 
stand plate from tilt now this works
with<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.150> Qi<00:00:26.420> wireless<00:00:27.109> technology<00:00:27.920> so<00:00:28.160> this

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
with the Qi wireless technology so this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.669 
with the Qi wireless technology so this
will<00:00:28.820> charge<00:00:29.119> a<00:00:29.330> lot<00:00:29.510> of<00:00:29.630> devices<00:00:30.109> up<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.560> a

simple stand comes with a charging

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.740 
simple stand comes with a charging
adapter<00:00:46.789> so<00:00:46.850> it<00:00:46.910> hasn't<00:00:47.059> adapted<00:00:47.329> what<00:00:47.660> you

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
adapter so it hasn't adapted what you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.650 
adapter so it hasn't adapted what you
plug<00:00:48.020> in<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:48.500> then<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:49.280> course<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:49.579> plug<00:00:49.910> the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
plug in and then of course you plug the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.410 
plug in and then of course you plug the
the<00:00:51.410> base<00:00:51.620> units<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.370> adapter<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.000> then

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
the base units to the adapter and then

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.240 
the base units to the adapter and then
there's<00:00:53.660> an<00:00:53.809> LED<00:00:54.260> indicator<00:00:54.620> at<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.860> bottom

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
there's an LED indicator at the bottom

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.869 
there's an LED indicator at the bottom
which<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:55.930> kind<00:00:56.930> of<00:00:57.110> not<00:00:57.350> too<00:00:57.620> useful<00:00:57.879> it's

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
which is kind of not too useful it's

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.240 
which is kind of not too useful it's
hard<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.300> see<00:00:59.570> but<00:00:59.809> it<00:01:00.109> will<00:01:00.500> flash<00:01:00.829> if<00:01:01.100> it's

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
hard to see but it will flash if it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.490 
hard to see but it will flash if it's
charging<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:02.449> can<00:01:02.600> check<00:01:02.809> for<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:03.170> charge

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
charging now you can check for a charge

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.289 
charging now you can check for a charge
numerous<00:01:04.100> devices<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:04.729> we<00:01:04.820> can<00:01:04.940> charge<00:01:05.149> a

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
numerous devices so we can charge a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.230 
numerous devices so we can charge a
