00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this tattoo when I just thought you know

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.470 
this tattoo when I just thought you know
why<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:35.190> didn't<00:00:35.489> reach<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.760> challenge

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
why not we didn't reach the challenge

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
why not we didn't reach the challenge
which<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.989> 100,000<00:00:37.950> subscribers<00:00:38.370> within
