00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.789 
really gets good but all I can say is
that<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> circumstances<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.350> he<00:02:04.530> goes

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
say maybe a light pencil sketch meets

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.220 
say maybe a light pencil sketch meets
watercolor<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.620> certainly<00:02:38.950> gives<00:02:39.460> Maison

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
animations that do look similar to this

animations that do look similar to this
one<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:48.490> only<00:02:48.700> real<00:02:48.850> negative<00:02:49.090> thing<00:02:49.600> I<00:02:49.690> can

one the only real negative thing I can

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.900 
one the only real negative thing I can
say<00:02:50.050> about<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:50.860> if<00:02:51.460> you're<00:02:51.700> not<00:02:51.730> a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
say about this is that if you're not a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.640 
say about this is that if you're not a
fan<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.740> drama<00:02:53.740> then<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:54.760> may<00:02:55.000> not<00:02:55.300> find<00:02:56.050> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
fan of drama then you may not find the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.830 
fan of drama then you may not find the
maze<00:02:56.800> on<00:02:56.980> empathy<00:02:57.370> cubes<00:02:57.700> particularly<00:02:58.690> as

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
maze on empathy cubes particularly as

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.690 
maze on empathy cubes particularly as
enjoyable<00:02:59.200> as<00:02:59.320> others<00:02:59.830> because<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.340> does<00:03:00.490> have

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
enjoyable as others because it does have

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.270 
enjoyable as others because it does have
a<00:03:00.730> little<00:03:01.030> bit<00:03:01.210> heavy<00:03:01.500> heavier<00:03:02.500> drama<00:03:02.830> moments

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
a little bit heavy heavier drama moments

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.190 
a little bit heavy heavier drama moments
to<00:03:03.460> it<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.000> still<00:03:04.330> think<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.780> should<00:03:04.810> check

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
to it but I still think you should check

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.230 
to it but I still think you should check
it<00:03:05.350> out<00:03:05.410> anyway<00:03:05.620> because<00:03:06.490> I<00:03:06.520> mean<00:03:06.760> it's<00:03:06.970> only

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
it out anyway because I mean it's only

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.960 
it out anyway because I mean it's only
roughly<00:03:07.840> over<00:03:08.140> 10<00:03:08.410> minutes<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.430> know<00:03:09.730> even

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
roughly over 10 minutes so you know even

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.340 
roughly over 10 minutes so you know even
if<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.180> don't<00:03:10.390> like<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.750> there's<00:03:10.960> really<00:03:11.110> no

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
if you don't like it there's really no

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.780 
if you don't like it there's really no
reason<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.800> feel<00:03:11.950> like<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.190> wasted<00:03:12.340> your<00:03:12.640> time

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
reason to feel like you wasted your time

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.570 
reason to feel like you wasted your time
with<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.060> either<00:03:13.270> so<00:03:14.080> anyway<00:03:14.500> if<00:03:15.400> you're

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
with it either so anyway if you're

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.430 
with it either so anyway if you're
looking<00:03:15.820> for<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.030> very<00:03:16.180> touching<00:03:16.690> film<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
looking for a very touching film and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.440 
looking for a very touching film and
you've<00:03:17.860> only<00:03:18.040> got<00:03:18.310> about<00:03:18.460> you<00:03:18.910> know<00:03:19.030> ten

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
you've only got about you know ten

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.240 
you've only got about you know ten
minutes<00:03:19.750> or<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:19.900> despair<00:03:20.470> then<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:20.980> highly

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
minutes or so despair then I highly

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.690 
minutes or so despair then I highly
recommend<00:03:21.280> giving<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:22.210> a<00:03:22.570> try
