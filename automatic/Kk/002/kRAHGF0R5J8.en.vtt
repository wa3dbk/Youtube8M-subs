00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
for years but this tent that what they

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.890 
for years but this tent that what they
did<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.770> they<00:03:17.800> created<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.610> bar<00:03:18.850> system<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:19.810> you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
did is they created a bar system so you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.100 
did is they created a bar system so you
don't<00:03:20.050> have<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.260> sag<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.280> basically<00:03:21.820> you<00:03:22.720> hold

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
don't have to sag so basically you hold

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.290 
don't have to sag so basically you hold
yourself<00:03:23.230> up<00:03:23.530> going<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.770> try<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:23.980> no<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:25.060> try

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
yourself up going to try it no you try

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.340 
yourself up going to try it no you try
no<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.320> tried<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:27.070> tried<00:03:27.250> if<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:27.640> fall<00:03:27.910> oh

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350

no you tried you tried if I fall oh
alright<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.160> idea<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:32.590> go<00:03:32.830> in<00:03:33.040> here<00:03:33.220> we
