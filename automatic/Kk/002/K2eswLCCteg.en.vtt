00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.899 
already know he's a badass a complete
badass<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.640> sort<00:01:47.759> of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
badass and I was actually sort of

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.210 
badass and I was actually sort of
thinking<00:01:48.180> um<00:01:48.409> because<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.649> issue<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:50.070> see

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
thinking um because in this issue we see

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
thinking um because in this issue we see
store<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> dark<00:01:51.479> cave<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
store going to dark cave and kind of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.730 
store going to dark cave and kind of
like<00:01:52.409> throughout<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.659> media<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:55.259> Star<00:01:55.560> Wars

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
like throughout a media like Star Wars

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
like throughout a media like Star Wars
for<00:01:55.920> example<00:01:56.280> when<00:01:56.399> Luke<00:01:56.549> Skywalker<00:01:57.000> goes<00:01:57.479> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
for example when Luke Skywalker goes and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.240 
for example when Luke Skywalker goes and
did<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> dark<00:01:58.110> cave<00:01:58.439> he<00:01:58.890> almost<00:01:59.130> has<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
did the dark cave he almost has to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.670 
did the dark cave he almost has to
confront<00:01:59.610> him<00:01:59.909> himself<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.530> his

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
confront him himself you know like his

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.010 
confront him himself you know like his
inner<00:02:01.950> darkness<00:02:02.340> mm-hmm<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.869> thinking

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
inner darkness mm-hmm so I was thinking

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
inner darkness mm-hmm so I was thinking
maybe<00:02:04.259> Gore<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.680> god<00:02:04.920> butcher<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.520> actually

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
maybe Gore the god butcher is actually

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.919 
maybe Gore the god butcher is actually
the<00:02:06.270> dark<00:02:06.600> side<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> Thor<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.220> why

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
the dark side of Thor and that is why

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.839 
the dark side of Thor and that is why
the<00:02:09.929> god<00:02:10.110> butcher<00:02:10.289> doesn't<00:02:10.709> kill<00:02:11.129> him<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.489> guess

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the god butcher doesn't kill him I guess

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.760 
the god butcher doesn't kill him I guess
that'd<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.569> an<00:02:12.629> interesting<00:02:12.930> thing<00:02:13.349> because

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that'd be an interesting thing because

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.010 
that'd be an interesting thing because
is<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.070> shadow<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.790> way<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.420> way<00:02:15.540> he<00:02:15.720> acts

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
is like a shadow the way the way he acts

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.440 
is like a shadow the way the way he acts
and<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:17.010> way<00:02:17.400> he<00:02:17.550> fights<00:02:17.790> he's<00:02:18.060> all<00:02:18.270> these

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and the way he fights he's all these

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.450 
and the way he fights he's all these
tendrils<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.170> shadowy<00:02:19.740> things<00:02:20.070> coming<00:02:20.370> out

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
tendrils and shadowy things coming out

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.820 
tendrils and shadowy things coming out
of<00:02:20.520> them<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.910> even<00:02:21.540> his<00:02:21.930> name<00:02:22.170> sort<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.560> sounds

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
of them and even his name sort of sounds

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.400 
of them and even his name sort of sounds
familiar<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.220> Gore<00:02:23.520> or<00:02:23.940> Thor<00:02:24.480> gore<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.320> then

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
familiar to Gore or Thor gore and then

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.610 
familiar to Gore or Thor gore and then
obviously<00:02:25.890> door<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.090> he's<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> god<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.080> thunder

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
obviously door is he's a god of thunder

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.890 
obviously door is he's a god of thunder
but<00:02:28.830> he's<00:02:28.950> also<00:02:29.100> like<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> war<00:02:29.790> god<00:02:30.090> right<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
but he's also like a war god right and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.950 
but he's also like a war god right and
so<00:02:31.440> gore<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.400> know<00:02:32.520> there's<00:02:32.880> Gordon<00:02:33.510> ward<00:02:33.780> I

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
don't know I'm just I maybe I'm drunk

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.760 
don't know I'm just I maybe I'm drunk
grasping<00:02:35.670> at<00:02:35.790> straws<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.200> well<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.470> think

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
grasping at straws it well I just think

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.080 
grasping at straws it well I just think
would<00:02:37.920> be<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.220> cool<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.000> have

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
would be kind of cool it's like you have

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.140 
would be kind of cool it's like you have
to<00:02:39.240> overcome<00:02:39.450> your<00:02:39.960> own<00:02:40.170> evil<00:02:40.830> nature<00:02:41.150> even

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to overcome your own evil nature even

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.570 
to overcome your own evil nature even
gods<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.840> do<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:43.190> speaking<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.310> gods

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
gods have to do that speaking of gods

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.100 
gods have to do that speaking of gods
and<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.120> know<00:02:45.210> their<00:02:45.390> natures<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.930> think

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
and you know their natures I think

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.600 
and you know their natures I think
that's<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.040> things<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
that's one of the things that this

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.790 
that's one of the things that this
series<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.000> really<00:02:48.240> expanding<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:48.810> where<00:02:49.440> we

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
series is really expanding on where we

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.920 
series is really expanding on where we
get<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.250> see<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> glimpse<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.150> what's<00:02:51.390> above<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
get to see a glimpse of what's above the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.450 
get to see a glimpse of what's above the
gods<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:52.500> also<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.890> see<00:02:53.130> more<00:02:53.310> about

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460

gods and we also get to see more about
how<00:02:53.700> gods<00:02:54.000> themselves<00:02:54.780> live<00:02:55.500> because<00:02:55.740> Thor

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
how gods themselves live because Thor

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.560 
how gods themselves live because Thor
mentions<00:02:56.670> how<00:02:56.790> he<00:02:56.850> can't<00:02:57.180> remember

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
mentions how he can't remember

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.080 
mentions how he can't remember
everything<00:02:57.960> just<00:02:58.320> because<00:02:58.680> as<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.920> god<00:02:59.730> you

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
everything just because as a god you

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.880 
everything just because as a god you
know<00:03:00.210> you<00:03:00.270> still<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:01.350> can't<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.710> you're

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
know you still have you can't if you're

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.530 
know you still have you can't if you're
not<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.700> finite<00:03:02.940> amount<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.420> memory

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
not out of a finite amount of memory

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.460 
not out of a finite amount of memory
yeah<00:03:03.960> not<00:03:04.260> all<00:03:04.500> gods<00:03:04.800> are<00:03:05.130> all-knowing<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.470> so

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
yeah not all gods are all-knowing and so

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.080 
yeah not all gods are all-knowing and so
it's<00:03:08.220> kind<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.460> interesting<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.030> know

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
it's kind of interesting that you know

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.290 
it's kind of interesting that you know
he's<00:03:09.240> just<00:03:09.360> forgotten<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.080> much<00:03:10.350> right<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:12.120> we

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
he's just forgotten so much right and we

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300 
he's just forgotten so much right and we
also<00:03:12.450> get<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.630> see<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.050> amna<00:03:13.710> city<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.100> think

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
also get to see the amna city I think

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.700 
also get to see the amna city I think
it's<00:03:14.430> called<00:03:14.580> I'm<00:03:14.820> omnipotence<00:03:15.480> any<00:03:15.960> I'm<00:03:16.110> the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
it's called I'm omnipotence any I'm the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.970 
it's called I'm omnipotence any I'm the
tent<00:03:17.070> city<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:18.000> nexus<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.600> gods<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:19.440> what

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
tent city the nexus of the gods as what

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.180 
tent city the nexus of the gods as what
they<00:03:20.100> called<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:21.560> it's<00:03:22.560> really<00:03:22.830> cool

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
they called it and it's it's really cool

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.460 
they called it and it's it's really cool
just<00:03:23.490> like<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.390> panel<00:03:24.900> itself<00:03:25.020> I<00:03:25.320> thought

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
just like that panel itself I thought
