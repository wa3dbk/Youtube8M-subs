00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
them I plan to build a big stack and

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.549 
them I plan to build a big stack and
tower<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:00.579> didn't<00:01:01.480> get<00:01:01.600> around<00:01:01.840> to<00:01:02.170> it

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
tower I didn't get around to it

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.560 
tower I didn't get around to it
but<00:01:02.770> then<00:01:02.890> had<00:01:03.160> these<00:01:03.370> these<00:01:03.730> lettuce<00:01:04.149> plants

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
but then had these these lettuce plants

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.940 
but then had these these lettuce plants
that<00:01:04.659> just<00:01:04.839> weren't<00:01:05.079> doing<00:01:05.469> well<00:01:05.649> in<00:01:05.829> the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
that just weren't doing well in the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.879 
that just weren't doing well in the
crack<00:01:06.189> key<00:01:06.430> system<00:01:06.880> they<00:01:07.479> were<00:01:07.749> you<00:01:08.619> know<00:01:08.740> they

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:08.889 
crack key system they were you know they

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:10.379 
crack key system they were you know they
weren't<00:01:09.069> tolerating<00:01:09.789> Sun

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:10.389 
weren't tolerating Sun

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.260 
weren't tolerating Sun
they<00:01:10.929> weren't<00:01:11.139> growing<00:01:11.759> you<00:01:12.759> know<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:12.969> can

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
they weren't growing you know you can

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.199 
they weren't growing you know you can
see<00:01:13.420> these<00:01:13.600> here<00:01:13.959> it's<00:01:14.770> it's<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.399> big<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:15.969> have

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:16.209 
see these here it's it's that big I have

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.029 
see these here it's it's that big I have
some<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.630> are<00:01:16.689> huge<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.469> the<00:01:17.560> cracking

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
some that are huge and the cracking

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.649 
some that are huge and the cracking
these<00:01:18.399> just<00:01:18.759> didn't<00:01:18.999> do<00:01:19.090> well<00:01:19.329> so<00:01:19.509> I<00:01:19.569> decided

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
these just didn't do well so I decided

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.399 
these just didn't do well so I decided
what<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:20.170> hell<00:01:20.319> I'll<00:01:20.499> put<00:01:20.740> them<00:01:20.799> into<00:01:21.009> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
what the hell I'll put them into the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.929 
what the hell I'll put them into the
stacking<00:01:23.409> system<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:24.310> see<00:01:24.549> how<00:01:24.700> they<00:01:24.880> do

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
stacking system and see how they do

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.330 
stacking system and see how they do
there<00:01:25.359> and<00:01:25.810> basically<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.409> water<00:01:26.590> flows<00:01:27.039> out

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
there and basically the water flows out

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.519 
there and basically the water flows out
of<00:01:27.369> here<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:27.999> goes<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.840> this<00:01:28.990> one<00:01:29.229> then<00:01:29.439> this

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:29.529 
of here and goes to this one then this

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:31.499 
of here and goes to this one then this
one<00:01:29.590> flows<00:01:30.009> through<00:01:30.399> down<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.909> this<00:01:31.029> one<00:01:31.299> and

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
one flows through down to this one and

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.999 
one flows through down to this one and
then<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.749> one<00:01:31.810> flows<00:01:32.200> through<00:01:32.529> down<00:01:32.740> into

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
then this one flows through down into

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.039 
then this one flows through down into
the<00:01:33.099> bucket<00:01:33.459> and<00:01:33.639> you<00:01:34.509> know<00:01:34.599> all<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.929> way

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
the bucket and you know all the way

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.719 
the bucket and you know all the way
around<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:35.619> one<00:01:35.799> here<00:01:36.009> is<00:01:36.099> dripping<00:01:36.459> on<00:01:36.579> this

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
around this one here is dripping on this

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.879 
around this one here is dripping on this
plant<00:01:37.029> this<00:01:37.630> one's<00:01:37.899> going<00:01:38.079> into<00:01:38.349> the<00:01:38.439> bucket

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:38.889 
plant this one's going into the bucket

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.399 
plant this one's going into the bucket
this<00:01:39.279> one's<00:01:39.490> water<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:40.359> plant<00:01:40.689> it's<00:01:41.200> kind

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
this one's water in this plant it's kind

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.169 
this one's water in this plant it's kind
of<00:01:41.469> a<00:01:41.560> wasted<00:01:42.009> setup<00:01:42.429> like<00:01:42.579> I<00:01:42.639> said<00:01:42.909> these<00:01:43.119> are

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
of a wasted setup like I said these are

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.399 
of a wasted setup like I said these are
just<00:01:43.299> kind<00:01:43.539> of<00:01:43.630> my<00:01:43.779> misfit<00:01:44.319> plants<00:01:45.959> but<00:01:46.959> I<00:01:47.169> will

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
just kind of my misfit plants but I will

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.589 
just kind of my misfit plants but I will
say<00:01:47.619> I<00:01:47.950> was<00:01:48.429> really<00:01:48.669> excited<00:01:49.149> when<00:01:49.179> I<00:01:49.359> bought

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
say I was really excited when I bought

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.300 
say I was really excited when I bought
these<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.469> thought<00:01:50.649> they'd<00:01:50.859> work<00:01:51.009> great

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
these and I thought they'd work great

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.419 
these and I thought they'd work great
but<00:01:51.490> they're<00:01:51.609> not<00:01:51.639> really<00:01:52.329> all<00:01:52.569> that<00:01:53.429> one

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
but they're not really all that one

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.510 
but they're not really all that one
issue<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.909> have<00:01:55.359> is<00:01:55.889> sitting<00:01:56.889> on<00:01:57.009> top<00:01:57.219> of<00:01:57.279> this

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
issue I have is sitting on top of this

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.389 
issue I have is sitting on top of this
bucket<00:01:58.060> lid<00:01:58.299> on<00:01:59.109> the<00:01:59.499> deck<00:01:59.770> they're<00:02:00.219> not

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
bucket lid on the deck they're not

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.819 
bucket lid on the deck they're not
perfectly<00:02:00.909> level<00:02:01.419> so<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.749> flow<00:02:02.079> rate<00:02:02.109> is

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
perfectly level so the flow rate is

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.140 
perfectly level so the flow rate is
different<00:02:03.489> coming<00:02:03.819> out<00:02:03.939> of<00:02:04.090> all<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.299> them<00:02:04.689> I

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
different coming out of all of them I

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.630 
different coming out of all of them I
found<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:05.480> very<00:02:05.630> hard<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.170> regulate<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:07.370> get<00:02:07.520> an

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
found it very hard to regulate to get an

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.980 
found it very hard to regulate to get an
even<00:02:07.910> because<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.119> don't<00:02:08.270> want<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.840> this

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
even because you don't want it like this

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.100 
even because you don't want it like this
one<00:02:09.170> here<00:02:09.500> will<00:02:09.979> remove<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.580> plant<00:02:10.930> you<00:02:11.930> can

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
one here will remove the plant you can

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.050 
one here will remove the plant you can
see<00:02:12.290> as<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.470> steady<00:02:12.800> stream<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.820> really

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
see as a steady stream and you really

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.690 
see as a steady stream and you really
don't<00:02:14.270> need<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.540> much<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:16.040> on<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.550> other

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
don't need that much but on the other

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.510 
don't need that much but on the other
side<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.540> kind<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.110> drift<00:02:18.530> but<00:02:19.220> again

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
side it's just kind of a drift but again

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.610 
side it's just kind of a drift but again
the<00:02:20.210> roots<00:02:20.420> are<00:02:20.630> looking<00:02:20.930> good<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.290> plant

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the roots are looking good this plant

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.670 
the roots are looking good this plant
this<00:02:22.100> plant<00:02:22.160> had<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> rough<00:02:22.940> life

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
this plant had a rough life

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.400 
this plant had a rough life
the<00:02:24.680> roots<00:02:24.890> are<00:02:25.070> looking<00:02:25.460> good<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
the roots are looking good and the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.290 
the roots are looking good and the
plants<00:02:27.770> are<00:02:27.890> healthy<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.700> have<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.000> lot<00:02:29.240> of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
plants are healthy but I have a lot of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.240 
plants are healthy but I have a lot of
problem<00:02:29.780> getting<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.050> flow<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.380> even<00:02:30.830> like

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
problem getting the flow and even like

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.340 
problem getting the flow and even like
this<00:02:31.400> plant<00:02:31.730> here<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.480> basically<00:02:33.020> just

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
this plant here is basically just

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.310 
this plant here is basically just
getting<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.740> drip<00:02:34.300> about<00:02:35.300> every<00:02:35.630> few<00:02:35.840> seconds

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
getting a drip about every few seconds

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.130 
getting a drip about every few seconds
now<00:02:37.390> what<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.420> have<00:02:38.630> used<00:02:38.870> inside<00:02:39.350> was<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
now what I have used inside was the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.930 
now what I have used inside was the
slate<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.800> buy<00:02:42.950> at<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.160> hydroponics<00:02:43.850> store

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
slate but you buy at a hydroponics store

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.580 
slate but you buy at a hydroponics store
it's<00:02:44.630> just<00:02:44.870> little<00:02:45.080> little<00:02:46.040> pebbles<00:02:47.590> it's

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
it's just little little pebbles it's

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.670 
it's just little little pebbles it's
really<00:02:48.980> light<00:02:49.510> okay<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.750> decided<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.350> use<00:02:51.470> this

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
really light okay I decided to use this

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.020 
really light okay I decided to use this
because<00:02:51.890> it's<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.160> little<00:02:52.370> cheaper<00:02:52.730> than<00:02:52.910> all

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
because it's a little cheaper than all

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.500 
because it's a little cheaper than all
you<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.420> hydroponic<00:02:54.080> stones<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.760> I

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
you have the hydroponic stones and I

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.090 
you have the hydroponic stones and I
think<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.170> better<00:02:57.350> product<00:02:57.890> than

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
think it's just a better product than

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.000 
think it's just a better product than
the<00:02:59.260> slipping<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.470> name<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.890> other

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the slipping on the name of the other

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.430 
the slipping on the name of the other
stuff<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:01.820> that's<00:03:01.940> what<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.180> use<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.720> here<00:03:02.959> and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
stuff but that's what I use in here and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.130 
stuff but that's what I use in here and
I<00:03:04.130> just<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.580> said<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.090> can<00:03:05.209> see<00:03:05.360> this<00:03:05.540> this

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
I just like I said you can see this this

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.199 
I just like I said you can see this this
plant<00:03:06.440> hasn't<00:03:06.830> established<00:03:06.950> its<00:03:07.580> roots<00:03:07.850> down

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
plant hasn't established its roots down

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.199 
plant hasn't established its roots down
into<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> rocks<00:03:08.930> yet<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.550> can<00:03:10.730> just<00:03:10.880> pick<00:03:11.060> it

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
into the rocks yet so I can just pick it

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.850 
into the rocks yet so I can just pick it
up<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.630> move<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.959> but<00:03:12.380> some<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.709> other

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
up and move it but some of the other

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.280 
up and move it but some of the other
plants<00:03:13.700> had<00:03:13.850> pretty<00:03:14.269> good<00:03:14.450> sized<00:03:14.690> roots<00:03:15.019> where

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
plants had pretty good sized roots where

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.080 
plants had pretty good sized roots where
I<00:03:15.320> had<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.590> bury<00:03:15.800> them<00:03:16.010> down<00:03:16.220> into<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.760> rock

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
I had to bury them down into the rock

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.290 
I had to bury them down into the rock
and<00:03:17.750> this<00:03:18.200> one's<00:03:18.440> on<00:03:18.620> its<00:03:18.830> way<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:20.090> this

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
and this one's on its way like this

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.850 
and this one's on its way like this
plant<00:03:20.570> here<00:03:20.780> has<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> lot<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.260> roots<00:03:21.530> already

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
plant here has a lot of roots already

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.699 
plant here has a lot of roots already
down<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.459> rock<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:23.690> plant<00:03:23.959> here<00:03:24.140> doesn't

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
down in the rock this plant here doesn't

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.290 
down in the rock this plant here doesn't
you<00:03:24.920> know<00:03:25.010> they're<00:03:25.190> all<00:03:25.370> pretty<00:03:25.610> like<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.090> said

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
you know they're all pretty like I said

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.690 
you know they're all pretty like I said
my<00:03:26.450> misfits<00:03:26.930> but<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.860> main<00:03:28.010> reason<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.430> didn't

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
my misfits but the main reason I didn't

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.900 
my misfits but the main reason I didn't
like<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:30.019> cuz<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:31.730> being

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
like this is just cuz the not being

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.479 
like this is just cuz the not being
level<00:03:32.420> now<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.019> can't<00:03:33.320> hang<00:03:33.620> them<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.310> can

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
level now you can't hang them you can

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.100 
level now you can't hang them you can
run<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.700> rod<00:03:34.970> up<00:03:35.239> through<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.570> middle<00:03:35.810> of<00:03:35.930> them

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
run a rod up through the middle of them

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.509 
run a rod up through the middle of them
and<00:03:36.260> hang<00:03:36.500> them<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.890> make<00:03:37.100> them<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.310> lot<00:03:37.459> more

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
and hang them that make them a lot more

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.000 
and hang them that make them a lot more
level<00:03:38.090> probably<00:03:38.420> make<00:03:38.540> them<00:03:38.630> flow<00:03:38.989> better<00:03:39.290> but

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
level probably make them flow better but

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.520 
level probably make them flow better but
as<00:03:40.130> far<00:03:40.340> as<00:03:40.370> sitting<00:03:40.820> on<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.540> didn't<00:03:42.350> like

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
as far as sitting on this I didn't like

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.560 
as far as sitting on this I didn't like
it<00:03:42.769> now<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.310> pump<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:43.760> got<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.120> here

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
it now the pump I got in here

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.820 
it now the pump I got in here
it's<00:03:45.290> like<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.530> 80<00:03:45.860> gallon<00:03:46.790> per<00:03:46.940> hour<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.830> 135

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
it's like a 80 gallon per hour to 135

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.910 
it's like a 80 gallon per hour to 135
gallon<00:03:49.340> or<00:03:49.430> 132<00:03:49.820> hour<00:03:50.630> pump<00:03:50.959> adjustable<00:03:51.739> I

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
gallon or 132 hour pump adjustable I

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.370 
gallon or 132 hour pump adjustable I
haven't<00:03:52.549> turned<00:03:52.670> all<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.090> way<00:03:53.209> down<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:54.230> is

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
haven't turned all the way down this is

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.900 
haven't turned all the way down this is
the<00:03:54.440> other<00:03:54.590> issue<00:03:54.799> when<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.190> leaves<00:03:55.459> get<00:03:55.730> up

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
the other issue when the leaves get up

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.020 
the other issue when the leaves get up
on<00:03:56.090> there<00:03:56.360> they<00:03:57.019> kind<00:03:57.380> of

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
on there they kind of

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.470 
on there they kind of
okay<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.480> flow<00:03:59.700> but<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.790> course<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.360> is

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
okay the flow but of course it is

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.240 
okay the flow but of course it is
flowing<00:04:01.930> through<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.200> center<00:04:02.530> -<00:04:02.770> so<00:04:03.010> there<00:04:03.130> is

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
flowing through the center - so there is

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.490 
flowing through the center - so there is
water<00:04:03.520> down<00:04:04.210> in<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.540> rocks<00:04:04.750> in<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.110> middle<00:04:05.260> it

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
water down in the rocks in the middle it

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.230 
water down in the rocks in the middle it
doesn't<00:04:05.530> have<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:06.010> rely<00:04:06.310> on<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:06.760> once<00:04:07.060> the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
doesn't have to rely on this once the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.970 
doesn't have to rely on this once the
roots<00:04:07.450> get<00:04:07.690> established<00:04:07.960> but<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.800> pump

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
roots get established but the pump

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.040 
roots get established but the pump
anyways<00:04:09.370> like<00:04:09.520> I<00:04:09.580> said<00:04:09.700> it's<00:04:09.820> like<00:04:09.910> 80<00:04:10.240> to<00:04:10.480> 130

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
anyways like I said it's like 80 to 130

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.770 
anyways like I said it's like 80 to 130
gallon<00:04:11.590> call<00:04:11.800> I<00:04:12.100> have<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:12.730> hose<00:04:13.150> running<00:04:13.540> up

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
gallon call I have this hose running up

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.020 
gallon call I have this hose running up
on<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.230> outside<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:14.980> just<00:04:15.190> zip<00:04:15.610> tied<00:04:15.820> it

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
on the outside and I just zip tied it

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.110 
on the outside and I just zip tied it
here<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.420> outside<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:18.190> got<00:04:18.400> my<00:04:18.519> flow<00:04:18.790> set

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
here on the outside and got my flow set

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.120 
here on the outside and got my flow set
that<00:04:19.359> way<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.410> can<00:04:20.950> tell<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.280> one<00:04:21.519> thing<00:04:21.760> as

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
that way but I can tell you one thing as

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.610 
that way but I can tell you one thing as
as<00:04:24.130> opposed<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.760> crack<00:04:25.030> key<00:04:25.270> method<00:04:25.720> with

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
as opposed to the crack key method with

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.770 
as opposed to the crack key method with
this<00:04:26.770> one<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.430> water<00:04:27.640> is<00:04:27.820> moving<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:28.600> it's

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
this one the water is moving so it's

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.020 
this one the water is moving so it's
getting<00:04:29.140> oxygenated<00:04:29.980> as<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.490> drips<00:04:30.760> through

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
getting oxygenated as it drips through

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.810 
getting oxygenated as it drips through
getting<00:04:31.750> oxygen<00:04:32.260> in<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:33.100> plants<00:04:33.550> look

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
getting oxygen in it the plants look

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.360 
getting oxygen in it the plants look
really<00:04:34.540> good<00:04:34.750> they<00:04:35.410> sit<00:04:35.680> down<00:04:35.710> here<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.280> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
really good they sit down here on the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.880 
really good they sit down here on the
lower<00:04:36.520> deck<00:04:36.850> it's<00:04:37.090> almost<00:04:37.570> 100<00:04:38.230> percent<00:04:38.380> shade

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
lower deck it's almost 100 percent shade

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.850 
lower deck it's almost 100 percent shade
down<00:04:39.220> here<00:04:39.930> like<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:40.990> said<00:04:41.260> at<00:04:41.410> least<00:04:41.560> these

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
down here like I said at least these

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.360 
down here like I said at least these
weren't<00:04:42.070> all<00:04:42.310> rating<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.390> Sun<00:04:43.630> very<00:04:43.900> well

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
weren't all rating the the Sun very well

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.120 
weren't all rating the the Sun very well
so<00:04:45.370> this<00:04:45.640> is<00:04:45.820> 100<00:04:46.360> percent<00:04:46.390> shade<00:04:47.020> on<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.890> deck

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
so this is 100 percent shade on the deck

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.760 
so this is 100 percent shade on the deck
the<00:04:48.610> clamps<00:04:49.030> are<00:04:49.180> absolutely<00:04:50.020> they<00:04:50.320> just<00:04:50.560> have

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
the clamps are absolutely they just have

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.380 
the clamps are absolutely they just have
come<00:04:51.010> back<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.250> life<00:04:51.430> they're<00:04:51.910> starting<00:04:52.360> to

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
come back to life they're starting to

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.460 
come back to life they're starting to
grow<00:04:52.660> again<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:54.070> that<00:04:54.160> aspect<00:04:54.730> of<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.180> I

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
grow again so for that aspect of it I

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.620 
grow again so for that aspect of it I
really<00:04:56.470> like<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:56.890> but<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:58.120> doesn't<00:04:58.510> have

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
really like it but that doesn't have

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.720 
really like it but that doesn't have
anything<00:04:58.660> to<00:04:59.169> do<00:04:59.320> with<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.650> planters<00:05:00.190> itself

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
anything to do with the planters itself

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.210 
anything to do with the planters itself
that's<00:05:01.120> just<00:05:01.390> because<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.870> think<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.740> nutrient

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
that's just because I think the nutrient

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.580 
that's just because I think the nutrient
solution<00:05:03.760> is<00:05:03.970> being<00:05:04.479> pumped<00:05:04.870> it's<00:05:05.169> in<00:05:05.350> motion

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
solution is being pumped it's in motion

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.820 
solution is being pumped it's in motion
it's<00:05:06.070> getting<00:05:06.340> oxygen<00:05:06.970> in<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.360> it's<00:05:08.320> staying

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
it's getting oxygen in it it's staying

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.280 
it's getting oxygen in it it's staying
mixed<00:05:09.190> up<00:05:09.370> because<00:05:09.550> again<00:05:10.030> it's<00:05:10.270> being<00:05:10.479> flowed

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
mixed up because again it's being flowed

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.310 
mixed up because again it's being flowed
through<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.590> pumps<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:13.240> dripping<00:05:13.840> back<00:05:14.080> down

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
through the pumps and dripping back down

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.110 
through the pumps and dripping back down
I<00:05:14.350> just<00:05:14.530> had<00:05:14.800> holes<00:05:15.070> cut<00:05:15.430> in<00:05:15.460> here<00:05:15.760> so<00:05:15.910> if<00:05:16.030> you

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
I just had holes cut in here so if you

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.300 
I just had holes cut in here so if you
drip<00:05:16.360> back<00:05:16.600> down<00:05:16.870> but<00:05:17.200> all<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:17.919> these<00:05:18.100> are

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
drip back down but all of these are

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.070 
drip back down but all of these are
pretty<00:05:18.580> decent<00:05:19.090> I'm<00:05:19.210> not<00:05:19.360> gonna<00:05:19.540> jump<00:05:19.780> up<00:05:19.960> and

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
pretty decent I'm not gonna jump up and

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.930 
pretty decent I'm not gonna jump up and
down<00:05:20.229> and<00:05:20.470> say<00:05:20.620> these<00:05:20.830> stacking<00:05:21.370> planners<00:05:21.790> are

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
down and say these stacking planners are

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.520 
down and say these stacking planners are
the<00:05:22.030> best<00:05:22.300> thing<00:05:22.540> you'll<00:05:22.720> buy<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:22.930> do<00:05:23.229> skeezy

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
the best thing you'll buy to do skeezy

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.290 
the best thing you'll buy to do skeezy
hydroponics<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:24.520> your

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
hydroponics and your

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.270
