 hi i'm victor 100 cows and this video is about 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 how to know whether it is time to change the oil 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.220
 automatic transmission or 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.220
 variator for the procedure we need 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
 gloves 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:45.170
 dropper syringe for 20 cubic 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:45.170
 centimeters scissors well, let's get started 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:57.409
 automatic transmission and how 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.409
 usually looking for here it's pull out the dipstick 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.210
 as a rule on the probe, we can not jump 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.350
 quality of working fluid automatic 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 gear boxes 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.310
 charge so we use another 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.100
 the way we take the drip 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:18.170
 get the probe 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:25.270
 and measure the length of the probe in slang from 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.270
 droppers and with a small margin cut off 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.229
 we have such a hose 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:56.759
 of accumulating already a little bit stream 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:01.729
 because it spins further my 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.729
 put on a syringe without a needle 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.340
 now we shove 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.340
 drip from the dropper into the holes of the carton 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.650
 and draw the liquid in the syringe 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.319
 now you see well the quality 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:44.420
 fluid syringe and now you see well 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.470
 that liquid is black light and and long 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.910
 it's time to change on the dipstick it was not visible 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.390
 Now you show looks like new 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.390
 liquid 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.680
 now you just notice the difference between 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.060
 new fluid and old new look 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.730
 bright red cherry blossom 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.800
 old black old liquid strongly 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.040
 contaminated by friction wear products 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.080
 and the strong described old record leads 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.630
 increased fuel consumption to jerks at 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.280
 high wear gear shifting 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.420
 gear boxes in total failure 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.730
