idea<00:01:23.460> by<00:01:23.940> my<00:01:24.090> cat<00:01:24.450> sometimes<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:26.270> putting

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
idea by my cat sometimes of putting

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.430 
idea by my cat sometimes of putting
together<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.690> sort<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.900> partnership<00:01:28.200> with

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
together some sort of partnership with

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.960 
together some sort of partnership with
MLG<00:01:29.720> down<00:01:30.720> 100<00:01:31.410> sent<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.740> who<00:01:31.980> who<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.790> go

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
for this dick I don't think it's the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.840 
for this dick I don't think it's the
most<00:01:34.530> popular<00:01:37.010> it's<00:01:38.010> lacking<00:01:38.370> a<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.640> of

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
most popular it's lacking a bit of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.290 
most popular it's lacking a bit of
identity<00:01:40.130> but<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.370> good<00:01:41.640> idea<00:01:41.730> of<00:01:42.060> good

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
identity but it is a good idea of good

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.030 
identity but it is a good idea of good

better<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.710> that's<00:01:47.010> a<00:01:47.100> good<00:01:47.280> thing<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.580> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
better then that's a good thing and I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.790 
better then that's a good thing and I
think<00:01:47.670> mad<00:01:48.000> catz<00:01:48.300> my<00:01:49.110> face<00:01:49.350> through<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.560> right

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
think mad catz my face through the right

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.960 
think mad catz my face through the right
thing<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.220> some<00:01:53.340> interesting<00:01:53.550> sides

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
thing it's got some interesting sides

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.390 
thing it's got some interesting sides
and<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.530> wanted<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.830> mod<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
and I think if you wanted to mod it it

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.830 
and I think if you wanted to mod it it
could<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.610> very<00:01:56.820> interesting<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.420> actually

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
could be very interesting and actually

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.060 
could be very interesting and actually
it<00:01:58.020> looks<00:01:58.230> a<00:01:58.350> lot<00:01:58.710> nicer<00:01:59.060> in<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.840> person<00:02:01.380> so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
it looks a lot nicer in in person so

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
it looks a lot nicer in in person so
this<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> final<00:02:02.820> stick<00:02:03.120> street<00:02:03.750> fighter

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
this is the final stick street fighter

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.320 
this is the final stick street fighter
cross<00:02:04.020> tekken<00:02:05.810> i<00:02:07.369> like<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> some<00:02:09.000> people<00:02:09.030> down

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
cross tekken i like it some people down

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.350 
cross tekken i like it some people down
so<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.710> weird<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.730> initial<00:02:11.910> run<00:02:12.210> was

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
so think it's weird the initial run was

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.750 
so think it's weird the initial run was
limited<00:02:12.720> edition<00:02:13.140> with<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.380> thousand<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.370> Xbox

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
limited edition with a thousand the Xbox

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.240 
limited edition with a thousand the Xbox
not<00:02:15.000> sure

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
not sure

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.340 
not sure
PlayStation<00:02:16.030> somebody<00:02:16.390> after<00:02:16.510> Tommy<00:02:17.520> and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
PlayStation somebody after Tommy and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.500 
PlayStation somebody after Tommy and
then<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.620> believe<00:02:21.130> they<00:02:21.550> continue<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:22.330> make

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
then I believe they continue to make

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.090 
then I believe they continue to make
them<00:02:22.690> after<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.470> they<00:02:23.620> weren't<00:02:23.770> part<00:02:24.070> of

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
them after that but they weren't part of

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.390 
them after that but they weren't part of
