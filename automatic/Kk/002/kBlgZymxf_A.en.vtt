much like making rice a roni if you've
ever<00:02:12.840> made<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> keep<00:02:14.700> this

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
ever made that you have to keep this

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.809 
ever made that you have to keep this
going<00:02:15.299> until<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.170> start<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.709> smell<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.459> nutty

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
going until you start to smell a nutty

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.630 
going until you start to smell a nutty
flavor<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.870> you'll<00:02:19.560> notice<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.430> rice

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
flavor and you'll notice that the rice

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.630 
flavor and you'll notice that the rice
and<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> orzo<00:02:21.510> start<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.959> take<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.709> deeper

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
and the orzo start to take on a deeper

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.819 
and the orzo start to take on a deeper
brown<00:02:23.940> color<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.660> they'll<00:02:24.810> become<00:02:24.989> toasted

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
brown color and they'll become toasted

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.090 
brown color and they'll become toasted
so<00:02:26.790> that's<00:02:27.540> gonna<00:02:27.810> take<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.530> few<00:02:28.769> minutes

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
so that's gonna take just a few minutes

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.800 
so that's gonna take just a few minutes
and<00:02:29.340> I'll<00:02:29.489> be<00:02:29.519> back<00:02:29.670> when<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.209> time<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.660> add

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
and I'll be back when it's time to add

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.210 
and I'll be back when it's time to add
the<00:02:31.230> liquid<00:02:33.230> we're<00:02:34.230> back<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.739> has<00:02:34.920> been

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
the liquid we're back it has been

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.860 
the liquid we're back it has been
between<00:02:35.519> five<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:35.910> seven<00:02:36.209> minutes<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
between five and seven minutes and you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.050 
between five and seven minutes and you
can<00:02:37.079> see<00:02:37.350> how<00:02:37.620> toasty<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.370> brown<00:02:38.609> the<00:02:38.880> rice

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
can see how toasty and brown the rice

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.229 
can see how toasty and brown the rice
granules<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.840> gotten<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> bottom

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
granules have gotten and on the bottom

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.699 
granules have gotten and on the bottom
it's<00:02:42.480> gonna<00:02:42.660> start<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.079> feel<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.530> it's

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
it's gonna start to feel like it's

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.830 
it's gonna start to feel like it's
getting<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:44.100> little<00:02:44.190> sticky<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.940> that's<00:02:45.540> just

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
getting a little sticky and that's just

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.390 
getting a little sticky and that's just
because<00:02:45.989> some<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.530> starch<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.980> coming<00:02:47.280> out

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
because some of the starch is coming out

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.280 
because some of the starch is coming out
of<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.549> rice<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.359> perfectly<00:02:48.750> okay

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
of the rice and that is perfectly okay

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.220 
of the rice and that is perfectly okay
