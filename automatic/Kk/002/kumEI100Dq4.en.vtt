really lets it get in tight and it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080 
really lets it get in tight and it
honestly<00:01:01.559> makes<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.160> huge<00:01:02.550> difference<00:01:02.579> when

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
you could put that lens through its

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.390 
you could put that lens through its
paces<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> volume<00:01:07.680> rocker<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.280> it's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
paces with the volume rocker but it's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
paces with the volume rocker but it's
much<00:01:08.760> more<00:01:09.000> fun<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> pinch<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.840> zoom

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
