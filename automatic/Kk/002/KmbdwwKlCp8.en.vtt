video<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.510> tried<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> record<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
video and we tried to record this a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.410 
video and we tried to record this a
couple<00:00:19.650> times<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.160> uploaded<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.060> earlier

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
couple times I uploaded this earlier

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.269 
couple times I uploaded this earlier
over<00:00:21.660> some<00:00:21.960> gameplay<00:00:22.410> some<00:00:22.650> really<00:00:22.859> old<00:00:22.980> plaza

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
over some gameplay some really old plaza

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.769 
over some gameplay some really old plaza
hardpoint<00:00:23.789> gameplay<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> game<00:00:24.449> sounds<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
hardpoint gameplay but the game sounds a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.730 
hardpoint gameplay but the game sounds a
little<00:00:24.869> too<00:00:25.050> loud<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> figured<00:00:25.650> I'd

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
little too loud so I figured I'd

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.140 
little too loud so I figured I'd
re-upload<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.609> make<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> little<00:00:27.000> more

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
re-upload it and make it a little more

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.519 
re-upload it and make it a little more
short<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.689> sweet<00:00:27.869> because<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.260> was<00:00:28.349> about<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
short and sweet because that was about a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
short and sweet because that was about a
nine<00:00:28.769> minute<00:00:29.010> video<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.670> touched<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> lot

we've had a lot of fun with it we played
a<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:18.780> every<00:01:18.990> day<00:01:19.110> maybe<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.500> than<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
a little bit every day maybe more than a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.170 
a little bit every day maybe more than a
little<00:01:19.920> bit<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> point<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.060> are

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
little bit at this point because we are

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
little bit at this point because we are
just<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:21.750> getting<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> point<00:01:22.470> where<00:01:22.710> we

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
just now getting to the point where we

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
just now getting to the point where we
were<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.100> four<00:01:23.400> back<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> house<00:01:23.939> since

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
were all four back in the house since

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.230 
were all four back in the house since
gfinity<00:01:25.229> won<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> since<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.490> MLG<00:01:26.820> has

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
gfinity won and since then MLG has

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.969 
gfinity won and since then MLG has
changed<00:01:27.810> some<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> their<00:01:28.290> some<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> their

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
changed some of their some of their

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.010 
changed some of their some of their
rules<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.610> basically<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.630> some<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
rules and basically not some of the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.899 
rules and basically not some of the
rules<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.500> entire<00:01:31.829> way<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.400> pro<00:01:32.640> point

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
rules the entire way the pro point

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
rules the entire way the pro point
system<00:01:33.329> works<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:34.159> different<00:01:35.159> from<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
system works so now different from the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
system works so now different from the
past<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.939> gain<00:01:36.090> profiles<00:01:36.720> from<00:01:37.020> playing

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
past you can gain profiles from playing

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.160 
past you can gain profiles from playing
I<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:38.400> even<00:01:38.640> 1v1<00:01:39.060> tournaments<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> V<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I think even 1v1 tournaments to V to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.359 
I think even 1v1 tournaments to V to
tournaments<00:01:40.710> 3v3

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
tournaments 3v3
