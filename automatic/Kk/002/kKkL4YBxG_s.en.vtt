00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
one of the best realtime strategy games

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.340 
one of the best realtime strategy games
ever<00:00:16.920> made<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:18.240> let's<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> look<00:00:18.840> why

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
ever made and let's have a look why

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.140 
ever made and let's have a look why
first<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.439> all<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.460> special<00:00:23.820> about<00:00:23.880> this

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
first of all all so special about this

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.480 
first of all all so special about this
game<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:25.170> zoom<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.279> zoom

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
game is that you can zoom in and zoom

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.540 
game is that you can zoom in and zoom
out<00:00:26.880> completely<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.109> then<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.220> see<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
out completely and then you can see the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
out completely and then you can see the
whole<00:00:29.670> battlefield<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.570> actually

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
whole battlefield or you can actually

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.470 
whole battlefield or you can actually
zoom<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.070> much<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.640> get<00:00:33.270> really

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
zoom in so much as you can get really

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.450 
zoom in so much as you can get really
close<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:33.989> units<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.620> want<00:00:34.890> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
close to the units which you want to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.260 
close to the units which you want to
look<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:37.160> another<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.700> which<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:38.969> really

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
look at another thing which is really

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.650 
look at another thing which is really
good<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.350> due<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.070> zooming<00:00:41.660> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
good is that due to this zooming the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650 
good is that due to this zooming the
units<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.290> now<00:00:43.500> allowed<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:45.210> shoot<00:00:45.420> at

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
units are now allowed to shoot at

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.380 
units are now allowed to shoot at
realistic<00:00:46.469> ranges<00:00:46.860> unlike<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.670> most<00:00:47.879> other

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
realistic ranges unlike in most other

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
realistic ranges unlike in most other
games<00:00:48.660> where<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.289> soldier<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.920> shooting<00:00:50.280> not

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
games where a soldier is shooting not

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.209 
games where a soldier is shooting not
more<00:00:51.000> than<00:00:51.059> 20<00:00:51.510> meters<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.829> actually

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
more than 20 meters here you actually

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.939 
more than 20 meters here you actually
have<00:00:53.730> realistic<00:00:54.030> ranges<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.840> things<00:00:55.739> are

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
have realistic ranges and things are

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.439 
have realistic ranges and things are
shooting<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> range<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:56.910> kilometers

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
shooting at the range of two kilometers

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.590 
shooting at the range of two kilometers
and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.140> artillery<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.910> shooting<00:01:00.210> easily

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and the artillery can be shooting easily

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
and the artillery can be shooting easily
across<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> whole<00:01:01.379> map<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:02.520> example<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
across the whole map for example you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
across the whole map for example you
could<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.570> artillery<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.739> at

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
could have an artillery here back at

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
could have an artillery here back at
your<00:01:05.040> home<00:01:05.220> base<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.090> could<00:01:06.240> shoot<00:01:06.420> all

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
your home base and you could shoot all

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.649 
your home base and you could shoot all
the<00:01:06.869> way<00:01:07.340> at<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> enemy<00:01:08.880> home<00:01:09.210> base<00:01:10.760> now<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the way at the enemy home base now you

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.030 
the way at the enemy home base now you
might<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.960> thinking<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.619> artillery

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
might be thinking that the artillery

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
might be thinking that the artillery
might<00:01:14.250> become<00:01:14.580> overpowered<00:01:15.150> well<00:01:15.689> actually

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
might become overpowered well actually

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.770 
might become overpowered well actually
it<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.500> overpowered<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.780> although

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
it is not overpowered because although

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.710 
it is not overpowered because although
it<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.290> shoot<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:20.070> far<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:21.540> most

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
it can shoot really far and in most

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
it can shoot really far and in most
cases<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.290> will<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.590> able<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> shoot<00:01:23.220> anywhere

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
cases it will be able to shoot anywhere

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.170 
cases it will be able to shoot anywhere
on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> map<00:01:24.270> at<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.110> same<00:01:25.320> time<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.729> becomes

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
on the map at the same time it becomes

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660 
on the map at the same time it becomes
very<00:01:27.330> inaccurate<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.250> spotting

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
very inaccurate if you are not spotting

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
very inaccurate if you are not spotting
the<00:01:29.790> position<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.299> which<00:01:30.329> you're<00:01:30.600> firing<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the position at which you're firing and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.330 
the position at which you're firing and
that's<00:01:32.009> when<00:01:32.400> recon<00:01:32.909> where<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> recon<00:01:33.840> comes<00:01:34.079> in

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
that's when recon where a recon comes in

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.020 
that's when recon where a recon comes in
so<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:36.299> using<00:01:36.450> recon<00:01:37.350> units<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.610> spot<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so you're using recon units to spot the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.520 
so you're using recon units to spot the
enemy<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.810> choose<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.409> bit

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
enemy that you can choose a little bit

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
enemy that you can choose a little bit
more<00:01:40.680> precise<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.939> still<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> take

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
more precise but still you have to take

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.429 
more precise but still you have to take
into<00:01:43.500> account<00:01:44.090> also<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.930> artillery<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
into account also that the artillery is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.100 
into account also that the artillery is
also<00:01:46.680> using<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.100> munition<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
also using a munition just like all the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.190 
also using a munition just like all the
other<00:01:49.350> game<00:01:49.590> units<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> game<00:01:50.930> all<00:01:51.930> units

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
other game units in the game all units

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.999 
other game units in the game all units
have<00:01:52.500> some<00:01:53.630> amount<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.930> ammunition<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.829> can

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
have some amount of ammunition you can

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.950 
have some amount of ammunition you can
see<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.549> example<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.060> has<00:01:57.329> 8,000

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
see here for example this one has 8,000

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530 
see here for example this one has 8,000
bullet<00:01:58.219> in<00:01:59.219> its<00:01:59.579> machine<00:01:59.939> gun<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
bullet in its machine gun and at the

hundreds of units and when hundreds of
units<00:02:47.360> are<00:02:47.420> swarming<00:02:47.810> there<00:02:48.230> will<00:02:48.349> be<00:02:48.380> simply

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
units are swarming there will be simply

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.140

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.160 
this one you can then send in more
reinforcements<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:58.120> sectors<00:03:58.599> which<00:03:58.989> have

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
reinforcements so sectors which have

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.500 
reinforcements so sectors which have
arrows<00:03:59.709> for<00:04:00.310> example<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:00.730> can<00:04:00.939> see<00:04:01.060> alpha<00:04:01.359> has

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
arrows for example you can see alpha has

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.240 
arrows for example you can see alpha has
an<00:04:01.629> arrow<00:04:01.780> here<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:04.060> then<00:04:04.650> as<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.709> take<00:04:06.040> over

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
an arrow here and then as you take over

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.039 
an arrow here and then as you take over
the<00:04:06.370> sector's<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.659> will<00:04:07.780> be<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:08.019> course

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
the sector's and you will be of course

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.199 
the sector's and you will be of course
engaging<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.889> enemy<00:04:08.919> and<00:04:09.579> you'll<00:04:09.730> be<00:04:09.939> doing<00:04:10.120> a

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
engaging the enemy and you'll be doing a

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.300 
engaging the enemy and you'll be doing a
defeating<00:04:10.659> the<00:04:10.780> enemy<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.200> when<00:04:11.919> you<00:04:12.010> destroy

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
defeating the enemy and when you destroy

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.129 
defeating the enemy and when you destroy
the<00:04:12.340> enemy<00:04:12.700> units<00:04:13.030> you'll<00:04:13.269> be<00:04:13.450> getting<00:04:13.569> points

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
the enemy units you'll be getting points

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.960 
the enemy units you'll be getting points
for<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.950> value<00:04:15.220> of<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.489> units<00:04:15.760> which<00:04:15.879> you

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
for the value of the units which you

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.589 
for the value of the units which you
destroy<00:04:17.669> also<00:04:18.669> in<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:18.970> game<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.329> cannot

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
destroy also in this game you cannot

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:26.159 
destroy also in this game you cannot
just<00:04:20.789> send<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.910> big<00:04:23.190> blob<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.430> units<00:04:24.849> and<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.930> send

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
just send a big blob of units and I send

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.170 
just send a big blob of units and I send
them<00:04:26.289> to<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.560> enemy<00:04:27.039> and<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.370> just<00:04:27.669> hope<00:04:28.150> that

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
them to the enemy and I just hope that

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.270 
them to the enemy and I just hope that
and<00:04:28.720> expect<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.289> if<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.650> have<00:04:29.800> more<00:04:29.949> units

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
and expect that if you have more units

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.589 
and expect that if you have more units
that<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.490> are<00:04:30.550> going<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.849> win<00:04:31.030> automatically

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
that you are going to win automatically

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.689 
that you are going to win automatically
now<00:04:32.020> this<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.409> not<00:04:32.590> how<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:32.889> works<00:04:33.099> there's

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
now this is not how it works there's

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.790 
now this is not how it works there's
also<00:04:33.909> what<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.270> have<00:04:34.419> artillery<00:04:34.780> for<00:04:35.169> that

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
also what you have artillery for that

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.589 
also what you have artillery for that
when<00:04:36.070> there<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.460> big<00:04:36.760> concentration<00:04:37.060> of

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
when there is a big concentration of

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.200 
when there is a big concentration of
units<00:04:38.440> they<00:04:39.039> just<00:04:39.280> share<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.789> with<00:04:39.940> artillery

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
units they just share it with artillery

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.240 
units they just share it with artillery
and<00:04:40.510> you're<00:04:40.690> going<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.110> decimate<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:42.039> enemy

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
and you're going to decimate the enemy

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.730 
and you're going to decimate the enemy
forces<00:04:42.720> that's<00:04:43.720> why<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.260> this<00:04:44.380> one<00:04:44.560> in<00:04:44.620> this

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
forces that's why and this one in this

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.550 
forces that's why and this one in this
game<00:04:44.919> is<00:04:45.070> actually<00:04:46.139> made<00:04:47.139> in<00:04:47.289> a<00:04:47.380> very

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
game is actually made in a very

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.050 
game is actually made in a very
realistic<00:04:47.680> way<00:04:48.159> that<00:04:48.340> people<00:04:48.639> are<00:04:48.849> spreading

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
realistic way that people are spreading

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.240 
realistic way that people are spreading
out<00:04:49.330> their<00:04:49.510> forces<00:04:49.780> they<00:04:50.620> try<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.889> defend

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
out their forces they try to defend

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.790 
out their forces they try to defend
everywhere<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.199> game<00:04:53.409> is<00:04:53.560> also

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
everywhere and in this game is also

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.520 
everywhere and in this game is also
important<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:55.240> take<00:04:55.780> into<00:04:55.840> account<00:04:56.349> that

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
important to take into account that

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.140 
important to take into account that
someone<00:04:56.949> might<00:04:57.099> be<00:04:57.250> flanking<00:04:57.610> you<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.000> you

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
someone might be flanking you and you

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.230 
someone might be flanking you and you
should<00:04:58.300> be<00:04:58.419> also<00:04:58.570> using<00:04:58.960> strategies<00:04:59.440> which

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
should be also using strategies which

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.310 
should be also using strategies which
real<00:05:01.240> generals<00:05:01.690> would<00:05:01.840> be<00:05:02.020> applauded

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
real generals would be applauded

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.969 
real generals would be applauded
employing<00:05:02.680> in<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:02.949> real<00:05:03.130> war

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.700 

then<00:05:06.979> as<00:05:07.419> soon<00:05:08.419> as<00:05:08.600> you<00:05:08.750> destroy<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.410> certain

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
then as soon as you destroy a certain

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.140 
then as soon as you destroy a certain
amount<00:05:10.009> of<00:05:10.190> points<00:05:10.400> you're<00:05:10.610> going<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.910> win<00:05:11.060> the

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
amount of points you're going to win the

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.050 
amount of points you're going to win the
game<00:05:11.300> for<00:05:11.509> example<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:12.139> game<00:05:12.410> is<00:05:12.590> set<00:05:12.800> at

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
game for example this game is set at

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.879 
game for example this game is set at
6,000<00:05:14.060> or<00:05:14.180> 7,000<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:16.990> also<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.199> game<00:05:18.380> can<00:05:18.590> end

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
6,000 or 7,000 and also the game can end

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.580 
6,000 or 7,000 and also the game can end
if<00:05:19.300> all<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.690> command<00:05:21.020> vehicles<00:05:21.470> are

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
if all the command vehicles are

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.610 
if all the command vehicles are
destroyed<00:05:21.979> now<00:05:22.520> what<00:05:22.699> our<00:05:22.850> command<00:05:23.150> vehicles

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
destroyed now what our command vehicles

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.460 
destroyed now what our command vehicles
basically<00:05:25.210> these<00:05:26.210> are<00:05:26.419> very<00:05:26.630> expensive<00:05:26.930> units

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
basically these are very expensive units

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.610 
basically these are very expensive units
they<00:05:27.800> cost<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.580> 200<00:05:29.389> points<00:05:29.660> each<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.500> when

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
they cost to 200 points each and when

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.590 
they cost to 200 points each and when
you<00:05:30.710> bring<00:05:30.889> them<00:05:31.039> to<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.160> sector<00:05:31.490> then<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.449> will

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
you bring them to a sector then you will

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.320 
you bring them to a sector then you will
be<00:05:32.720> getting<00:05:33.250> earning<00:05:34.250> some<00:05:34.430> revenue<00:05:34.820> from<00:05:35.150> the

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
be getting earning some revenue from the

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.120 
be getting earning some revenue from the
sector<00:05:35.600> for<00:05:35.780> example<00:05:35.840> here<00:05:36.320> go<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.770> have<00:05:37.070> a

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
sector for example here go I have a

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.159 
sector for example here go I have a
command<00:05:37.430> vehicle<00:05:37.729> here<00:05:37.940> at<00:05:37.970> every<00:05:38.630> 4<00:05:38.840> seconds

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
command vehicle here at every 4 seconds

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.760 
command vehicle here at every 4 seconds
a<00:05:39.289> mere<00:05:39.500> earning<00:05:39.949> one<00:05:40.100> credit<00:05:41.470> which<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:42.620> can

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
a mere earning one credit which I can

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.200 
a mere earning one credit which I can
then<00:05:42.800> use<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.160> send<00:05:43.610> more<00:05:44.539> reinforcements<00:05:46.210> so

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
then use to send more reinforcements so

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.850 
then use to send more reinforcements so
as<00:05:47.479> soon<00:05:47.720> as<00:05:48.220> one<00:05:49.220> side<00:05:49.490> loses<00:05:49.940> all<00:05:50.650> see<00:05:51.650> use

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
as soon as one side loses all see use

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.279 
as soon as one side loses all see use
the<00:05:52.699> command<00:05:53.030> unit<00:05:53.720> then<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.740> game<00:05:54.889> is<00:05:55.010> over

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
the command unit then the game is over

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.560 
the command unit then the game is over
for<00:05:57.289> example<00:05:57.590> in<00:05:57.650> this<00:05:57.800> game<00:05:58.010> the<00:05:58.970> target<00:05:59.330> was

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
for example in this game the target was

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.800
