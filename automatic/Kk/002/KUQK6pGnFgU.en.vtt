00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:20.230
 hello mobile sea friends here we have the 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.419
 nokia 1320 the note 3 and 5 as we can 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.840
 check are three different types of 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.840
 sizes 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:34.130
 In Nokia Lumia 1320 are 6 inches the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.820
 North 3 are 5.7 inches and in those 5 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.270
 5 inches exactly 495 as we can 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.020
 check here we have the two formats 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.340
 of the size and really then here 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.920
 inside we can get an idea of 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.280
 which one we may like the most when it comes to 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.070
 have one or another phone we can 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.570
 Check that the Nokia is the largest 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.570
 of all with their Ã­nfulas 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:08.880
 the note 3 is very near the nokia 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.210
 but its size is more reduced and the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.300
 5 well, it is well below 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.240
 those 2 and the truth is that you also see 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.470
 very well the screen and others have to 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.260
 say that 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.000
 and if we see there is a check 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.490
 quite important difference between 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.490
 three we can not see the three 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.689
 how would they be 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.780
 and obviously the biggest of all 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.530
 is the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.530
 the nokia 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.369
 how can we check 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.490
 The Nokia Lumia are 6 inches and its 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.490
 size is a size d 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:09.110
 164 with 285 with nine 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.110
 and 98 thick 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.490
 as for the note 3 it has a size d 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.940
 151 with 2 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.130
 79 with 2 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:34.680
 and 8.3 and the 15th month has a size of 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.680
 one hundred 37 869 with 1 859 thickness 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.530
 what we wanted is in this video to see 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.700
 that you see the differences in the size of 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.069
 each one for you to see 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.709
 which one do you like best or which do you want 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:59.500
 They go better to your needs in this 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:02.410
 case I think the Nokia is a bit 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.510
 excessively large by the way that 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.590
 has and by the weight that is a weight that 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:13.300
 round 220 grams instead 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:16.660
 we compared the 13 are 168 and one of its 5 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.750
 they are 130 with which we are talking 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:26.319
 practically that Nokia is almost double 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.860
 than a 5 in weight and in size then 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.069
 we also see that it is much bigger 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.930
 and we can check here we see 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.930
 much bigger 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.390
 so then good is a way of 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.210
 to be able to compare which is the best 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.720
 comes for your needs in the 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.180
 next video we will make a comparison of 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.790
 how each one navigates how the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.579
 photos in each in one and in another and 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.359
 and nothing and above all navigation 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:05.400
 youtube to see what you think in a 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.939
 greeting friends and see you in the 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.939
 next video
