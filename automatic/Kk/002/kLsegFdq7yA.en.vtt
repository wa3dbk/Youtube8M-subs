00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
actually then damage the muscle the name

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.179 
actually then damage the muscle the name
black<00:01:43.140> blade<00:01:43.380> comes<00:01:43.649> from<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.829> fact<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.039> you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
black blade comes from the fact that you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.099 
black blade comes from the fact that you
go<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.429> look<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.789> muscle<00:01:45.119> later<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.960> down

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
go and look at the muscle later on down

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:47.539 
go and look at the muscle later on down
the<00:01:46.170> line<00:01:46.320> after<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:46.859> animal<00:01:47.159> may<00:01:47.249> have<00:01:47.280> died

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the line after the animal may have died

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.550 
the line after the animal may have died
because<00:01:47.850> often<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.570> fatal<00:01:49.200> disease

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
because often it can be a fatal disease

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.399 
because often it can be a fatal disease
then<00:01:50.340> actually<00:01:50.789> you'll<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:52.170> muscle

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
then actually you'll see the muscle

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.569 
then actually you'll see the muscle
would<00:01:52.499> be<00:01:52.590> blackened<00:01:53.039> has<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.429> been

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
would be blackened has it's been

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.029 
would be blackened has it's been
destroyed<00:01:53.969> by<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> toxins<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.560> said<00:01:55.859> you

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
destroyed by the toxins that said you

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.590 
destroyed by the toxins that said you
know<00:01:56.159> Clostridium<00:01:56.759> very<00:01:57.030> sensitive<00:01:57.479> to

penicillin

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.929 
penicillin
but<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.009> case<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.429> getting<00:01:59.700> in

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
but it's a case of actually getting in

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.219 
but it's a case of actually getting in
there<00:02:00.090> early<00:02:00.359> enough<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.569> catch<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:01.109> disease

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
there early enough to catch the disease

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.700 
there early enough to catch the disease
to<00:02:01.770> hear<00:02:02.429> a<00:02:02.460> stop<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> fatality<00:02:03.469> lost<00:02:04.469> radial

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to hear a stop a fatality lost radial

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.020 
to hear a stop a fatality lost radial
disease<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.159> something<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.609> I<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
disease is something that I think if a

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.419 
disease is something that I think if a
farmers<00:02:06.390> had<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:06.719> he's<00:02:06.869> very<00:02:07.079> aware<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.679> it<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
farmers had it he's very aware of it is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
farmers had it he's very aware of it is
everywhere<00:02:08.910> every<00:02:09.420> cow<00:02:09.570> is<00:02:09.690> theoretically

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
only real way to prevent is in a very

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.250 
only real way to prevent is in a very

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
cost effective way of preventing it is

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.199 
cost effective way of preventing it is
by<00:02:24.440> using<00:02:24.680> clostridial<00:02:25.099> vaccines<00:02:25.700> such<00:02:25.909> as<00:02:26.060> Co

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
by using clostridial vaccines such as Co

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.509 
by using clostridial vaccines such as Co
vaccinate<00:02:26.690> Kovacs<00:02:27.319> intent<00:02:27.769> yeah<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.430> think

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
vaccinate Kovacs intent yeah I think

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.089 
vaccinate Kovacs intent yeah I think
that<00:02:28.819> there's<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.060> potential<00:02:29.420> for<00:02:29.629> a<00:02:30.500> case<00:02:30.920> of

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
that there's a potential for a case of

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.559 
that there's a potential for a case of
black<00:02:31.280> plague<00:02:31.489> on<00:02:31.670> pretty<00:02:31.910> much<00:02:32.000> every<00:02:32.330> farm

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
black plague on pretty much every farm

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.150 
black plague on pretty much every farm
you'll<00:02:32.720> find<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.110> it's<00:02:33.470> there<00:02:33.799> if<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.040> look

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
you'll find it it's there if you look

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.619 
you'll find it it's there if you look
hard<00:02:34.370> enough<00:02:34.430> you'll<00:02:34.730> find<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> bacteria

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
hard enough you'll find the bacteria

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.420 
hard enough you'll find the bacteria
Clostridium<00:02:36.110> Chauvet<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.769> think<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.250> you'll

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
Clostridium Chauvet I think it is you'll

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.690 
Clostridium Chauvet I think it is you'll
actually<00:02:37.459> find<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.150> in<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.360> soil<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.709> it's

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
actually find it in the soil and it's

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.970 
actually find it in the soil and it's
they're<00:02:41.060> essentially<00:02:41.959> waiting<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:42.860> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
they're essentially waiting for the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.910 
they're essentially waiting for the
right<00:02:43.220> set<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.549> circumstances<00:02:44.379> which<00:02:45.379> enable

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
right set of circumstances which enable

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.400 
right set of circumstances which enable
it<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.069> then<00:02:46.790> go<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.150> cause<00:02:47.450> disease<00:02:47.870> bit

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
it to then go on and cause disease bit

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.170 
it to then go on and cause disease bit
like<00:02:48.590> clostridial<00:02:48.920> diseases<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:49.579> sheep<00:02:49.819> that

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
like clostridial diseases in sheep that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.509 
like clostridial diseases in sheep that
you<00:02:50.329> can<00:02:50.510> go<00:02:50.690> quite<00:02:51.349> possibly<00:02:51.739> for<00:02:51.859> for

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
you can go quite possibly for for

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.520 
you can go quite possibly for for
several<00:02:52.700> years<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.180> then<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.450> get<00:02:53.629> the<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
several years and then you get the the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.900 
several years and then you get the the
incident<00:02:54.980> at<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.190> right<00:02:55.370> time<00:02:55.609> that<00:02:55.790> means

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
incident at the right time that means

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.300 
incident at the right time that means
you<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.269> get<00:02:56.390> out<00:02:56.450> an<00:02:57.410> outbreak<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.829> black<00:02:58.129> sea

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
you can get out an outbreak of black sea

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.740 
you can get out an outbreak of black sea
and<00:02:58.340> outbreak<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.849> struck<00:02:59.150> in<00:02:59.299> sheep<00:02:59.540> and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and outbreak the struck in sheep and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.780 
and outbreak the struck in sheep and
bang<00:02:59.900> you've<00:03:00.140> got<00:03:00.379> problems<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.129> a<00:03:01.250> number<00:03:01.760> of

bang you've got problems in a number of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.699 
bang you've got problems in a number of
sheep<00:03:02.030> when<00:03:02.209> you've<00:03:02.359> seen<00:03:02.569> no<00:03:02.690> problems<00:03:03.079> for

frustrating vaccination is very cheap
and<00:04:24.560> very<00:04:25.160> easy<00:04:26.290> so<00:04:27.290> if<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.620> just<00:04:27.830> imagine<00:04:27.980> the

and very easy so if you just imagine the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.970 
and very easy so if you just imagine the
cost<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.700> losing<00:04:29.030> one<00:04:29.570> beast<00:04:29.870> every<00:04:30.650> two<00:04:30.830> or

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
cost of losing one beast every two or

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.330 
cost of losing one beast every two or
three<00:04:31.010> years<00:04:31.390> would<00:04:32.390> probably<00:04:33.080> pay<00:04:33.860> for<00:04:34.190> the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
three years would probably pay for the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.940 
three years would probably pay for the
vaccinations<00:04:35.000> on<00:04:35.120> your<00:04:35.330> farm<00:04:35.600> for<00:04:35.950> two

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
vaccinations on your farm for two

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.190 
vaccinations on your farm for two
generations

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
generations

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.110

so<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.830> strudel<00:04:40.040> disease<00:04:40.370> is<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.550> strange<00:04:40.910> one

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120

so the strudel disease is a strange one
in<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.390> they<00:04:41.780> look<00:04:41.960> fine<00:04:42.140> today<00:04:42.380> I'm<00:04:42.920> very

often the very best one in the field is

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.540 
often the very best one in the field is
