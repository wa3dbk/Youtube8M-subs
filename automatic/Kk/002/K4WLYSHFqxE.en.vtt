00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
really fast non burnout at least I think

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.550 
really fast non burnout at least I think
it<00:00:40.870> hasn't<00:00:40.989> been<00:00:41.110> on<00:00:41.290> me<00:00:41.469> yet<00:00:42.900> redstone<00:00:43.900> clock

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
it hasn't been on me yet redstone clock

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.330 
it hasn't been on me yet redstone clock
so<00:00:45.330> here<00:00:46.330> I've<00:00:46.480> done<00:00:46.690> it's<00:00:47.110> for<00:00:47.290> normal<00:00:47.860> the

so here I've done it's for normal the
default<00:00:48.760> setting<00:00:49.210> two<00:00:49.720> repeaters<00:00:50.079> one<00:00:50.650> that

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
default setting two repeaters one that

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.850 
default setting two repeaters one that
way<00:00:50.950> on<00:00:51.250> this<00:00:51.490> way<00:00:51.670> okay<00:00:52.360> come<00:00:52.570> over<00:00:52.600> that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
way on this way okay come over that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.830 
way on this way okay come over that

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
callously run go to leaving out some of

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.470 
callously run go to leaving out some of
the<00:00:55.930> power<00:00:56.380> nets<00:00:56.710> good<00:00:57.010> get<00:00:57.880> some<00:00:58.030> resin<00:00:58.329> up

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
the power nets good get some resin up

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.660 
the power nets good get some resin up
and<00:00:58.780> then<00:00:59.290> quickly<00:00:59.650> destroy<00:01:00.130> them<00:01:00.250> places

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
and then quickly destroy them places

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.720 
and then quickly destroy them places
three<00:01:01.180> times

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
three times

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.899 
three times
I'll<00:01:03.730> one<00:01:04.360> time<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.809> works<00:01:05.049> and<00:01:05.979> now<00:01:06.250> it

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
I'll one time that works and now it

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.130 
I'll one time that works and now it
looks<00:01:07.090> like<00:01:07.180> you're<00:01:07.329> splashing<00:01:07.540> randomly<00:01:08.079> and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
looks like you're splashing randomly and

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.889 
looks like you're splashing randomly and
it's<00:01:08.409> not<00:01:08.590> going<00:01:08.740> very<00:01:09.659> consistently<00:01:10.659> but

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
it's not going very consistently but

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.289 
it's not going very consistently but
people<00:01:11.140> without<00:01:11.259> that<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:12.850> going<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.180> now

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
people without that this is going in now

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.359 
people without that this is going in now
and<00:01:13.630> let's<00:01:14.439> see<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:14.829> weren't<00:01:15.009> so<00:01:15.100> controls

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
and let's see it weren't so controls

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.800 
and let's see it weren't so controls
lock<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.520> don't<00:01:15.729> think<00:01:15.909> that's<00:01:16.479> how<00:01:16.569> look<00:01:18.810> okay

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
that's weird

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.529 
that's weird
but<00:01:21.520> let's<00:01:21.700> see<00:01:21.850> what<00:01:21.939> happened<00:01:22.210> when<00:01:22.270> I<00:01:22.359> put

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.389 
but let's see what happened when I put
this<00:01:22.600> down<00:01:22.749> a<00:01:22.929> lot<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.139> time<00:01:23.259> guys<00:01:23.409> okay<00:01:23.829> wait

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
it's yeah but it's super fast it sounded

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.749 
it's yeah but it's super fast it sounded
super<00:01:34.450> signal<00:01:34.990> but<00:01:35.229> even<00:01:35.740> this<00:01:35.979> makes<00:01:36.639> it<00:01:36.729> a

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
super signal but even this makes it a

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.120 
super signal but even this makes it a
bit<00:01:36.850> like<00:01:36.969> this<00:01:37.090> fears<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.380> that's<00:01:38.920> pretty

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130

that's<00:01:39.869> super<00:01:40.869> really<00:01:41.560> really<00:01:41.770> fast<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.310> I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
that's super really really fast and I

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.370 
that's super really really fast and I
just<00:01:43.029> saw<00:01:43.149> but<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:43.719> still<00:01:43.899> that<00:01:44.079> that's

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380

worried

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
worried

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.560 
worried
so<00:01:46.209> why<00:01:46.389> let's<00:01:47.079> not<00:01:47.200> look<00:01:47.289> something

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.350 

that<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:54.070> like<00:01:54.220> as<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.820> post<00:01:55.030> videos<00:01:55.150> about

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
that it's like as I post videos about

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.580 
that it's like as I post videos about
1052<00:01:56.050> gold<00:01:56.230> or<00:01:56.500> diamonds<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:59.050> watches<00:01:59.350> video

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.740 
pretty cool anyway that's a super-fast
redstone<00:02:08.500> clock<00:02:08.649> it's<00:02:09.369> pretty<00:02:10.270> useful<00:02:10.420> I

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
redstone clock it's pretty useful I

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.490 
redstone clock it's pretty useful I
don't<00:02:10.930> know<00:02:10.990> if<00:02:11.050> these<00:02:11.230> will<00:02:11.380> actually

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
don't know if these will actually

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.620 
don't know if these will actually
haven't<00:02:11.830> used<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.190> anything<00:02:12.430> yet<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.940> just
