00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.359 
so much better when you put it in sport
mode<00:02:07.289> throttle<00:02:08.289> response<00:02:08.380> becomes<00:02:09.039> just

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
mode throttle response becomes just

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.040 
mode throttle response becomes just
about<00:02:09.610> instantaneous<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.810> when<00:02:10.929> you're

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
about instantaneous and when you're

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.900 
about instantaneous and when you're
driving<00:02:11.170> around<00:02:11.500> corners<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.400> transmission

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
driving around corners the transmission

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.699 
driving around corners the transmission
is<00:02:13.030> doing<00:02:13.300> most<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> braking<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.500> so

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
is doing most of the braking for you so

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.199 
is doing most of the braking for you so
as<00:02:14.830> soon<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.069> you<00:02:15.190> let<00:02:15.340> off<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.670> throttle<00:02:15.700> you

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
as soon as you let off the throttle you

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.910 
as soon as you let off the throttle you
start<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.810> slow<00:02:17.020> down<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:17.590> you've<00:02:17.739> got

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
start to slow down and then you've got

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.680 
start to slow down and then you've got
the<00:02:18.100> lower<00:02:18.250> gear<00:02:18.550> ready<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.970> speed<00:02:19.239> up<00:02:19.390> out<00:02:19.540> of

there we thought we'd test out the nav
system<00:03:07.300> now<00:03:07.690> I've<00:03:07.930> got<00:03:08.140> mixed<00:03:08.320> feelings<00:03:08.440> about

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
system now I've got mixed feelings about

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.560 
system now I've got mixed feelings about
the<00:03:09.010> nav<00:03:09.160> system<00:03:09.190> on<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.820> one<00:03:10.000> hand<00:03:10.240> the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
the nav system on the one hand the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.290 
the nav system on the one hand the
interface<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.170> very<00:03:11.470> elegant<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.120> like

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
interface is very elegant and I like

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.370 
interface is very elegant and I like
that<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.510> tells<00:03:13.690> me<00:03:13.810> where<00:03:13.960> I<00:03:13.990> need<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.230> go

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
that it tells me where I need to go

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.630 
that it tells me where I need to go
right<00:03:14.590> up<00:03:14.740> here<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> LED<00:03:15.460> in<00:03:15.550> the

right up here in the LED in the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930

my eyes too far off the road on the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
interface choices are very intuitive I

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.750 
interface choices are very intuitive I
mean<00:03:23.170> even<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.470> Toyota<00:03:23.890> Tundra<00:03:24.070> we<00:03:24.370> tested

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
mean even the Toyota Tundra we tested

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.840 
mean even the Toyota Tundra we tested
had<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.150> touchscreen<00:03:25.570> LCD<00:03:25.840> but<00:03:26.830> this<00:03:27.010> one<00:03:27.250> it

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
had a touchscreen LCD but this one it

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.950 
had a touchscreen LCD but this one it
feels<00:03:27.910> more<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:28.270> you're<00:03:28.480> operating<00:03:28.570> an

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960

feels more like you're operating an

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
etch-a-sketch I really don't like that

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.880 
etch-a-sketch I really don't like that
it<00:03:31.810> doesn't<00:03:31.960> have<00:03:32.170> real-time<00:03:32.560> traffic

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
it doesn't have real-time traffic

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.640 
it doesn't have real-time traffic
because<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.550> did<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:34.080> wouldn't<00:03:35.080> be<00:03:35.260> stuck<00:03:35.500> in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
because if it did I wouldn't be stuck in

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.970 
because if it did I wouldn't be stuck in
it<00:03:35.770> right<00:03:35.920> now

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
it right now

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.410 
it right now
now<00:03:38.980> with<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.400> nav<00:03:39.580> system<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:40.180> get<00:03:40.390> a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
now with the nav system you get a

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.390 
now with the nav system you get a

might<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:36.949> think<00:05:37.400> I'd<00:05:37.520> up<00:05:37.669> with<00:05:37.819> the<00:05:37.879> 2.0<00:05:38.360> turbo

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
might I think I'd up with the 2.0 turbo

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.269 
might I think I'd up with the 2.0 turbo
I<00:05:38.840> mean<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.020> engine<00:05:39.289> is<00:05:39.409> more<00:05:39.560> fun<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:40.069> they

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
I mean the engine is more fun and they

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.670 
I mean the engine is more fun and they
start<00:05:40.550> around<00:05:40.749> 26,000<00:05:41.749> which<00:05:41.870> is<00:05:42.020> after<00:05:42.349> you

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
start around 26,000 which is after you

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.649 
start around 26,000 which is after you
trig<00:05:42.889> it<00:05:43.009> out<00:05:43.159> still<00:05:43.819> about<00:05:44.029> 10<00:05:44.270> grand<00:05:44.509> less

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
trig it out still about 10 grand less

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.600
