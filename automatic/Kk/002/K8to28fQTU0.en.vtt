00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello friends of the respondes January in the 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.460
 today's video I 'll show you how 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.770
 do the hidden sewing that is used in 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.320
 I bag the stores and in many things 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.820
 where they use action to sleep with their 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.860
 Prepared or avoided to show you how 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.370
 is done and the great I know that the secret of 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.710
 The hidden seam is glue for 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.039
 agreement 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.750
 come on, the first thing to do is 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.750
 paste the two new ones that we are going to use 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.500
 let's see how it comes out because a lot 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.270
 amount I do not have 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.270
 We put on both sides 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.810
 I had not noticed that I was 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.810
 ending if I had not bought 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.890
 good ones 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.640
 you are going to be better sure you 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.460
 they put more quantity they scatter it well 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.470
 we leave it between 10-15 minutes and then 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.740
 just sticks so it sticks with more 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.970
 force once we hit the two hours 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.409
 what we do is 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.240
 we mark him 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 a cut in the middle of the area 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.650
 a not too deep cut 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.680
 but that is marked 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.640
 we do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.320
 after we mark the cut of the two 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.229
 sides we make holes more or less in 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.890
 one centimeter or two centimeters according to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.180
 size also of what they are doing 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.480
 the holes have to enter 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.830
 on one side by the middle of the line that 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.790
 we mark and have to leave the other side 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.379
 as well 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.379
 by the middle of the line 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.130
 once we did 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.130
 we mark the holes again 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.260
 so that time passes easily by 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.260
 it 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.020
 Now let's start sewing this would 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.020
 a hidden seam of long run 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.110
 we went through the first hole 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.230
 as I did not have enough that the mind does not 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.080
 it hit very well but you sure 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.670
 it will be better 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.670
 we went through the first hole 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.870
 and now what we do 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.970
 for the same 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.269
 through the same hole we put the line in 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.269
 diagonal 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.329
 and we make it go out 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.190
 through the second hole 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.480
 especially 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.379
 and we take well down 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.310
 and someone pointed already was pretty 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.410
 simulated 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.530
 now in the second hole we do what 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.530
 same 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.020
 we make 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.180
 another stitch if I wanted we could not 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.230
 have saved the first step of putting together 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.690
 the holes and have left 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.160
 directly me to have more or less 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.300
 as a reference where I want to go by 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.830
 that marks them 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.320
 and we do the same 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.320
 we are looking for a diagonal and we left 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.620
 In the third 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.990
 we adjust well 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.990
 we close the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.280
 the stitch 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.280
 we adjust 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.710
 well, we do the same thing 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.520
 we enter diagonal 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.580
 and we make it go out 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.580
 through the next hole 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.910
 yes 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.230
 plus 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.500
 we like firm always remember 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.030
 after adjusting carry with the nails 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.140
 the seams 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.140
 that is closing 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.920
 so that it stays hidden after 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.310
 when we finish it we put soap or 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.690
 fat and that disguises ma sewing the 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.650
 we grab with a clamp so that it 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.440
 close plus the cut and ready you have to 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.670
 hidden to finish them off in the part of 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.430
 forward and a half in the back what 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.470
 we do with two ponytails the same 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.990
 We do needlework , but it goes on 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.970
 medium in this case that comes out the means of 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.180
 We cut the area there, ready, it is not 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.070
 good thing here we have the sewing 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.810
 hidden I hope you have served them 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.970
 that is not understood and see you in the 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.070
 next video corner of sojero up 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.330
 the next and thanks for the support 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.330
 see you, chao
