you hook up to and then it's a plastic
line<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.720> line<00:02:06.990> there<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.350> gets

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
line you see that line there it gets

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.410 
line you see that line there it gets
hooked<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.860> down<00:02:08.099> there<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:08.939> it<00:02:09.030> goes<00:02:09.149> all

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
hooked up down there then it goes all

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.229 
hooked up down there then it goes all
the<00:02:09.450> way<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.890> water<00:02:11.129> dumps<00:02:12.090> up

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
the way up here and the water dumps up

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.449 
the way up here and the water dumps up

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.259 
a piece of pipe like this and went to
the<00:02:45.020> hardware<00:02:45.200> store<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:45.739> got<00:02:46.100> them<00:02:46.250> two<00:02:47.000> foot

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
pinhole is and I'm not sure that's

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.240 
pinhole is and I'm not sure that's
creating<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.480> entire<00:02:53.600> problem<00:02:54.080> or<00:02:54.380> not<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:55.220> I

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
okay so this water line right here going

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.720 
okay so this water line right here going
up<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.500> icemaker<00:03:11.950> I'm<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.550> have

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
up to the icemaker I'm going to have

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.270 
up to the icemaker I'm going to have
that<00:03:12.940> located<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.840> think<00:03:14.500> where<00:03:14.740> it<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.220> he

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
cut it back down here and up here

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.620 
cut it back down here and up here
somewhere<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.650> I'm<00:03:20.860> gonna<00:03:21.040> fix<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.580> now<00:03:22.420> how
