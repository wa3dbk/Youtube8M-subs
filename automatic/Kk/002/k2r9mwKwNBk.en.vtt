00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
I've noticed one thing these like to UM

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.679

heal<00:04:47.810> themselves<00:04:48.499> like<00:04:49.159> a<00:04:49.460> lot<00:04:49.819> um<00:04:51.039> and<00:04:52.689> while

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:53.689 
heal themselves like a lot um and while

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.019 
heal themselves like a lot um and while
you're<00:04:53.719> fighting<00:04:54.110> them<00:04:54.379> they<00:04:54.499> heal<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.639> I've

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:56.029 
you're fighting them they heal so I've

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.360 
you're fighting them they heal so I've
noticed<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.840> there's<00:04:57.050> one<00:04:57.469> good<00:04:57.949> thing<00:04:58.009> that

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
noticed that there's one good thing that

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.540 
noticed that there's one good thing that
about<00:04:59.180> these<00:04:59.449> guys<00:04:59.659> is<00:04:59.719> the<00:05:00.319> fact<00:05:00.560> that<00:05:00.740> uh<00:05:00.889> I

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
about these guys is the fact that uh I

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.760 
about these guys is the fact that uh I
guess<00:05:02.539> they're<00:05:02.719> probably<00:05:02.900> good<00:05:03.169> for<00:05:03.199> training

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
guess they're probably good for training

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.189 
guess they're probably good for training
on<00:05:03.889> I'm<00:05:04.460> not<00:05:04.610> sure<00:05:04.669> who<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.240> hell<00:05:05.270> trains<00:05:05.900> on

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
on I'm not sure who the hell trains on

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.429 
on I'm not sure who the hell trains on
revs<00:05:06.639> but<00:05:07.639> it's<00:05:08.150> possible<00:05:08.599> because<00:05:09.080> these

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:09.439 
revs but it's possible because these

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.999 
revs but it's possible because these
guys<00:05:09.650> do<00:05:10.310> actually<00:05:11.270> heal<00:05:12.110> themselves<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:12.770> I

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
guys do actually heal themselves and I

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.800 
guys do actually heal themselves and I
guess<00:05:13.250> training<00:05:13.789> would<00:05:13.849> be<00:05:14.060> pretty<00:05:14.479> easy<00:05:16.810> like

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
guess training would be pretty easy like

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.059 
guess training would be pretty easy like
a<00:05:17.839> boss<00:05:18.020> like<00:05:18.199> a<00:05:18.289> boss<00:05:18.319> like<00:05:18.589> a<00:05:18.680> boss<00:05:18.710> like<00:05:18.979> a

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069
