00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.810
 constantly on both devices and 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.410

 they said that labeling people 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.440
 I usually label people in those 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.810
 things and they do not like the past of 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.470
 the backpacks that I think only do not 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.470
 he did it then 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.870
 you do not know who to label the truth like this 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.760
 what 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.060
 I do not know I do not know the truth that I do not know 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.040
 tag occurs because you tagged them 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.020
 all of you not to all who are 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.940
 youtubers make that tactical gala in their 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.590
 devices and as I tell them says this 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.889
 nobody is for things that I was missing because 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.569
 I already brought them so 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.400
 the annex without the vote hey told me to 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:47.759

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.669
 just apply us I tell them we do not 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:53.189

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.740
 that I said ok I'm missing the ipod and already for 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.779
 complete the trilogy that my 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.669
 devices in the three years interest of 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:03.810
 the people of joves is not that leave as 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:06.029
 that forgotten in that and then nothing in 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.800
 cent per study label all my 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:11.270
 ubs labeled obviously 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.050
 no a lion 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:17.800
 12 in sonic he 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:22.599
 before everything, that is, there is nothing 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:25.030
 tag manuel mi tocayo manuel ticket 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:26.530
 or ham, although he already did it so 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.419
 you can label the because it was already 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.770
 commits that this causes and I think the can 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.090
 world then like who can 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.310
 the people that a science did then 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.830
 the tax does not want to be labeled and 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.740
 So, here, you like to do it, because you do it 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:42.749
 and I spend it in fort your cha and happy 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:46.870

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.009
