us was all of life where we found out
very<00:01:46.100> soon<00:01:46.430> into<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.940> trial<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.570> wear

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
very soon into the trial that the wear

very soon into the trial that the wear
was<00:01:48.380> very<00:01:48.650> good<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.130> fact<00:01:49.490> at<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.940> Honda<00:01:50.300> terms

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
was very good in fact at a Honda terms

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.300 
was very good in fact at a Honda terms
of<00:01:50.630> kilometers<00:01:51.080> was<00:01:51.290> better<00:01:51.560> than<00:01:51.800> most<00:01:52.010> other

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
of kilometers was better than most other

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.230 
of kilometers was better than most other
brands<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.540> for<00:01:54.110> us<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.470> was<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.820> all-round<00:01:55.820> very

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
brands so for us it was a all-round very

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.719 
brands so for us it was a all-round very
good<00:01:56.420> trial<00:01:59.530> prior<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.830> trial<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.460> we

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
good trial prior to the trial and we

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.160 
good trial prior to the trial and we
wouldn't<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.030> imagined<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.840> rolling

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
wouldn't have imagined the rolling

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.540 
wouldn't have imagined the rolling
resistance<00:02:03.229> would<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.890> made<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.190> much<00:02:04.430> of

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
resistance would have made this much of

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.010 
resistance would have made this much of
a<00:02:04.610> difference<00:02:04.970> but<00:02:05.240> we<00:02:05.390> would<00:02:05.630> be<00:02:05.780> very

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
a difference but we would be very

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.100 
a difference but we would be very
proactive<00:02:06.619> towards<00:02:07.570> testing<00:02:08.570> this<00:02:08.690> sort<00:02:08.990> of

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
proactive towards testing this sort of

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.900 
proactive towards testing this sort of
theory<00:02:09.320> this<00:02:09.679> trial<00:02:10.009> was<00:02:10.190> done<00:02:10.369> on<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.850> a

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
theory this trial was done on on a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.270 
theory this trial was done on on a
tractor<00:02:11.330> unit<00:02:11.630> basis<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.200> we<00:02:12.590> believe<00:02:12.800> there's

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
tractor unit basis so we believe there's

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.490 
tractor unit basis so we believe there's
more<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.700> saving<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.270> come<00:02:14.510> when<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:14.959> roll<00:02:15.350> it

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
more of a saving to come when we roll it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.600 
more of a saving to come when we roll it
out<00:02:15.590> across<00:02:15.709> our<00:02:16.040> trailer<00:02:16.310> fleet<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:17.500> 5.25%

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
out across our trailer fleet so 5.25%

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.250 
out across our trailer fleet so 5.25%
