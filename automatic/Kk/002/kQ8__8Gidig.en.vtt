00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
type at the belt round and then you just

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.140 
type at the belt round and then you just
crack<00:02:17.540> up<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.680> idea<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.280> keep<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.670> keep

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
crack up the idea is to keep the keep

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.729 
crack up the idea is to keep the keep
the<00:02:20.180> engineering<00:02:20.780> simples<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.470> there's<00:02:21.590> no

really<00:02:31.850> just<00:02:32.210> make<00:02:32.420> something<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.810> on

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
really just make something up on

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.160 
really just make something up on
delivery<00:02:34.370> use<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> pedal<00:02:35.990> power

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170

doesn't<00:02:47.450> take<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.750> much<00:02:47.900> energy<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.470> mean

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
doesn't take that much energy I mean

00:02:49.180 --> 00:03:16.610 
doesn't take that much energy I mean
it's<00:02:50.180> not<00:02:50.239> like

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.520
