00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
well you know what I think there are a

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.920 
well you know what I think there are a
lot<00:03:28.639> of<00:03:28.670> stigmas<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.120> stereotypes<00:03:29.269> about

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
public housing communities and I think

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.340 
public housing communities and I think

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
methodologies it was really about how do

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:07.960 
methodologies it was really about how do
we<00:04:06.859> bring<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.130> whole<00:04:07.280> community<00:04:07.730> together

we bring the whole community together
well<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.569> thing<00:04:09.110> is<00:04:09.140> none<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.620> us<00:04:09.769> is<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.069> smart

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
well the thing is none of us is a smart

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.450 
well the thing is none of us is a smart
or<00:04:10.849> a<00:04:10.879> strong

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
or a strong

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.400 
or a strong
all<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.820> us<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.180> together<00:04:12.630> we<00:04:13.050> can<00:04:13.200> really

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
all of us and together we can really

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.660 
all of us and together we can really
make<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.590> difference<00:04:13.890> if<00:04:14.190> we<00:04:14.310> all<00:04:14.430> come

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
make a difference if we all come

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.830 
make a difference if we all come
together<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.120> think<00:04:15.210> if<00:04:15.510> we<00:04:15.630> learn<00:04:15.810> anything

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
together I think if we learn anything

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.720 
together I think if we learn anything
from<00:04:16.320> this<00:04:16.470> election<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.250> power<00:04:17.460> of<00:04:17.670> the

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
from this election is the power of the

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.790 
from this election is the power of the
voice<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.210> the<00:04:18.330> people<00:04:18.480> if<00:04:18.840> we<00:04:19.290> really<00:04:19.530> try<00:04:19.740> to

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
voice of the people if we really try to

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.130 
voice of the people if we really try to
come<00:04:20.010> together<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.520> create<00:04:20.640> change<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.390> we

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
come together to create change and we

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.480 
come together to create change and we
might<00:04:22.320> have<00:04:22.560> not<00:04:22.920> enough<00:04:23.160> resources

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.400 
might have not enough resources
individually<00:04:24.330> but<00:04:24.450> if<00:04:24.570> we<00:04:24.690> come<00:04:24.870> together<00:04:25.020> we

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
individually but if we come together we
