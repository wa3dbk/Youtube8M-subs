glove hand into the bear hand so if a
player<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:07.050> catching<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.830> ball<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.850> two

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
player is catching the ball with two

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.910 
player is catching the ball with two
hands<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.660> same<00:01:09.840> time<00:01:10.200> they're<00:01:10.860> gonna

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
hands at the same time they're gonna

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.800 
hands at the same time they're gonna
have<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.190> stiff<00:01:11.490> wrist<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> slower<00:01:12.330> exchange

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have a stiff wrist and a slower exchange

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
have a stiff wrist and a slower exchange
here<00:01:13.619> we're<00:01:13.890> trying<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.190> tap<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.550> ball<00:01:14.670> into

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
here we're trying to tap the ball into

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
here we're trying to tap the ball into
our<00:01:15.119> bare<00:01:15.330> hand<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> quickest<00:01:16.200> exchange

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
our bare hand for the quickest exchange

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.680 
our bare hand for the quickest exchange
so<00:01:17.220> we're<00:01:17.369> only<00:01:17.460> catching<00:01:18.030> half<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> bet

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
so we're only catching half of the bet

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.510 
so we're only catching half of the bet
half<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> baseball<00:01:19.560> instead<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
half of the baseball instead of the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.400 
half of the baseball instead of the
whole<00:01:20.700> ball<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.180> when<00:01:21.660> we<00:01:21.780> receive<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> ball

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
whole ball and when we receive the ball

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.740 
whole ball and when we receive the ball
this<00:01:22.650> way<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.130> player<00:01:23.640> should<00:01:23.970> never<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
this way a player should never have to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.540 
this way a player should never have to
close<00:01:25.020> his<00:01:25.229> glove<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.619> next<00:01:31.890> step<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> put

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
close his glove the next step is to put

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.420 
close his glove the next step is to put
the<00:01:32.580> glove<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.180> use<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the glove on and use it to have also the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
the glove on and use it to have also the
wrist<00:01:35.670> hinge<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> two-piece<00:01:36.509> glove<00:01:36.810> move<00:01:37.080> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
wrist hinge and two-piece glove move and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.559 
wrist hinge and two-piece glove move and
this<00:01:38.069> is<00:01:38.220> done<00:01:38.460> both<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:38.819> same<00:01:39.179> way<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.539> I

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
this is done both the same way when I

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.480 
this is done both the same way when I
receive<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> ball<00:01:40.289> or<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:40.800> I<00:01:40.830> feel<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.250> ground

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
receive a ball or when I feel the ground

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
receive a ball or when I feel the ground
ball<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:42.270> infielders<00:01:43.080> right<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.679> ball

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
ball good infielders right when the ball

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.430 
ball good infielders right when the ball
takes<00:01:44.160> that<00:01:44.369> last<00:01:44.759> hop<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.450> ground<00:01:45.720> you'll

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
takes that last hop on the ground you'll

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.529 
takes that last hop on the ground you'll
see<00:01:46.679> that<00:01:46.830> naturally<00:01:47.490> their<00:01:47.670> hand<00:01:47.910> awfully

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
see that naturally their hand awfully

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.230 
see that naturally their hand awfully
often<00:01:49.140> extends<00:01:49.679> back<00:01:49.890> before<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> comes<00:01:51.090> back

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
often extends back before it comes back

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.270 
often extends back before it comes back
through<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> baseballs<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.710> receive<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:53.190> in

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
through the baseballs I receive it in

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.040 
through the baseballs I receive it in
the<00:01:53.369> ground<00:01:53.520> ball<00:01:53.819> well<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:54.929> we

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
the ground ball well this is what we

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.540 
the ground ball well this is what we
want<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.319> do<00:01:55.410> from<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> standing<00:01:56.039> position<00:01:56.160> when

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
want to do from a standing position when

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.309 
want to do from a standing position when
we<00:01:56.580> receive<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.060> as<00:01:57.149> well<00:01:57.330> making<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:58.080> hand

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
we receive it as well making my hand

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.380 
we receive it as well making my hand
softer<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.860> independent<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.910> we'll<00:02:00.060> start

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
softer and independent so we'll start

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.359 
softer and independent so we'll start
now<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.750> our<00:02:00.840> receiving<00:02:01.289> position<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.220> what

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
now in our receiving position but what

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160 
now in our receiving position but what
I'll<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.789> players<00:02:03.060> do<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.509> open<00:02:04.020> their

I'll have the players do is open their
glove<00:02:04.440> hand<00:02:04.679> slightly<00:02:05.119> pre<00:02:06.119> flexing<00:02:06.780> that

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
glove hand slightly pre flexing that

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.230 
glove hand slightly pre flexing that
wrist<00:02:07.319> so<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> ball<00:02:08.490> hits<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.030> flat

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240

surface<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> glove<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.590> forces<00:02:11.250> my

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
surface of the glove it forces my

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.730 
surface of the glove it forces my
fingers<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.360> extend<00:02:12.840> into<00:02:13.290> my

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
fingers to have to extend into my

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.220
