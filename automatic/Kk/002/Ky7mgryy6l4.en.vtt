00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
Hello. We had an exclusive interview with the main vocal of hot Korean band CNBLUE in Shanghai earlier.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.190
Check it out.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.700
Jung Yong Hwa met with his fans bringing his warm smiles to Shanghai.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.430
He was first known playing a role in the K drama "You're Beautiful".

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.580
But he as a singer, with his musical talents, is what makes him a charmer.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.330
The new album has good sales in Japan and that makes him very happy.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.740
He talked about that enthusiastically (in the interview).

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.100
When the album was released, for both Korea and Japan...

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.490
Of course I'm very happy that the album is well received.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.300
But the fact that the album I created can be released is a very happy thing itself.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.540
I'm most grateful to the fans who support us.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.220
Will work even harder to repay their love.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.620
Jung Yong Hwa, who's been busy singing and acting,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.210
is going to have a fully packed schedule in 2014 too.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.430
To be busy with work like that is a very happy thing to Jung Yong Hwa.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.030
Now I'm reviewing scripts, and choosing scripts.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.640
I'm also preparing my solo album.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.530
Now for these two projects ... I'm not sure which will happen first.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.070
Anyway, this year will be a very busy one.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.040
Also, a happy year.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.010
Jung Yong Hwa has not filmed any movies yet, but he wants to be a movie actor as soon as possible.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.540
He always comes to China because of work.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.560
He wants to start his movie career in China too.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.450
But I haven't even started filming movies

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.030
But I would be so happy if I really had the opportunity to do it in China.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.130
Because I've come to China many times for work,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.540
it's like I begin to like China more and more every time I come.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.980
For a movie, who ever the actors (to collaborate with), I'm very happy to be a part.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.040
(Genre?) ... as long as the script is good.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.040
I really want to try.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.720
It's not that easy to be good as a singer and an actor at the same time.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.350
But Jung Yong Hwa is very confident on this,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.630
"I'm quite good for both roles."

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.530
I was first trained to be a singer,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.070
but when I'm working in dramas, everybody calls me an actor.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.490
So I begin to think I'm quite good doing both.
