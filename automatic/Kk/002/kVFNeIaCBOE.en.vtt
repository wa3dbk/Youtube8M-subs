tier and what I wanted to show you today
in<00:00:24.120> this<00:00:24.270> video<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> piano<00:00:25.860> engine

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
in this video is that the piano engine

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.590 
in this video is that the piano engine
in<00:00:26.910> both<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.360> these<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.500> fact<00:00:28.830> identical<00:00:29.760> so

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
in both of these is in fact identical so

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.350 
in both of these is in fact identical so
whether<00:00:31.050> I'm<00:00:31.260> playing<00:00:31.290> something<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.969> PX

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
whether I'm playing something on the PX

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.940 
whether I'm playing something on the PX
5s<00:00:36.890> or<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> 350

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.950 

it's<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.220> same<00:00:44.490> engine<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.420> sounds<00:00:45.810> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it's the same engine and it sounds the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
it's the same engine and it sounds the
same<00:00:46.200> because<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.190> same<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
same because they are the same and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.970 
same because they are the same and
they're<00:00:48.060> both<00:00:48.239> set<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.960> grand<00:00:49.230> piano<00:00:49.620> concert

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
they're both set for grand piano concert

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:59.430 
they're both set for grand piano concert
so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.090 

all<00:01:00.440> right<00:01:00.620> now<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.879> 350<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:02.949> can<00:01:03.949> make

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
all right now with the 350 I can make

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.070 
all right now with the 350 I can make
some<00:01:04.460> adjustments<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.360> tone<00:01:05.600> they<00:01:05.900> have

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
some adjustments to the tone they have

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.359 
some adjustments to the tone they have
some<00:01:06.350> limited<00:01:06.979> hard<00:01:07.940> SEC<00:01:08.600> reverb<00:01:09.590> which

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
some limited hard SEC reverb which

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.889 
some limited hard SEC reverb which
really<00:01:10.790> doesn't<00:01:11.030> make<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.149> much<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.689> a

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
really doesn't make that much of a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.380 
really doesn't make that much of a
difference<00:01:12.350> but<00:01:12.680> when<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.250> comes<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.880> PX

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
difference but when it comes to the PX

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.130 
difference but when it comes to the PX
5s<00:01:15.220> everything<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.399> editable<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:17.119> can<00:01:17.659> make<00:01:17.869> any

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
5s everything is editable I can make any

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.320 
5s everything is editable I can make any
sound<00:01:18.649> my<00:01:19.310> own<00:01:19.549> completely<00:01:20.240> now<00:01:21.229> again<00:01:22.009> with

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
sound my own completely now again with

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.359 
sound my own completely now again with
limited<00:01:23.330> reverb<00:01:23.659> up<00:01:23.899> here<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.950> doesn't<00:01:25.130> even

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
limited reverb up here it doesn't even

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.820 
limited reverb up here it doesn't even
make<00:01:25.820> much<00:01:26.060> sense<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.720> show<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:26.990> but<00:01:27.500> when<00:01:27.740> it

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
make much sense to show you but when it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.880 
make much sense to show you but when it
comes<00:01:28.069> to<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.369> PX<00:01:28.729> 5s<00:01:29.440> I've<00:01:30.440> got<00:01:30.679> complete

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
comes to the PX 5s I've got complete

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.190 
comes to the PX 5s I've got complete
control<00:01:31.490> over<00:01:31.610> different<00:01:32.240> types<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.810> reverb

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
control over different types of reverb

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.620 
control over different types of reverb
but<00:01:33.440> listen<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:38.770> as<00:01:39.770> I<00:01:40.399> adjust<00:01:40.630> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
but listen to this as I adjust the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:56.740 
but listen to this as I adjust the
reverb<00:01:41.929> level<00:01:53.979> pretty<00:01:54.979> sweet<00:01:55.310> huh<00:01:55.509> alright

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
reverb level pretty sweet huh alright

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.410 
reverb level pretty sweet huh alright
and<00:01:56.840> in<00:01:57.350> addition<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:58.009> reverb<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:59.030> things

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
and in addition to reverb the things

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.240 
and in addition to reverb the things
that<00:01:59.659> I<00:01:59.690> have<00:01:59.960> control<00:02:00.170> over<00:02:00.469> here<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.159> I'm

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
that I have control over here that I'm

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.850 
that I have control over here that I'm
going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.640> use<00:02:01.909> more<00:02:02.329> often<00:02:02.840> than<00:02:03.079> not<00:02:03.110> with

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
going to use more often than not with

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.810 
going to use more often than not with
them<00:02:04.520> with<00:02:04.670> any<00:02:04.850> other<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.619> EQ<00:02:06.619> know<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.490> first

four<00:02:08.209> knobs<00:02:08.509> K<00:02:09.019> 1<00:02:09.229> through<00:02:09.470> K<00:02:09.769> for<00:02:10.540> default

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
four knobs K 1 through K for default

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.349 
four knobs K 1 through K for default
here<00:02:12.109> to<00:02:12.500> EQ<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:14.000> K<00:02:14.480> one<00:02:14.780> being<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.859> bass<00:02:16.459> and

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
here to EQ the K one being the bass and

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:25.089 
here to EQ the K one being the bass and
I'll<00:02:18.400> increase<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.459> beats<00:02:19.850> as<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.420> play

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.360 

and<00:02:26.060> we'll<00:02:26.780> do<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.989> same<00:02:27.200> thing<00:02:27.260> with<00:02:27.650> there's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and we'll do the same thing with there's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.349 
and we'll do the same thing with there's
two<00:02:28.730> actually<00:02:29.629> mid-range<00:02:30.379> knob<00:02:31.189> so<00:02:31.700> mid-range

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
two actually mid-range knob so mid-range

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.020 
two actually mid-range knob so mid-range
one<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.019> two<00:02:33.260> or<00:02:33.500> mid-range<00:02:33.980> low<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.549> high<00:02:34.700> so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
one and two or mid-range low and high so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.899 
one and two or mid-range low and high so
let's<00:02:35.239> start<00:02:35.480> with<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:35.750> low<00:02:38.889> and<00:02:39.889> then<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
let's start with the low and then the

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:54.280 
let's start with the low and then the
high<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.819> let's<00:02:46.819> go<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.420> treble<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.870> you

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
high and let's go to the treble so you

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.280 
high and let's go to the treble so you
can<00:02:54.470> see<00:02:54.879> just<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.090> fact<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.629> can<00:02:56.840> control

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
can see just the fact that I can control

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.409 
can see just the fact that I can control
that<00:02:57.530> beautiful<00:02:58.069> reverb<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.760> way<00:02:58.909> it<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.209> on

00:02:59.409 --> 00:02:59.419 
that beautiful reverb the way it is on

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.979 
that beautiful reverb the way it is on
the<00:02:59.480> px5<00:03:00.169> yes<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:01.459> tone<00:03:01.730> that's<00:03:02.510> enough

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
the px5 yes and the tone that's enough

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.869 
the px5 yes and the tone that's enough
to<00:03:03.169> make<00:03:03.349> me<00:03:03.500> want<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.799> take<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.280> pretty<00:03:04.639> much

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879
