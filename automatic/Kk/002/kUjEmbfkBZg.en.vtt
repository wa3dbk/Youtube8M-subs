00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
off around with a death machine or a war

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.250 
off around with a death machine or a war
machine<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.390> hands<00:01:03.690> fully<00:01:03.960> loaded

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
machine in your hands fully loaded

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740 
machine in your hands fully loaded
that's<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:05.880> damage<00:01:06.150> now<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that's gonna do some damage now I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.780 
that's gonna do some damage now I
remember<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> war<00:01:07.860> machine<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.460> counts

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
remember with the war machine it counts

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.550 
remember with the war machine it counts
as<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> projectile<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.750> don't<00:01:09.960> shoot<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.380> right

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
as a projectile so don't shoot it right

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.109 
as a projectile so don't shoot it right
away<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.460> spawn<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.909> because

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
away right when you spawn in because

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.280 
away right when you spawn in because
it's<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> count<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.200> on

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
it's not going to count as you see on

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.410 
it's not going to count as you see on
screen<00:01:13.320> right<00:01:13.590> here<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.580> yeah<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.119> know<00:01:15.299> as
