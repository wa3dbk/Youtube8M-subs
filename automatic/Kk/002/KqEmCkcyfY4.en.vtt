00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
professionally I don't have a particular

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
professionally I don't have a particular
role<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.890> mind<00:01:44.130> though<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.400> mean<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.759> guess<00:01:44.909> it

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
role in mind though I mean I guess it

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.999 
role in mind though I mean I guess it
would<00:01:45.210> depend<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.930> everything<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.740> doesn't

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
would depend on everything it doesn't

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.410 
would depend on everything it doesn't
depend<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.550> in<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> role<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.000> depends

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
depend just in the role that depends

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.719 
depend just in the role that depends
again<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.050> director<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.040> producer<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729

they

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
they

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.670 
they
I<00:02:01.240> guess<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.270> mean<00:02:02.630> there's<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:03.410> lot<00:02:03.530> of
