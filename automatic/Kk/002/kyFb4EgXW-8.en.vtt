00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.690
 so friends number one acceleration was 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.290
 is devoted to the fourth stage of acceleration 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.200
 number 2 3 and 4 were dedicated to the seventh 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.590
 stage and how do you think what it will be 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.449
 dedicated to acceleration number five 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.300
 please look at the cube and rate 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.850
 setting seven stages 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.789
 made accordingly we conclude that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.720
 this acceleration will be devoted to the eighth 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.939
 stage 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.309
 and probably you already guessed what 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.860
 will be discussed 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.829
 We try to dock the ribs with the centers 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.219
 have to make aunts and uncles happened that 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.910
 we have one uncle here here aunt 2 uncle 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.730
 here and here aunt but these uncles and aunts 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.070
 are against each other this is 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.770
 the most terrible situation that you 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.780
 always infuriated at the eighth stage I 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.699
 I know for sure because I'm on my own 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.280
 time was also very angry 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.230
 and I know the reaction of the children who are trying 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 try to collect speed cube 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.640
 set a record and here you are 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.580
 Nezhdanchik on the eighth and the crowd appears 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.490
 Uncle Opposite Uncle and Aunt Opposite Aunt 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.360
 but there is a quick solution and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.549
 this problem, those who have already watched mine 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.220
 Rubik's cube training videos 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.180
 with eyes closed probably already 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.770
 understand how to solve this problem i 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.759
 talked about some combination 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.720
 West is exactly this combination will help us 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.150
 get down to solve this problem the question is how 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 correctly take the cube and question number two 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.579
 how to make a combination of west to question 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.000
 number one answer is very simple 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.790
 need to keep uncles to themselves and uncles back 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.149
 question number 2 the answer is also very 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.360
 i need to watch my video on 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.450
 assembling a Rubik's Cube with eyes closed 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.520
 not all twenty-seven parts from participation in 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.299
 which I tell about the combination 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.740
 west of the volume we described in detail it can 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.740
 look right here 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.790
 now it may seem that the cube is assembled 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.030
 in fact it is wrong now i 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.700
 I will do this very combination of west I will do 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.850
 her fast enough for you 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.280
 able to appreciate all her strength all her power and 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.560
 so you are sure that her 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.290
 really need to learn and she you 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.510
 will help speed up your build and so 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.190
 your attention a combination of west with 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.800
 by which you are much faster 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.680
 can deal with the eighth stage in 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.960
 when we have uncles 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.440
 on each other and you don't have to 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.290
 do here a long 14 running combination 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.140
 two times by the way the combination of west is also 14 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.970
 running but remember these 14 moves in 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.460
 this case is simply necessary in order 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.430
 not to hope for miracles and not 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.650
 hope that in the eighth stage you 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.260
 get into a simpler situation when 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:12.370
 two uncles are next to each other and 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:18.550
 so combination west that's all 8 stage 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.120
 made to compare show you 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.790
 did 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.610
 if in this situation did not know 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.250
 combination west you would first make 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.770
 the same 14x new algorithm in which 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.320
 we are tired turned off the light we went 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.390
 the roof started a long night afterwards 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.100
 turned on the light long day turned off 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.440
 light went to london killed a man 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.800
 swept away the traces of the crime left 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:48.790
 London turned on the lights and got 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.850
 The following picture is such a picture 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.630
 now we have two uncles near and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.530
 would repeat this 14x new combination 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.900
 agree to this you would have gone 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.930
 much more time than that 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.150
 to just do in this case 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.370
 combination of west once again model this 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.470
 situation here they are two uncle opposite friend 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.630
 friend is and do with you 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:16.900
 combination west and all 8 stage 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.080
 made dear friends do not be lazy teach 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.710
 new algorithms and you will succeed before 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.710
 new meetings
