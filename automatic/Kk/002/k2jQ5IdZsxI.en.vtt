00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.570
 like two cities next to each other, right? 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 and I have this privilege forever in the aerial bridge 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.430
 trying to enjoy what both have good but beats a longing for the river 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.850
 I'm Rio in this house, so I miss it. 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.260

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.430
 the comedian 990 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.760
 which I think will be a cheap 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.930
 we have everything to be very cool. 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.920
 the nature 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.250
 and so it's all improvise marcelo teles 15 minutes and the how do you do everything 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.479

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.779
 the area last night and each time he and the family force maximum but 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.379
 suffered a little longer 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.799
 I live there that he moves I do not know if it ends and from day to day just like you 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.799
 It's all improvisation but first fight than good. 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.859
 and they had 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.969
 It's all improvisation because we did not want minutes like that. 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.540
 It is a script that we can exempt, which are the best but not the 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.179
 who improvised 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.179
 and what is cool that marks everyone is an improvisation right? 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.339
 What we want is peace and emerges in the hour arise with freshness 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.539
 what he thinks the same thing to do then it is different who improvised to see 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.269
 by the difference of the heat the interpretation sometimes I do is a 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.889
 very plastered thing 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.299
 you lose there 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.299
 to these frills be reproduced to after the warm 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.999
 then improvise a cockroach I love to do carousel I think the fans are 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.509
 improvised with more illegal ones are 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:05.279
 sometimes things 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.439
 jacques leclair do you think of this new wave of comedians zenas 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.970
 each of these new colleagues adapted to the snow 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.049
 This is with cn 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.519
 I think it's a comedy. 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.609
 the comedy truck by an authorial path or what matters now is the 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:22.639
 that I think 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.689
 my impressions the comedian is more free so I imagine misses 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:27.929
 young 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:31.879
 arriving because here they try to carry you the dna of that generation that is to 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:32.889
 Same time 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.129
 of the internet of the computer but that was born there in the 80 been different 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.609
 is a character that the most traditional are a generation that 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.989
 has a legal duality and now one can think that the time of doctor 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.919
 with the internet and anyone can make a video 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.839
 and bota on the internet and are successful and people follow this because until the 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:56.619
 new democracy then new democracy brings new names with new ideas is 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.930
 very good
