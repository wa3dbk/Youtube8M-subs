00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.320
 lausanne the topic relatively leads me to 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:21.140
 writing so say she was insane 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:21.140
 make coffee unevenly if you 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 still clearly demonstrated that the team 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 Of course I like to do it like that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 power yes you do not have coffee 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.899
 make in your broadcast 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.989
 I'll do that for you, thank you 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.320
 many times , but there is a very strong 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.320
 coffee 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.220
 Of course freshly ground nespresso 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 models 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.970
 what are you doing there there is one 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.470
 there is a reason to celebrate 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.100
 just had one behind me 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.100
 Tied up 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.760
 I wrote a book 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.720
 you wrote a book that knows 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.550
 I myself 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.320
 what it is in the book is there a 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.960
 spiritual work a very thick doctrine 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:54.760
 a spiritual empty there you only come as 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:58.510
 Author question who this book you have 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.820
 how bad how to write a book pen 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.150
 and paper and then you start 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:09.700
 gm leaves a blank line and afterwards 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:13.540
 one writes one so one writes one 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.120
 book believe me it was not so easy 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.190
 how he sounds I wrote to him 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.510
 I use the blank lines I use 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.680
 short vacation 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.080
 then i wrote b i wrote i stand up 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.880
 and then suddenly I was like you 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.860
 the problem was the hair was mine 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.280
 fancy 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.720
 just like you is okay I have you 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.880
 even mention it in the book 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.880
 you mentioned me or in my head 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.440
 blank and there I have something set 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.940
 he writes something in the header 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.740
 sign it but it is not that 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.140
 What I wanted to do was what I did 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:09.060
 wanted to make a dash but it 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:11.760
 was a hyphen is a book one 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.350
 Arbitrary collection of letters 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.500
 the letters you all know 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:22.310
 Letters and there it comes 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.870
 Steep template what in kÃ¶then 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.040
 These are letters we already considered 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.830
 children consonants continue to follow 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:40.050
 further reflexes 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:41.840
 You have to use them but what are common 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.450
 Sounds 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:51.240
 what's wrong with my book no you 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:55.320
 but are even more loud markets 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 quickly the question has different vocals 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:04.330
 there is no hair 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.550
 As far as vocals are concerned, no hair is not 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.860
 explain again look that was one 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.960

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.639

 The book is called a coffee set 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:35.110
 Coffee was more of a spontaneous one 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:37.599
 deposits and what 's up in this 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.680
