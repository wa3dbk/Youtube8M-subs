00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.880
 bass 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:35.909
 if you have two threads slider left then 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:41.960
 bass will be less if we are under and new 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.960

 these are the settings for the surround bass that is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:01.110
 if you are two strands to the right then 3d 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.869
 sound will increase if you move 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.570

 improve the quality of the bass on your 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.439

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.730
