and answer calls volume up and down and

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.139 
and answer calls volume up and down and
this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.789> such<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> sticker<00:00:48.860> which<00:00:50.000> feels<00:00:51.000> off

like<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.850> pushing<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.030> center<00:00:54.390> console<00:00:54.660> out

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
like so pushing this center console out

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.979 
like so pushing this center console out
lets<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.890> switch<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> speaker<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.969> off
