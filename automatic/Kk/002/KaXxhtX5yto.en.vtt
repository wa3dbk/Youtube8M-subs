00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.620
 the video today is a little recipe chair 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.490
 wax to shave the wrist 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.059
 We're going to need sugar. 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.720
 I chose that one gets honey brown and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.760
 a few drops of lemon 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 then there are about two tablespoons of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.710
 sugar and two tablespoons of honey but I do not 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.300
 tell me not too much more or less 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.300
 by the quantity thus in the other 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:43.330
 I take the microwave for more or less 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.240
 one minute and then I'll take a look and 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:51.280
 sugar has not completely melted 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.980
 I put one more minute it stays like this 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.770
 with balls but after we 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.150
 put the droplets of lemon he gets 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.280
 best 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.000
 so here I add some more 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.000
 lemon droplets 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.180
 and the consistency stayed like this we go 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.120
 leave for a few seconds until you 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.050
 warm not cold but also not hot 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.870
 to be able to use good now I go 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.350
 pass mirror then I was being made 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:33.130
 a little noise and then we'll use 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.720
 a little piece of queue to do 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:43.180
 apply card and then pull too much 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:46.810
 You just pull and just go to a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.060
 little but it's normal and you can 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.080
 apply the damper again and pull 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.600
 again 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.300
 While you feel you have me, you 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.930
 pull again 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.170
 So do this one on both sides. 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.350
 right 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.830
 It's just good, it's a good recipe. 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.570
 simple and you can do it in your 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.840
 house that I hope you have 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.769
 I liked it, thank you very much for watching. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.769
 ae
