straight clipping and I absolutely love

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.370 
straight clipping and I absolutely love
those<00:00:33.270> clipping<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.809> only<00:00:33.960> thing<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.200> really

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
those clipping so only thing I really

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.170 
those clipping so only thing I really
don't<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.190> they're<00:00:35.670> really<00:00:35.850> really

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
don't like is that they're really really

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
don't like is that they're really really
thin<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.710> you're<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:38.010> sure<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.280> can

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
thin and if you're not sure you can

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.619 
thin and if you're not sure you can
blend<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.879> them<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> little<00:00:39.540> bit

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
blend with them but it's a little bit

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.990 
blend with them but it's a little bit
harder<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.020> build<00:00:40.170> them<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> nice

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
harder to build them but I think a nice

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.880 
harder to build them but I think a nice
guy<00:00:42.480> he<00:00:42.660> won<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.020> definitely<00:00:43.260> recommend<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
guy he won so I definitely recommend a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.040
