00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:16.830
 we are embarrassed this week the authorities 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.640
 by pastry by herman duriez and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.349
 is pharma is what I propose it is 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960
 to experience what is more 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.000
 difficult in this profession of perfumer there 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.599
 I propose to make you a blind test 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.710
 so I take a smell at random and you 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.440
 will try to recognize her 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.629
 I look at him do not look at all 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.820
 way I hide so you'll see it's 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:45.300
 very very confusing but I'm sure 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:48.810
 that you have a good and it's a smell 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.489
 familiar you do not know but that at the beginning 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.480
 when you opened I told myself 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 cucumbers but no it's the sea 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.920

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.739
 a second go go it's gone 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 yes, it's gone so you do not look at it 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.189
 y to pull there is a trap 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 you will recognize but you must me 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.499
 say all of the hour's water 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.499

 ya with good it's sweet yes so I 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.600
 would say it's sweet it's a pastry 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.010

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 lemon or lemon tart 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.600
