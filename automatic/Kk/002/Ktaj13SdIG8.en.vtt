don't know anything about them so go

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.590 
don't know anything about them so go
check<00:00:44.320> that<00:00:44.380> out<00:00:44.610> I've<00:00:45.610> melted<00:00:45.940> these<00:00:46.210> in<00:00:46.510> the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
check that out I've melted these in the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.030 
check that out I've melted these in the
microwave<00:00:46.750> at<00:00:47.290> 50%<00:00:47.800> power<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:50.739> find

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
microwave at 50% power and if you find

microwave at 50% power and if you find
the<00:00:51.370> candy<00:00:51.700> melts<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.090> be<00:00:52.210> too<00:00:52.510> thick<00:00:52.750> you<00:00:53.110> can

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
the candy melts to be too thick you can

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.930 
the candy melts to be too thick you can
thin<00:00:53.470> them<00:00:53.590> out<00:00:53.710> by<00:00:53.950> using<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.309> little<00:00:54.489> bit<00:00:54.730> of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
thin them out by using a little bit of

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.389 
thin them out by using a little bit of
vegetable<00:00:55.510> shortening<00:00:55.840> or<00:00:56.140> some<00:00:56.739> low<00:00:57.010> tastes

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
vegetable shortening or some low tastes

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.380 
vegetable shortening or some low tastes
vegetable<00:00:58.270> oil<00:00:58.600> now<00:00:59.610> to<00:01:00.610> make<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.059> petals

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
vegetable oil now to make the petals

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.869 
vegetable oil now to make the petals
you'll<00:01:01.540> need<00:01:01.690> some<00:01:01.840> plastic<00:01:02.350> spoons<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.280> need

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
you'll need some plastic spoons you need

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.580 
you'll need some plastic spoons you need
plastic<00:01:04.119> spoons<00:01:04.660> because<00:01:04.899> they<00:01:05.020> have<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.500> be

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
plastic spoons because they have to be

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.530 
plastic spoons because they have to be
flexible<00:01:05.830> in<00:01:06.250> order<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.580> remove<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.210> petals

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
flexible in order to remove the petals

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.190 
flexible in order to remove the petals
after<00:01:07.899> they've<00:01:08.110> hardened<00:01:08.500> I<00:01:10.200> experimented

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
after they've hardened I experimented

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.529 
after they've hardened I experimented
with<00:01:11.410> this<00:01:11.979> technique<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:13.030> found<00:01:13.300> that<00:01:13.420> the

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
with this technique and I found that the

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.330 
with this technique and I found that the
best<00:01:13.660> way<00:01:13.869> to<00:01:13.960> do<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.410> was<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.649> put<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.009> little

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
best way to do it was to put a little

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.730 
best way to do it was to put a little
bit<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.420> melted<00:01:16.869> candy<00:01:17.140> melts<00:01:17.530> on<00:01:17.619> the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
bit of the melted candy melts on the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.850 
bit of the melted candy melts on the
back<00:01:17.890> of<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.190> spoon<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:19.470> then<00:01:20.470> give<00:01:20.619> them<00:01:20.740> a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
back of the spoon and then give them a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.000 
back of the spoon and then give them a
little<00:01:21.159> tap<00:01:21.369> that<00:01:22.270> has<00:01:23.110> two<00:01:23.350> purposes<00:01:23.710> it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
little tap that has two purposes it

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.440 
little tap that has two purposes it
spreads<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.520> out<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.670> little<00:01:24.820> bit<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.270> also

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
spreads it out a little bit and it also

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.200 
spreads it out a little bit and it also
makes<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.900> nice<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.080> smooth<00:01:26.560> if<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.880> petal<00:01:28.150> is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
makes it nice and smooth if the petal is

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.630 
makes it nice and smooth if the petal is
not<00:01:28.360> quite<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:29.110> your<00:01:29.470> liking<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.130> can<00:01:30.340> spread

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
not quite to your liking you can spread

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.219 
not quite to your liking you can spread
it<00:01:30.790> out<00:01:30.850> a<00:01:30.909> little<00:01:31.180> bit<00:01:31.420> more<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.960> get<00:01:32.049> the

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
it out a little bit more to get the

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.649 
it out a little bit more to get the
shape<00:01:32.439> that<00:01:32.470> you<00:01:32.860> want<00:01:33.130> just<00:01:33.850> make<00:01:33.939> sure<00:01:34.330> that

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
shape that you want just make sure that

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.330 
shape that you want just make sure that
you<00:01:34.780> stay<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.350> center<00:01:35.560> of<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.010> back<00:01:36.159> of

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
you stay in the center of the back of

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.460 
you stay in the center of the back of
the<00:01:36.430> spoon<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.000> don't<00:01:37.630> go<00:01:37.840> too<00:01:37.900> near<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
the spoon and don't go too near the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.810 
the spoon and don't go too near the
edges<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.369> spoon<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:42.250> go<00:01:42.369> too<00:01:42.430> near

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
edges of the spoon if you go too near

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.060 
edges of the spoon if you go too near
the<00:01:42.850> edges<00:01:43.270> it'll<00:01:43.689> be<00:01:43.810> harder<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.320> remove<00:01:44.890> the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
the edges it'll be harder to remove the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.640 
the edges it'll be harder to remove the
petals<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:46.420> can<00:01:46.570> also<00:01:46.720> dip<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.290> back<00:01:47.439> of<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
petals you can also dip the back of the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.280 
petals you can also dip the back of the
spoon<00:01:47.920> into<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.520> candy<00:01:48.880> melts<00:01:49.180> like<00:01:50.140> I'm

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
spoon into the candy melts like I'm

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.570 
spoon into the candy melts like I'm
doing<00:01:50.590> here<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:50.979> I'm<00:01:51.040> just<00:01:51.070> gonna<00:01:51.250> show<00:01:51.369> you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
doing here and I'm just gonna show you

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.390 
doing here and I'm just gonna show you
what<00:01:51.729> happens<00:01:52.210> if<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.840> make<00:01:53.170> large<00:01:53.740> petals

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
what happens if you make large petals

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.350 
what happens if you make large petals
that<00:01:54.610> cover<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.450> entire<00:01:55.479> back<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.470> spoon

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that cover the entire back of the spoon

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.679 
that cover the entire back of the spoon
and<00:01:59.280> one<00:02:00.280> more<00:02:00.490> time<00:02:00.759> this<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.360> technique

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
and one more time this is the technique

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.109 
and one more time this is the technique
that<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.990> found<00:02:02.320> worked<00:02:02.560> best<00:02:02.650> for<00:02:03.100> me<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.460> little

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
that I found worked best for me a little

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.210 
that I found worked best for me a little
bit<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.360> candy<00:02:04.540> melts<00:02:04.960> on<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.200> back<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
bit of candy melts on the back of the

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.810 
bit of candy melts on the back of the
spoon<00:02:07.619> spread<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.739> out<00:02:08.829> into<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.369> rough<00:02:09.549> shape

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
spoon spread it out into the rough shape

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:20.390 
spoon spread it out into the rough shape
that<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.209> want

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.280 

give<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> little<00:02:21.299> tap<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.900> side<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
give it a little tap on the side of the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.809 
give it a little tap on the side of the
bowl<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:24.200> spread<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.489> now<00:02:26.489> if<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.700> don't

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
bowl just spread it out now if you don't

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.670 
bowl just spread it out now if you don't
like<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.239> shape<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.720> petal<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.440> can

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
like the shape of the petal you can

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.789 
like the shape of the petal you can
alter<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.310> by<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:30.000> using<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.510> piece<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.799> paper

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
alter it by just using a piece of paper

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.660 
alter it by just using a piece of paper
toweling<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.489> then<00:02:35.489> you're

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
toweling just like that then you're

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
toweling just like that then you're
gonna<00:02:35.790> put<00:02:36.030> them<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.420> refrigerator<00:02:36.690> for

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
about five or ten minutes until the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.949 
about five or ten minutes until the
candy<00:02:40.140> melts<00:02:40.349> have<00:02:40.440> hardened<00:02:41.659> now<00:02:42.659> I<00:02:42.720> want<00:02:42.930> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
candy melts have hardened now I want to

candy melts have hardened now I want to
show<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.500> one<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.159> covered<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
show you the one that I covered the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.539 
show you the one that I covered the
entire<00:02:44.970> back<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.750> spoon<00:02:46.260> there<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.129> go<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
entire back of the spoon there we go a

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.720 
entire back of the spoon there we go a
very<00:02:47.970> nice<00:02:48.480> large<00:02:48.840> petal<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.530> believe<00:02:50.489> me<00:02:50.700> I

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
very nice large petal and believe me I

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.509 
very nice large petal and believe me I
tried<00:02:50.909> many<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:52.079> these<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.560> each<00:02:52.799> time<00:02:53.160> I

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
tried many of these and each time I

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.699 
tried many of these and each time I
tried<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.299> them<00:02:54.480> off<00:02:54.629> they<00:02:55.019> crack<00:02:55.379> down

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
tried to get them off they crack down

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.270 
tried to get them off they crack down
the<00:02:55.829> middle<00:02:55.980> or<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:57.000> split<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.959> center

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
the middle or they split in the center

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.160 
the middle or they split in the center
so<00:02:59.280> covering<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> entire<00:03:00.329> back<00:03:00.629> of<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.870> spoon

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
so covering the entire back of the spoon

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.699 
so covering the entire back of the spoon
is<00:03:01.560> not<00:03:01.890> work<00:03:02.400> very<00:03:02.730> well<00:03:03.079> however<00:03:04.079> if<00:03:04.590> you

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
is not work very well however if you

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.380 
is not work very well however if you
keep<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.069> petals<00:03:05.400> small<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.000> put<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.299> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
keep the petals small and put in the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.569 
keep the petals small and put in the
center<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.140> back<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> spoon<00:03:07.799> they

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
center of the back of the spoon they

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.500 
center of the back of the spoon they
just<00:03:08.790> pop<00:03:08.970> right<00:03:09.000> off<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.690> they're<00:03:10.620> perfect

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
just pop right off and they're perfect

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.699 
just pop right off and they're perfect
so<00:03:12.510> when<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.840> make<00:03:12.959> these<00:03:13.200> make<00:03:13.500> sure<00:03:13.530> you

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
so when you make these make sure you

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.530 
so when you make these make sure you
don't<00:03:13.920> go<00:03:14.159> too<00:03:14.190> near<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.700> edges<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.269> spoon

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
don't go too near the edges of the spoon

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.580 
don't go too near the edges of the spoon
and<00:03:16.909> that's<00:03:17.909> why<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.209> need<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.599> flexible<00:03:19.230> spoon

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and that's why you need a flexible spoon

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.069 
and that's why you need a flexible spoon
so<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:19.920> when<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.640> flex<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.180> spoon<00:03:21.569> they<00:03:21.840> pop

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
so that when you flex the spoon they pop

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.930 
so that when you flex the spoon they pop
off<00:03:22.349> so<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.709> bend<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.099> back<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.609> spoon<00:03:23.879> a

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
off so you bend the back of the spoon a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.680 
off so you bend the back of the spoon a
little<00:03:24.030> bit<00:03:25.190> then<00:03:26.190> ice<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.579> cupcake<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.359> green

of<00:04:10.230> flower<00:04:10.470> with<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:10.859> I<00:04:11.069> just<00:04:11.099> thought<00:04:11.760> that

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
of flower with this I just thought that

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.390 
of flower with this I just thought that
I<00:04:12.180> really<00:04:12.480> like<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.840> water<00:04:13.199> lilies<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:13.919> that's

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
I really like the water lilies so that's

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.680 
I really like the water lilies so that's
why<00:04:14.609> I'm<00:04:14.790> decorating<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.389> this<00:04:15.510> way<00:04:17.660> now<00:04:18.660> for

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
why I'm decorating it this way now for

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.279 
why I'm decorating it this way now for
the<00:04:18.930> next<00:04:19.109> one<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:20.220> order<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.579> stop<00:04:20.910> that

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
the next one in order to stop that

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.420 
the next one in order to stop that
frosting<00:04:22.289> mounting<00:04:22.680> up<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:22.979> center<00:04:23.280> I

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
frosting mounting up in the center I

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.159 
frosting mounting up in the center I
just<00:04:23.639> put<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.820> little<00:04:24.000> bit<00:04:24.150> less<00:04:24.270> frosting<00:04:25.020> on

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
just put a little bit less frosting on

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.260 
just put a little bit less frosting on
the<00:04:25.320> top<00:04:25.349> of<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.949> cupcake<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.610> center<00:04:26.970> and

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the top of the cupcake in the center and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.570 
the top of the cupcake in the center and
then<00:04:28.139> inserted<00:04:28.710> some<00:04:28.890> of<00:04:28.979> the<00:04:29.039> white<00:04:29.190> petals

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
then inserted some of the white petals

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.850 
then inserted some of the white petals
all<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:30.000> way<00:04:30.120> around<00:04:30.390> be<00:04:31.200> gentle<00:04:31.620> when<00:04:31.710> you're

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
all the way around be gentle when you're

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.290 
all the way around be gentle when you're
putting<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.159> petals<00:04:32.490> on<00:04:32.729> because<00:04:33.030> they<00:04:33.120> will

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
putting the petals on because they will

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.920 
putting the petals on because they will
break

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
break

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.830 
break
too<00:04:34.169> hard<00:04:34.410> on<00:04:34.590> them<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:36.240> there<00:04:36.360> we<00:04:36.479> go<00:04:36.509> the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
too hard on them so there we go the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.870 
too hard on them so there we go the
white<00:04:37.020> petals<00:04:37.259> and<00:04:37.800> then<00:04:38.160> using<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.699> same

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
white petals and then using the same

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.290 
white petals and then using the same
technique<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.330> put<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.780> yellow<00:04:40.050> Center<00:04:40.500> I

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
technique to put the yellow Center I

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.010 
technique to put the yellow Center I
used<00:04:42.300> about<00:04:42.539> eight<00:04:42.960> petals<00:04:43.500> per<00:04:44.340> cupcake<00:04:45.020> for

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
used about eight petals per cupcake for

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.860 
used about eight petals per cupcake for
this<00:04:46.169> particular<00:04:46.500> one<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.660> there<00:04:48.660> they<00:04:48.840> are

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
this particular one and there they are

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.920 
this particular one and there they are
the<00:04:49.680> buttercream<00:04:50.160> frosting<00:04:50.509> once<00:04:51.509> it<00:04:51.660> dries

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
the buttercream frosting once it dries

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.379 
the buttercream frosting once it dries
we'll<00:04:51.960> set<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.250> we'll<00:04:53.460> hold<00:04:53.610> onto<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.060> petals

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
we'll set and we'll hold onto the petals

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.140 
we'll set and we'll hold onto the petals
quite<00:04:54.690> nicely<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.710> they're<00:04:55.949> pretty<00:04:56.669> easy<00:04:57.000> to

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
quite nicely so they're pretty easy to

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.240 
quite nicely so they're pretty easy to
transport<00:04:57.780> if<00:04:57.930> you<00:04:58.020> put<00:04:58.229> them<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.740> single

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
transport if you put them in a single

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.870 
transport if you put them in a single
layer<00:04:59.400> in<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.699> box<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:02.130> there's<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.460> completed

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
layer in a box and there's the completed

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.020 
layer in a box and there's the completed
cupcakes<00:05:03.270> what<00:05:03.870> they<00:05:04.050> did<00:05:04.289> in<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.949> Karin<00:05:05.850> tack

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
cupcakes what they did in the Karin tack

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.330 
cupcakes what they did in the Karin tack
and<00:05:06.270> Alan<00:05:06.570> Richardson<00:05:06.780> book<00:05:07.259> is<00:05:07.500> they<00:05:08.099> made

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
and Alan Richardson book is they made

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.879 
and Alan Richardson book is they made
these<00:05:08.550> in<00:05:08.849> a<00:05:08.970> mini<00:05:09.240> cupcake<00:05:09.720> version<00:05:10.199> and<00:05:10.380> they

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
these in a mini cupcake version and they

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.580 
these in a mini cupcake version and they
set<00:05:11.160> them<00:05:11.340> into<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.669> shallow<00:05:12.000> dish<00:05:12.389> of<00:05:12.720> blue

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
set them into a shallow dish of blue

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.770 
set them into a shallow dish of blue
jello<00:05:14.070> so<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.610> looked<00:05:14.849> like<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.180> water<00:05:15.389> lilies

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
jello so it looked like the water lilies

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.450 
jello so it looked like the water lilies
were<00:05:15.960> floating<00:05:16.410> in<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.650> pond<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.340> was

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
were floating in a pond and that was

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.020 
were floating in a pond and that was
quite<00:05:17.639> pretty

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
quite pretty

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.000 
quite pretty
so<00:05:18.840> water<00:05:19.259> lily<00:05:19.590> cupcakes<00:05:20.130> give<00:05:20.550> them<00:05:20.699> a<00:05:20.789> try
