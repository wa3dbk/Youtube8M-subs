00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.600 
going to beat any linebacker out there
for<00:01:36.240> me<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> was<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> image<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> game<00:01:37.610> from

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
for me it was the image of the game from

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.219 
for me it was the image of the game from
his<00:01:38.759> positive<00:01:39.150> standpoint<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> Seahawks

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
his positive standpoint for the Seahawks

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.380 
his positive standpoint for the Seahawks
was<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.920> Patrick<00:01:41.340> Willis<00:01:41.549> trailing<00:01:42.090> him<00:01:42.240> on

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
was was Patrick Willis trailing him on

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.389 
was was Patrick Willis trailing him on
his<00:01:42.689> two<00:01:42.869> big<00:01:43.110> catches<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.250> he<00:01:44.310> did

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
his two big catches and one that he did

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.590 
his two big catches and one that he did
not<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:44.759> earlier<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> game<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.390> don't

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
not get earlier in the game I don't

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.730 
not get earlier in the game I don't
think<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:45.869> thrown<00:01:46.110> particularly<00:01:46.590> well

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
think it was thrown particularly well

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.139 
think it was thrown particularly well
but<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.280> know<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.579> cut<00:01:47.820> him<00:01:47.970> across

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
but you know when they cut him across

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.460 
but you know when they cut him across
the<00:01:48.390> middle<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.780> he<00:01:48.960> said<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the middle and he said it in the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.870 
the middle and he said it in the
interview<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:50.009> he's<00:01:50.189> always<00:01:50.310> dying<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
interview you know he's always dying to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
interview you know he's always dying to
see<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> linebacker<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.750> them<00:01:51.869> even<00:01:52.799> though

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
see a linebacker on them even though

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.469 
see a linebacker on them even though
they<00:01:53.009> might<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.430> differently<00:01:53.820> there<00:01:54.390> are<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
they might think differently there are a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
they might think differently there are a
couple<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.869> fast<00:01:55.110> linebackers<00:01:55.770> out<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.130> but

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
couple of fast linebackers out there but

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.010 
couple of fast linebackers out there but
not<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.759> kind<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.119> speed<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.930> know

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
not with this kind of speed and you know

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.300 
not with this kind of speed and you know
you<00:01:58.079> go<00:01:58.229> back<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.770> save<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> tape

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you go back and if you save the tape

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.649 
you go back and if you save the tape
like<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> lot<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.299> back<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
like I know a lot of you do go back and
