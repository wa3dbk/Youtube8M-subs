Engineering reason why I chose to attend

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.380 
Engineering reason why I chose to attend
San<00:01:56.340> Diego<00:01:56.490> State<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.120> of<00:01:57.300> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
San Diego State was because of the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.090 
San Diego State was because of the
engineering<00:01:57.720> program<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.320> well<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:58.920> fact

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
engineering program as well as the fact

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.320 
engineering program as well as the fact
that<00:01:59.220> it's<00:01:59.490> probably<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.940> closest

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
that it's probably the closest

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.900 
that it's probably the closest
University<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.170> Hawaii<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.160> that's<00:02:02.610> always<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
University to Hawaii and that's always a

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.330 
University to Hawaii and that's always a
good<00:02:03.000> thing<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> weather's<00:02:04.860> very

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
good thing and the weather's very

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.160 
good thing and the weather's very
similar<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:06.120> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.600> less<00:02:06.720> humid<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.110> I

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
similar just a little less humid and I

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
similar just a little less humid and I
like<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.190> relationship<00:02:08.759> between

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
like that the relationship between

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400 
like that the relationship between
professors<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.750> students

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

our<00:02:10.580> hands<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:11.850> awesome<00:02:12.890> right<00:02:13.890> now<00:02:13.920> I'm

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
our hands down awesome right now I'm

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.830 
our hands down awesome right now I'm
just<00:02:14.790> starting<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.270> get<00:02:15.420> into<00:02:15.600> my<00:02:15.690> upper

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
just starting to get into my upper

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.480 
just starting to get into my upper
division<00:02:16.080> courses<00:02:16.500> I'm<00:02:16.830> getting<00:02:17.220> into<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
division courses I'm getting into the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.100 
division courses I'm getting into the
lab<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.940> fact<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.480> actually<00:02:18.810> see

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
lab in the fact that I can actually see

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.230 
lab in the fact that I can actually see
what's<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.890> as<00:02:20.310> far<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
what's going on as far as like the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.140 
what's going on as far as like the
circuits<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.050> using<00:02:22.860> transistors<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.790> can

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
circuits and using transistors and I can

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.630 
circuits and using transistors and I can
just<00:02:24.300> go<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.600> on<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.830> really<00:02:26.220> love<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
just go on and on but I really love the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.860 
just go on and on but I really love the
hands-on<00:02:26.940> they<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.420> really<00:02:27.630> good<00:02:27.750> equipment

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
hands-on they have really good equipment

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.110 
hands-on they have really good equipment
and<00:02:28.290> that's<00:02:29.040> definitely<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.430> big<00:02:29.670> plus<00:02:29.820> for<00:02:29.970> me

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
that my freshman year as well I really

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.010 
that my freshman year as well I really
just<00:03:38.400> wanted<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.850> dive<00:03:39.060> into<00:03:39.300> things<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.870> need

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
just wanted to dive into things and need
