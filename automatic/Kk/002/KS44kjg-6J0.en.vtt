I wish the heads inside of borderlands
to<00:01:22.960> look<00:01:23.590> this<00:01:23.770> good<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.610> reason<00:01:24.820> they

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
to look this good and the reason they

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.880 
to look this good and the reason they
actually<00:01:25.450> don't<00:01:25.630> look<00:01:25.960> as<00:01:26.110> good<00:01:26.409> as<00:01:26.469> that<00:01:26.560> is

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
actually don't look as good as that is

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.819 
actually don't look as good as that is
because<00:01:27.310> 4j<00:01:28.090> studios<00:01:28.630> are<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.350> ones<00:01:29.590> that

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
because 4j studios are the ones that

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.670 
because 4j studios are the ones that
made<00:01:30.460> those<00:01:30.700> skins<00:01:31.119> gearbox<00:01:32.020> just<00:01:32.350> allowed

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
made those skins gearbox just allowed

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.920 
made those skins gearbox just allowed
them<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.920> use<00:01:33.159> it<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.340> gearbox<00:01:34.299> isn't<00:01:34.570> putting

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
them to use it so gearbox isn't putting

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.679 
them to use it so gearbox isn't putting
any<00:01:35.200> manpower<00:01:35.560> into<00:01:36.549> working<00:01:36.939> on<00:01:37.060> dlcs<00:01:37.659> for
