00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
season they were very very hard to beat
I<00:01:35.430> think<00:01:35.909> that's<00:01:36.060> how<00:01:36.270> they'll<00:01:36.420> set<00:01:36.659> up

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
I think that's how they'll set up

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.880 
I think that's how they'll set up
they're<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.380> out<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.619> try<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
they're not going to go out and try and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.560 
they're not going to go out and try and
beat<00:01:38.070> chelsea<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> first<00:01:38.850> game<00:01:39.060> they'll

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
beat chelsea in the first game they'll

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
beat chelsea in the first game they'll
set<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.170> they'll<00:01:40.259> try<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.530> park<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> bus

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
set up and they'll try and park the bus

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.280 
set up and they'll try and park the bus
as<00:01:41.340> Jose<00:01:41.579> Jose<00:01:41.640> Mourinho<00:01:41.970> says<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.840> think

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
as Jose Jose Mourinho says so I think

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
as Jose Jose Mourinho says so I think
Chelsea<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.070> find<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> hard<00:01:44.579> breaking<00:01:44.970> them

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
Chelsea will find it hard breaking them

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.600 
Chelsea will find it hard breaking them
down<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.600> think<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:46.500> will<00:01:46.680> eventually<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.369> can

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
down I think they will eventually I can

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580 
down I think they will eventually I can
see<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> one-nil<00:01:48.210> or<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.570> Nilda<00:01:48.840> Chelsea<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.500> I'd

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
see a one-nil or to Nilda Chelsea so I'd

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.340 
see a one-nil or to Nilda Chelsea so I'd
go<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.860> Chelsea<00:01:50.280> another<00:01:50.939> 2.5<00:01:51.450> actually<00:01:51.899> yeah

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
go for Chelsea another 2.5 actually yeah

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.350 
go for Chelsea another 2.5 actually yeah
I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> key<00:01:53.159> factor<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.820> Burnley

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
I think the key factor here is Burnley

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
I think the key factor here is Burnley
with<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> home<00:01:54.869> advantage<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:56.100> selling

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
with the home advantage and they selling

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
with the home advantage and they selling
not<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.759> underestimated<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.600> front<00:01:58.110> of

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
not to be underestimated in front of

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
not to be underestimated in front of
their<00:01:58.259> home<00:01:58.409> fans<00:01:58.610> both<00:01:59.610> teams<00:01:59.820> two<00:02:00.030> scores

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
their home fans both teams two scores

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.690 
their home fans both teams two scores

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
live in the back you know there were

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.420 
live in the back you know there were
best<00:02:13.200> defense<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.739> premier<00:02:14.069> league<00:02:14.189> last

season<00:02:14.670> don't<00:02:15.330> see<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.599> changing<00:02:15.659> have

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
season don't see that changing have

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.259 
season don't see that changing have
strengthened<00:02:16.739> if<00:02:16.860> anything<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.790> think<00:02:17.909> you

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
strengthened if anything so I think you

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.479 
strengthened if anything so I think you
know<00:02:18.299> Chelsea<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.989> keep<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.230> clean<00:02:19.470> sheet<00:02:19.500> it

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
know Chelsea to keep a clean sheet it

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.979 
know Chelsea to keep a clean sheet it
might<00:02:20.700> take<00:02:20.730> them<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.060> while<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.239> break<00:02:21.510> burning

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
might take them a while to break burning

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.030 
might take them a while to break burning
down<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.319> know<00:02:22.379> another<00:02:22.560> bet<00:02:22.799> might<00:02:23.010> be
