00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.960
 Grief and sadness is what you can see 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.330
 right now in the eyes of the 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.650
 neighbors that gave the scare by the flood 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.839
 now the destruction is by the 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.429
 overflow of this river however 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.289
 the water has caused damage that will take 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.820
 some days in returning to be what they were 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.890
 like the school or the health center 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.269
 until the town has moved the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.070
 president of aragon luisa fernanda rudi 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.249
 who has wanted to know personally 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.199
 these damages but still to a waterspout 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.160
 water concentrated in a very short time as 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.840
 you all know 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.550
 if there is any part we can say 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.410
 thank God it has been very 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.059
 early with which the children in the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.730
 school had not yet begun the 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.200
 classes and thank God that has 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.780
 allowed there to be no 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.180
 personal misfortune it is true that as 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.970
 the mayor tells me and he tells me 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.160
 that the president of the confederation 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.660
 graph of the ebro this years ago 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.570
 quite a few years that was not given and that 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.460
 well, it is impossible and impossible to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.440
 foresee something in which they have coincided 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.660
 from the hydrographic confederation of 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.489
 ebro punto president xavier de pedro ha 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.430
 noted that flow has risen to 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.950
 6 meters there is a phenomenon of 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.190
 online storms of about 150 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.320
 kilometers and they have downloaded 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.229
 130 liters in four hours in the same 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 site that has generated a channel 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.070
 secondary like him 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.780
 Rigel passing through Ã¡lava because here there 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.480
 thus reached the height of 6 meters 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.070
 causing significant damage to a school 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.020
 as well as the gauging station 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.450
 because he had the confederation 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.220
 has been literally razed is still 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.170
 soon to assess the damage but from 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.400
 the provincial deputation of zaragoza that 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.960
 is committed to restoring the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.000
 local school that has been 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.310
 completely deprecated the deputation 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.610
 Provincial of Zaragoza will act in the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.500
 reconstruction of the school in 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.600
 issues of public roads in 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.990
 sanitation issues in cleaning 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.410
 daily in everything that is 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.720
 infrastructure that own 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.310
 City Hall has going to act too 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.740
 of course in the arrangement as before 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.509
 said of roads and from there on 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.520
 everything that its purpose is acting 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.560
 without prejudice to the work that is 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.170
 doing that goes beyond what 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.030
 anyone can think now they all look at 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.620
 heaven so that tomorrow I will not go 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.620
 keeps the red alert for rain
