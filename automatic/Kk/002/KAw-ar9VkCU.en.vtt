that then let's move on step two is the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.560 
that then let's move on step two is the
most<00:00:32.130> important<00:00:32.640> part<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.000> learning<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
most important part of learning to

other<00:01:53.399> words<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.909> level<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.430> second<00:01:56.909> ball

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
other words I level so the second ball

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.719 
other words I level so the second ball
starts<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.490> first<00:01:59.490> ball

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
till it reaches I levels it moves

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.030 
till it reaches I levels it moves
towards<00:02:09.850> your<00:02:10.030> off<00:02:10.240> hand<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.930> then<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.740> falls

again<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:27.790> sounds<00:02:28.210> pretty<00:02:28.330> complicated<00:02:28.570> when
