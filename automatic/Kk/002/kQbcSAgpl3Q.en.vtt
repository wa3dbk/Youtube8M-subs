00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello friends this video we did it and eating ata we dedicated a good time 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.590
 to bring you the next preview of the game grand theft auto 4 for pc 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.149
 let us begin 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.900
 unanimously acclaimed by critics and public 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.820
 grand theft auto 4 has become by its own merits in one of the games 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.820
 that have best exploited the potential of the new generation 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.039
 a little more than half a year since its departure for consoles 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.569
 prepares to do the same in pc 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.289
 thanks to a very fickle engine and a video editor that will do the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.120
 delights of any follower of the machinima phenomenon probably we 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.269
 we will find before the best version removed until the moment 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.640
 hamas resolution that real life 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640
 2560 by 1600 pixels 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.400
 that is the maximum resolution that we can support in gt to 4 pc 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.240
 an extremely high number that 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.240
 for those who have a monitor and a graphics card to match them 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.440
 will know glory 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.020
 the improvement that we have seen in the technical aspect is nothing short of abysmal 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.100
 the captures that accompany this text can not even capture I have part 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.450
 that feeling that we had as soon as we saw the immensity of the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.490
 metropolis from the top of one of its skyscrapers 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.119
 if it was more than remarkable the work done by rockstar about it in 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.730
 console now is when it can be appreciated in its entirety 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.740
 but do not be frightened by those who have a more modest machine 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.190
 the minimum requirements enter the current standards 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.760
 leaving enough room for him to run in the most teams 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.160
 possible 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.820
 the error effect 'that every game has the very striking would do if it has not been 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.330
 markedly improved by improving the edges of the characters more fluidity in 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.750
 its movement and the best easier to handle 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.810
 many of you will wonder 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.740
 what kind of commands will be used 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.390
 to play it on the pc the simple and simple answer is 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.330
 the keyboard or any dio and this homemade glass that we have at hand 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.000
 as it has been new the new grand thef auto 4 for pc and also for consoles 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.170
 is the very striking way to take coverage 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.420
 behind a car 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.200
 or anything that can give us protection then I will give the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.899
 following configurations that come by de fort in this pc version 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:15.689
 To designate our movements on foot we will use the following 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.459
 configurations 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.459
 To give the player movement, the keys will be used 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:22.709

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.159
 The key 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.919
 serves to move the player to the left 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:32.920
 the letter s 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.910
