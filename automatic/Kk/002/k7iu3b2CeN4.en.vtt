Sakura shrimp in it and I've never
showed<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.500> tank<00:00:49.879> although<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.390> pretty

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
showed this tank although it was pretty

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.889 
showed this tank although it was pretty
because<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.190> didn't<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.789> people<00:00:53.910> hating<00:00:54.750> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
because I didn't want people hating on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
because I didn't want people hating on
me<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:56.129> having<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.489> filter<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
me for not having a filter that kind of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.080 
me for not having a filter that kind of
thing<00:00:58.309> they<00:00:59.309> were<00:00:59.370> doing<00:00:59.460> quite<00:00:59.820> well

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
somewhere nicer to live with filtration

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.810 
somewhere nicer to live with filtration

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.319 

so<00:01:32.509> this<00:01:32.689> is<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.079> um<00:01:33.829> I'm<00:01:34.549> really<00:01:34.729> happy<00:01:34.999> with

it so far

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.340 
it so far
um<00:01:37.990> most<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.170> these<00:01:39.289> rocks<00:01:39.649> um<00:01:40.549> we'll<00:01:41.000> go<00:01:41.350> these

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
um most of these rocks um we'll go these

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.459 
um most of these rocks um we'll go these
two<00:01:42.679> especially<00:01:43.369> you're<00:01:43.490> just<00:01:43.700> holding<00:01:43.939> down

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
two especially you're just holding down

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.199 
two especially you're just holding down
that<00:01:45.469> plant<00:01:45.799> because<00:01:46.459> they<00:01:46.640> keep<00:01:46.819> wanting<00:01:47.060> to

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
that plant because they keep wanting to

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.709 
that plant because they keep wanting to
float<00:01:47.950> but<00:01:48.950> um<00:01:49.310> yeah<00:01:49.909> I'm<00:01:50.240> just<00:01:50.420> gonna<00:01:50.600> be

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
float but um yeah I'm just gonna be

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.349 
float but um yeah I'm just gonna be
quiet<00:01:50.929> for<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.200> second<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:52.240> show<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.329> guys

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
quiet for a second and show you guys

00:01:53.359 --> 00:03:33.120 
quiet for a second and show you guys
that<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.229> closed<00:01:54.439> hook

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.850 

so<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:34.060> light<00:03:34.270> is<00:03:34.420> pretty<00:03:34.660> strong<00:03:34.960> and<00:03:35.260> I'm

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
so this light is pretty strong and I'm

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.940 
so this light is pretty strong and I'm
hoping<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.430> these<00:03:37.210> plants<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.380> baby<00:03:38.620> tears

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
hoping that these plants the baby tears

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.430 
hoping that these plants the baby tears
and<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.880> one<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.180> back<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:40.570> something

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
and the one in the back is something

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.020 
and the one in the back is something
different<00:03:41.650> although<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.160> looks<00:03:42.370> exactly<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
different although it looks exactly the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.570 
different although it looks exactly the
same<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.450> me<00:03:43.570> I'm<00:03:44.500> hoping<00:03:44.710> they<00:03:45.040> take<00:03:45.370> root

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
same to me I'm hoping they take root

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.820 
same to me I'm hoping they take root
soon<00:03:46.300> so<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.660> can<00:03:46.690> take<00:03:47.050> some<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.410> those<00:03:47.500> weight

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
soon so I can take some of those weight

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.380 
soon so I can take some of those weight
rocks<00:03:48.130> off<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.730> they<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.850> get<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.210> full

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
rocks off and they can get the full

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.670 
rocks off and they can get the full
light<00:03:49.920> but<00:03:50.920> um<00:03:51.250> effort<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.330> light<00:03:52.680> on

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
light but um effort that the light on

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.420 
light but um effort that the light on
this<00:03:53.920> thing

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
this thing

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.610 
this thing
well<00:03:54.970> mostly<00:03:55.630> just<00:03:55.900> on<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.170> four<00:03:56.380> count

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
well mostly just on the four count

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.770 
well mostly just on the four count
because<00:03:56.860> it's<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.160> small<00:03:57.240> it's<00:03:58.240> really<00:03:58.330> good

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
because it's so small it's really good

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.950 
because it's so small it's really good
and<00:03:59.140> that<00:03:59.890> you<00:03:59.980> can<00:04:00.100> grow<00:04:00.690> pretty<00:04:01.690> difficult

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
and that you can grow pretty difficult
