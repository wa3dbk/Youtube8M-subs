00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.150
 you remember when I told you that for 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.009
 kill schools with punches and other 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.839
 We did not know why the links with the 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.549
 sentinels would be deactivated despite 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.049
 that the countdown was no longer 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.360
 active and we had to have a little 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.279
 of luck of taxes I lied very good 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.439
 I'm all Gonzalez Faus and in this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.210
 video I'll show you a trick to 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.160
 kill in a faster way is with 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.009
 making them that the links with the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.720
 servants or with sentinels 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.419
 always remain in disabled 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.070
 although we do not have a countdown 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.570
 good this video I bring it to you in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.190
 exclusive because you have not seen 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.960
 no youtuber more neither Spanish nor 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.379
 international but you know that this is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.750
 youtube and that in two days all the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.600
 Destiny community will have this video 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.699
 in your channel but good that you know that no 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.379
 it's a video that has seen no one else and 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.579
 which is a video that we have worked on 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.379
 we would thank you then 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.910
 Tell me if already in this video such a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 because it is a video that we have discovered 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.410
 we just like we killed schools to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.940
 punching for the first time and good is a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.740
 video that I really did not plan to upload 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.570
 because a lot of people say it's annoying 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.250
 the destination experience 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.690
 and that we already knew back then 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.479
 when we kill schools with punches 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.430
 we realized that day but what good 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.420
 had not gone up because of that because there 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.550
 people who say that annoy the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.260
 sting experience and so on then yes 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.240
 how annoying the street experience 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.430
 we had been slow to upload this video 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.500
 we had decided not to publish it always 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.050
 good yesterday we upload a video killing 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.210
 schools punched with hunters without 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.610
 use the trick and there were people who 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.110
 he really said he had not got 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.240
 kill schools not even with weapons 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.920
 those people gave us pity and that's why 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.200
 we have decided to take this trick to light 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 a trick that as I'm telling you, we were going to 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
 shut up but good 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.720
 this trick goes mostly for 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.910
 those people who have not killed yet 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.860
 schools and we hope that with this trick 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.820
 kill schools once and for all 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.710
 because if I think it 's a trick 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.780
 if I know a trick I think the rest 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.280
 of people has the right to know that trick 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.670
 especially if you have not killed the tails 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.619
 then here you are going to see how to deactivate 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.810
 the links with the sentinels of 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.610
 perpetual way to defuse those 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.619
 links with sentinels so 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.700
 perpetual and without curling more what 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.560
 we have to do 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 and go to the map area 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.940
 where we are used to kill 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.610
 tails we go to the right and 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.459
 we have to kill the servant who 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.190
 give links to schools and which 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.959
 if we destroy these servants not 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.459
 we are going to do school damage, well, what 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.319
 we kill as if we were to kill 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.390
 Schools normally and as you see I 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.800
 started a counter a countdown 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.440
 that links with servants 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.209
 disabled and that starts in mind and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.269
 that goes to zero then to do the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.500
 trick what we have to do is 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.750
 concentrate the fire all the players 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.910
 so schools are getting hurt 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.030
 when the countdown reaches zero 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.530
 exactly if we do that if scola is 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.450
 is taking damage when it reaches 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.280
 second zero exactly as you see 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.510
 although the links with sentinels 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.610
 are not where they are activated in forgiveness 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.310
 because schools will continue to receive 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.319
 same amount of damage as if they were 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.049
 disabled in the video that you upload 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.970
 punching or killing schools 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.730
 punch better said later also 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.950
 Here I leave you the exact moment in which 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.940
 just in the links they reach 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.680
 make a park 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.170
 that I was just giving him a 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.600
 punch schools at that time and by 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.420
 we could do that, we could kill schools 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.030
 so fast, so good is what 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.740
 I want to say is that if really school 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.140
 receives damage when it reaches the second zero 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.360
 the links are going to remain 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.280
 deactivated continuously and that 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.960
 more I say good then the one that you do not have 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.730
 why use the gal ajn is worth 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.470
 any weapon and if it does not come out it's 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.840
 simply because it is with the most 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.700
 received damage in the second zero too 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.380
 can that scholar re citizen in the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.020
 second zero and not immediately 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.580
 come out but as you will see later then 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.620
 yes at two or three seconds 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.740
 it will come out that schools are already receiving 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.740
 in the amount of damage you have when 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.660
 because the links are disabled and 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.070
 nothing else I wanted to take to give 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.200
 also thanks in return 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.930
 Gonzalez among the three of us discovered the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.490
 trick and the feet of the two or of 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.440

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.450
 merit that I though they let me go up the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.700
