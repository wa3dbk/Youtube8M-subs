 your windows the programs on the mac 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.069
 Run it was not 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.110
 do not complicate anything and write 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.610
 he just needs two apps 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.740
 first course steen 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 just click on steam install 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.650
 and then here on windows because if you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.699
 click on it then you would mac 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.289
 downloaded and then also offered wine 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.710
 So in the left-hander one 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.710
 description 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.720
 if you have the link in the description 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.460
 sounds then this page comes here 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.770
 skip a click for you , so to speak 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.510
 then you would have to mark five seconds here 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.239
 and then just click on advertising 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.040
 I would have to skip that, too 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.200
 wait another five seconds then will 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.030
 downloaded automatically if you too 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.480
 lazy silk can push her even start 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:54.059
 but I already have the downloader 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.550
 That's why the next one is yes then 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.579
 So downloaded the apps here 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.690
 steam setup online bottler 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.250
 first sounds double click on 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.430
 butler and then pulls the two files 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.070
 over here I have already done 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.869
 so I do not do now So yes 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 Wine offered the power to write apps 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.290
 and wine is about to open the app 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 So first of all, click on one 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.509
 butler 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.040
 that is then opened here so there are 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.900
 then you have already supported here 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.439
 can download and install 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.049
 here there is also steam at 4 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.610
 you can install 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.590
 There is only one problem, and that is true 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.920
 this does not work for some people 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.829
 So it just will not be explained now 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.290
 there comes console and I know 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.030
 but not because something shows therefore 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.549
 I now also the second variant you 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 goes on a butler so by the way ever 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.380
 installed grade 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:03.479
 click on advanced you have to do that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 team setup excuse here 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.099
 can you choose what you need for 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.250
 example what with many windows program 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.440
 needs the net framework's yes but 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.880
 for the team 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.620
 that's why he does not need anything 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:23.450
 just tick on us 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.490
 lasts so then he finished it 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.780
 made 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.170
 you click on documents and you see 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.760
 Here is the problem is just that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.680
 event does not want there I believe that 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.790
 not bad if only the installed 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.880
 then just click command and 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.620
 then on documents and then here on 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.180
 common then you both take here 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.010
 this symbol and see it in here 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.550
 if it bothers you then just stop 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.690
 the team symbol is also the team corner 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.220
 But it's not that bad 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.220
 yes then it could open normally 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.730
 So there are a few more 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.290
 but not much 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.150
 then here comes the normal team 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.260
 think what ever comes when you do that 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.260
 first time downloaded 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.440
 yes now the files 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.440
 downloaded which he needs 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.370
 always takes a bit 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.840
 Yes 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.370
 So he wanted to fill it out 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.760
 one more thing if you offered on wine 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.760
 loudly short 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.889
 so install it over steam then 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.389
 is the version in english and if 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.979
 here asks what when actually at 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.410
 Everywhere it is in German 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.970
 because I do not know in which country 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.600
 you are and that's why it's easy 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.729
 the steam but here that 2010 is yes 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.280
 was just 2010 the download would have 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.280
 but it is always the case 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.740
 latest version because the mountains are updated 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.300
 if you open it the first time so 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.180
 Here is the program you can 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.050
 log in to create an account and 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.479
 You can play on it, if you like 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.220
 install and play as normal 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:58.180
 I say goodbye like 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:03.000
 subscribed to the video has the yabo 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.000
 until next time
