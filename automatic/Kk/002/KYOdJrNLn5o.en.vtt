00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
evaporated milk that's what we got here

nonfat evaporated milk and actually
that's<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.799> good<00:02:17.950> thing<00:02:18.189> because<00:02:18.689> it<00:02:19.689> helps<00:02:20.049> to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
that's a good thing because it helps to

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.390 
that's a good thing because it helps to
cut<00:02:20.409> down<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.840> calories<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
cut down on the calories in the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.170 
cut down on the calories in the
casserole<00:02:25.140> nonfat<00:02:26.140> evaporated<00:02:27.040> milk<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.610> I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
casserole nonfat evaporated milk and I

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.880 
casserole nonfat evaporated milk and I
think<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.689> came<00:02:28.959> from<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.290> fact<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.769> you

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
think that came from the fact that you

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.940 
think that came from the fact that you
know<00:02:30.040> when<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> was<00:02:30.519> growing<00:02:30.730> up<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:32.470> had<00:02:32.500> to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
know when I was growing up they had to

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.640 
know when I was growing up they had to
economize<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.879> often<00:02:34.180> times<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:35.349> didn't

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
economize and often times they didn't

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.130 
economize and often times they didn't
have<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.760> money<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.209> buy<00:02:37.360> real<00:02:37.690> expensive

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
have the money to buy real expensive

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.319 
have the money to buy real expensive
things<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:38.920> my<00:02:39.159> mother<00:02:39.370> would<00:02:39.549> improvise<00:02:39.879> and

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
things so my mother would improvise and

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.839 
things so my mother would improvise and
she<00:02:40.480> would<00:02:40.659> use<00:02:40.900> what<00:02:41.650> she<00:02:41.680> had<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.189> hand<00:02:42.489> so

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
she would use what she had on hand so

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.970 
she would use what she had on hand so
evaporated<00:02:43.629> milk<00:02:43.659> it<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.640> once<00:02:45.970> that's<00:02:46.329> in

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
evaporated milk it was so once that's in

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.430 
evaporated milk it was so once that's in
you<00:02:47.980> want<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:49.359> come<00:02:49.599> to<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.780> boil<00:02:50.109> and

looks good it's slightly thickened it's

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.039 
looks good it's slightly thickened it's
not<00:03:03.549> real<00:03:03.909> thick<00:03:04.209> we<00:03:04.329> don't<00:03:04.480> want<00:03:04.599> it<00:03:04.690> real

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049

not real thick we don't want it real
thick<00:03:05.319> but<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.620> slightly<00:03:05.889> thickened<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.489> now

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
thick but it's slightly thickened so now

Italian<00:03:12.819> but<00:03:13.000> remember<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.959> is<00:03:14.170> an

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
Italian but remember this is an

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.879 
Italian but remember this is an
italian-american<00:03:15.420> casserole<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.379> we<00:03:17.500> add<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
italian-american casserole so we add the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
cheese and that helps to thicken that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.189 
cheese and that helps to thicken that

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
mix that all around now these are going

to<00:03:49.900> get<00:03:50.019> baked<00:03:50.349> but<00:03:51.160> we're<00:03:51.310> not<00:03:51.459> going<00:03:51.639> to<00:03:51.699> do

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
to get baked but we're not going to do

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.199 
to get baked but we're not going to do
just<00:03:52.150> an<00:03:52.389> ordinary<00:03:53.290> casserole<00:03:54.280> for<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:54.669> that

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
just an ordinary casserole for this that

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.839 
just an ordinary casserole for this that
just<00:03:55.449> wouldn't<00:03:55.690> be<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:57.099> tradition<00:03:57.579> of<00:03:57.699> how

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
just wouldn't be in the tradition of how

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.330 
just wouldn't be in the tradition of how
my<00:03:58.090> mother<00:03:58.359> thought<00:03:58.659> my<00:03:59.620> mother<00:03:59.859> was<00:04:00.040> always

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
my mother thought my mother was always

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.599 
my mother thought my mother was always
thinking<00:04:00.849> outside<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.959> box<00:04:02.620> if<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.489> know

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
thinking outside the box if you know

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.990 
thinking outside the box if you know
what<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.790> mean<00:04:04.199> no<00:04:05.199> no<00:04:05.379> instead<00:04:06.099> to<00:04:06.549> make<00:04:06.730> things

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
what I mean no no instead to make things

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.390 
what I mean no no instead to make things
go<00:04:07.299> further<00:04:09.629> yes<00:04:10.629> she<00:04:11.500> did<00:04:11.739> them<00:04:11.889> in<00:04:12.069> cupcake

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
go further yes she did them in cupcake

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.729 
go further yes she did them in cupcake
pans<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.959> way<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:14.139> could<00:04:14.319> only<00:04:14.470> have<00:04:14.680> one

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
pans that way you could only have one

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.000 
pans that way you could only have one
and<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:16.510> want<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.780> spray<00:04:17.109> them<00:04:17.380> this<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:17.979> a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
and you want to spray them this is a

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.770 
and you want to spray them this is a
nonstick<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:18.729> you<00:04:18.820> don't<00:04:18.970> even<00:04:19.090> have<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.449> spray

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
nonstick so you don't even have to spray

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.190 
nonstick so you don't even have to spray
and<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:21.700> she<00:04:21.760> could<00:04:22.030> get<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.240> lot<00:04:22.479> of<00:04:22.630> servings

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
and so she could get a lot of servings

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.420 
and so she could get a lot of servings
out<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.650> something<00:04:24.219> like<00:04:24.400> this

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
out of something like this

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.460
