00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.100
 soften our mixture 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.720
 and we 're going to mix all this in your 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 blender in your food processor 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.850

 look like this is how our mix looks 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.610
 fascinates me because it is totally easter 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 look at the color that beautiful to make 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.149
 a little bit, the little yellow is green 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.140
 lemon and look here I have some 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.330
 Salty cookies 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.130
 these are cookies they call cookies 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.680
 water are the least amount of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.330
 calories they contain are not as rich as 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.670
 the other randy are redonditos with 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.729
 butter but they help you save 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.880
 calories and have good flavor cited well 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.850

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.090
 fascinates because it gives it a flavor 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.180
 it gives it color and gives it a flavor 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.040
 half sweet to this recipe and something that is 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.780
 key to this recipe is the chile 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.350
 chipotle look around here I have some 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.020
 chipotles and I'm going to cut only a small 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.990
 chip with a band of chipotle 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.480

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.580

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.220
 the people we are dieting is ideal 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.170
 if you have your children with two pairs of 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.360
 boxes are perfect are 140 calories 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.300

 canapé but on a bread and the same 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.000
 process we add our mixture 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.230
 there is 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.970
 to know that people ask you what 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.790
