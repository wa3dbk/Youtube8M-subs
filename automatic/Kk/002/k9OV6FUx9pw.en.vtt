I'm going to do here is zip into the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.510 
I'm going to do here is zip into the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
market and we'll have a look setting up

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.650 
market and we'll have a look setting up
a<00:00:20.730> trade<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.720> here<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> longer<00:00:22.590> term<00:00:22.859> trade

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
a trade on here on a longer term trade

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.839 
a trade on here on a longer term trade
rather<00:00:24.660> bizarrely<00:00:25.220> it<00:00:26.220> appears<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.609> race

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
rather bizarrely it appears this race

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.179 
rather bizarrely it appears this race
has<00:00:26.880> three<00:00:27.300> runners<00:00:27.740> which<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> quite<00:00:29.010> amusing

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
has three runners which is quite amusing

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.580 
has three runners which is quite amusing
because<00:00:29.519> football<00:00:30.390> matches<00:00:30.929> will<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.320> three

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
because football matches will have three

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
because football matches will have three
sets<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> odds<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.279> them<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.460> well<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.820> hadn't

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
sets of odds on them as well I hadn't

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510 
sets of odds on them as well I hadn't
anticipated<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
anticipated that but what I'm going to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400 
anticipated that but what I'm going to
do<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.120> offset<00:00:36.510> by<00:00:36.809> 100

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
do here is I'm going to offset by 100

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.990 
do here is I'm going to offset by 100
tix<00:00:37.649> trailing<00:00:38.579> stop<00:00:38.930> at<00:00:39.930> five<00:00:40.710> tix<00:00:42.620> now<00:00:43.620> II<00:00:44.000> now

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
we're going to do that 10 ticks give it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.080 
we're going to do that 10 ticks give it
a<00:00:47.250> room<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.940> manoeuvre<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.789> if<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
look at the long-term chart here see if

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.160 
look at the long-term chart here see if
we<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.559> some<00:00:52.620> idea<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.370> direction<00:00:54.170> looks

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
we can get some idea on direction looks

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.450 
we can get some idea on direction looks
like<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> price<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.890> favorites<00:00:56.309> coming

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
like the price on this favorites coming

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.110 
like the price on this favorites coming
in<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.960> zip<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:59.539> back<00:01:00.539> at

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
in so I'm going to zip in here back at

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.579 
in so I'm going to zip in here back at
this<00:01:03.120> price<00:01:03.300> let<00:01:03.570> me<00:01:03.629> move<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> unmatched

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this price let me move up the unmatched

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
this price let me move up the unmatched
odd<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:06.600> Bettinger

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
odd so you can see here what Bettinger

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080 
odd so you can see here what Bettinger
is<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.520> put<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.760> offset

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
is going to do now is it's put an offset

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
is going to do now is it's put an offset
in<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.860> 101<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.880> basically<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
in at 101 but basically it's got a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
in at 101 but basically it's got a
trailing<00:01:13.619> stop<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> position

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
trailing stop in it so as the position

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.590 
trailing stop in it so as the position
moves<00:01:15.119> into<00:01:15.840> profit<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.390> pull<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
moves into profit it will pull the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
moves into profit it will pull the
trailing<00:01:19.020> stop<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.320> behind<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.970> hopefully

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
trailing stop in behind it and hopefully

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
trailing stop in behind it and hopefully
look<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> profit<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.140> us<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
look in a profit for us at that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.440 
look in a profit for us at that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
particular point now because you put it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
particular point now because you put it
in<00:01:24.570> Guardian<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.500> will<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.250> managed

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
now i could apply a stop loss on this

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.730 
now i could apply a stop loss on this
marker<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:23.930> there's<00:02:24.050> no<00:02:24.170> point<00:02:24.410> because<00:02:24.650> you

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
marker but there's no point because you

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.930 
marker but there's no point because you
know<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.950> direction<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.610> market<00:02:25.910> is

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
know the direction that this market is

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.370 
know the direction that this market is
going<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.600> not<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.960> spike<00:02:27.170> out

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
going in and it's not going to spike out

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.290 
going in and it's not going to spike out
and<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.530> said<00:02:27.680> there's<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.920> goal<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:28.790> no<00:02:28.970> point<00:02:29.210> in

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
and I said there's a goal so no point in

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.180 
and I said there's a goal so no point in
having<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.570> stop<00:02:29.780> on<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.050> one<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:31.040> also

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190
