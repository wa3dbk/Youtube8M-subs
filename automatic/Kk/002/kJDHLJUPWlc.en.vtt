hi there here you're going to learn a
little<00:00:09.269> bit<00:00:09.450> about<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.870> toon<00:00:10.080> shader<00:00:10.110> feature

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
little bit about the toon shader feature

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.070 
little bit about the toon shader feature
and<00:00:10.950> iclone<00:00:11.250> I'm<00:00:12.150> going<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.509> start<00:00:12.750> off<00:00:12.870> with

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and the colors also change a bit you can

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
and the colors also change a bit you can
adjust<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> edge<00:00:32.640> width<00:00:32.880> by<00:00:33.149> using<00:00:33.360> the

already<00:01:53.180> when<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.360> project<00:01:54.600> loads<00:01:55.140> I'll

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
already when this project loads I'll

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.959 
already when this project loads I'll
show<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> an<00:01:56.070> example<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.759> different

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
show you an example of a different

show you an example of a different
technique<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.750> toon<00:01:57.930> shader<00:01:57.960> using<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
technique with toon shader using the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.950 
technique with toon shader using the
texture<00:01:59.189> color<00:01:59.490> feature

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.620 

so<00:02:02.800> now<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:02.980> I<00:02:03.100> have<00:02:03.280> my<00:02:03.430> project<00:02:03.730> loaded<00:02:04.300> up

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
so now that I have my project loaded up

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.180 
so now that I have my project loaded up
I'll<00:02:04.780> go<00:02:05.050> enable<00:02:05.440> toon<00:02:05.620> shader<00:02:05.920> again<00:02:08.190> this

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
I'll go enable toon shader again this

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.830 
I'll go enable toon shader again this
time<00:02:09.429> notice<00:02:09.759> that<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.240> silhouette<00:02:10.539> edge

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
time notice that in the silhouette edge

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.350 
time notice that in the silhouette edge
section<00:02:11.350> instead<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:12.010> color<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.640> now<00:02:13.120> have

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
section instead of color and now have

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.750 
section instead of color and now have
texture<00:02:13.930> color<00:02:14.170> which<00:02:15.040> means<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.430> will<00:02:15.550> copy

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
texture color which means it will copy

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.550 
texture color which means it will copy
the<00:02:16.000> color<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> dominant<00:02:17.020> texture<00:02:17.410> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the color of the dominant texture of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.610 
the color of the dominant texture of
that<00:02:17.710> object<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.690> scene<00:02:19.930> now<00:02:20.110> looks<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.470> lot

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
that object the scene now looks a lot

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.390 
that object the scene now looks a lot
brighter<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.190> more<00:02:21.370> cartoony<00:02:22.890> I'll<00:02:23.890> zoom<00:02:24.220> in

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
brighter and more cartoony I'll zoom in

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.980 
brighter and more cartoony I'll zoom in
on<00:02:24.520> my<00:02:24.550> character's<00:02:25.090> face<00:02:25.360> here<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.840> give<00:02:25.959> a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
on my character's face here to give a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.740 
on my character's face here to give a
better<00:02:26.230> look<00:02:26.530> at<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.800> toon<00:02:27.040> shader<00:02:27.070> levels

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
better look at the toon shader levels

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.940 
better look at the toon shader levels
the<00:02:28.750> second<00:02:29.110> slider<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.740> line

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
the second slider on that line

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.710 
the second slider on that line
determines<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.610> extent<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.270> darkest

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
determines the extent of the darkest

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.199 
determines the extent of the darkest
shading<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.370> rave<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> higher

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
shading if you rave that to a higher

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
level the scene will have predominantly

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.210

dark<00:02:36.670> shading<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:38.380> second<00:02:38.739> slider<00:02:38.980> will

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
dark shading the second slider will

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.650 
dark shading the second slider will
determine<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.670> extent<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.330> medium

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
determine the extent of the medium

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.530 
determine the extent of the medium
shading<00:02:40.900> level<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.760> can<00:02:42.910> see<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> difference

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
shading level you can see the difference

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.900 
shading level you can see the difference
as<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.870> adjust<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.380> slightly<00:02:47.459> let's<00:02:48.459> experiment

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
as I adjust it slightly let's experiment

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.880

a<00:02:49.120> little<00:02:49.239> for<00:02:49.510> yourself<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.140> find<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.470> level

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
a little for yourself to find the level

back my project now you can see that it

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.520 
back my project now you can see that it
