00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.370
 Hi everyone, I'm here today to give a 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.400
 Simple tip for you guys that can do 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.879
 difference 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.699
 When you say that the 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.640
 existence of louis good 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.960
 the assembly is the simplest background 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.640
 face bottom and snack you to such was the 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.769
 Steel tie will get a copper wire 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:39.030
 and will cut about an inch 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:43.480
 only taking out the tip tube 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.629
 this way and he will also pass it 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:52.449
 here on the line 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:01:00.330
 now you lace your steel clash is not 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:00.330
 easily give you six laps here 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:16.150
 34 56 laps and I'll be right back in the ball 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:22.600
 initial and closed not closed the doors 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:26.800
 over cutting in of leaving one or two 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.840
 millimeters and the assembly is ready 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.000
 why and I quote right here before the ingot 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.200
 because consequently throughout the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.830
 fishing 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.710
 the call goes taking it in the node and she 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.830
 will end up cutting at a moment's notice 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.630
 so with this little tub here on the line 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:56.770
 it is harder for her to cut because he 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.960
 dampens the sink when it hits 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.630
 down here 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.560
 beyond this assembly would like to 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.250
 also share the equipment that I 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.049
 I usually use the technique of large 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:21.430
 banks and tambaquis dps pac is one hour from 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:24.909
 80 from the marina of 30 60 free with 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.990
 a primer also from the marina 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:31.120
 sport 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:35.530
 with 10 bearings and a 0 40 thread 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.620
 in this reel is 0 40 invitation 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:44.530
 110 meters approximately 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.390
 then it is enough for the good picture is the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.970
 What I would like to convey to you 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.970
 today and until the next liberators
