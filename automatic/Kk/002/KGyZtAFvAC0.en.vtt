00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
when you go to the F when I played the F

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.809 
when you go to the F when I played the F
the<00:04:06.930> first<00:04:07.109> time<00:04:07.470> all<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.769> did<00:04:08.069> was<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.280> took<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
the first time all I did was I took the

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.140 
the first time all I did was I took the
I<00:04:09.230> inverted<00:04:10.230> this<00:04:10.500> chord<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.099> took<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.849> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
I inverted this chord and took the the a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.390 
I inverted this chord and took the the a
and<00:04:12.690> moved<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.019> over<00:04:13.140> here<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.739> all<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:13.920> did<00:04:14.250> was

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
and moved it over here so all I did was

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.150 
and moved it over here so all I did was
just<00:04:14.430> reverse<00:04:14.909> the<00:04:15.480> chord<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.739> now<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:16.949> won't

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
just reverse the chord so now you won't

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.979 
just reverse the chord so now you won't
play<00:04:17.280> C<00:04:17.510> F<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:20.190> G<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.729> remember<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.780> first

time when you play you just tape see if

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.490 
time when you play you just tape see if
la<00:04:25.889> you<00:04:25.919> just<00:04:26.700> take<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.539> you<00:04:28.169> reverse
