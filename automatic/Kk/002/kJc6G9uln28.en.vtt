00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
parts the first part is a couple of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.880 
parts the first part is a couple of
hours<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.880> five<00:01:06.360> four<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.470> second

hours of five four and then the second

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
hours of five four and then the second
half<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.430> 11<00:01:09.119> 4<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.810> 5<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.530> 5<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.340> 11<00:01:11.700> 4<00:01:12.240> and

half is 11 4 so 5 for 5 for 11 4 and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
half is 11 4 so 5 for 5 for 11 4 and
I'll<00:01:13.470> show<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.680> guys<00:01:13.860> something<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.580> it

I'll show you guys something how it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.219 
I'll show you guys something how it
sounds<00:01:15.119> I'll<00:01:15.240> slow<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:16.020> bit

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
sounds I'll slow it down a little bit

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
sounds I'll slow it down a little bit
show<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> metronome<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.390> let's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
show you on the metronome and now let's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:02:04.230 
show you on the metronome and now let's
see<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.049> put<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.290> together

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.060 

so<00:02:05.240> there<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.479> go<00:02:05.570> that's<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.080> two<00:02:06.470> elements

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
so there you go that's the two elements

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.910 
so there you go that's the two elements
of<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:07.520> beat<00:02:07.959> slow<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.110> down<00:02:09.140> as<00:02:09.500> much<00:02:09.619> as<00:02:09.679> you

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
of that beat slow it down as much as you

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.500 
of that beat slow it down as much as you
can<00:02:10.190> when<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.520> start<00:02:10.790> to<00:02:10.880> learn<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.240> try<00:02:11.450> to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
can when you start to learn it try to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.300 
can when you start to learn it try to
figure<00:02:12.080> out<00:02:12.320> exactly<00:02:12.530> where<00:02:12.860> each<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.190> those

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
figure out exactly where each of those

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.090 
figure out exactly where each of those
finger<00:02:13.940> strokes<00:02:14.240> is<00:02:14.540> landing<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.500> how<00:02:15.709> it

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
finger strokes is landing and how it

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.130 
finger strokes is landing and how it
comes<00:02:16.490> together<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:17.209> know<00:02:17.840> that's<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.110> very

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
comes together I know that's a very

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.070 
comes together I know that's a very
short<00:02:18.680> explanation<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:20.330> what's<00:02:20.570> going<00:02:20.870> on

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
short explanation for what's going on

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.490 
short explanation for what's going on
there

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
there

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.100 
there
but<00:02:22.190> for<00:02:22.459> now<00:02:22.550> let's<00:02:22.970> see<00:02:23.180> what<00:02:23.390> happens<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:23.900> we

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
but for now let's see what happens if we

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.590 
but for now let's see what happens if we
speed<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.740> up<00:02:24.860> from<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.190> point<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:26.510> an

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
speed it up from that point and get an

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.660 
speed it up from that point and get an
idea<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.020> how<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.380> came<00:02:27.560> from<00:02:27.860> there<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.520> what

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
idea of how it came from there to what

00:02:28.670 --> 00:03:09.290 
idea of how it came from there to what
you<00:02:28.760> heard<00:02:28.880> at<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.060> start<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.510> video
