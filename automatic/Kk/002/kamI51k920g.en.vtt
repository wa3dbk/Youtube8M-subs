50th cetera these skis are really

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.610 
50th cetera these skis are really
different<00:00:31.220> than<00:00:31.460> those<00:00:31.669> were<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.570> AC<00:00:32.750> 50<00:00:33.230> for

different than those were the AC 50 for

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.620 
different than those were the AC 50 for
example<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:34.280> latest<00:00:34.550> version<00:00:35.060> before<00:00:35.210> these

example the latest version before these

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.310 
example the latest version before these
was<00:00:36.500> about<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.550> same<00:00:37.730> shape<00:00:38.320> conventionally

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320

cambered<00:00:39.739> ski<00:00:39.890> really<00:00:40.879> stiff<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.109> call<00:00:42.620> it

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
cambered ski really stiff so to call it

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.369 
cambered ski really stiff so to call it
at<00:00:42.890> all<00:00:43.039> conditions<00:00:43.699> which<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:44.390> what<00:00:44.570> AC<00:00:44.750> stood

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
at all conditions which is what AC stood

at all conditions which is what AC stood
for<00:00:45.710> really<00:00:46.670> wasn't<00:00:47.239> all<00:00:47.480> that<00:00:47.510> good<00:00:47.899> I<00:00:47.960> mean

for really wasn't all that good I mean

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.599 
for really wasn't all that good I mean
they<00:00:48.320> were<00:00:48.379> great<00:00:48.590> for<00:00:48.829> going<00:00:48.980> really<00:00:49.280> fast

they were great for going really fast
they<00:00:49.910> were<00:00:49.969> good<00:00:50.239> for<00:00:50.390> plowing<00:00:50.870> through

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019

they were good for plowing through
clumps<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.680> snow<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.129> sagebrush<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.480> they

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
clumps of snow and sagebrush but they

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.330 
clumps of snow and sagebrush but they
weren't<00:00:53.960> real<00:00:54.199> nimble<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:54.739> bumps<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.250> they

weren't really good in soft snow the RTM
84<00:00:58.850> changes<00:00:59.629> all<00:00:59.840> of<00:01:00.230> that

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
84 changes all of that

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.290 
84 changes all of that
the<00:01:00.890> first<00:01:01.160> thing<00:01:01.399> that<00:01:01.429> they<00:01:01.730> did<00:01:02.000> is

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
the first thing that they did is

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.360 
the first thing that they did is
although<00:01:03.230> they<00:01:03.379> kept<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.710> shape<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.129> same

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
although they kept the shape the same

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.080 
although they kept the shape the same
they<00:01:05.089> made<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.510> flex<00:01:05.900> on<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.290> RTM<00:01:06.770> series

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
they made the flex on the RTM series

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.430 
they made the flex on the RTM series
quite<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.120> bit<00:01:08.390> softer<00:01:08.870> now<00:01:08.900> these<00:01:09.200> aren't

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
quite a bit softer now these aren't

significantly softer than the old
versions<00:01:13.940> which<00:01:14.180> were<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.510> stiffest<00:01:14.960> skis<00:01:15.320> in

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
softer more even flex so it's versatile

profile rocker not first thing you might
think<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.140> -<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.500> rocker<00:01:45.770> on<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.210> 84

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
think of is - a rocker on a 84

think of is - a rocker on a 84
millimeter<00:01:47.600> wide<00:01:47.720> ski<00:01:48.080> doesn't<00:01:48.380> make<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.530> ton

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
millimeter wide ski doesn't make a ton

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.040 
millimeter wide ski doesn't make a ton
of<00:01:48.800> sense<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.150> start<00:01:50.450> looking<00:01:50.780> at<00:01:50.900> this

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
of sense but you start looking at this

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.690 
of sense but you start looking at this
and<00:01:51.260> when<00:01:51.410> I<00:01:51.440> put<00:01:51.650> them<00:01:51.710> up<00:01:51.830> on<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.280> bottom<00:01:52.550> you

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
and when I put them up on the bottom you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.370 
and when I put them up on the bottom you
can<00:01:52.880> see<00:01:52.910> some<00:01:53.300> rocker<00:01:53.510> but<00:01:53.810> there<00:01:53.960> sure<00:01:54.200> isn't

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
can see some rocker but there sure isn't

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.190 
can see some rocker but there sure isn't
very<00:01:54.740> much<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.060> effect<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:56.780> is

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
very much and so the effect of that is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.310 
very much and so the effect of that is
that<00:01:57.920> when<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.820> ski<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.150> really<00:01:59.180> flat<00:01:59.960> on<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
that when this ski is really flat on the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.490 
that when this ski is really flat on the
snow<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.010> tippet

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
snow the tippet

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.440 
snow the tippet
a<00:02:01.530> little<00:02:02.220> bit<00:02:02.340> disconnected<00:02:02.970> from<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> snow

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
a little bit disconnected from the snow

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.070 
a little bit disconnected from the snow
is<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:05.010> tiny<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.550> squirmy<00:02:06.510> but<00:02:06.690> as<00:02:06.810> soon

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
is a little tiny bit squirmy but as soon

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.109 
is a little tiny bit squirmy but as soon
as<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> turn<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.560> ski<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:07.980> on<00:02:08.160> its<00:02:08.310> edge<00:02:08.520> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
as you turn the ski up on its edge this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.750 
as you turn the ski up on its edge this
lays<00:02:09.420> down<00:02:09.860> engages<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.130> skis<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.460> like

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
lays down engages and it skis just like

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.030 
lays down engages and it skis just like
a<00:02:11.790> normal<00:02:12.030> ski<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:13.170> when<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.380> combine<00:02:13.620> this

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
a normal ski so when you combine this

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.340 
a normal ski so when you combine this
little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.580> rocker<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.600> softer<00:02:16.020> flex

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
little bit of rocker and the softer flex

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.440 
little bit of rocker and the softer flex
you<00:02:16.470> get<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> much<00:02:17.040> more<00:02:17.070> versatile<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.180> useful

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
you get a much more versatile and useful

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.560 
you get a much more versatile and useful
frontside<00:02:19.320> ski<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.580> type<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.880> mixed

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
frontside ski to the type of mixed

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.750 
frontside ski to the type of mixed
conditions<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.560> you'll<00:02:22.740> get<00:02:22.920> around<00:02:23.250> Tahoe

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
conditions that you'll get around Tahoe

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.060
