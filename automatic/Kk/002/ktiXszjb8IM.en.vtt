00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.170 

okay<00:00:06.050> so<00:00:06.920> now<00:00:07.100> we're<00:00:07.189> going<00:00:07.279> to<00:00:07.370> consider<00:00:07.730> how

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
okay so now we're going to consider how

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.410 
okay so now we're going to consider how
to<00:00:08.540> draw<00:00:09.290> a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.390 

isosceles<00:00:14.379> right<00:00:14.969> triangle<00:00:17.099> using<00:00:18.099> the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
isosceles right triangle using the

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.560 
isosceles right triangle using the
turret<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:20.439> triangle<00:00:21.009> is<00:00:21.099> isosceles

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
turret this triangle is isosceles

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.319 
turret this triangle is isosceles
because<00:00:23.160> these<00:00:24.160> two<00:00:24.490> sides<00:00:24.849> are<00:00:25.210> the<00:00:25.240> same

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
because these two sides are the same

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.109 
because these two sides are the same
length<00:00:25.539> and<00:00:26.200> it's<00:00:26.740> a<00:00:26.860> right<00:00:27.070> triangle<00:00:27.400> because

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
length and it's a right triangle because

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.410 
length and it's a right triangle because
we<00:00:28.570> have<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.750> right<00:00:29.050> angle<00:00:29.259> right<00:00:29.829> here<00:00:33.420> let's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
we have a right angle right here let's

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.590 
we have a right angle right here let's
put<00:00:34.960> our<00:00:35.079> turtle<00:00:35.530> right<00:00:35.680> over<00:00:35.920> here<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:37.239> for

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
put our turtle right over here and for

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.209 
put our turtle right over here and for
now<00:00:37.780> I'm<00:00:38.079> not<00:00:38.110> going<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.410> actually<00:00:39.040> draw

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
now I'm not going to actually draw

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.770 
now I'm not going to actually draw
anything<00:00:39.640> on<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.879> screen<00:00:40.180> I<00:00:40.210> just<00:00:40.360> want<00:00:40.719> to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
anything on the screen I just want to

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.170 
anything on the screen I just want to
see<00:00:40.899> if<00:00:40.989> I<00:00:41.050> get<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.379> turtle<00:00:41.770> to<00:00:41.920> follow<00:00:42.309> the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
see if I get the turtle to follow the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:53.370 
see if I get the turtle to follow the
path<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:44.620> this<00:00:45.460> edge<00:00:45.820> so<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:52.540> happen<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.170> know

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
path of this edge so I happen to know

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.060 
path of this edge so I happen to know
this<00:00:53.620> this<00:00:54.070> particular<00:00:54.910> triangle<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.410> 100

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
this this particular triangle is 100

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.900 
this this particular triangle is 100
steps<00:00:57.430> on<00:00:57.790> this<00:00:57.940> side<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.570> 100<00:00:59.350> on<00:00:59.470> this<00:00:59.649> side

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
steps on this side and 100 on this side

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.469 
steps on this side and 100 on this side
so<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.690> start<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.170> easy<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.530> can<00:01:02.649> just<00:01:02.890> say

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
so the start is easy I can just say

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.819 
so the start is easy I can just say
forward<00:01:05.909> 100<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:08.170> takes<00:01:08.409> me<00:01:08.560> up<00:01:08.619> to<00:01:08.740> the

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
forward 100 and that takes me up to the

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.889 
forward 100 and that takes me up to the
corner<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.740> want<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.189> figure<00:01:12.369> out<00:01:12.630> how<00:01:13.630> much

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
corner now I want to figure out how much

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:21.990 
corner now I want to figure out how much
of<00:01:14.079> a<00:01:14.170> turn<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.950> have<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:16.240> make<00:01:16.450> here<00:01:17.220> well<00:01:21.000> let's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
of a turn I have to make here well let's

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.039 
of a turn I have to make here well let's
consider<00:01:22.900> for<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.530> minute<00:01:24.180> how<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.240> make<00:01:25.690> our

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
consider for a minute how we make our

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.060 
consider for a minute how we make our
right<00:01:26.799> angled<00:01:27.190> isosceles<00:01:27.549> triangle<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.860> look

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
right angled isosceles triangle we look

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.899 
right angled isosceles triangle we look
at<00:01:30.220> this<00:01:30.820> square<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:32.710> can<00:01:32.740> see<00:01:33.159> that<00:01:33.400> this<00:01:33.549> this

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
at this square we can see that this this

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.180 
at this square we can see that this this
triangle<00:01:34.479> is<00:01:34.630> made<00:01:34.869> by<00:01:35.049> starting<00:01:36.010> with<00:01:36.040> a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
triangle is made by starting with a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.219 
triangle is made by starting with a
square<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:37.710> drawing<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:39.340> diagonal<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:41.049> this

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
square and drawing the diagonal so this

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
square and drawing the diagonal so this
diagonal<00:01:43.170> cuts<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.439> angle<00:01:44.890> right<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.250> half

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
diagonal cuts this angle right in half

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.859 
diagonal cuts this angle right in half
doesn't<00:01:46.689> it<00:01:46.780> we<00:01:47.590> know<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.970> each<00:01:49.210> corner<00:01:49.750> of

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
doesn't it we know that each corner of

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.390 
doesn't it we know that each corner of
the<00:01:49.990> square<00:01:50.229> is<00:01:50.760> 90<00:01:51.760> degrees<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:53.010> if<00:01:54.010> we<00:01:54.130> cut

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
the square is 90 degrees so if we cut

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.080 
the square is 90 degrees so if we cut
that<00:01:54.549> 90<00:01:54.970> degrees<00:01:55.360> in<00:01:55.570> half<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:57.310> have<00:01:57.430> 45

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
that 90 degrees in half we have 45

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
that 90 degrees in half we have 45
degrees<00:01:58.600> right<00:01:58.930> here<00:02:00.479> okay

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.749 

so<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.780> angle<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.560> 45<00:02:07.890> degrees

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
so we know that this angle is 45 degrees

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.020 
so we know that this angle is 45 degrees
how<00:02:09.450> much<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.810> turn<00:02:10.370> do<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.819> make

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
how much of a turn do we have to make

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.460 
how much of a turn do we have to make
how<00:02:12.239> much<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> turn<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.080> turtle<00:02:13.379> have

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
how much of a turn just the turtle have

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:23.619 
how much of a turn just the turtle have
to<00:02:13.590> make<00:02:16.970> let's<00:02:17.970> look<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.750> at<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.200> turn<00:02:19.500> okay

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.910 

now<00:02:24.629> in<00:02:24.810> general<00:02:25.110> when<00:02:25.410> we're<00:02:25.560> turning<00:02:25.709> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
now in general when we're turning a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.990 
now in general when we're turning a
corner<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:29.040> how<00:02:29.129> we're<00:02:29.280> still<00:02:29.519> facing<00:02:29.760> in

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
corner you see how we're still facing in

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.190 
corner you see how we're still facing in
that<00:02:30.150> direction<00:02:31.459> this<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.819> entire<00:02:33.480> angle<00:02:34.140> if

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
that direction this this entire angle if

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
that direction this this entire angle if
we<00:02:34.319> take<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.190> blue<00:02:37.430> corner<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.730> triangle

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
we take the blue corner of the triangle

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.650 
we take the blue corner of the triangle
together<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.110> whole<00:02:40.470> sector<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:41.790> 180

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
together with this whole sector is 180

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.819 
together with this whole sector is 180
degrees<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:44.940> know<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.329> this<00:02:45.480> little

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
degrees and we know that this little

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.059 
degrees and we know that this little
blue<00:02:46.829> part<00:02:47.640> here<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.269> little<00:02:48.450> angle<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.140> 45

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
blue part here this little angle is 45

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.559 
blue part here this little angle is 45
degrees<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.440> total<00:02:52.829> amount<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.310> turn<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
degrees so the total amount of turn the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.110 
degrees so the total amount of turn the
angle<00:02:55.019> in<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.230> whole<00:02:55.470> sector<00:02:55.829> here<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.370> 180

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
angle in this whole sector here is 180

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:08.660 
angle in this whole sector here is 180
minus<00:02:57.920> 45<00:02:58.940> or<00:03:00.470> 135<00:03:01.470> degrees<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.530> that's<00:03:07.799> true

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
minus 45 or 135 degrees so that's true

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.229 
minus 45 or 135 degrees so that's true
right<00:03:09.709> 135<00:03:10.709> degrees<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.430> see<00:03:11.549> how<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.880> looks

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
right 135 degrees and see how that looks

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.819 
right 135 degrees and see how that looks
okay<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.380> looks<00:03:13.500> about<00:03:13.680> right<00:03:15.530> now<00:03:16.530> we<00:03:16.590> have

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
okay that looks about right now we have

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.569 
okay that looks about right now we have
to<00:03:16.950> figure<00:03:17.190> out<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:18.150> length<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:19.139> this<00:03:19.709> line

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
to figure out the length of this line

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.059 
to figure out the length of this line
right<00:03:20.970> here<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:22.319> that's<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.709> little<00:03:22.889> bit

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
right here and that's a little bit

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.809 
right here and that's a little bit
trickier<00:03:27.440> let's<00:03:28.440> consider<00:03:29.010> for<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> minute

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
trickier let's consider for a minute

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.960 
trickier let's consider for a minute
what<00:03:29.970> we're<00:03:30.090> gonna<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.540> look<00:03:30.720> at<00:03:30.930> is

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
what we're gonna have to look at is

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.390 
what we're gonna have to look at is
we're<00:03:32.970> going<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.150> start<00:03:33.389> with<00:03:33.599> two<00:03:34.400> squares

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
we're going to start with two squares

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.780 
we're going to start with two squares
here<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:37.459> think<00:03:38.459> for<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.730> minute<00:03:38.970> about<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
here and think for a minute about the

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.000 
here and think for a minute about the
area<00:03:42.389> of<00:03:42.599> squares<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.290> then<00:03:43.410> it'll<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.620> clear

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
area of squares and then it'll be clear

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.250 
area of squares and then it'll be clear
why<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:44.910> minute<00:03:45.209> why<00:03:45.389> we<00:03:45.569> have<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.810> worry

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
why in a minute why we have to worry

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.740 
why in a minute why we have to worry
about<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.590> areas<00:03:47.120> but<00:03:49.639> we<00:03:50.639> said<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.060> 100

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
about the areas but we said this is 100

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.650 
about the areas but we said this is 100
steps<00:03:52.190> actually<00:03:53.190> let's<00:03:53.609> let's<00:03:53.910> make<00:03:54.269> up<00:03:54.299> our

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
steps actually let's let's make up our

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.860 
steps actually let's let's make up our
own<00:03:54.720> unit<00:03:55.260> we'll<00:03:56.750> say<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.079> 1<00:03:58.410> hecto<00:03:59.099> step

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
own unit we'll say this is 1 hecto step

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.699 
own unit we'll say this is 1 hecto step
okay<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.900> hectometer

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
okay a hectometer

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.150 
okay a hectometer
is<00:04:01.889> 100<00:04:02.609> meters<00:04:03.169> hecto<00:04:04.169> step<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.769> hundred

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
is 100 meters hecto step is a hundred

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.270 
is 100 meters hecto step is a hundred
step<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:05.669> is<00:04:05.849> one<00:04:06.090> hecto<00:04:06.540> step<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:08.069> this

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
step so this is one hecto step so this

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.390 
step so this is one hecto step so this
square<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.700> one<00:04:09.000> by<00:04:09.239> one<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:12.540> if<00:04:12.989> if<00:04:13.349> each<00:04:14.040> side

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
square is one by one so if if each side

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.880 
square is one by one so if if each side
is<00:04:14.700> one<00:04:15.030> then<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.659> area<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.380> square<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.739> a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
is one then the area of the square is a

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.009 
is one then the area of the square is a
whole<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.430> one

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
whole is one

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.189 
whole is one
square<00:04:18.440> heck<00:04:19.340> does<00:04:19.609> step<00:04:19.849> and<00:04:20.090> these<00:04:20.900> two

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
square heck does step and these two

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.089 
square heck does step and these two
squares<00:04:21.940> make<00:04:22.940> up<00:04:23.180> two<00:04:23.930> square<00:04:24.680> head<00:04:24.710> two

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
squares make up two square head two

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.580 
squares make up two square head two
steps

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
steps

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.469 
steps
now<00:04:27.590> let's<00:04:27.800> rearrange<00:04:28.099> these<00:04:28.669> pieces<00:04:29.030> for<00:04:29.419> a

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
now let's rearrange these pieces for a

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:46.930 
now let's rearrange these pieces for a
minute

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:55.809 

okay<00:04:47.940> we<00:04:48.120> know<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:49.259> area<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:50.069> this<00:04:50.789> square<00:04:51.590> is

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.200 

to<00:04:56.819> hecto<00:04:57.660> steps<00:04:57.990> because<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.710> area<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.370> this

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
to hecto steps because the area of this

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.779 
to hecto steps because the area of this
is<00:05:00.479> 1<00:05:01.169> hecto<00:05:01.590> step<00:05:01.889> the<00:05:02.099> area<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.490> square

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
is 1 hecto step the area of the square

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.480 
is 1 hecto step the area of the square
is<00:05:02.819> 1<00:05:03.090> hecto<00:05:03.449> step<00:05:03.750> squared<00:05:04.319> so<00:05:05.039> this<00:05:05.190> has<00:05:05.370> to

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
is 1 hecto step squared so this has to

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.029 
is 1 hecto step squared so this has to
be<00:05:05.550> -<00:05:06.360> Hector's<00:05:06.780> hecto<00:05:07.410> step<00:05:07.680> squared<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.800> what

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
be - Hector's hecto step squared so what

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.589 
be - Hector's hecto step squared so what
does<00:05:11.190> that<00:05:11.220> mean<00:05:11.639> about<00:05:11.819> the<00:05:11.940> length<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.479> this

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
does that mean about the length of this

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.920 
does that mean about the length of this
line<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.590> length<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:14.039> this<00:05:14.190> line<00:05:14.660> times<00:05:15.660> the

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
line the length of this line times the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.719 
line the length of this line times the
length<00:05:16.139> of<00:05:16.380> this<00:05:16.770> line<00:05:17.630> on<00:05:18.630> its<00:05:19.500> -<00:05:19.830> hecto<00:05:20.370> steps

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
length of this line on its - hecto steps

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.950 
length of this line on its - hecto steps
so<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.840> means<00:05:22.110> that<00:05:22.380> one<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.830> these<00:05:23.539> lines<00:05:24.539> is

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
so that means that one of these lines is

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.510 
so that means that one of these lines is
the<00:05:25.169> square<00:05:25.590> root<00:05:25.830> of<00:05:25.949> 2<00:05:26.240> hecto<00:05:27.240> steps<00:05:28.520> and

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
the square root of 2 hecto steps and

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.029 
the square root of 2 hecto steps and
since<00:05:29.759> the<00:05:29.849> hector<00:05:30.150> step<00:05:30.419> is<00:05:30.630> 100<00:05:31.199> steps<00:05:32.900> means

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
since the hector step is 100 steps means

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:41.240 
since the hector step is 100 steps means
we<00:05:35.039> want<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:35.370> go<00:05:35.460> forward<00:05:37.550> 100<00:05:38.630> times<00:05:40.250> the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
we want to go forward 100 times the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.140 
we want to go forward 100 times the
square<00:05:41.729> root<00:05:41.759> of<00:05:42.690> 2<00:05:43.639> so<00:05:44.639> watch<00:05:45.270> this<00:05:45.509> turtle<00:05:46.020> my

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
square root of 2 so watch this turtle my

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.700 
square root of 2 so watch this turtle my
hit<00:05:48.150> return<00:05:48.569> and<00:05:48.630> we<00:05:49.020> go<00:05:49.139> forward<00:05:49.470> we<00:05:49.680> should

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
hit return and we go forward we should

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.980 
hit return and we go forward we should
go<00:05:50.099> all<00:05:50.789> the<00:05:51.000> way<00:05:51.030> to<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.270> other<00:05:51.360> corner<00:05:51.750> let's

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
go all the way to the other corner let's

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:59.420 
go all the way to the other corner let's
see<00:05:52.669> yes<00:05:53.669> that<00:05:54.030> worked<00:05:54.300> ok<00:05:57.139> so<00:05:58.139> now<00:05:58.469> let's<00:05:58.860> see

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
see yes that worked ok so now let's see

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.320 
see yes that worked ok so now let's see
let's<00:05:59.820> put<00:06:00.240> our<00:06:01.490> original<00:06:04.639> triangle<00:06:05.639> back<00:06:06.120> in

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
let's put our original triangle back in

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.200 
let's put our original triangle back in
place<00:06:06.719> and<00:06:09.620> now<00:06:10.620> we<00:06:10.680> want<00:06:11.099> to<00:06:11.159> figure<00:06:11.400> out<00:06:11.639> how

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
place and now we want to figure out how

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.149 
place and now we want to figure out how
much<00:06:12.360> of<00:06:12.419> a<00:06:12.599> turn<00:06:12.930> you<00:06:13.440> need<00:06:13.590> to<00:06:13.710> make<00:06:13.830> on<00:06:14.009> this

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
much of a turn you need to make on this

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.330 
much of a turn you need to make on this
side<00:06:14.370> remember<00:06:14.610> we<00:06:14.870> returned<00:06:15.870> 135<00:06:16.860> degrees

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
side remember we returned 135 degrees

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.330 
side remember we returned 135 degrees
here<00:06:18.530> let's<00:06:19.530> take<00:06:19.889> a<00:06:19.949> look<00:06:20.370> at<00:06:20.550> that<00:06:20.759> turn<00:06:22.340> well

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
here let's take a look at that turn well

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.890 
here let's take a look at that turn well
this<00:06:24.180> is<00:06:24.360> also<00:06:24.599> 45<00:06:25.380> degrees<00:06:26.300> so<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.449> turn<00:06:27.719> we

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
this is also 45 degrees so the turn we

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.890 
this is also 45 degrees so the turn we
need<00:06:28.080> to<00:06:28.229> make<00:06:28.440> here<00:06:28.919> is<00:06:30.590> also<00:06:31.909> 180<00:06:32.909> minus<00:06:33.330> 45

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
need to make here is also 180 minus 45

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:42.219 
need to make here is also 180 minus 45
or<00:06:34.400> 135<00:06:35.400> degrees<00:06:38.030> so<00:06:39.030> let's<00:06:39.240> go<00:06:39.509> right<00:06:40.550> 135

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
or 135 degrees so let's go right 135

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:49.339 
or 135 degrees so let's go right 135
that<00:06:43.229> looks<00:06:43.530> right<00:06:45.919> and<00:06:46.919> now<00:06:47.719> we<00:06:48.719> knew<00:06:49.020> that

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:49.349 
that looks right and now we knew that

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:54.589 
that looks right and now we knew that
this<00:06:49.530> was<00:06:50.240> 100<00:06:51.240> steps<00:06:52.909> before<00:06:53.909> we<00:06:54.030> went<00:06:54.150> 100

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 
this was 100 steps before we went 100

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.719 
this was 100 steps before we went 100
steps<00:06:54.839> this<00:06:55.139> time<00:06:55.199> this<00:06:55.680> one<00:06:55.919> went<00:06:56.219> from<00:06:56.370> here

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
steps this time this one went from here

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:58.760 
steps this time this one went from here
to<00:06:56.760> here<00:06:57.029> 100<00:06:57.750> steps

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
to here 100 steps

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.790 
to here 100 steps
also<00:06:59.069> 100<00:06:59.520> steps<00:07:02.030> and<00:07:03.229> finally<00:07:04.229> just<00:07:04.440> to<00:07:04.590> get

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
also 100 steps and finally just to get

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.180 
also 100 steps and finally just to get
ourselves<00:07:04.919> back<00:07:05.629> to<00:07:06.629> our<00:07:06.830> initial<00:07:07.830> state<00:07:08.159> to

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
ourselves back to our initial state to

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.930 
ourselves back to our initial state to
our<00:07:08.550> starting<00:07:09.330> position<00:07:10.340> I'm<00:07:11.340> gonna<00:07:11.430> go<00:07:11.669> right

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
our starting position I'm gonna go right

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:19.189 
our starting position I'm gonna go right
99<00:07:15.289> chosen<00:07:17.360> so<00:07:18.360> let's<00:07:18.539> just<00:07:18.840> double-check

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 
99 chosen so let's just double-check

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:25.399 
99 chosen so let's just double-check
we'll<00:07:21.530> move<00:07:22.530> this<00:07:22.770> guy<00:07:23.009> down<00:07:23.069> here<00:07:24.139> and<00:07:25.139> put

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:25.409 
we'll move this guy down here and put

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:29.600 
we'll move this guy down here and put
the<00:07:25.530> pen<00:07:25.740> down<00:07:27.500> now<00:07:28.500> I'll<00:07:28.680> just<00:07:28.710> back<00:07:29.129> up<00:07:29.430> and

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
the pen down now I'll just back up and

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.990 
the pen down now I'll just back up and
walk<00:07:29.849> through<00:07:31.310> all<00:07:32.310> the<00:07:32.430> steps<00:07:32.639> we<00:07:32.849> took

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
walk through all the steps we took

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.740 
walk through all the steps we took
before<00:07:33.240> we<00:07:33.539> went<00:07:33.750> forward<00:07:34.740> 100<00:07:36.199> right<00:07:37.199> 135

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
before we went forward 100 right 135

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.320 
before we went forward 100 right 135
forward<00:07:39.750> 100<00:07:40.169> times<00:07:40.349> the<00:07:40.500> square<00:07:40.800> root<00:07:40.830> of<00:07:40.949> 2

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.330 
forward 100 times the square root of 2

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:47.719 
forward 100 times the square root of 2
right<00:07:42.330> 135<00:07:43.669> forward<00:07:44.669> 100<00:07:45.330> and<00:07:45.930> right<00:07:46.440> 90<00:07:46.949> and

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:47.729 
right 135 forward 100 and right 90 and

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:51.770 
right 135 forward 100 and right 90 and
that's<00:07:48.270> how<00:07:48.569> you<00:07:48.630> make<00:07:49.020> a<00:07:50.210> isosceles<00:07:51.210> right

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 
that's how you make a isosceles right

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.680 
that's how you make a isosceles right
triangle
