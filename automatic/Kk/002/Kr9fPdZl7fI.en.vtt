 rubbing and gustavu I team to be 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.850
 debut attention this weekend I 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.979
 first time I like this track 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.649
 very fast fascinating 3 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.420
 here the amazing atmosphere just started 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.340
 weekend but there are already a lot 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.649
 fans it is amazing what 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.570
 so many people are fond of motor racing I 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.190
 can't even imagine how many fans 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.190
 will be here during the year 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.409
 weekend attention includes everything 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 one four-hour training session 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.170
 and 3 qualifications for which 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.850
 determine the place at the start of the first 3 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.830
 qualification passes evening time 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.350
 so that riders can fully 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.160
 adapt to piloting in the dark 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.479
 time of day both crews g-drive racing 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.790
 faced with problems in the settings 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.470
 cars besides all sessions 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.660
 interrupted by red flags 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.330
 because of the large number of incidents on 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.860
 the road therefore drive the necessary 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.110
 distance failed 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.160
 however in the course of crew weekends 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.540
 russian team 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.590
 have made serious progress 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.080
 gamification was able to show 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.330
 good time but the session was suspended 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.670
 red flags we could fight 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.860
 for the floor even though the car is not 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.140
 easy to manage she strives to go into a skid 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.690
 at the corner entrance we see the corner itself 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.100
 slide the front wheels we all 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.910
 Equally until the end tried to improve 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.910
 result 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.480
 principle good result in the rest 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.100
 time of course I would like to first but in 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.210
 reality first century or fikatsii us 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.850
 there were very big problems with 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.900
 settings so we had first 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.410
 fourth position then moved to 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.080
 the sixth but worked very hard and I think 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.790
 that now, in principle, the race will be 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.160
 a little easier to get hard to find 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.170
 car settings on the track new 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.170
 connection and it completely changed 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.320
 result of qualification for our team 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.330
 second and ninth place in the class lmp2 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.520
 Of course, by resale in 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.670
 le mane and do not play a decisive role well 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.430
 show a good pace is crucial 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.870
 front 2 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.909
 punks who need 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.580
 not only reliably not fall into all sorts 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.730
 trouble but also quickly not 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.159
