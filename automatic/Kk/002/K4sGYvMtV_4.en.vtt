 hello everyone with you letsplay show today 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.990
 we will review on the egg app 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 This is an interesting application where u 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.949
 us 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.619
 the egg on which we must proclaim 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.750
 already 1 million times on camera of this 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.150
 probably will not be heard and you will not 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.060
 feel but when i hit the egg i 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:33.270
 feel the vibration the vibration that we 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:37.660
 we can disable the sound in the settings 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.720
 vibration can color color pancake color background 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.720
 change to some orange there 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.320
 let's say the sound of clicking is my sound 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.750
 disabled 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.340
 Do not ruin to demonstrate something there 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.990
 copyrighted violated sounds 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.600
 block no nose to the general good class 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.570
 they clash there classes so we must 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.380
 a million times at click this i own my 800 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.040
 just managed to click on the toilet at the top 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.110
 we are all sorts of facebook contact twitter 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.470
 classmates this all refers to 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.660
 our only not our developer 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.630
 this game he also earns others 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.060
 games are not bad in principle but 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.360
 at the same time as my bad phone 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.320
 didn't go though I was honestly surprised that how 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.840
 IS-4 did not go well, anything happens 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.240
 by the way the developer promised some 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.560
 interesting chip at the end of that well after 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.600
 you click a million times well i 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.970
 Naturally I will not do this 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.700
 I know what a trick maybe you tell 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.650
 me in the comments when you click on 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.520
 but it seems to me this chip will be just 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.520
 killed and nerves and a hole in the phone just 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.650
 in the area of ​​this egg i'm so telephone 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.650
 I probably won't risk my 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.560
 yeah well nafig general well if you like 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.010

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.250

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.659
