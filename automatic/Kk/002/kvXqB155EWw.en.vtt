00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
get but basically some of the things you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.170 
get but basically some of the things you
can<00:00:31.890> find<00:00:31.920> our<00:00:32.219> attachments<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> weapons

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
can find our attachments for the weapons

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.760 
can find our attachments for the weapons
that<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.600> buy<00:00:33.719> around<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.020> place<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
that you can buy around the place and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.100 
that you can buy around the place and
when<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.430> attach<00:00:35.700> these<00:00:35.910> stuff<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.809> i<00:00:36.840> think

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
when you attach these stuff but i think

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.330 
when you attach these stuff but i think
it's<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> sites<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.219> also

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
it's the sites that do this but also

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.130 
it's the sites that do this but also
some<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> other<00:00:38.790> ones<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.149> basically<00:00:40.050> what

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
some of the other ones do basically what

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.240 
some of the other ones do basically what
it<00:00:40.170> does<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.469> changes<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> cam<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.219> your

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it does it changes the cam on your

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
it does it changes the cam on your
weapon<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> new<00:00:42.239> camera<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.840> I've<00:00:43.170> done<00:00:43.379> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
weapon to a new camera so I've done it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
weapon to a new camera so I've done it
now<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.800> I've<00:00:43.890> got<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.789> smaller<00:00:45.059> choco<00:00:45.329> camo

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
now and I've got some smaller choco camo

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.810 
now and I've got some smaller choco camo
oh<00:00:45.899> yes<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.800> does<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.399> basically<00:00:47.489> if

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
oh yes so it does that but basically if

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.400 
oh yes so it does that but basically if
you<00:00:47.910> find<00:00:48.149> two<00:00:48.360> attachments<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> same

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you find two attachments of the same

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
you find two attachments of the same
type<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.100> can't<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.520> both<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.969> say<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
type that you can't have both so say a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.119 
type that you can't have both so say a
thermal<00:00:51.660> sight<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> red<00:00:52.410> dot<00:00:52.530> sight<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.920> red

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
thermal sight on a red dot sight or red

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
thermal sight on a red dot sight or red
dot<00:00:53.250> holographic<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.539> mostly<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.320> keep

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
dot holographic the mostly you can keep

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.770 
dot holographic the mostly you can keep
on<00:00:55.559> switching<00:00:55.770> between<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:57.629> you'll

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
on switching between them and you'll

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
on switching between them and you'll
switch<00:00:57.930> between<00:00:58.109> all<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> available<00:00:58.710> camos<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
switch between all the available camos I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.510 
switch between all the available camos I
think<00:00:59.670> there's<00:01:00.000> 15<00:01:00.570> close<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.260> 20<00:01:01.500> maybe<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.460> if

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
think there's 15 close to 20 maybe so if

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.100 
think there's 15 close to 20 maybe so if
you<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.059> quite<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> bit<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.989> can

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
you just do this quite a bit as you can

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.299 
you just do this quite a bit as you can
see<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> comic<00:01:04.890> pretty<00:01:05.070> early

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
see you can see the comic pretty early

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.859 
see you can see the comic pretty early
on<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.720> do

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
on then what you can do is you can do

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.880 
on then what you can do is you can do
this<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.140> long<00:01:07.320> enough<00:01:07.409> till<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> get

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
