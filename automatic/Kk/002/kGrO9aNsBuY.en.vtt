00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:19.440
 so here is the thermomix at tm 31 in front of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.420
 werk facing the companion kitchens 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.950
 moulinex robots that are intended to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.750
 do pretty much anything that is done in 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.400
 cooking including cooking 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.600
 food 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.700
 we will especially highlight the 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.420
 differences of these two robots to 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.010
 start with the bowl on the thermomix on 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.360
 is going to have a bowl that absolutely has to be 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.130
 open to be removed from a capacity 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 maximum of 2 liters on the companion 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.510
 is going to have a bowl of 2 liters and a half which 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 can be removed by leaving the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 lid on it and that works with 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.340
 two little clips on the wrists like 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.320
 a pressure cooker thermomix 1 is delivered 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.160
 with a minimum of accessories since 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.170
 going to have a knife that serves everything to 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.640
 four blades on which we will be able 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.170
 add a whip in terms of the soul 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.290
 it is the only accessory that is provided 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.240
 with the harmonix on the companion we go 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.150
 have a chopper a mixer a drummer 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.220
 and a knife kneads every robot is 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.409
 supplied with an orange spatula for 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.970
 companion slides for heels 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.939
 then at the level of operation 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.939
 it's very simple we will adjust a time 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:38.430
 cooking that ranges from 30 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.220
 seconds to an hour then eventually 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.310
 a temperature in the case of foods 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.970
 which must be heated knowing that the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.670
 temperature goes from 37 to 100 Â° per slice 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.540
 10 degrees then to launch the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.159
 robot operation 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.350
 we will close the lid well 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.880
 obviously since we like security and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.220
 choose the speed of rotation of the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.869
 blade that is graduated according to said 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.509
 different powers 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.150
 differences also between the companion 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.700
 and the thermomix the companion has 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.160
 automatic programs that will us 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.350
 to make jumps without 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.500
 soups of simmering 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.680
 steaming pasta and pasta 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.880
 desserts in these programs we have 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.280
 for some under program with some 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.720
 different temperatures and times of 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 different cooking that we can 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 heard vary also at 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 inside as needed
