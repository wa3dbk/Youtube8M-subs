00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.150
 backtrack beautiful and warm 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.179
 Welcome youtube to a new conti 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.150
 german speaker and that touch here 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.000
 whole live today under battlefield 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.800
 3 and then even after mat at first 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.850
 not so i know i call it anyway 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.560
 so because I can yes and actually 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.060
 Let's play it all right here 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 live and I should should I have to say 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.109
 me actually on the rost server 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.750
 also just wanted to run 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.230
 the bomb diffused keeper it happens 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 the admin change the label on this 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.239
 scavenger so on looter too german 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.620
 this new game mode in battlefield 3 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.210
 I did not want to show it 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 I actually do not do it at all 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.820
 But that's the way it is and now we're playing that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.160
 quite simply you see 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
 Scavenger are everywhere on the map 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.059
 Weapons around the bottom right you can also see one 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.230
 has, for example, with the mg 100 shot 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.030
 then it is teacher you need one 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.100
 other weapon respectively there is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 but at some places ammunition boxes 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.840
 the one then old pattern one then 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.400
 can or can cancel 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.260
 you can go then you just get 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 again ammunition that is very cool 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.430
 in itself I find the mode but just 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 anyway the celebration somehow not so 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.009
 all my battlefield course down 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.900
 feeling corresponds 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.369
 That's why I would rather have shown quickly 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.100
 Play a quick thousand times, you know that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.350
 I originally wanted her even hornier 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.920
 Show you guys that's completely impossible 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 that does not work anymore 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.759
 I do not want tdm with 500 to partially 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.979
 1000 tickets play 100 200 tickets 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.549
 I want that but there is nowhere 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.350
 more on offer that's really shit 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.140
 or is it that way just either 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.369
 no service at all or the server 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.670
 permanently occupied I understand it 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.280
 Not 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.470
 i do not like it to be that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.960
 it is still different with other dlcs or 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.979
 at other cards here at those of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.009
 It is not like that after math lessons 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.360
 well, the cool thing is scavenger that 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.040
 you also get the points very very fast 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.689
 I think that's absolutely cool 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.020
 So there are very many again 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.120
 points as fast as the weapon 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.590
 bz by the way also very cool one 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.430
 sometimes plays other weapons again 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.690
 I would not normally 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.730
 Now he is coming around the corner 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.130
 I'm so stupid why I charge at the moment 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.460
 if I hardly ever shoot anyway 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.160
 from 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.840
 that's a bit that's always 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.330
 because of black ops two players again much 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.940
 or actually gc so I'm playing 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.290
 and on black ops 2 and yes you know it 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.930
 yes after a shot you load on 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.840
 Dearest already after shit 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.640
 and yes you still take over 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.860
 at battlefield what is absolute piss 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.280
 malermeister first time so another 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.560
 Thing 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.440
 just say something without looking 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.990
 do you know the map names of after matte 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.100
 So here I am not I can do it myself 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.060
 do not notice yes I have them 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.520
 wrote 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.080
 but before I look what they are called 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.980
 I would like to first take up weapon 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.360
 here is a rum 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.620
 I'm not so defenseless either 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.230
 this mkl afloat is rochelle people 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.890
 Well, so no matter before we do the porno 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.630
 web sites azadi palace epicenter talar 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.390
 market and markers monolith horny meppen 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.080
 but I really can not remember 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.520
 the suck so now any time 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.000
 take a point and best again one 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.100
 good weapon wars quotation lascana yes 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.160
 never so my case but better than light 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.920
 everyone runs after you young life 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.300
 saved that big you are all there 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.370
 blind here pure action that's the cool 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.140
 the negative is why I, by the way 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.850
 Came not so happy or actually 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.820
 hardly do not play games at all 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.959
 you really did not have enough shot you got 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.709
 too little Schlussmann is partially in 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.810
 fire fighting yes there you have two you yes 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.490
 You are in their back and you have 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.830
 really just shot the other one 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.260
 turns around picks you up so that works 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.510
 constantly sometimes in the middle of 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.840
 firefight is the moni all that clear 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.300
 can you too 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.459
 normally happen but here it is 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.230
 much more extreme so birgit will not last 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.640
 I also hate the weapon like that 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.260
 pest yes I 've just said so 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.150
 lmk fj shit high ten 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.750
 I do not bring down room Smeral 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.490
 times lost live 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.620
 yes I have already told me last 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.060
 but relatively few gameplays of dies 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.919
 by dies no by after mat in circulation 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.540
 Now some years tell you to do it 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.889
 but quite a lot of what I find 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.919
 not at all from and to seven 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.540
 but it is due to the gameplay 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.440
 release of black ops 2 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.220
 but pretty much lost so again 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.610
 brought down five times by the old guys 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.220
 five times 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.630
 it has pretty much gone down and there 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.169
 You can really only say a pity 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.000
 actually 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.320
 Although it play a lot but on 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.910
 youtube.com but not so 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.400
 I would like to change that a bit 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.840
 definitely gives battlefield 3 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.120
 I can play games of it at the moment 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.570
 just saying running is usually not like that 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.220
 good and that's why I do not have any 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.020
 normal gameplay of shown i hope 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.160
 that my rounds will be better there soon 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.870
 and mostly straight 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.430
 already seen the sco here you come 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.539
 here 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.849
 19 11 was to attach but you should 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.700
 not without 20 four men already dear 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:33.000
 but will be summer 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.440
 in that sense, I thank you for the 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.460
 attention see you at 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.539
