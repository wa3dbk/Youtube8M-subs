that one come from is that a stock one

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.480 
that one come from is that a stock one
this<00:00:14.100> this<00:00:14.850> is<00:00:15.000> an<00:00:15.150> original<00:00:15.540> stock<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.490> kicker

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
this this is an original stock of kicker

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.919 
this this is an original stock of kicker
cover<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.689> was<00:00:18.930> produced<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:20.329> says<00:00:21.329> October

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:21.929 
cover that was produced in says October

cover that was produced in says October
of<00:00:22.669> 1947<00:00:23.669> so<00:00:24.150> that's<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.349> date<00:00:25.560> code

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
of 1947 so that's what that date code

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.069 
of 1947 so that's what that date code
means<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.359> wanted<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.869> was

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
to have as authentic look as possible to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.590 
to have as authentic look as possible to
the<00:00:31.050> original<00:00:31.140> stock<00:00:31.710> ones<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.489> then<00:00:32.640> update

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the original stock ones but then update

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.560 
the original stock ones but then update
as<00:00:33.810> much<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
as much as we could so this is this is

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.000 
as much as we could so this is this is
one<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> our<00:00:36.870> castings<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.680> actually<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
one of our castings this is actually a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.349 
one of our castings this is actually a
version<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> doesn't<00:00:38.789> have<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> date<00:00:39.149> code

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
version that doesn't have the date code

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.250 
version that doesn't have the date code
on<00:00:39.539> it<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.370> we've<00:00:41.370> updated<00:00:41.699> the<00:00:42.359> casting<00:00:42.899> but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
on it but we've updated the casting but

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.580 
on it but we've updated the casting but
we've<00:00:43.609> kept<00:00:44.609> all<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.090> nuances<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
we've kept all the nuances of the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.549 
we've kept all the nuances of the
original<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.370> week<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.850> close<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.539> could<00:00:48.750> if

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
original as week as close as we could if

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.720 
original as week as close as we could if
you<00:00:49.649> look<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> inside<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.739> original<00:00:53.309> ones

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you look at the inside the original ones

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
you look at the inside the original ones
they<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.300> tend<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> break<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.829> would

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
they they tend to break and they would

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.110 
they they tend to break and they would
weld<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.429> up

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
weld them up

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
weld them up
Rema<00:00:57.600> sheen<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.199> put<00:00:58.559> bushings<00:00:58.890> back<00:00:59.129> in

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
Rema sheen them and put bushings back in

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.759 
Rema sheen them and put bushings back in
their<00:01:00.179> original<00:01:00.300> had<00:01:00.870> two<00:01:00.989> two-piece<00:01:01.350> bushing

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
their original had two two-piece bushing

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.160 
their original had two two-piece bushing
which<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.300> seal<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> inside

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
which and the seal was on the inside

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.040 
which and the seal was on the inside
that<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.250> middle<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.640> bushings<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.930> you'd

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
that the middle of the bushings so you'd

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.840 
that the middle of the bushings so you'd
have<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.230> dry<00:01:07.440> outer<00:01:07.650> seal<00:01:07.980> what<00:01:08.370> we've<00:01:08.520> done<00:01:08.730> is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
have a dry outer seal what we've done is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.550 
have a dry outer seal what we've done is
we've<00:01:09.000> gone<00:01:09.120> to<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.300> single<00:01:09.720> bushing<00:01:10.080> beefed

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
we've gone to a single bushing beefed

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.490 
we've gone to a single bushing beefed
all<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> material<00:01:11.520> around<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.060> boss<00:01:12.750> itself

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
all the material around the boss itself

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.150 
all the material around the boss itself
and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> outside<00:01:14.780> added<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.900> seal<00:01:16.470> for

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
and then on the outside added a seal for

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.650 
and then on the outside added a seal for
improvement<00:01:17.730> now<00:01:17.910> when<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.510> this<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
improvement now when it when this is

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.030 
improvement now when it when this is
fully<00:01:19.110> assembled<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.620> can't<00:01:19.800> tell<00:01:19.980> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
fully assembled you can't tell the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.590 
fully assembled you can't tell the
difference<00:01:20.340> between<00:01:20.430> stock<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:23.180> flat<00:01:24.180> right

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
difference between stock and flat right

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
difference between stock and flat right
your<00:01:24.780> kickstart<00:01:25.230> lever<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.950> mounts

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
your kickstart lever you know mounts

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980 
your kickstart lever you know mounts
right<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> don't<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.540> shaft<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
right here so you don't get the shaft of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.960 
right here so you don't get the shaft of
that<00:01:28.170> yeah<00:01:28.410> yeah<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.370> don't<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.760> see

kept all the nuances here I'm looking at
how<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.800> casting<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> rough<00:01:38.880> wasn't

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
how the casting was kind of rough wasn't

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.720 
how the casting was kind of rough wasn't
perfectly<00:01:39.660> round<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.890> guys<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.250> duplicated

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
perfectly round you guys have duplicated

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.790 
perfectly round you guys have duplicated

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
it right here yeah exactly but we've

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.930 
it right here yeah exactly but we've
want<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.130> duplicate<00:01:44.580> every<00:01:44.970> nuance<00:01:45.150> every

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
want to duplicate every nuance every

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.660 
want to duplicate every nuance every
every<00:01:47.940> imperfection<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:50.130> they<00:01:50.280> had<00:01:50.490> in

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
every imperfection that that they had in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.120 
every imperfection that that they had in
fact<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.950> 1948<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.130> 1950<00:01:54.830> style<00:01:55.830> kicker

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
fact this is a 1948 to 1950 style kicker

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
fact this is a 1948 to 1950 style kicker
cover<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:56.940> would<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.540> been<00:01:57.660> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
cover so that would have been the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.770 
cover so that would have been the
tooling<00:01:58.020> back<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.470> day<00:01:59.540> we've<00:02:00.540> come<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
tooling back in the day we've come a
