it's a big big accomplishment and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.230 
it's a big big accomplishment and
something<00:00:17.110> that<00:00:17.410> you'll<00:00:17.650> use<00:00:17.890> through<00:00:18.820> your

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
something that you'll use through your

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.089 
something that you'll use through your
years<00:00:19.480> of<00:00:19.539> playing<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.619> you'll<00:00:20.740> come<00:00:20.949> up<00:00:20.980> with

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
years of playing and you'll come up with

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.529 
years of playing and you'll come up with
all<00:00:21.279> kinds<00:00:21.310> of<00:00:21.609> different<00:00:21.730> variations<00:00:22.119> on

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
all kinds of different variations on

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.779 
all kinds of different variations on
that<00:00:22.750> but<00:00:23.050> that's<00:00:23.560> a<00:00:23.679> really<00:00:23.859> good<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.369> think<00:00:24.580> a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
that but that's a really good I think a

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.109 
that but that's a really good I think a
good<00:00:25.000> baseline<00:00:25.359> as<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:25.900> how<00:00:26.349> it<00:00:26.500> works<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.970> this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
good baseline as to how it works in this

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.550 
good baseline as to how it works in this
lesson<00:00:28.359> we're<00:00:28.599> gonna<00:00:28.660> take<00:00:29.080> a<00:00:29.109> look<00:00:29.380> at

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
lesson we're gonna take a look at

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.010 
lesson we're gonna take a look at
transposing<00:00:30.369> that<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.849> different<00:00:31.720> keys<00:00:31.869> so

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
transposing that to different keys so

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.780 
transposing that to different keys so
we're<00:00:32.110> not<00:00:32.259> limited<00:00:32.650> to<00:00:32.680> just<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.340> key<00:00:33.520> of<00:00:33.640> a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
we're not limited to just the key of a

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.090 
we're not limited to just the key of a
so<00:00:34.780> let's<00:00:34.900> take<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:35.050> look<00:00:35.260> at<00:00:35.350> this<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:35.860> when<00:00:36.010> we

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
so let's take a look at this so when we

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.840 
so let's take a look at this so when we
played<00:00:36.340> that<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.960> at<00:00:38.110> a<00:00:38.289> power<00:00:38.739> chord<00:00:41.850> we're

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
played that and at a power chord we're

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.700 
played that and at a power chord we're
basically<00:00:43.149> on<00:00:43.449> two<00:00:43.989> strings<00:00:44.230> we're<00:00:44.530> on<00:00:44.620> the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
basically on two strings we're on the

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.650 
basically on two strings we're on the
fifth<00:00:44.859> string<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.820> fourth<00:00:46.059> string<00:00:46.329> and

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
fifth string and the fourth string and

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.799 
fifth string and the fourth string and
the<00:00:47.440> 5th<00:00:47.590> string<00:00:47.920> was<00:00:48.820> an<00:00:48.940> open<00:00:49.359> note<00:00:49.510> it<00:00:49.690> was

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
the 5th string was an open note it was

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.610 
the 5th string was an open note it was
an<00:00:49.870> opening<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:52.239> open<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.260> actually

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
an opening and the open a is actually

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.310 
an opening and the open a is actually
what<00:00:53.739> makes<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.129> nice<00:00:54.340> because<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.989> frees<00:00:56.289> up

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
what makes that nice because it frees up

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.200 
what makes that nice because it frees up
our<00:00:56.590> other<00:00:56.739> hand<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.280> be<00:00:57.399> able<00:00:57.519> to<00:00:57.640> make<00:00:57.969> all

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
our other hand to be able to make all

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.669 
our other hand to be able to make all
kinds<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.570> stretches<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.989> can<00:01:02.050> move<00:01:02.320> all<00:01:02.500> up

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
kinds of stretches you can move all up

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.799 
kinds of stretches you can move all up
and<00:01:02.829> down<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.039> neck<00:01:03.070> if<00:01:03.339> it<00:01:03.460> needs<00:01:03.609> to<00:01:03.809> well

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
and down the neck if it needs to well

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.210 
and down the neck if it needs to well
we're<00:01:04.930> gonna<00:01:05.050> transpose<00:01:05.620> this<00:01:05.920> you're<00:01:06.130> gonna

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
we're gonna transpose this you're gonna

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.480 
we're gonna transpose this you're gonna
see<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.820> don't<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.210> that<00:01:08.490> flexibility

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
see that you don't have that flexibility

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.180 
see that you don't have that flexibility
because<00:01:10.110> instead<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.290> playing<00:01:11.500> these<00:01:11.710> open

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
because instead of playing these open

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.880 
because instead of playing these open
notes<00:01:12.400> you're<00:01:13.240> gonna<00:01:13.360> have<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.720> actually<00:01:14.350> push

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
notes you're gonna have to actually push

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.830 
notes you're gonna have to actually push
down<00:01:15.130> you're<00:01:15.460> gonna<00:01:15.580> fret<00:01:15.940> that<00:01:16.150> open<00:01:16.690> though

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
down you're gonna fret that open though

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.020 
down you're gonna fret that open though
so<00:01:17.440> if<00:01:17.620> you<00:01:17.710> think<00:01:17.830> of<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.100> nut<00:01:18.310> here<00:01:18.610> which<00:01:18.910> is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
so if you think of the nut here which is

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.270 
so if you think of the nut here which is
this<00:01:19.150> piece<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.870> nut<00:01:20.260> as<00:01:20.470> your<00:01:20.650> finger<00:01:21.010> it's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
this piece the nut as your finger it's

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.130 
this piece the nut as your finger it's
kind<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.520> pushing<00:01:21.700> down<00:01:22.030> for<00:01:22.330> you<00:01:22.480> on<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.780> on

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
kind of pushing down for you on the on

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.500 
kind of pushing down for you on the on
the<00:01:23.350> zero<00:01:23.650> fret<00:01:23.980> now<00:01:24.880> if<00:01:24.970> we're<00:01:25.120> gonna<00:01:25.270> play<00:01:25.450> in

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
the zero fret now if we're gonna play in

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.730 
the zero fret now if we're gonna play in
the<00:01:25.570> key<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.930> sharp<00:01:26.290> for<00:01:26.500> example<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:29.590> gonna

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
the key of a sharp for example I'm gonna

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.130 
the key of a sharp for example I'm gonna
have<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.130> fret<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.060> myself<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:31.780> think<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.050> it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
have the fret that myself so think of it

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.750 
have the fret that myself so think of it
as<00:01:32.230> moving<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.650> nut<00:01:32.950> up<00:01:33.160> one<00:01:33.490> you're

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
as moving the nut up one you're

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.900 
as moving the nut up one you're
simulating<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.390> nut<00:01:34.570> with<00:01:34.810> your<00:01:35.020> ear<00:01:35.440> finger

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
simulating the nut with your ear finger

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.510 
simulating the nut with your ear finger
so<00:01:36.910> just<00:01:37.570> as<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.770> other<00:01:38.980> note<00:01:39.220> on<00:01:39.430> the

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
so just as the the other note on the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.350 
so just as the the other note on the
fourth<00:01:39.730> string<00:01:39.850> was<00:01:40.810> here<00:01:41.290> on<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:42.360> now

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
fourth string was here on the a now

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.810 
fourth string was here on the a now
we're<00:01:43.570> gonna<00:01:43.660> have<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.900> move<00:01:44.050> it<00:01:44.260> up<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.820> so

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
we're gonna have to move it up to so

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.980 
we're gonna have to move it up to so
it's<00:01:45.940> gonna<00:01:46.060> have<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.210> go<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.510> third<00:01:46.690> fret

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
it's gonna have to go to the third fret

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.140 
it's gonna have to go to the third fret
so<00:01:47.350> it<00:01:47.470> looks<00:01:47.740> like<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.850> put<00:01:49.030> them

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
so it looks like this you put them

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.580 
so it looks like this you put them
together<00:01:49.270> that's<00:01:49.930> an<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.410> sharp<00:01:51.280> power<00:01:51.700> chord

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
together that's an a sharp power chord

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.620 
together that's an a sharp power chord
now<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.650> challenge<00:01:54.400> isn't<00:01:54.760> that<00:01:54.940> so<00:01:55.180> much<00:01:55.390> as

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
now the challenge isn't that so much as

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.980 
now the challenge isn't that so much as

the<00:03:39.180> blues<00:03:40.180> jam<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.600> key<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:42.160> started

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
the blues jam in the key of a we started

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.720 
the blues jam in the key of a we started
on<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.850> fifth<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.130> fifth<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.250> fourth<00:03:45.459> strain

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
on the fifth and fifth and fourth strain

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330 
on the fifth and fifth and fourth strain
to<00:03:45.970> play<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.600> but<00:03:47.350> then<00:03:47.470> we<00:03:47.590> jumped<00:03:47.950> up<00:03:48.070> to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
to play the a but then we jumped up to

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.600 
to play the a but then we jumped up to
the<00:03:48.730> fourth<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.420> third<00:03:49.600> string<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:51.130> play<00:03:51.280> the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
the fourth and third string to play the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.750 
the fourth and third string to play the
D<00:03:52.090> well<00:03:52.959> we<00:03:53.230> can<00:03:53.380> also<00:03:53.500> work<00:03:53.799> do<00:03:54.160> anything<00:03:54.579> on

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
D well we can also work do anything on

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.030 
D well we can also work do anything on
we<00:03:55.150> could<00:03:55.299> do<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.540> same<00:03:55.750> pattern<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.320> any<00:03:56.860> of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
we could do the same pattern on any of

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:06.600 
we could do the same pattern on any of
the<00:03:57.280> fourth<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.940> third<00:03:58.420> strings<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.430> can

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
the fourth and third strings so you can

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.160 
the fourth and third strings so you can
see<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.880> can<00:04:07.000> slide<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.360> all<00:04:07.450> up<00:04:07.660> up<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.019> down

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
see you can slide it all up up and down

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.470 
see you can slide it all up up and down
the<00:04:08.350> in<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.160> neck<00:04:09.370> there<00:04:09.579> to<00:04:09.760> get<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.180> can<00:04:10.329> so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
the in the neck there to get you can so

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.759 
the in the neck there to get you can so
you<00:04:10.510> can<00:04:10.660> find<00:04:10.840> whatever<00:04:11.049> key<00:04:11.380> it<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.620> you're

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
you can find whatever key it is you're

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.800 
you can find whatever key it is you're
trying<00:04:11.890> to<00:04:12.010> find<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.880> can<00:04:12.970> also<00:04:13.180> do<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.660> same

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
trying to find you can also do the same

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.860 
trying to find you can also do the same
thing<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.500> fifth<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.700> sixth<00:04:16.060> strings<00:04:16.299> so

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
thing on the fifth and sixth strings so

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.390 
thing on the fifth and sixth strings so
we<00:04:17.019> play<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.410> e<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:17.950> here

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
we play the e down here

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.870 
we play the e down here
if<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.120> played<00:04:20.359> here<00:04:21.250> that's<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.490> in<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.699> key

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
if I played here that's the in the key

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.930 
if I played here that's the in the key
of<00:04:22.910> F<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.780> got<00:04:23.900> F<00:04:24.110> sharp<00:04:24.440> G<00:04:26.979> G<00:04:27.979> sharp

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
of F you got F sharp G G sharp

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.150 
of F you got F sharp G G sharp
now<00:04:29.690> an<00:04:29.870> interesting<00:04:30.290> thing<00:04:30.500> happens<00:04:31.100> here

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
now an interesting thing happens here

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.030 
now an interesting thing happens here
when<00:04:31.639> I<00:04:31.699> move<00:04:31.910> up<00:04:32.030> one<00:04:32.210> more<00:04:32.590> what's<00:04:33.590> above<00:04:33.860> the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
when I move up one more what's above the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.610 
when I move up one more what's above the
G<00:04:34.220> sharp<00:04:34.250> was<00:04:34.880> an<00:04:35.090> A<00:04:36.070> but<00:04:37.070> this<00:04:37.790> is<00:04:37.940> an<00:04:38.060> a2<00:04:38.620> so

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
G sharp was an A but this is an a2 so

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.530 
G sharp was an A but this is an a2 so
you<00:04:39.710> can<00:04:39.889> play<00:04:40.040> that<00:04:40.190> exact<00:04:40.669> same<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.270> sounds

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
you can play that exact same a it sounds

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.120 
you can play that exact same a it sounds
exactly<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.960> same<00:04:44.860> either<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:46.040> these

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
exactly the same either of these

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.980 
exactly the same either of these
positions<00:04:48.220> one<00:04:49.220> thing<00:04:49.490> that<00:04:49.699> if<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.780> go<00:04:50.930> to

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
positions one thing that if you go to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.170 
positions one thing that if you go to
youtube<00:04:51.229> and<00:04:51.710> do<00:04:52.130> a<00:04:52.160> search<00:04:52.370> for<00:04:52.400> Chuck<00:04:52.760> Berry

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
you'll notice that Chuck Berry played a

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.390 
you'll notice that Chuck Berry played a
lot<00:04:56.060> most<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.840> what<00:04:57.020> he<00:04:57.110> played<00:04:57.410> rhythm<00:04:58.070> wise

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
lot most of what he played rhythm wise

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.279 
lot most of what he played rhythm wise
was<00:04:58.910> kind<00:04:59.630> of<00:04:59.720> using<00:05:00.050> this<00:05:00.199> this<00:05:00.590> rhythm<00:05:05.289> and

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
was kind of using this this rhythm and

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.310 
was kind of using this this rhythm and
obviously<00:05:06.740> he<00:05:06.949> inspired<00:05:07.780> everybody<00:05:08.780> from<00:05:09.260> the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
obviously he inspired everybody from the

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.730 
obviously he inspired everybody from the
Rolling<00:05:09.919> Stones<00:05:10.220> to<00:05:10.490> Eric<00:05:11.449> Clapton<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:12.650> know

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
Rolling Stones to Eric Clapton you know

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.980 
Rolling Stones to Eric Clapton you know
and<00:05:13.010> obviously<00:05:13.490> many<00:05:13.910> many<00:05:14.300> artists<00:05:14.810> through

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
and obviously many many artists through

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.170 
and obviously many many artists through
the<00:05:15.080> years<00:05:15.260> have<00:05:15.470> picked<00:05:15.680> up<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:15.860> rhythm<00:05:16.340> but

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
the years have picked up that rhythm but

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.730 
the years have picked up that rhythm but
I<00:05:17.539> always<00:05:17.630> kind<00:05:17.930> of<00:05:17.960> think<00:05:18.199> of<00:05:18.289> that<00:05:18.500> as<00:05:18.710> a

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
I always kind of think of that as a

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.850 
I always kind of think of that as a
Chuck<00:05:19.039> Berry<00:05:19.280> rhythm<00:05:20.229> and<00:05:21.229> watch<00:05:21.440> his<00:05:21.620> hands

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
Chuck Berry rhythm and watch his hands

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.110 
Chuck Berry rhythm and watch his hands
when<00:05:22.070> he's<00:05:22.160> playing<00:05:22.430> he's<00:05:22.669> he's<00:05:22.940> that's

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
when he's playing he's he's that's

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.960 
when he's playing he's he's that's
exactly<00:05:23.630> what<00:05:23.750> he's<00:05:23.870> doing<00:05:24.139> is<00:05:24.229> that

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
exactly what he's doing is that

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.250 
exactly what he's doing is that
obviously<00:05:25.970> he'd<00:05:26.510> mix<00:05:26.750> it<00:05:26.870> in<00:05:26.990> with<00:05:27.080> other

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
obviously he'd mix it in with other

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.190 
obviously he'd mix it in with other
things

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.190 

so<00:05:36.200> this<00:05:36.350> is<00:05:36.500> just<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.830> key<00:05:37.010> of<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:40.420> just<00:05:41.420> same

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
so this is just the key of a just same

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.660 
so this is just the key of a just same
key<00:05:42.410> that<00:05:42.560> we<00:05:42.650> learned<00:05:45.040> so<00:05:46.040> anyway<00:05:46.340> I'm<00:05:46.520> not

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
key that we learned so anyway I'm not

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.280 
key that we learned so anyway I'm not
sure<00:05:46.850> why<00:05:47.030> I<00:05:47.060> chokeberry<00:05:47.720> always<00:05:48.050> kind<00:05:48.230> of

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
sure why I chokeberry always kind of

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.770 
sure why I chokeberry always kind of
played<00:05:48.500> up<00:05:48.680> here<00:05:48.920> in<00:05:49.760> fact<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.120> think<00:05:50.210> I've<00:05:50.480> seen

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
played up here in fact I think I've seen

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.690 
played up here in fact I think I've seen
him<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.170> don't<00:05:51.380> know<00:05:51.500> that<00:05:51.680> I've<00:05:51.800> ever<00:05:52.070> seen<00:05:52.400> him

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
him I don't know that I've ever seen him

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.470 
him I don't know that I've ever seen him
playing<00:05:53.150> down<00:05:54.020> here<00:05:54.470> I<00:05:55.210> guess<00:05:56.210> it's<00:05:56.390> because

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
playing down here I guess it's because

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.480 
playing down here I guess it's because
he's<00:05:56.750> got<00:05:56.930> such<00:05:57.110> long<00:05:57.350> fingers<00:05:57.710> or<00:05:58.130> something

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
he's got such long fingers or something

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.510 
he's got such long fingers or something
but<00:05:59.320> anyway<00:06:00.320> he's<00:06:00.680> Chuck<00:06:00.890> Berry<00:06:01.130> you<00:06:01.310> can<00:06:01.430> get

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
but anyway he's Chuck Berry you can get

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.880 
but anyway he's Chuck Berry you can get
away<00:06:01.610> with<00:06:01.850> it<00:06:01.970> but<00:06:02.720> there<00:06:03.110> you<00:06:03.230> go

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
away with it but there you go

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.160 
away with it but there you go
I<00:06:03.920> think<00:06:04.670> that<00:06:04.880> that's<00:06:05.570> pretty<00:06:05.780> much<00:06:05.900> all

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
I think that that's pretty much all

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.710 
I think that that's pretty much all
there<00:06:06.260> is<00:06:06.320> to<00:06:06.700> transposing<00:06:07.700> that<00:06:07.730> blues

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
there is to transposing that blues

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.200 
there is to transposing that blues
rhythm<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.410> any<00:06:09.770> key<00:06:10.070> so<00:06:10.700> hopefully<00:06:11.030> that's

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
rhythm to any key so hopefully that's

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.700 
rhythm to any key so hopefully that's
something<00:06:11.300> that<00:06:11.660> makes<00:06:11.810> sense<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.260> you<00:06:12.380> you

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
something that makes sense to you you

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.140 
something that makes sense to you you
know<00:06:12.830> something<00:06:13.040> you<00:06:13.190> have<00:06:13.370> to<00:06:13.400> practice<00:06:13.940> in

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
know something you have to practice in

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.030 
know something you have to practice in
the<00:06:14.600> beginning<00:06:14.930> it's<00:06:15.200> gonna<00:06:15.380> hurt<00:06:15.620> your<00:06:15.830> hand

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
the beginning it's gonna hurt your hand

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.230 
the beginning it's gonna hurt your hand
a<00:06:16.160> little<00:06:16.190> bit<00:06:16.460> especially<00:06:17.030> right<00:06:17.210> here

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
a little bit especially right here

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.570 
a little bit especially right here
there's<00:06:17.690> a<00:06:17.750> muscle<00:06:18.170> or<00:06:18.410> maybe<00:06:19.010> it's<00:06:19.160> a<00:06:19.220> tendon

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
there's a muscle or maybe it's a tendon

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.330 
there's a muscle or maybe it's a tendon
or<00:06:19.730> something<00:06:20.060> but<00:06:20.440> you'll<00:06:21.440> feel<00:06:21.710> you'll<00:06:22.070> feel

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
or something but you'll feel you'll feel

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.920 
or something but you'll feel you'll feel
them<00:06:22.490> it<00:06:22.880> kind<00:06:23.090> of<00:06:23.180> burn<00:06:23.420> we'll<00:06:23.660> fill<00:06:23.900> that

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
them it kind of burn we'll fill that

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.380 
them it kind of burn we'll fill that
when<00:06:24.170> you're<00:06:24.290> first<00:06:24.530> doing<00:06:24.770> this<00:06:25.040> but<00:06:25.940> just

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
when you're first doing this but just

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.940 
when you're first doing this but just
keep<00:06:26.570> practicing<00:06:27.080> it<00:06:27.200> and<00:06:27.230> that<00:06:27.440> will<00:06:27.530> go<00:06:27.680> away

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
keep practicing it and that will go away

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.330 
keep practicing it and that will go away
you'll<00:06:28.370> be<00:06:28.550> you'll<00:06:28.910> be<00:06:28.970> a<00:06:29.060> pro
