00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.769
 Hey girls, how are you 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.810
 good today I will not appear in the video I 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.000
 I come here to show how the 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.510
 birthday cake result 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.020
 bucca who had never spoken in the last 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:22.570
 video is showing 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:27.140
 and thus the final result 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:33.289
 I found it very beautiful, I did it and two 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.309
 and the top of the cake was thus 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.190
 mickey 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:42.170
 Then I'm thinking, just put the little girl. 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.489
 here in this little ball 16 over the head 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.510
 his 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:53.899
 How are you going to get the final result? 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:59.149
 so mateus back character I had 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:02.569
 made before gum and deer gum eva 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.870
 but our very bad I particularly 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:10.550
 I did not like etv I had seen a 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.580
 video on youtube from that part he 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.640
 was red in this part a frosting and is 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.640
 gum and see the red-and-white glassey 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.520
 only I do not know so I could not 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.710
 I did the two work but it got very 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.860
 full of probe 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.500
 when I'm picking up the icing 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.620
 we got awful had to take apart 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.890
 everything and do it all over again 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.240
 and these people believe I made 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.690
 paperboard 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.540
 the work was very good 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.030
 not even that far, you can not tell 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.610
 which is made of cardstock but is made of cardstock 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.640
 I liked it a little more for you to see. 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.920
 I did his face there right there. 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.900
 very beautiful and will be at the center table 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.409
 of the table to leave exactly as 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.150
 are the characters around the cake 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.130
 the mic on top only thing I wanted 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.920
 but could not put the fifth and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.380
 So it started from the mickey onu, 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.080
 first floor more 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.270
 It was legal because of this base that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.650
 he's here round 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.450
 there was a very easy job of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.400
 make it very tasty I found it very good 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.700
 I really enjoyed working with 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.070
 cardboard is very flexible to make 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.880
 drugs and that cake I actually 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.670
 buy back base nerds voted but this base 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.860
 of cardboard box that had 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.260
 a video on youtube too cool 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.850
 I first did not believe that it gives 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.480
 to do to stay so 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.590
 round so perfect but our super 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.490
 easy 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.560
 Of course you have to have a lot of patience. 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.760
 very easy to work with 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.130
 the paperboard 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.740
 but our very easy to move much 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.040
 It's really cool, working, everything. 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.390
 and the base got very good a lot 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.250
 perfect 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.510
 was much more economical as 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.100
 working with a recyclable resource 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.630
 I'm making the birthday of the logo everything. 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.400
 very little I'm buying right? 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.130
 I 'm boring, I 'm really counting 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.710
 things that I can not do as the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.900
 characters in some things 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.300
 So, people stayed like this and I hope 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.320
 You liked it, I really liked it. 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.320
 muito lindo 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.709
 It's really cool to do and redo from three 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.170
 floors but it was not going to get too big 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.390
 so mess up the picture because three 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.430
 floors but the top of the cake gets a lot 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.510
 So I thought it was going to be very 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.110
 cool 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.910
 and then I did even if you were to make 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.220
 head like I play I thought I'd stay 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.620
 very cool get very high so that 's it 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.750
 Hey guys, I came here to record, asked for 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.390

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.810
 cake 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.060
 so now I'm missing very little 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.600
 I have now to solve the theme of the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.150
 panel your command to focus on what I 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.120
 I've seen it's all right for 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.669

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.680

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.720
