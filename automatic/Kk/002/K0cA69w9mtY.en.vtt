00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.479 
couple cheap hits in arm before I switch
to<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.680> main<00:04:17.830> strategy<00:04:18.280> which<00:04:18.459> is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
to the main strategy which is

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.090 
to the main strategy which is
telekinesis<00:04:19.380> what<00:04:20.380> you're<00:04:20.470> going<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.650> do<00:04:20.770> here

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
telekinesis what you're going to do here

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.010 
telekinesis what you're going to do here
and<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.670> deal<00:04:21.850> insane<00:04:22.390> amount<00:04:22.660> of<00:04:22.690> damage

these

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.839 
these
I<00:04:25.539> guess<00:04:26.539> oxygen<00:04:27.410> or<00:04:27.560> chemical<00:04:28.220> canisters

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
I guess oxygen or chemical canisters

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.450 
I guess oxygen or chemical canisters
they're<00:04:29.599> very<00:04:30.169> flammable<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.949> right<00:04:31.310> there<00:04:31.430> I

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
the first time this happened and it was

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.040 
the first time this happened and it was
kind<00:04:49.370> of<00:04:49.400> funny<00:04:49.639> but<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.300> couldn't<00:04:50.720> find<00:04:50.750> them

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
kind of funny but I couldn't find them

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.439 
kind of funny but I couldn't find them
and<00:04:51.229> I<00:04:51.500> thought<00:04:51.710> he<00:04:51.800> kind<00:04:51.979> of<00:04:52.099> ran<00:04:52.340> up<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:53.030> out

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
and I thought he kind of ran up and out

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.939 
and I thought he kind of ran up and out
of<00:04:53.479> here<00:04:53.660> so<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.500> make<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.710> quick<00:04:54.979> loop<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.870> I

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
of here so I make a quick loop and I

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.899 
of here so I make a quick loop and I
think<00:04:57.949> I<00:04:58.009> find<00:04:58.220> him<00:04:58.310> right<00:04:58.400> back<00:04:58.550> down<00:04:58.729> there

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
think I find him right back down there

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.610 
think I find him right back down there
at<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.030> surgery<00:04:59.360> table<00:04:59.569> so<00:05:00.259> I<00:05:00.289> don't<00:05:00.560> know

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
at the surgery table so I don't know

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.020 
at the surgery table so I don't know
where<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.860> hell<00:05:00.979> he<00:05:01.159> went<00:05:01.190> well<00:05:01.759> I<00:05:01.789> was

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
where the hell he went well I was

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.990 
where the hell he went well I was
looking<00:05:02.150> for<00:05:02.479> them<00:05:02.569> but<00:05:03.289> I<00:05:03.800> find<00:05:04.280> them<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.610> I

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
looking for them but I find them and I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.719 
looking for them but I find them and I
kick<00:05:05.210> his<00:05:05.300> ass<00:05:05.509> so<00:05:06.199> just<00:05:06.770> watch<00:05:06.979> these<00:05:07.460> things

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
kick his ass so just watch these things

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.309 
kick his ass so just watch these things
do<00:05:07.909> watch<00:05:08.150> them<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.449> damage<00:05:08.810> this<00:05:08.900> thing<00:05:09.110> does

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
do watch them on damage this thing does

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.559 
do watch them on damage this thing does
just<00:05:09.770> want<00:05:10.069> this<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.430> on<00:05:10.490> hard<00:05:10.789> it<00:05:11.479> almost

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
just want this is on hard it almost

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.010 
just want this is on hard it almost
takes<00:05:11.870> off<00:05:12.190> half<00:05:13.190> his<00:05:13.220> health<00:05:13.610> are<00:05:14.330> three

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
takes off half his health are three

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.990 
takes off half his health are three
quarters<00:05:15.319> of<00:05:15.380> itself<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:15.949> all<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.639> takes<00:05:16.849> is

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
quarters of itself and all it takes is

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.920 
quarters of itself and all it takes is
literally<00:05:17.270> one<00:05:17.569> more<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:18.130> don't<00:05:19.130> he's<00:05:19.490> done

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
literally one more and don't he's done

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.659 
literally one more and don't he's done
it's<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:21.080> very<00:05:21.319> very<00:05:21.530> fast<00:05:21.740> way<00:05:22.039> to<00:05:22.069> kill<00:05:22.520> them

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
it's a very very fast way to kill them

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.749 
it's a very very fast way to kill them
and<00:05:23.150> you<00:05:23.300> don't<00:05:23.479> use<00:05:23.599> any<00:05:23.840> ammo<00:05:24.319> so<00:05:24.919> i<00:05:25.250> highly

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
and you don't use any ammo so i highly

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.610 
and you don't use any ammo so i highly
recommend<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.300> strategy<00:05:26.690> again<00:05:27.050> if<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.440> have

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
recommend the strategy again if you have

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.290 
recommend the strategy again if you have
one<00:05:27.860> that<00:05:28.039> works<00:05:28.070> better<00:05:28.400> for<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.759> or<00:05:29.000> if<00:05:29.150> this

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
one that works better for you or if this

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.709 
one that works better for you or if this
doesn't<00:05:29.630> work<00:05:29.719> as<00:05:29.870> well<00:05:29.900> for<00:05:30.080> you<00:05:31.539> feel<00:05:32.539> free

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
doesn't work as well for you feel free

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.680 
doesn't work as well for you feel free
to<00:05:32.810> do<00:05:32.930> that<00:05:33.070> but<00:05:34.070> uh<00:05:34.099> everything's<00:05:34.909> corpse

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
to do that but uh everything's corpse

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.370 
to do that but uh everything's corpse
once<00:05:36.650> you<00:05:36.740> pick<00:05:36.860> up<00:05:36.979> the<00:05:37.070> key<00:05:38.080> you<00:05:39.080> get<00:05:39.199> a<00:05:39.229> whole

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
once you pick up the key you get a whole

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.230 
once you pick up the key you get a whole
bunch<00:05:39.409> of<00:05:39.620> ammo<00:05:39.830> from<00:05:40.099> them<00:05:40.310> adding<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:41.090> your

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
bunch of ammo from them adding to your

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.080 
bunch of ammo from them adding to your
stash<00:05:42.080> already<00:05:42.469> and<00:05:42.740> i<00:05:43.430> think<00:05:43.669> you<00:05:43.789> go<00:05:43.880> down

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
stash already and i think you go down

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.290 
stash already and i think you go down
and<00:05:44.120> i<00:05:44.539> hack<00:05:44.780> a<00:05:44.810> safe<00:05:45.259> which<00:05:45.590> has<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.800> few<00:05:46.300> more

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
and i hack a safe which has a few more

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.050 
and i hack a safe which has a few more
on<00:05:47.479> I<00:05:47.719> think<00:05:47.990> mo<00:05:48.289> hands<00:05:48.500> outs<00:05:48.740> so<00:05:49.280> that's

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
on I think mo hands outs so that's

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.850 
on I think mo hands outs so that's

take on a big daddy um I have a strategy
that<00:05:55.969> works<00:05:56.090> pretty<00:05:56.300> well<00:05:56.449> but<00:05:56.919> i<00:05:58.599> like<00:05:59.599> to

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690
