blog and today I'm going to show you how
I<00:00:04.259> decorated<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:05.250> stencil<00:00:05.549> cake

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
I decorated this stencil cake

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.870 
I decorated this stencil cake
okay<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.319> you've<00:00:07.740> gone<00:00:07.919> ahead<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.400> we<00:00:08.490> put<00:00:08.700> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
okay so you've gone ahead and we put the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.299 
okay so you've gone ahead and we put the
fondant<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.360> cake<00:00:09.500> because<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:10.830> fondant

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
fondant on the cake because it's fondant

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.339 
fondant on the cake because it's fondant
it's<00:00:11.519> too<00:00:11.759> firm<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.389> actually<00:00:12.750> push<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
it's too firm to actually push the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.039 
it's too firm to actually push the
stencil<00:00:13.889> into<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.370> cake<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.880> then<00:00:15.089> pipe<00:00:15.809> it

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
stencil into the cake and then pipe it

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.290 
stencil into the cake and then pipe it
and<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.859> what<00:00:17.070> we're<00:00:17.220> gonna<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.789> probably<00:00:18.240> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and so what we're gonna do is probably a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.820 
and so what we're gonna do is probably a
little<00:00:18.420> bit<00:00:18.630> easier<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.109> then<00:00:19.170> actually

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
little bit easier and then actually

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.140 
little bit easier and then actually
borrow<00:00:20.070> Richards<00:00:20.490> hands<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.970> we're<00:00:21.060> gonna

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
borrow Richards hands and we're gonna

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.390 
borrow Richards hands and we're gonna
smooth<00:00:21.510> out<00:00:21.660> each<00:00:22.050> side<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> senso<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
smooth out each side of the senso and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.849 
smooth out each side of the senso and
wipe<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> frosting<00:00:24.660> over<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.289> then<00:00:25.560> lift

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
wipe the frosting over it and then lift

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.839 
wipe the frosting over it and then lift
it<00:00:26.010> off<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.460> show<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.119> finished<00:00:27.449> cake<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.849> here

filling<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.770> sides<00:00:59.040> with<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.460> stenciled

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
filling the sides with the stenciled

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:50.930 
filling the sides with the stenciled
parts<00:01:00.360> with<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> frosting

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:00.420 

lifted<00:01:51.940> our

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
okay so now that we've got the middle

okay so now that we've got the middle
part<00:02:02.680> we're<00:02:02.860> going<00:02:02.980> to<00:02:03.040> actually<00:02:03.190> take<00:02:03.580> the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
part we're going to actually take the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.670 
part we're going to actually take the
stencil<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.390> ladle<00:02:04.780> on<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.110> side<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.560> we're

just<00:02:05.710> going<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:05.980> continue<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.550> design<00:02:06.940> around

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
just going to continue the design around

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.240 
just going to continue the design around
the<00:02:07.480> top<00:02:07.660> of<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.930> cake<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.100> looks

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the top of the cake so that it looks

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:18.210 
the top of the cake so that it looks
nice<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.790> pretty<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:17.530> we're<00:02:17.710> just<00:02:17.830> doing<00:02:18.010> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
nice and pretty now we're just doing the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:03:32.220 
nice and pretty now we're just doing the
same<00:02:18.460> thing

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.390 

okay<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:33.290> we<00:03:33.560> went<00:03:33.680> ahead<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:33.950> we<00:03:34.130> did<00:03:34.310> the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
okay so we went ahead and we did the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.010 
okay so we went ahead and we did the
stencil<00:03:34.820> around<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> side<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.540> cake<00:03:35.780> and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
stencil around the side of the cake and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.780 
stencil around the side of the cake and
then<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:36.200> long<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.770> actual<00:03:36.950> side<00:03:37.550> we<00:03:37.760> just

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.230 
we're gonna do now is we're gonna finish
it<00:03:41.840> up<00:03:41.960> by<00:03:42.170> making<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.710> star<00:03:43.160> border<00:03:43.670> around<00:03:43.880> the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
it up by making a star border around the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.540 
it up by making a star border around the
top<00:03:44.450> then<00:03:44.840> you're<00:03:45.020> just<00:03:45.170> gonna<00:03:45.320> squeeze<00:03:46.250> out

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
top then you're just gonna squeeze out

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:57.400 
top then you're just gonna squeeze out
your<00:03:46.580> stars

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.170 

okay<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.220> this<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.460> your<00:03:59.700> stunsail

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
okay so this is it this is your stunsail

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.440 
okay so this is it this is your stunsail
cake<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.870> as<00:04:01.800> you<00:04:02.340> can<00:04:02.490> see<00:04:02.550> we<00:04:02.820> did<00:04:02.970> do<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> star

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
cake and as you can see we did do a star

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.880 
cake and as you can see we did do a star
border<00:04:03.780> around<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.050> top<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.590> make<00:04:04.650> it

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
border around the top just to make it

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.710 
border around the top just to make it
look<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.280> little<00:04:05.400> more<00:04:05.610> even<00:04:06.000> than<00:04:06.330> when<00:04:06.450> you

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
look a little more even than when you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.900 
look a little more even than when you
just<00:04:06.750> do<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.230> like<00:04:07.410> an<00:04:07.500> uneven<00:04:07.920> frosted<00:04:08.460> edge<00:04:08.580> I

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
just do it like an uneven frosted edge I

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.150 
just do it like an uneven frosted edge I
did<00:04:09.840> cheat<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.500> use<00:04:10.710> store-bought

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
did cheat and I use store-bought

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.230 
did cheat and I use store-bought
frosting<00:04:11.580> so<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.270> stars<00:04:12.510> don't<00:04:12.840> look<00:04:12.990> as

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
frosting so the stars don't look as

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.550 
frosting so the stars don't look as
usually<00:04:15.240> when<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.420> use<00:04:15.450> firmer<00:04:15.930> frosting<00:04:16.440> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
usually when you use firmer frosting the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.050 
usually when you use firmer frosting the
stars<00:04:16.799> look<00:04:17.010> more<00:04:17.160> pronounced<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.670> right<00:04:17.940> now

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
stars look more pronounced so right now

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.699 
stars look more pronounced so right now
it<00:04:18.209> kind<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.450> just<00:04:18.630> looks<00:04:18.810> more<00:04:19.019> like<00:04:19.170> fringe

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
it kind of just looks more like fringe

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.069 
it kind of just looks more like fringe
but<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.250> actually<00:04:20.400> really<00:04:20.670> like<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.930> way<00:04:22.049> that

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
but I actually really like the way that

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.540 
but I actually really like the way that
it<00:04:22.350> turned<00:04:22.500> out<00:04:22.770> because<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.100> looks<00:04:23.130> kind<00:04:23.520> of

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
it turned out because it looks kind of

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.420 
it turned out because it looks kind of
like<00:04:23.670> a<00:04:23.730> fancy<00:04:24.000> pillow<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.530> really<00:04:26.100> do<00:04:26.280> enjoy

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
like a fancy pillow so I really do enjoy

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.400 
like a fancy pillow so I really do enjoy
it<00:04:26.670> I<00:04:26.790> think<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.210> was<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.420> great<00:04:27.720> way<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.930> frost

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
it I think this was a great way to frost

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.140 
it I think this was a great way to frost
the<00:04:28.590> cake<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.980> make<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.100> look<00:04:29.280> fancy<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.940> it's

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
the cake and make it look fancy and it's

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150 
the cake and make it look fancy and it's
quick<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.169> don't<00:04:31.380> have<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.680> do<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.830> lot<00:04:32.040> of

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
quick and you don't have to do a lot of

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.620 
quick and you don't have to do a lot of
intricate<00:04:32.610> piping<00:04:32.790> because<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.419> use<00:04:33.600> the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
intricate piping because you use the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.230 
intricate piping because you use the
stencil<00:04:34.200> so<00:04:34.650> it'll<00:04:34.800> save<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.160> time<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.760> it

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
stencil so it'll save you time and it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.090 
stencil so it'll save you time and it
looks<00:04:36.480> like<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.870> took<00:04:36.900> way<00:04:37.380> more<00:04:37.590> time<00:04:37.830> than<00:04:38.010> it

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
looks like it took way more time than it

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.850 
looks like it took way more time than it
actually<00:04:38.250> did<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:40.290> think<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.590> turned<00:04:40.770> out
