of wipers uh we're acting funny I have
been<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.080> thought<00:00:13.290> maybe<00:00:13.650> he'll<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.280> know

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.910 
been and I thought maybe he'll you know
the<00:00:14.549> wiper<00:00:15.210> motors<00:00:15.660> probably<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.199> bad<00:00:16.410> I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
the wiper motors probably going bad I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.740 
the wiper motors probably going bad I
went<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.789> there<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.029> unplug<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.390> connector

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
went in there and unplug the connector

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.370 
went in there and unplug the connector
and<00:00:19.109> see<00:00:19.260> if<00:00:19.350> there's<00:00:19.560> any<00:00:19.740> corrosion<00:00:20.300> um

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
and see if there's any corrosion um

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.750 
and see if there's any corrosion um
there<00:00:22.380> isn't<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:22.920> probably<00:00:23.460> never<00:00:23.580> been

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
there isn't it's probably never been

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.279 
there isn't it's probably never been
unplugged<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.480> was<00:00:24.630> very<00:00:24.810> difficult<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
unplugged and it was very difficult to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.160 
unplugged and it was very difficult to
get<00:00:25.410> off<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.240> but<00:00:27.240> there<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:27.599> no<00:00:27.720> corrosion<00:00:28.109> in

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
get off so but there was no corrosion in

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.220 
get off so but there was no corrosion in
it<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.449> that's<00:00:30.449> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> weird<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:30.990> don't

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it so that's kind of weird now you don't

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.690 
it so that's kind of weird now you don't
need<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> start<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> truck<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.520> but

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
need to start the truck to do this but

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.250 
need to start the truck to do this but
I'm<00:00:32.759> gonna<00:00:32.880> go<00:00:32.969> ahead<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.120> start<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:36.020> okay

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
I'm gonna go ahead and start it okay

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.990 
I'm gonna go ahead and start it okay
here's<00:00:38.040> my<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.399> issue<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:39.059> turn<00:00:39.870> on

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.260 

that<00:00:43.480> should<00:00:43.750> be<00:00:43.900> going<00:00:44.260> you<00:00:44.440> know<00:00:44.560> like<00:00:44.770> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that should be going you know like this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.430 
that should be going you know like this
slowly<00:00:46.270> but<00:00:46.600> if<00:00:46.720> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.990 

push<00:00:49.980> down<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.180 

is<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:55.790> actually<00:00:56.790> this<00:00:56.880> is<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:58.190> slow-mo

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
is that actually this is the slow-mo

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.689 
is that actually this is the slow-mo
slow-mo

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.950 

there<00:01:04.850> see<00:01:05.299> they're<00:01:05.420> working<00:01:05.509> totally<00:01:06.049> fine

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.320 

that<00:01:09.710> should<00:01:09.890> be<00:01:09.980> going<00:01:10.220> kind<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.610> slow<00:01:10.670> but

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that should be going kind of slow but

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.230 
that should be going kind of slow but
got<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> concert

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.760 

the<00:01:18.480> squirter<00:01:18.810> works<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.320> better<00:01:19.350> now

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.490 

like<00:01:25.430> way<00:01:25.670> better

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:40.179 

but<00:01:30.070> let<00:01:30.190> go<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.670> cuts<00:01:31.270> out

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:50.270 

Oh<00:01:40.219> baby<00:01:41.090> there<00:01:41.479> hold<00:01:41.749> it<00:01:41.869> down

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.499 

so

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.350 

what<00:01:56.509> our<00:01:56.750> problem<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.939> poor<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.060> Martin

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
what our problem is poor is Martin

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.399 
what our problem is poor is Martin
Lawrence<00:01:59.630> would<00:01:59.780> say<00:01:59.990> what<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.710> problem<00:02:01.130> is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
Lawrence would say what the problem is

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.300 
Lawrence would say what the problem is
that<00:02:03.409> switch<00:02:03.829> is<00:02:04.070> bad<00:02:05.860> which<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.039> funny

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
that switch is bad which is funny

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.309 
that switch is bad which is funny
because<00:02:07.399> that<00:02:07.759> was<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.939> brand<00:02:08.599> new<00:02:08.810> one<00:02:09.020> when<00:02:09.289> I

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
because that was a brand new one when I

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.220 
because that was a brand new one when I
bought<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.800> truck<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.160> came<00:02:10.310> with<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.759> because

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
bought the truck it came with it because

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.780 
bought the truck it came with it because
the<00:02:12.230> lady<00:02:12.470> who<00:02:12.650> owned<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.099> was<00:02:13.250> having<00:02:13.610> issues

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
the lady who owned it was having issues

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.430 
the lady who owned it was having issues
with<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.239> wipers<00:02:14.660> they<00:02:14.870> were<00:02:14.930> they<00:02:15.290> would

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
with the wipers they were they would

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.120 
with the wipers they were they would
come<00:02:15.680> on<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:15.980> then<00:02:16.130> go<00:02:16.340> away<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:17.830> then<00:02:18.830> come

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
come on and then go away and then come

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.890 
come on and then go away and then come
on<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.550> go<00:02:19.610> away<00:02:19.700> or<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.150> not<00:02:20.420> come<00:02:20.599> on<00:02:20.750> at

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
on and go away or just not come on at

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.410 
on and go away or just not come on at
all<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.170> you'd<00:02:21.260> have<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.470> turn<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.739> off<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.160> I

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
all and you'd have to turn it off and I

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.140 
all and you'd have to turn it off and I
believe<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.690> spilled<00:02:24.200> on<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.680> camera<00:02:25.150> so

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
believe I just spilled on the camera so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.750 
believe I just spilled on the camera so
I<00:02:26.680> was<00:02:27.680> like<00:02:27.799> okay<00:02:28.040> I'll<00:02:28.160> put<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> new<00:02:28.549> switch

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
I was like okay I'll put the new switch

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.949 
I was like okay I'll put the new switch
in<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.090> put<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.330> in<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.510> working<00:02:29.780> it's<00:02:29.870> been

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
in I put it in it working it's been

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.650 
in I put it in it working it's been
working<00:02:30.140> great<00:02:30.260> up<00:02:30.860> until<00:02:31.900> now<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.970> think

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
working great up until now so I think

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.690 
working great up until now so I think
I'm<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.080> buy<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> new<00:02:36.560> wiper<00:02:36.950> switch<00:02:37.220> for

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
I'm going to buy a new wiper switch for

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
I'm going to buy a new wiper switch for
it<00:02:37.819> and<00:02:37.940> we'll<00:02:38.060> go<00:02:38.120> ahead<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.269> put<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> new<00:02:38.690> one

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
it and we'll go ahead and put a new one

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.270 
it and we'll go ahead and put a new one
in<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.080> was<00:02:39.170> kind<00:02:39.349> of<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.470> pain<00:02:39.680> in<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.860> ass<00:02:40.040> to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
in it was kind of a pain in the ass to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.130 
in it was kind of a pain in the ass to
do<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.900> I'll<00:02:41.989> do<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.260> again<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.630> I'm<00:02:44.780> hoping

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
do it but I'll do it again so I'm hoping

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.839 
do it but I'll do it again so I'm hoping
this<00:02:45.380> one<00:02:45.500> doesn't<00:02:45.680> go<00:02:45.860> out<00:02:46.010> I'll<00:02:46.580> probably

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
this one doesn't go out I'll probably

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.550 
this one doesn't go out I'll probably
just<00:02:47.090> go<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.299> Napa<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.810> buy<00:02:48.019> one<00:02:48.230> because<00:02:48.440> this

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
just go to Napa and buy one because this

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.000 
just go to Napa and buy one because this
one<00:02:48.769> here's<00:02:48.980> an<00:02:49.130> autozone<00:02:49.610> one<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.860> every<00:02:51.860> now

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
one here's an autozone one and every now

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.070 
one here's an autozone one and every now
and<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:52.400> there's<00:02:52.819> that<00:02:52.970> one<00:02:53.030> autozone<00:02:53.810> part

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
and then there's that one autozone part

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.559 
and then there's that one autozone part
that<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:54.709> just<00:02:54.980> craps<00:02:55.280> out<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.420> a

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
that that just craps out it just is a

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.560 
that that just craps out it just is a
piece<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.959> crap<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.850> probably<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.390> first

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
piece of crap this is probably the first

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.360 
piece of crap this is probably the first
one<00:02:59.810> in<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.989> while<00:03:00.260> I've<00:03:00.530> had<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.130> can't

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
one in a while I've had and I can't

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.710 
one in a while I've had and I can't
recall<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:01.760> last<00:03:01.910> time<00:03:02.150> we've<00:03:02.269> had<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.450> problem

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
recall the last time we've had a problem

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.520 
recall the last time we've had a problem
with<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.930> Durr<00:03:03.109> last<00:03:03.350> part<00:03:04.480> um<00:03:05.480> was<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.200> I

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
with the Durr last part um was it I

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.710 
with the Durr last part um was it I
think<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.920> was<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.070> voltage<00:03:07.519> regulator<00:03:07.820> it<00:03:08.239> but

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
think it was a voltage regulator it but

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.870 
think it was a voltage regulator it but
back<00:03:09.049> then<00:03:09.319> that's<00:03:09.500> kind<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.709> my<00:03:09.829> fault<00:03:10.870> um<00:03:12.880> but

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
back then that's kind of my fault um but

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.349 
back then that's kind of my fault um but
