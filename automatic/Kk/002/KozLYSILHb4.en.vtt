00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 diagonally making diamonds 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.880

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.230
 the pieces of rabbit 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.670
 and the pieces of chicken 7 stay 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.830
 to be done happy color little that already begins to make caramel color 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 then that color color 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:36.990
 we remove scea we have dollar added the bean from the podium 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.830

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.350
 little tomatoes will take more strength 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.390
 we remove everything 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.560
 and followed 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.510
 laia and moss a minivan and teddy chin 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.490
 assistance 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.159
 you have to have a bulletin then yes, do not burn 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.859
 therefore we can not stop stirring 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.579
 and you do not have to give it much value either 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.189
 it's fair 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.479
 I would say that she 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.309
 water amount 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.549
 we had said julito 400 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.479
 we add the water 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.189
 and we're going to let all of that 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.889
 cook for 30 minutes 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.630
 to release all juices chicken rabbit 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.630
 The Jewish 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.510
 we've already had the broth boiling thirty minutes soft fire 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.309
 has the substance of the meat 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.309
 and of the vegetables now the do is add 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.599
 let's put it a little salty 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.219
 a salty point 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.559
 Most rate we always try whenever we try 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.499
 marita 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.759
 and we do not care that we got a salty droplet 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.130
 then the rice 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.130
 we are going to avoid that excess of salt 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.959
 perfect with tight 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.749
 and there what remains to us spain lives the rice this case as we had said 450 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.309
 grams of classic sos rice 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:24.099
 as the best permanent way to things in the country and Valencian 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.369
 let's make a cross 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.539
 we make a cross with the rice 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.539
 have him like that 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.199
 we have to ensure that we are well distributed throughout the surface 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.759
 valence in valencia the best way than the street the authentic the traditional 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:43.669
 it's with firewood because of the heat 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.929
 is distributed over the entire surface of what paella is then always going 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.079
 to be made the same everywhere 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.939
 perfect we leave a little more simó 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.939
 seven minutes 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.129
 they have already passed our 7 minutes on high heat for doing is to download it 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.679
 to the minimum 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.649
 from left as a rice fan 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:11.359
 absorbed all the ua and also to do is to lower it to the minimum and leave it 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.119
 five minutes leo be class b saffron 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.930
 that are great with classic sos rice give you a touch and a flavor 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.930
 great we hope you take note 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.810
 the five minutes have already passed at minimum fire now we are going to do it 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.379
 put a sprig of rosemary the corpse a great aroma 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.610
 we left ap there was minimal because we have it almost almost almost dry 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.820
 three more minutes 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.059
 In case you have them with a little bit of water, let's see them 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:46.210
 little by little it attracts me 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.309
 this case at least three minutes 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.309
 we cover with a cloth we let it rest 5 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.229
 our three minutes have already spent our home hoarse because no 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.330
 I had a lot of water 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.919
 and five minutes of rest then fix as we have been the 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.680
 Authentic Valencian paella 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.509
