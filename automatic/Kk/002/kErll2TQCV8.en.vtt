00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
but you're going to want to get the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.090 
but you're going to want to get the
hardware<00:02:40.870> from<00:02:41.870> put<00:02:42.740> all<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.980> hardware<00:02:45.100> in

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
hardware from put all the hardware in

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.470 
hardware from put all the hardware in
between<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.959> boards<00:02:48.700> now<00:02:49.700> see<00:02:49.910> if<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.060> can<00:02:50.270> show

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
between the boards now see if I can show

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.660 
between the boards now see if I can show
you<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:52.870> hard<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.080> see<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.440> but<00:02:55.370> there's<00:02:55.610> a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
you that hard to see it but there's a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:06.180 
you that hard to see it but there's a
metal<00:02:55.940> plate<00:02:56.270> there<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:59.590> metal<00:03:00.590> plate<00:03:00.800> there

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.070 

and<00:03:06.580> then<00:03:06.880> once<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.180> put<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.420> liner<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.930> you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
and then once you put the liner in you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.300 
and then once you put the liner in you
don't<00:03:08.230> really<00:03:08.410> want<00:03:08.740> it<00:03:08.830> you<00:03:08.920> don't<00:03:09.070> want<00:03:09.130> to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
don't really want it you don't want to

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.540 
don't really want it you don't want to
staple<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.300> down<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.660> want<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.400> leave<00:03:12.400> it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
staple it down you want to leave it

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.310 
staple it down you want to leave it
really<00:03:12.910> loose<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.570> edges<00:03:13.900> because<00:03:14.050> the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
really loose on the edges because the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.900 
really loose on the edges because the
water<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> going<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.890> pull<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.280> liner<00:03:15.610> into

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
water is going to pull that liner into

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.670 
water is going to pull that liner into
all<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.240> corners<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.900> in<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.110> bottom<00:03:17.530> and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
all the corners and in the bottom and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.250 
all the corners and in the bottom and
when<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.760> go<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:18.970> fill<00:03:19.270> it<00:03:19.420> fill<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.780> all<00:03:19.990> at

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
when you go to fill it fill it all at

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.590 
when you go to fill it fill it all at
once<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:21.490> let<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.760> run<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.210> run<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.420> run

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
once and let it run and run and run

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.240 
once and let it run and run and run
until<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.110> got<00:03:23.230> at<00:03:23.410> least<00:03:23.440> four<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.220> five

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
until you got at least four to five

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.930 
until you got at least four to five
inches<00:03:24.460> of<00:03:24.940> water<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.420> low<00:03:26.260> side<00:03:26.500> or<00:03:26.980> on

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
inches of water on the low side or on

inches of water on the low side or on
the<00:03:28.060> high<00:03:28.210> side<00:03:28.480> as<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.810> case<00:03:28.990> may<00:03:29.260> be<00:03:29.290> you

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
the high side as the case may be you

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.190 
the high side as the case may be you
know<00:03:31.120> i'll<00:03:31.300> show<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.630> how<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.500> thing<00:03:32.830> looks

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
know i'll show you how this thing looks

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.810 
know i'll show you how this thing looks
when<00:03:35.200> we<00:03:35.320> light<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.620> up<00:03:35.830> i'm<00:03:36.340> going<00:03:36.490> to<00:03:36.580> shut

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
when we light it up i'm going to shut

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.300 
when we light it up i'm going to shut
the<00:03:36.940> spot<00:03:37.240> lights<00:03:37.480> off<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:38.770> i'll<00:03:39.070> show<00:03:39.100> you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
the spot lights off and i'll show you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:50.030 
the spot lights off and i'll show you
how<00:03:39.430> we<00:03:39.550> skate<00:03:39.970> out<00:03:40.150> here

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.039 

and<00:03:50.459> that's<00:03:50.700> all<00:03:50.969> you<00:03:51.180> do<00:03:51.360> we<00:03:51.569> put<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> rope

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
and that's all you do we put the rope

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.399 
and that's all you do we put the rope
lights<00:03:52.379> underneath<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:55.829> liner<00:03:57.170> they<00:03:58.170> seem<00:03:58.379> to

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
lights underneath the liner they seem to

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.110 
lights underneath the liner they seem to
be<00:03:58.560> pretty<00:03:58.799> waterproof<00:03:59.430> but<00:03:59.670> if<00:03:59.760> we<00:03:59.849> put<00:04:00.030> them

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
be pretty waterproof but if we put them

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.759 
be pretty waterproof but if we put them
underneath<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.659> line<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.079> then<00:04:01.170> we<00:04:01.290> taped<00:04:01.560> it

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
underneath the line and then we taped it

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.289 
underneath the line and then we taped it
where<00:04:02.010> all<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.250> connections<00:04:02.579> are<00:04:02.879> we<00:04:03.060> taped

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
where all the connections are we taped

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.869 
where all the connections are we taped
those<00:04:03.510> together<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:04.260> even<00:04:05.069> use<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> little

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
those together I even use a little

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.429 
those together I even use a little
where<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.239> connections<00:04:06.750> were<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.319> make

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
where the connections were to to make

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.690 
where the connections were to to make
sure<00:04:07.680> they<00:04:07.829> stay<00:04:08.870> nice<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:09.930> watertight<00:04:10.700> case

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
sure they stay nice and watertight case

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.500 
sure they stay nice and watertight case
water's<00:04:12.150> coming<00:04:12.510> up<00:04:12.599> from<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.840> ground<00:04:14.510> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
water's coming up from the ground the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.060 
water's coming up from the ground the
ground<00:04:15.689> was<00:04:15.930> pretty<00:04:16.229> well<00:04:16.410> frozen<00:04:17.009> when<00:04:17.160> we

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
ground was pretty well frozen when we

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.640 
ground was pretty well frozen when we
put<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.190> liner<00:04:20.459> in<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:22.049> want<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.320> put<00:04:22.500> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
put the liner in you want to put the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.529 
put the liner in you want to put the
frame<00:04:22.889> up<00:04:23.130> before<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.610> ground<00:04:23.820> freezes<00:04:24.000> it

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
frame up before the ground freezes it

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.469 
frame up before the ground freezes it
certainly<00:04:24.840> makes<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.259> a<00:04:25.349> lot<00:04:25.470> easier<00:04:25.530> for<00:04:25.979> you

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:37.080 

but<00:04:30.479> that's<00:04:30.690> our<00:04:30.870> rink

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:45.770 

I'll<00:04:37.630> show<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:37.990> what<00:04:38.230> I<00:04:38.290> use<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.949> maintain<00:04:39.400> it

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.340 

after<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.870> kids<00:04:47.110> are<00:04:47.260> done<00:04:47.500> skating<00:04:49.199> you<00:04:50.199> got

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
after the kids are done skating you got

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.710 
after the kids are done skating you got
to<00:04:50.470> shovel<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:50.919> off<00:04:51.100> real<00:04:51.400> good<00:04:51.430> sweep<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:52.540> off

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
to shovel it off real good sweep it off

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.500 
to shovel it off real good sweep it off
and<00:04:53.050> then<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:53.800> use<00:04:54.010> this<00:04:54.220> rink<00:04:54.550> break<00:04:54.820> what<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.389> do

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
and then I use this rink break what I do

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.100 
and then I use this rink break what I do
is<00:04:55.979> I<00:04:56.979> took<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.220> about<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.210> 6-foot<00:04:58.960> piece<00:04:59.199> of<00:04:59.440> PVC

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
is I took a about a 6-foot piece of PVC

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.270 
is I took a about a 6-foot piece of PVC
on<00:05:02.110> one<00:05:02.410> end<00:05:02.650> I<00:05:02.770> put<00:05:02.979> a<00:05:03.010> connector<00:05:04.919> with<00:05:05.919> a<00:05:06.040> hose

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
on one end I put a connector with a hose

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.960 
on one end I put a connector with a hose
connection<00:05:07.060> on<00:05:07.210> it<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:08.350> valve<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:09.010> little

connection on it and a valve a little
ball<00:05:10.180> valve<00:05:10.540> so<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:10.990> can<00:05:11.200> control<00:05:11.590> it<00:05:13.650> put<00:05:14.650> it

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
ball valve so I can control it put it

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.440 
ball valve so I can control it put it
all<00:05:14.830> together<00:05:15.070> with<00:05:15.490> glue<00:05:15.900> special<00:05:16.900> PVC<00:05:17.470> glue
