00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 and hey hi anton i want to talk about 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.940
 my car is a district xb 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.330
 first generation year 2004 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.560
 I purchased in last year in August with 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.590
 109,000 miles to date 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.859
 drove but not very much 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 somewhere around five given today 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.710
 toaster 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.820
 as their owners call them lovers 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.329
 drove more than a hundred and eighty 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.190
 actually toaster he nicknamed for the form 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.180
 characteristic of the body and in principle has 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.230
 some circles of people 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.250
 the status of the cult machine precisely for its 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.300
 feature for its shape and then how 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.510
 people love them 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.180
 pull well naturally naturally go 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.780
 the most favorite is the first thing you need 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.010
 make it ordinary air suspension 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.180
 maximum understating is the biggest 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.970
 drives that you can shove there 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.090
 I while I lived in the usual urban mode 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.860
 on standard suspension on standard 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.320
 the height of what is actually in the city is very 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.549
 convenient because 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.100
 despite the fact that he seems to be not 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.780
 I value a very high wedge decent 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.909
 front bumper under the skirt calmly 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.180
 pass 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:34.590
 standard urban barga for the port 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.860
 the car is very comfortable because it has 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 not very long not very long 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.180
 base and not too wide visibility from 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.009
 the machine itself basically decent 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.649
 the only thing on the road mirrors have 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.860
 pretty decent dead zone so 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.950
 In principle, the first departures I people 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.180
 He scared us the end but to this and vyksa 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.870
 used to spin my head again and last 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:12.860
 time everything fits well and quite to itself 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:17.660
 convenient let's show it to my side 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.460
 favorite lettuce beloved 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.830
 summer wheels on which I just 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.890
 bought all did not look marking 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.300
 most likely this is the original tsk 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.520
 fifteen and previous 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.890
 their owner painted awesome 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.700
 acid green and polished 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.680
 shelves basically a grandson after winter i have them 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.480
 quality that did not touch it will be necessary 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.489
 tangle back in combination with 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.610
 Lunch center looks just 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.610
 chic 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.190
 car inside 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:05.600
 despite the fact that it seems as though 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:08.260
 very small inside the car 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.890
 amusingly framed dashboard with 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.100
 instrumentation 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.110
 standing in the center actually this 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.790
 it was not familiar about the first minutes 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:23.140
 10 drive then I really liked 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.700
 really sorry so 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.930
 it is necessary that is, it does not need to display 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.390
 really much more comfortable to ride 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.690
 when not to look away from the road 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:40.959
 somewhere in the direction of the steering do not lose point 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.900
 view road overview when in instruments 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.280
 located patients means like I already 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.470
 spoke despite external dimensions 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.620
 the cabin is amazingly spacious 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.489
 that is, here is my usual landing now 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.489
 comfortable for me 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.640
 and how am I doing this strong 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.270
 to achieve 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.920
 straight test drive everything turns out if 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.820
 move the seat forward in principle 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:21.530
 you can safely go back to back 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:28.100
 sand and the only drawback due 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:30.560
 this is a small trunk principle on 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.419
 days went fishing in Nizhny Novgorod 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.160
 and all we had to do was take a 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.540
 since drove with the girl 's things 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.240
 there was a lot almost all in the trunk 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.230
 fit and now there are others 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.580
 things but just for the presentation box 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:56.600
 with large awning chairs 2 folding chairs 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.090
 trunk fishing rod large suitcase 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.889
 another bag the size of this suitcase and 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.100
 something else is laid on top 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:07.060
 it all fit in the back and 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:12.850
 this is practically the only thing 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:17.240
 uncomfortable feature of the toaster itself 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:20.930
 as with yeon is a Toyota 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.530
 the American market is not for nothing that is considered 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.710
 toyota 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.130
 differ quite impressive 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:32.419
 reliability and big very survivability 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.970
 to mafia toaster Russian toaster club 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.330
 waters there are people who drove them 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:41.930
 400 500 thousand without any 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.030
 serious damage to attachments and even 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.840
 principle in normal mode on its own 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:52.039
 everyday use I actually 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.400
 on toasters fuse a long time ago 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.080
 8 10 back when I am only the first first 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.849
 saw either on tv whether in 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.000
 Moscow I got caught 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.500
 for a very long time I dreamed a toaster and 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.280
 finally last year I realized 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:15.039
 my dream and I count on it 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.180
 will travel for a long time therefore taking advantage 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.370
 I want a case to you 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.509
 Anton ask to pump 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.960
 my car so that it pleases me further 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.360
 and my passengers my favorite girl 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.669
 who is the permanent navigator about 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.159
 all of our trips and will soon begin 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:37.449
 learn to drive and in principle will 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:40.409
 second drivers of this car would like to 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:45.870
 give the car more personality 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:50.020
 adjust it for yourself and leave for a long time 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:54.509
 ride toasters and you are very 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.509
 Hello everyone
