00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
pictures that I think the audience is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.789 
pictures that I think the audience is
going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.360> will<00:01:57.840> show<00:01:58.049> yellow<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
going to see that will show yellow and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.889 
going to see that will show yellow and
brown<00:01:58.979> stains<00:01:59.490> tend<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.090> whiten<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.570> brighten

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
brown stains tend to whiten and brighten

brown stains tend to whiten and brighten
very<00:02:01.320> well<00:02:01.850> greystanes<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.299> bit

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
very well greystanes are a little bit

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.179 
very well greystanes are a little bit
harder<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> cover<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.860> they've<00:02:05.040> got

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
harder to cover up because they've got

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.399 
harder to cover up because they've got
some<00:02:05.430> dark<00:02:05.670> pigments<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.299> them<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.960> may<00:02:07.140> take<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
some dark pigments in them it may take a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.979 
some dark pigments in them it may take a
power<00:02:07.770> bleaching<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.840> get

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
power bleaching to do that as we get

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.020 
power bleaching to do that as we get
older<00:02:10.229> our<00:02:10.410> teeth<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:11.069> thinner<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.640> enamel

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
older our teeth get thinner the enamel

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.900 
older our teeth get thinner the enamel
does<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
does and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.730 
does and
very<00:02:13.120> hard<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.690> whiten<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> tooth<00:02:14.320> with<00:02:14.530> thin

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
very hard to whiten a tooth with thin

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.100 
very hard to whiten a tooth with thin
enamel<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.400> what<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.720> difference

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
enamel and what is the the difference

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.600 
enamel and what is the the difference
between<00:02:17.290> teeth<00:02:17.740> discoloration<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
between teeth discoloration and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.000 
between teeth discoloration and
teeth-staining<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.110> staying<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.650> something

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
teeth-staining so staying is something

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.300 
teeth-staining so staying is something
that's<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.430> outside<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.750> we're

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that's on the outside like if we're

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.520 
that's on the outside like if we're
smokers<00:02:24.310> or<00:02:24.580> coffee<00:02:24.970> or<00:02:25.180> tea<00:02:25.540> right<00:02:26.050> dark

that stain the tooth and can be scraped
off<00:02:30.610> whereas<00:02:31.330> discoloration<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.470> inside

off whereas discoloration is the inside

off whereas discoloration is the inside

the<00:04:38.230> dentist<00:04:38.380> in<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:38.830> have<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.100> very<00:04:39.700> high

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
the dentist in you have a very high

the dentist in you have a very high
concentration<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:40.990> bleach<00:04:41.230> on<00:04:41.440> your<00:04:41.560> teeth

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
concentration of bleach on your teeth

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.310 
concentration of bleach on your teeth
sensitivity<00:04:42.790> is<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.210> number<00:04:43.630> one<00:04:43.840> side

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
sensitivity is the number one side

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.190 
sensitivity is the number one side
effect<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.280> second<00:04:45.670> one<00:04:45.820> is<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.360> way<00:04:46.990> with

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
effect the second one is the way with

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.960 
effect the second one is the way with
time<00:04:47.530> though<00:04:47.830> it<00:04:48.040> certainly<00:04:48.310> does<00:04:48.670> is<00:04:48.850> your

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
time though it certainly does is your

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.640 
time though it certainly does is your
teeth<00:04:49.210> remineralize<00:04:49.960> they<00:04:50.170> get<00:04:50.320> better<00:04:50.530> in

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
teeth remineralize they get better in

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.650 
teeth remineralize they get better in
the<00:04:50.740> sensitivity<00:04:51.310> goes<00:04:51.490> away<00:04:51.640> and<00:04:51.970> then<00:04:52.540> the

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
the sensitivity goes away and then the

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.120 
the sensitivity goes away and then the
second<00:04:53.020> side<00:04:53.200> effect<00:04:53.620> is<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.980> can<00:04:54.100> actually

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
second side effect is you can actually

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.940 
second side effect is you can actually
burn<00:04:54.640> your<00:04:54.940> gums<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:55.960> people<00:04:56.320> like<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.680> think

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
you know if a little bit does a little

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.360 
you know if a little bit does a little
good<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.840> lot<00:04:59.230> must<00:04:59.530> do<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.680> lot<00:04:59.950> of<00:04:59.980> good<00:05:00.100> and

guns<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.610> important<00:05:10.090> thing<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.360> we<00:05:10.810> really

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
guns the important thing is we really

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.230 
guns the important thing is we really
have<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.500> follow<00:05:11.890> manufacturer's<00:05:12.700> direction

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
have to follow manufacturer's direction

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.610 
have to follow manufacturer's direction
what<00:05:13.330> about<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.600> enamel<00:05:13.990> of<00:05:14.080> your<00:05:14.110> teeth<00:05:14.230> does

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
what about the enamel of your teeth does

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.870 
what about the enamel of your teeth does
it<00:05:14.740> do<00:05:14.830> anything<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.430> as<00:05:15.580> well<00:05:15.610> I've

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
it do anything to that as well I've

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.150 
it do anything to that as well I've
heard<00:05:16.030> people<00:05:16.210> have<00:05:16.720> cavities<00:05:17.020> more<00:05:17.500> over

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
heard people have cavities more over

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.580 
heard people have cavities more over
time<00:05:18.190> is<00:05:18.610> that<00:05:18.640> true<00:05:19.000> or<00:05:19.030> not<00:05:19.480> it<00:05:19.960> shouldn't<00:05:20.380> be

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
time is that true or not it shouldn't be

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.290 
time is that true or not it shouldn't be
so<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.010> enamel<00:05:21.430> of<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.580> tooth<00:05:21.820> is<00:05:22.000> what<00:05:22.180> is

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
so the enamel of a tooth is what is

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.450 
so the enamel of a tooth is what is
actually<00:05:22.540> being<00:05:22.720> bleached<00:05:23.350> it's<00:05:23.980> almost<00:05:24.130> like

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
actually being bleached it's almost like

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.450 
actually being bleached it's almost like
frosting<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.210> piece<00:05:25.390> of<00:05:25.420> glass<00:05:25.720> but<00:05:26.710> nature

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
frosting a piece of glass but nature

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.860 
frosting a piece of glass but nature
will<00:05:27.610> take<00:05:27.640> care<00:05:27.820> of<00:05:28.090> it<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.390> it<00:05:28.750> will

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
will take care of it and it will

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.300 
will take care of it and it will
remineralize<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.920> that's<00:05:30.040> why<00:05:30.250> the

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
remineralize and that's why the

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.670 
remineralize and that's why the
whiteness<00:05:30.820> tends<00:05:31.090> to<00:05:31.270> go<00:05:31.390> away<00:05:31.660> after<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.410> few

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
whiteness tends to go away after a few

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.040 
whiteness tends to go away after a few
months<00:05:32.860> or<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.370> year<00:05:33.760> it's<00:05:34.330> because<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:34.840> tooth

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
months or a year it's because the tooth

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.810 
months or a year it's because the tooth
is<00:05:35.230> getting<00:05:35.560> clear<00:05:35.860> again<00:05:36.280> and<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:36.550> have<00:05:36.700> to

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
is getting clear again and you have to

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.340 
is getting clear again and you have to
branch<00:05:37.090> it<00:05:37.330> all<00:05:37.780> of<00:05:37.990> these<00:05:38.140> things

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
branch it all of these things

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.350
