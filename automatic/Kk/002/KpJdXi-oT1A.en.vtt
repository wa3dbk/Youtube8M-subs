00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.670
 and hi to all and this is 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.110
 great one 14 we find ourselves not 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.390
 finally if for a gameplay anyway 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.939
 but it's not important here it's 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.830
 just to make a little video just 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.990
 to prevent that I intend to do a 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.529
 royal rumble with each participant is 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.390
 chosen by a subscriber precisely is the one 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.070
 who wins to offer me a match that 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.480
 will be a priority so that's why I 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.980
 make a quick video without them 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 entries without anything it's just because 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.350
 I do not think everyone has seen that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.430
 because I say it to each at each 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.890
 times in my videos I put a little 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.190
 following message after putting a 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.490
 video where and it's on my channel but I 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.930
 do not think everyone has seen 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.950
 it's a ca will be royal rumble at 30 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.260
 people I would do several 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.910
 obviously you can well imagine and 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.560
 was waiting because I play at the same 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.030
 time I missed too bad and what is it 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.479
 that I meant so to participate 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.399
 just do not say I say 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.799
 participate and give me our superstar 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.050
 that you choose below this 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.909
 video I remember that there are already fifteen 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.220
 or sixteen participants and I know more 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.979
 I will show in the description of 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.360
 the video the wrestlers who are already 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.040
 obviously took a little bit of three 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.330
 times the same wrestler so mostly born and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.860
 they say those who have already registered 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.620
 do not obviously need to rewrite 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.600
 do not worry it's noted and ben 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.940
 these are the ones who want to register just 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.850
 had given me your superstar in 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.320
 comment on this video only 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.770
 I prefer glass as Sami to have 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.450
 messages mix and so that's it will be 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.670
 just a royal rumble with that I 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.890
 think it can be nice to see a 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.510
 superstar chosen by yourself and that if 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.710
 she wins you get you a match 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.830
 that you ask because obviously 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.140
 for those who do not know it I have 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.689
 currently fifty or even one 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.759
 sixty games to do knowing 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.530
 that jean posts between 3 and 4 by 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.390
 week what can I not do more 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.250
 also videos of these videos from them 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.660
 xiii i can only do them the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.060
 weekend you think well I'm 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.490
 not a weekend to make that videos 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.870
 I do not do that with my life 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.069
 so that's going to be a priority game 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.780
 so I think it's interesting for 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.209
 whoever asks who wants absolutely 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.180
 see if his match 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:43.090
 this interesting concern of 2 here is to play 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.680
 to propose this a character to see us 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.830
 if they do not win obviously 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.380
 in this kingdom I will control people 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.760
 control nothing at random it may be that 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.560
 I obviously lose I'm going to make a 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.330
 rumble video with age where I had 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.040
 won on arriving first but here I 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.600
 can lose anyway it will be 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.980
 chosen at random I would choose as 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.120
 that you finally here I hope you 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.620
 will have a lot of participants I will you 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.880
 say we are already fifteen or sixteen I 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.390
 would put in descriptive up list of 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.190
 head 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.420
 and here we go, I think that's all 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.739
 that I wanted to say is that I want 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.070
 I made video on purpose so that all 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.070
 world be aware 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.950
 know that I intend to do that 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.950
 dodge 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.610
 so that's just for 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.220
