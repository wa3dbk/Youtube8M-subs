game now the first thing I'm going to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.440 
game now the first thing I'm going to
say<00:00:34.890> before<00:00:35.010> anything<00:00:35.489> else<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> V

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
say before anything else is that the V

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
say before anything else is that the V
that<00:00:36.690> cannot<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.079> shot<00:00:37.350> down<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.219> only

counter<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> VSAT<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> counter<00:00:40.200> UAV

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
counter to the VSAT is the counter UAV

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
counter to the VSAT is the counter UAV

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
like that but the main way with that I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
like that but the main way with that I
was<00:00:58.469> doing<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.160> by<00:00:59.370> letting<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.820> visa

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
stuck I was continuously using every

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
stuck I was continuously using every
visa<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.180> had<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:04.019> me<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.379> kills<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
visa that I had to get me more kills and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950 
visa that I had to get me more kills and
you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> only<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> visa

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you can only do that with the visa

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
you can only do that with the visa
because<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:07.920> points<00:01:08.189> towards<00:01:08.610> your

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.399 
I'm gonna wait there I'm gonna make sure
they<00:01:30.180> don't<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.290> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
they don't get it and if they do get it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.440 
they don't get it and if they do get it
I<00:01:31.500> mean<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.770> least<00:01:31.799> getting<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.369> kill<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.299> once

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I mean at least getting a kill but once

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.789 
I mean at least getting a kill but once
I<00:01:33.540> figure<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.170> UAV<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.560> pack

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I figure out it's just a UAV I pack

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.350 
I figure out it's just a UAV I pack
totally<00:01:35.130> off<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.090> some<00:01:36.240> more

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
totally off it and go and get some more

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
totally off it and go and get some more
vase<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.840> kills<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> reason<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> vase

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
vase up kills now the reason the vase

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710 
vase up kills now the reason the vase
that's<00:01:38.430> mostly<00:01:38.790> overpowered<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.360> well<00:01:39.540> guys

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
that's mostly overpowered is well guys

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.600 
that's mostly overpowered is well guys
is<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> people<00:01:41.100> look<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> as

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
is because a lot of people look at it as

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
is because a lot of people look at it as
if<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.909> kind<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> kill<00:01:42.509> streak<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.899> air

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
if it's kind of a kill streak that air

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
if it's kind of a kill streak that air
you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> only<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:44.009> bridged<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.579> then

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
you know it can only be bridged and then

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.429 
you know it can only be bridged and then
what<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.880> mean<00:01:45.030> by<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.020> YouTube

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
what I mean by that is that on YouTube

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.020 
what I mean by that is that on YouTube
you<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> lot<00:01:47.130> being<00:01:47.430> used<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.850> kill

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you see a lot being used for kill

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
you see a lot being used for kill
streaks<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> help<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.689> get<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.380> kill

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
streaks to help you get to or that kill

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230 
streaks to help you get to or that kill
streaks<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:50.399> such<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.820> dogs<00:01:51.060> or

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
streaks you know such as your dogs or

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
streaks you know such as your dogs or
your<00:01:51.329> swarm<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> truth<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> vase

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
your swarm but the truth is the vase

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
your swarm but the truth is the vase
that<00:01:53.130> has<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> fantastic<00:01:53.880> ending<00:01:54.090> kill<00:01:54.509> streak

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that has a fantastic ending kill streak

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.030 
that has a fantastic ending kill streak
purely<00:01:55.049> because<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> lets<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> loop<00:01:55.920> around

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
purely because it lets you loop around

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.069 
purely because it lets you loop around
and<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.880> whichever<00:01:57.149> kill<00:01:57.540> streaks<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.899> had

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and get whichever kill streaks you had

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.749 
and get whichever kill streaks you had
behind<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.560> again<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.100> again<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.520> makes<00:01:59.670> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
behind it again and again it makes it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.310 
behind it again and again it makes it
super<00:01:59.969> easy<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:00.990> you've<00:02:01.079> got<00:02:01.229> an

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
super easy you know if you've got an

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.899 
super easy you know if you've got an

precision<00:02:05.070> point<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.700> you'll<00:02:06.180> know

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
precision point because you'll know
