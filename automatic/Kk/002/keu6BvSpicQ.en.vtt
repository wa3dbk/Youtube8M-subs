00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
week that I was just sitting so I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.039 
week that I was just sitting so I
haven't<00:01:20.909> even<00:01:20.970> combed<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> while

the shedding factor which isn't really

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.140
