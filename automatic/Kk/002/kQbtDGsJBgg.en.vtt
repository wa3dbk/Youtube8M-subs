00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.320
 good morning what we want to do to you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.990
 seeing today is one of many 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.839
 workings we do in the store from 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.880
 sport days 1 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.860
 one of the processes we do today 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.930
 we won't talk about this though for 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.540
 knowledge I have to show you is the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.830
 fact that we can possibly 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.780
 lengthen the boots 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.090
 how we do it to lengthen them 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.460
 this answered this plate where it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.920
 boot is put inside in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.129
 so that there is no movement 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.079
 machine that pushes into the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.449
 special devices with a hammer 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.480
 tire that is put inside and 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.579
 pushes the boot and warms up 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.530
 slightly we manage to lengthen it by 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.440
 a few millimeters therefore if anyone has 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.449
 a pain problem on a thumb is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 a light we can put it in place 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.519
 stretching the boot as well as it 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.309
 boot can be slightly enlarged or 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.650
 milling it here as well as a special one 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.380
 device or just enlarging it 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.049
 hull talking about enlargement of the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.460
 then we will have a specific boot 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.439
 but we will do this in a second 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.360
 moment we will show you just how 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.640
 also the processing of this boot 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
 specific we are however able to 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.960
 do it on all brands of boots 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.960
 what are the brands ii and boots that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.340
 we can all work 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.630
 on the other hand we have here as you see 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:41.450
 nordic fisher technical langhe and we have 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:46.649
 also the langhe salomon boot 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.229
 Atomic Rossignol from the beautiful with the beautiful that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.189
 today we work, in fact, there is precisely it 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.990
 a customer's boot that is what that 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.240
 to which we will have to put the appropriate ones 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.770
 heels because they are born to whom 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.950
 here under his heels are these that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.079
 let me show you this I'm loads and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.240
 we're going to put there are two 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.490
 36 mm models are added 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.800
 under it 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.340
 the boot because when the boot 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 skiing at these angles 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.130
 if I can be a little bit more 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.080
 high and vito retouch the snow immediately 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.360
 allows a better angle e 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.970
 maybe you prevented me with the possibility 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.230
 that the boot touching the snow me 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.730
 make it fall 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.210
 we know what to do is take it 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.050
 take the heels we need 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:51.350
 put them on the sole and then 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:55.550
 we must also put the screws we have 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.130
 put the heels on the boot e 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.270
 now we pray with the appropriate one 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.090
 machine to report the thicknesses of 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.500
 tip and heel at the physical levels because 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.150
 however, federal federation remedies 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.660
 Italian winter sports 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.120
 so we must have a thickness of 19 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.390
 mm 30 on the heel now we do it 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.390
 immediately 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.359
 now we need to redo the adjustment for 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.359
 make heels 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.359
 Now the boot and we ended 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.489
 put the heels we have milled it 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:02.599
 reported to the point we have 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.290
 milled that brought the part up to standard 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.219
 rear 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.980
 we can also put special ones 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:11.950
 inserts to ensure that embodies the case 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.019
 the athlete makes slalom competitions 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.269
 rise to go to bend or to do 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.810
 open the hook here we see the stir 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.789
 with the appropriate insert mounted in case 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.440
 of races in the middle of the posts 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.139
 the pole is going to crash here and avoid 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.880
 point that the hook or opens or 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.590
 is even folded this is 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.039
 another process we do in 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.990
 clear sports games laboratory la 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.120
 certain power and want to see it 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.669
 even stiffer boot 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:47.530
 we are able to mount the lunettes on 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:50.570
 rear of the ski and also on the tip 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.820
 the next machining will be a 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.009
 this langhe here are the heels 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.699
 langhe because as you see dong boot 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:04.010
 and technical coal or heel langhe 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:07.970
 Nordic boot we have the special one 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.610
 heel to insert under the boot ago 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.720
 the same as saying if the fisher 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.000
 if the boot is atomic of the boot e 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.030
 Salomon boy I request outside 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.250
 all because k2 we have it of nafiz 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.690
 We have this shoe 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.030
 I'm from ski mountaineering but we work 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.919
 even those if I've forgotten any 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.870
 brand know that we all have to 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.389
 let you see that we have many looks 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.389
 also to all those here if you are missing 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.909
 something you let me know that the 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.560
 next time in the picture I will put them 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.659
 also the boot, however, there 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.699
 we all work so you see all the 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.349
 boots that you have a heads up that 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.180
 we have a beautiful langhe those 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.490
 shoes you see here and others that 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.259
 We certainly do those shoes 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.479
 we all have a bit but even if it is one 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.180
 your boot does the same the boot 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.159
 that you use the important thing is that if 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.110
 worked sports reason will not be one 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.010
 normal boot will be a boot 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.010
 magical
