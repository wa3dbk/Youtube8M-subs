put it in warm water and soap and it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.100 
put it in warm water and soap and it
will<00:01:04.729> shrink<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.210> bit<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.900> makes

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
will shrink it a little bit but it makes

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.800 
will shrink it a little bit but it makes
the<00:01:07.770> stitches<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.369> very<00:01:08.640> tight<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the stitches very very tight so when you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.179 
the stitches very very tight so when you
felt<00:01:10.049> something<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> never<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> line<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
felt something you never have to line it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.890 
felt something you never have to line it
because<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> yarn<00:01:11.880> comes<00:01:12.180> together<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.780> it's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
because the yarn comes together and it's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.950 
because the yarn comes together and it's
it's<00:01:13.290> very<00:01:13.619> firm<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.810> find

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's very firm so then you just find

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480 
it's very firm so then you just find
yourself<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.439> real<00:01:16.590> pretty<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.040> button<00:01:17.340> and
