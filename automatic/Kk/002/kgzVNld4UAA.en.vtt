over here and show you the front of the

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.189 
over here and show you the front of the
machine<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.150> there's<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.509> two<00:00:27.990> ways

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
machine and there's actually two ways

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.140 
machine and there's actually two ways
that<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.770> get<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> stitches<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
that you can get the stitches one is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.560 
that you can get the stitches one is
with<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:31.019> toggle<00:00:31.560> were<00:00:32.220> dial<00:00:32.730> which<00:00:33.150> is<00:00:33.330> very

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
with this toggle were dial which is very

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.049 
with this toggle were dial which is very
unique<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.980> spin<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.580> you're<00:00:35.879> going

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
unique and as you spin that you're going

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.100 
unique and as you spin that you're going
to<00:00:36.150> see<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.800> different<00:00:37.949> stitches<00:00:39.110> changing

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to see the different stitches changing

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.380 
to see the different stitches changing
so<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.769> can<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:40.949> very<00:00:41.309> quickly<00:00:41.580> rotate<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
so you can just very quickly rotate that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.780 
so you can just very quickly rotate that
and<00:00:42.720> go<00:00:42.870> from<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.350> stitch<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.799> the<00:00:43.860> other<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
and go from one stitch to the other the

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.789 
and go from one stitch to the other the
other<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:45.299> to<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.470> a<00:00:46.589> touch

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:46.799 
other way to do it is it's a touch

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:48.950 
other way to do it is it's a touch
screen<00:00:46.949> and<00:00:47.339> there<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.150> stylus<00:00:48.659> that<00:00:48.690> is

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
screen and there is a stylus that is

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.869 
screen and there is a stylus that is
provided<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.769> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:49.949> all<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.729> do

and all the information comes up so two

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.270 
and all the information comes up so two
different<00:00:57.269> ways<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.720> you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:58.080> do<00:00:58.229> it<00:00:58.379> some

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
different ways that you can do it some

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.710 
different ways that you can do it some
of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.400> features<00:00:59.610> that<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.269> make<00:01:00.479> the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
of the features that just make the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.259 
of the features that just make the
janome<00:01:01.260> horizon<00:01:01.890> pretty<00:01:02.729> unique<00:01:03.030> I'm<00:01:03.150> going

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
janome horizon pretty unique I'm going

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.280 
janome horizon pretty unique I'm going
to<00:01:03.360> come<00:01:03.449> over<00:01:03.659> here<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.900> some<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
to come over here to some of the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.070 
to come over here to some of the
functions<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.729> see<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.479> top<00:01:06.510> here

functions as you can see at the top here

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
functions as you can see at the top here
we've<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.560> speed<00:01:07.860> control<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.670> course

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
we've got a speed control of course

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.899 
we've got a speed control of course
speed<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.900> also<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.260> controlled<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.890> how<00:01:11.250> much

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
speed can also be controlled by how much

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
speed can also be controlled by how much
you<00:01:12.180> press<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.840> foot<00:01:13.020> control<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.590> you
