00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.240
 very good I come to bring you today a 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:07.100
 analysis of a bluetooth speaker that 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.980
 bought my boss my boss is the one you see 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.099
 right now there that is opening it and 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.349
 nothing I buy it and the truth that I liked 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.449
 very much how was the sound and everything so 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.000
 that here I am going to leave you unpacked 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.029
 I'll explain a little bit 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.589
 amazon its price was about 30 euros 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.949
 although now what I write is that 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.659
 is in 37 but still deserves 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.150
 quite worth it if you want a speaker 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:34.820
 that has quality and that at the same time 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.219
 sound strong loud good as you can 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.469
 check if we open the box that came 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.579
 a little broken on one side but the truth 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.100
 that the speaker was going pretty well 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.410
 protected as you are going to find 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.739
 the instructions and with this little 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.469
 small box that I was carrying to load it a mini 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.070
 micro usb forgiveness and also that accessory 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.890
 which serves to directly put the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.000
 speaker connected to a device 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.190
 so you do not have to use the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.620
 bluetooth what I have to say is that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.390
 with that 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.240
 with those cables you hear worse you hear more 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.310
 under what if you put it by bluetooth good 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.220
 As you can see, it 's pretty nice 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.220
 It has three buttons one of them the play 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.380
 Forwards to backs and also carries 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.840
 Built-in microphone you can also 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.479
 answer directly to the phone from 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.210
 the device itself the truth that as 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.900
 It's tiny as you can see but it looks 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.540
 as very robust and quite well 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.240
 now let's try it to link it with 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.340
 his sony xperia z 2 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.659
 and good the truth that the subject of the link 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.970
 it was pretty quick he got into adjustments 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.060
 he found it easily and it was not even 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.860
 necessary to put a password because 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.229
 we know that many speakers 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.799
 they come and they ask you by default that 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.539
 permit is 0000 and this is good 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.380
 connected to the moment below has the 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.850
 button on-off and connected then that to 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.649
 moment it happens that my boss then 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.560
 It cost a bit to find the way 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.980
 but immediately I explained it was very 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.780
 easy I tell you the device as you can 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.319
 see is pretty pretty has a few 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.150
 finished like that black and silver to me 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.250
 it seemed pretty good in terms of 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.540
 sound has a sound that is not serious 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.460
 nor is it acute but it is quite 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.040
 pretty real 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.690
 and it seems that you have already connected and once 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.550
 connected because nothing the only thing we did 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.310
 was to get directly into music and 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.210
 try it the truth that I loved it and for 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.210
 I would like to recommend that 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.210
 arriving 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.470
 do not 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.260
 the wifi 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.770
 it's hard for me 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.990
 the days 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.410
 with you 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.290
 if you liked it, leave your like and 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.770
 we will continue making videos of a boxing 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.770
