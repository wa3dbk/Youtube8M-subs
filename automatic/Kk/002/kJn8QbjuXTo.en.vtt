00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
slower the netflix app was is one of the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.770 
slower the netflix app was is one of the
top<00:01:43.660> apps<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.470> store<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:44.980> this<00:01:45.190> point

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.450 

alright<00:01:52.780> we<00:01:52.990> can<00:01:53.110> actually<00:01:56.190> it's<00:01:57.190> screen

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
alright we can actually it's screen

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.890 
alright we can actually it's screen
larger<00:01:57.580> smaller<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:58.240> was<00:01:58.420> originally<00:01:58.750> thought

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
larger smaller I was originally thought

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.360 
larger smaller I was originally thought
that<00:01:58.960> if<00:01:59.260> you<00:01:59.290> double<00:01:59.590> tap<00:01:59.710> on<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.950> screen<00:02:00.130> it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
that if you double tap on the screen it

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.140 
that if you double tap on the screen it
would<00:02:00.460> do<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.640> but<00:02:00.850> there's<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.060> little

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
would do that but there's a little

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.940 
would do that but there's a little
button<00:02:01.330> up<00:02:01.510> here<00:02:01.690> for<00:02:01.870> me<00:02:01.990> here<00:02:02.200> why<00:02:02.830> it's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
button up here for me here why it's

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.820 
button up here for me here why it's
going<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.190> full<00:02:03.370> screen<00:02:03.720> okay<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:05.440> can<00:02:05.590> pause

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
going to full screen okay you can pause

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:16.050 
going to full screen okay you can pause
and<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.510> scrub<00:02:07.720> through<00:02:14.760> let's<00:02:15.760> get<00:02:15.940> to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
and when you scrub through let's get to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:27.740 
and when you scrub through let's get to
a<00:02:16.090> certain<00:02:16.270> part<00:02:18.000> ok<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.540> movie<00:02:19.840> heat

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.930 

fast<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:29.770> good<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.190> definitely<00:02:30.610> watchable

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
fast it's good it's definitely watchable

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.330 
fast it's good it's definitely watchable
and<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:31.840> i<00:02:31.900> can<00:02:32.050> replace<00:02:32.290> our<00:02:32.530> flat<00:02:32.770> panel<00:02:33.070> TV

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
