00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
 always went to roll to the street to the 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.270
 Bolivar Square or Bolivar Avenue 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.160
 assault walls and waxes but then when 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.020
 we found out that they were going to have to be 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.370
 we were very happy since we were going to 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.700
 have a place where to come the ends of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.989
 week to practice a bit now when 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 they inaugurated the skate park was a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.090
 wonder because we started to roll already 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.600
 I learned pretty trick a lot of technique 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.460
 it was pretty loose in the park and I 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.460
 I feel pretty good I like it a lot 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.160
 this is a work that only has it 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.400
 it's hair port here in venezuela is 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.260
 the largest park that this country has 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 we have it here in port hair 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.829
 you always had to be on the boardwalk or 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.130
 they were working by the squares and more 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.310
 well what they did was 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:39.020
 gratify the damage now not now the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 porteÃ±os have a u that is 8 meters 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.280
 wide by 5 meters high we have 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.799
 a smaller one of 3 meters in the part 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.689
 lateral towards where is the marina 2 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.689
 bolt one that is medium the other that is 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.860
 pro has some pots that are small 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.869
 so that people who are going to start in 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.299
 skates or bicycle beyond where 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.299
 it can start and then it will go 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.910
 climbing goes climbing the first 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.410
 pool that we have in transit to skate 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.590
 park that is what we call the mickey 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.519
 mouse to later come to this that is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.730
 where is the country that rotates 360 degrees and 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.709
 I hope that from here they come out good 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.980
 competitors because there are many 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.090
 areas 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.090
 and they are good 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.780
 I do not fear is not here 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.090
 skate a lot 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.090
 is skating and pulling water 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.370
 already after they made the sky for all 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.890
 true 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.980
 an example for us 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.420
 to keep skating and be with 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:08.580
 future would be an extreme future the truth 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.580
 this has been very extreme very quality 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.409
 extremes and that encouraged me and I would like 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.470
 go back to start to start 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.470
