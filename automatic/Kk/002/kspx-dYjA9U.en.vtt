00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.960
 video of the channel and these 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.089
 next I want to teach you there how 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.210
 take a led from the video on youtube that the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.279
 60fps feel a war then complaining 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.980
 we were with greg is simply 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.269
 this second tip on how to get the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.210
 is the first that simply 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.800
 download the video which is a bit more 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.269
 difficult but ends up losing a bit of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.619
 right quality 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.930
 I had just formatted the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.410
 computer was with the fucking fan 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.050
 When I got to open the game, right? 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.879
 Beauty, I researched a lot of the campaign. 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.250
 and no one had made the video yet 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.840
 I know now in the conduct by posting but the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.170
 business is the following I play video here 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.719
 You can see that it's good. 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.370

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.810
 a historical note lets me carry my 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.590
 part of the navigation shows that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.189
 that has saved and track data from 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.110
 navigation left in parts with noise 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.869
 background is that the code that playing already 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.820
 made is with a common history because 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.270
