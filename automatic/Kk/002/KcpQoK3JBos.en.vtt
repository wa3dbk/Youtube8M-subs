00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi here it is and powerful club that 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.420
 steffen israel by force believe that 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.040
 A young man with leather jacket and 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.769
 falcon barth we are here on the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.849
 berlin festival 2012 you are watching intro 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.849
 Watch TV on the internet 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.019
 hide felix you are not that 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.789
 first time here but at least that 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.770
 second time of the other paint knows 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.509
 I do not but with you yes in 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.949
 time so a lot of done so 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.690
 the berlin festival 2011 and 2012 what 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:41.940
 is the biggest difference for you 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:44.050
 the stage nobody said yes the stage 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.150
 Okay, you are waiting for the mainstage 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.839
 Of course, many people race and so on 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.119
 Of course, oh well, last year 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.430
 There we were, that's what we are 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:57.100
 felt two days before 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.909
 Slipped because one of 412 game 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.670
 jail sat and future wolf gang sat in 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.830
 slammer 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.360
 ok and now just like that in the hangar 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.030
 It is relatively short term 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.640
 it was middle-of-the-range 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.380
 folk festival with a group of people 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.810
 which will be much bigger this time 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.030
 but you are of course, too 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.409
 meanwhile bigger herb used so 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.220
 this is more of a game for you now 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.680
 So you always play at home anyway 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.950
 berlin festival what last year had to 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.510
 we also do not wait for us now 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.600
 the festival visitors here are already 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.930
 I would say a bit of music like that 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.210
 times 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.220
 perhaps even now not a typical 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.930
 indie bands would you say that 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.330
 audience here at berlin festival is 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.530
 rather distant not distancing 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.120
 Reserved us and a bit so 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.170
 You notice the people at home differently 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.630
 come that they are still smart 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.040
 have and that we were not three days 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.990
 have given up at some point too 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.940
 shit stinky neck stuck all this 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.560
 you notice a bit there 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.299
 It's a special trick now 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.920
 somehow crack this audience 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:14.099
 towards an audience when being as at 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.099
 I do not know about the skirt 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.120
 not working 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.050
 yes i know so i am yes i am real 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.050
 excited and I when I now I have 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.340
 Do not be scared but I have it already 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.040
 aware that something is becoming more difficult 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.830
 now any things with the people 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.210
 somehow now it is going to make 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.140
 that you say grown and now 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.090
 already the first people the poor 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.900
 interlock us say 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.490
 power club very loud but hello straight 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.810
 already said in the current 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.010
 current bravo from us one 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.720
 autograph card in it with preprinted 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.390
 autograph such a band we are now 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 We are still in the moment 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.510
 I really bought everything kiosk 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.100
 make and now again back to the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.610
 festivals in general you have now and 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.630
 like a whole slide at festivals 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.800
 You really get that way behind you 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.800
 a lot of coal 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.680
 it has been clarified lately like 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.550
 a lot of the coal for our fresh 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.800
 that was sobering little one 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.970
 looks like the garages how do we get 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.770
 but lately it became apparent 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.950
 shown how much is left for us 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.060
 and then another five say you had 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.320
 already made plans and how the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.970
 slab buildings in karl marx city too 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.060
 gild and now it's not even 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.060
 a fountain let's go we go 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.900
 what is such an absolute favorite 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.900
 festival 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.500
 that we be without Arschkriecher girl 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.450
 the melt festival that's us too 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.310
 Private always and otherwise lineup moderate 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.349
 Really this summer 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.090
 Frequency in Austria has everything 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.709
 topped I can imagine 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.290
 that the glory goes to your head now 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:11.069
 So who has the biggest in the band? 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.069
 problems with steffen 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.400
 why does it always have to be the water of the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.140
 Fiji islands should be that in the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.120
 Catering room then stop there is enough 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.530
 from the slightly dressed young man 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.610
 you overwhelmed from greece that 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.050
 can be peeled out the best if 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.360
 the water would be about the table 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.000
 on which the water stands must stop 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.010
 be made of fiji island fiji 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.450
 a synthesis islands 2 as islands fidschi 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.860
 actually looks international so 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.870
 We have already had Austria 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.190
 but that is not the end yet 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.580
 the flagpole so you are yes 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:54.850
 Certainly been in america 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:59.540
 namibia from illegal intentions or 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.830
 may need illegal intentions 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.830
 because any intentions were illegal 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.300
 Berlin debates goethe institute has us 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.420
 Invited to travel to Colombia or 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.210
 two weeks in cities could do so 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.160
 play you are already my cultural heritage 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.110
 Scholli would rather be that way 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:26.120
 publicly fed as feels 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:30.080
 because of the culture in other countries 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.669
 our here as culture itself us so 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.050
 you are now an ambassador so to speak 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.180
 diplomatic service what do you want? 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.840
 To convey to the people of Colombia how 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.250
 it looks like this 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.110
 we do not even know if they are us anymore 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:45.500
 33 songs will be transmitted 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.820
 send and then the texts do not know 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.220
 who give the honor but anyone 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.270
 will already be read but before 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.830
 we somehow come to an end 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.220
 here at the berlin festival and again 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:59.660
 to stretch the bow to the festivals 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:03.680
 abroad exactly the people there understood 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:07.010
 but we have we have one 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.890
 read a review of her appearance 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.400
 went down like oil or he described how 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.440
 he ran so long and it has heard and 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.860
 that the human but the play here 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.940
 no much better power club out 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:31.320
 play germany 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:32.190
 quasi as in fresh ok so the whole 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.690
 still to complete 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.340
 We also went to a festival 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.900
 then met at the beginning of the year 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.480
 in groningen you were in the 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.510
 pedestrian zone busy with that 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.560
 video to lose songs turn and 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:49.640
 it was about a wild kissing and 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.890
 I was exactly that time with Linus Volkmann 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.450
 drunk enough to join in and me 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.740
 find now you are guest in mine 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.800
 video and i think now is the time 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.580
 come that you should maybe 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.580
 in a nutshell 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.740
 Now the exhibition you know 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.320
 know what he's talking about 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.070
 now that we are smooching 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.610
 that would not be correct that I have now 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.830
 more specifically So yes, of course, but in 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.620
 but I have said that exactly me 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.140
 have so exactly meant any rate us 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:28.020
 So I would be really nice 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:29.700
 For if you now as a return to the 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:34.530
 is now my music video and so to speak 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:37.940
 now we sing the song after we 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.940
 do the unconventional we are 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.370
 thomas power 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.370
 oscars
