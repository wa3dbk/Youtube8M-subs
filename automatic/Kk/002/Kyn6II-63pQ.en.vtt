00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
advanced especially because this is

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.940

gonna be the first time that they're

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.370 
gonna be the first time that they're
developing<00:01:17.540> specifically<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> next-gen

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and all that stuff all that's gonna be

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.800 
and all that stuff all that's gonna be
much<00:01:35.820> much<00:01:36.060> better<00:01:36.240> than<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> year

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
much much better than it was a year

much much better than it was a year
before<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.159> every<00:01:38.850> single<00:01:39.150> year

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
before just like it is every single year

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
before just like it is every single year
but<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.740> caught<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.189> eye<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but what really caught my eye here is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.969 
but what really caught my eye here is
that<00:01:42.329> last<00:01:42.689> sentence<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> said<00:01:43.829> an

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that last sentence it said an

environmental effects such as fire smoke

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020 
environmental effects such as fire smoke
water<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> weather<00:01:47.070> system<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.610> fire

water and the weather system now fire
smoke<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.420> water<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:49.110> awesome<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:49.740> sure

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
smoke and water that's awesome I'm sure

of<00:01:56.520> course<00:01:56.820> those<00:01:57.299> things<00:01:57.630> would<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.840> on

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
of course those things would be going on

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.929 
of course those things would be going on
but<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> weather<00:01:58.710> system<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.549> really

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
but the weather system is what really

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.120 
but the weather system is what really
really<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.899> sparked<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.380> interest<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.040> as

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
really kind of sparked my interest so as

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.030 
really kind of sparked my interest so as
you<00:02:02.219> guys<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.659> recently<00:02:03.659> kind<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.860> this

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
whole evolution idea has been a pretty

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.960 
whole evolution idea has been a pretty
big<00:02:07.530> theme<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.179> first-person<00:02:09.179> shooters<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.720> can

all<00:02:10.119> day<00:02:10.300> we've<00:02:10.509> got<00:02:10.720> storm<00:02:11.080> front<00:02:11.410> where<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
all day we've got storm front where the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.100 
all day we've got storm front where the
map<00:02:11.830> starts<00:02:12.160> off<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.970> bright<00:02:13.300> sunny<00:02:13.630> day<00:02:13.840> and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
map starts off is a bright sunny day and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.570 
map starts off is a bright sunny day and
then<00:02:14.290> throughout<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.830> map<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.370> play<00:02:15.520> it

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
then throughout the map if you play it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.890 
then throughout the map if you play it
out<00:02:15.670> long<00:02:15.820> enough<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.300> domination<00:02:16.690> or

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
out long enough like in domination or

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.120 
out long enough like in domination or
something<00:02:17.140> like<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.830> kind<00:02:18.070> of

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
something like that it kind of

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.490 
something like that it kind of
transforms<00:02:18.430> into<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.390> dark<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.960> stormy

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
transforms into this dark and stormy

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.380 
transforms into this dark and stormy
rainy<00:02:20.770> map<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.400> not<00:02:21.490> only<00:02:21.760> does<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:21.940> change<00:02:22.270> it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
rainy map and not only does it change it

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.330 
rainy map and not only does it change it
in<00:02:22.480> terms<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.750> like<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.050> feel<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
in terms of like the feel and the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.790 
in terms of like the feel and the
setting<00:02:24.850> but<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.870> also<00:02:25.990> actually<00:02:26.440> changed<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
setting but it also actually changed the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.530 
setting but it also actually changed the
map<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.310> kind<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.580> makes<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.450> you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
map like it kind of makes it so you

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.180 
map like it kind of makes it so you
can't<00:02:28.810> see<00:02:29.020> quite<00:02:29.200> as<00:02:29.410> far<00:02:29.620> as<00:02:29.740> some<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.130> those

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
can't see quite as far as some of those

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.710 
can't see quite as far as some of those
longer<00:02:30.580> sniper<00:02:30.850> lines<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.300> sight<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.540> stuff

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
longer sniper lines of sight and stuff

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.820 
longer sniper lines of sight and stuff
don't<00:02:31.930> work<00:02:32.050> as<00:02:32.230> well<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.410> that's<00:02:32.620> kind<00:02:32.800> of

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
don't work as well so that's kind of

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.890 
don't work as well so that's kind of
interesting<00:02:33.010> or<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.880> even<00:02:34.150> more<00:02:34.360> kind<00:02:34.840> of

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
interesting or and even more kind of

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.930 
interesting or and even more kind of
dramatic<00:02:35.470> example<00:02:36.070> would<00:02:36.190> be<00:02:36.220> freefall<00:02:36.820> you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
dramatic example would be freefall you

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.220 
dramatic example would be freefall you
guys<00:02:37.060> know<00:02:37.240> how<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.420> building<00:02:37.780> falls<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
guys know how the building falls to the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.450 
guys know how the building falls to the
ground<00:02:38.290> I've<00:02:38.560> actually<00:02:38.710> never<00:02:39.010> played<00:02:39.340> on

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
ground I've actually never played on

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.710 
ground I've actually never played on
that<00:02:39.550> map<00:02:39.730> yet<00:02:39.970> believe<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.270> or<00:02:40.330> not<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.630> don't

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
that map yet believe it or not I don't

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.390 
that map yet believe it or not I don't
know<00:02:40.870> I'm<00:02:41.170> supposed<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.680> have<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:42.010> but<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.160> never

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
know I'm supposed to have it but I never

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.430 
know I'm supposed to have it but I never
got<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:43.000> any<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.450> rotations<00:02:43.990> but<00:02:44.200> um

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
got it in any of the rotations but um

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.740 
got it in any of the rotations but um
yeah<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.760> map<00:02:45.940> changes<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.600> goes<00:02:46.720> down

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
yeah the map changes as it goes down

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.510 
yeah the map changes as it goes down
that<00:02:47.110> literally<00:02:47.620> changes<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.310> sight

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
that literally changes you the sight

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.580 
that literally changes you the sight
lines<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.420> areas<00:02:50.050> where<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.290> can<00:02:50.440> run

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
lines and the areas where you can run

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.480 
lines and the areas where you can run
and<00:02:50.740> things<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:51.370> there's

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
and things like that and then there's

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.770 
and things like that and then there's
also<00:02:51.640> other<00:02:51.910> games<00:02:52.090> doing<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:52.570> like

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
also other games doing this like

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.750 
also other games doing this like
battlefield<00:02:53.709> has<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.400> know<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.520> bunch

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
battlefield has it and you know a bunch

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.070 
battlefield has it and you know a bunch
of<00:02:54.880> other<00:02:55.000> games<00:02:55.180> have<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.600> yeah

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
of other games have it so yeah

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.280 
of other games have it so yeah
LEvolution<00:02:56.470> seems<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.130> be<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> pretty<00:02:58.120> big<00:02:58.290> fad

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
LEvolution seems to be a pretty big fad

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.720 
LEvolution seems to be a pretty big fad
at<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> moment<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.070> game<00:03:00.190> developers<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.580> it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
at the moment for game developers and it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.160 
at the moment for game developers and it
makes<00:03:00.850> me<00:03:00.970> think<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.510> maybe<00:03:01.570> we'll<00:03:01.959> get<00:03:02.050> to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
makes me think that maybe we'll get to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.380 
makes me think that maybe we'll get to
see<00:03:02.200> some<00:03:02.590> more<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.850> next<00:03:04.150> Call

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
see some more of that in this next Call

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.820 
see some more of that in this next Call
of<00:03:04.420> Duty<00:03:04.570> game<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.900> modern<00:03:05.170> warfare<00:03:05.320> 4<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.800> I

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
of Duty game in modern warfare 4 and I

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.140 
of Duty game in modern warfare 4 and I
think<00:03:06.040> it's<00:03:06.130> pretty<00:03:06.340> cool<00:03:06.459> like<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.670> really

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
think it's pretty cool like I really

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.820 
think it's pretty cool like I really
like<00:03:07.360> LEvolution<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.110> things<00:03:08.320> like<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.620> as

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
like LEvolution and things like that as

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.860 
like LEvolution and things like that as
long<00:03:08.860> as<00:03:09.340> they're<00:03:09.550> done<00:03:09.730> well<00:03:10.360> as<00:03:10.630> long<00:03:10.840> as

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
long as they're done well as long as

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.870 
long as they're done well as long as
it's<00:03:11.110> not<00:03:11.260> overdone<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.950> actually<00:03:12.670> adds

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
it's not overdone and actually adds

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.180 
it's not overdone and actually adds
effect<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.470> know<00:03:14.560> whatever's<00:03:14.890> going<00:03:15.100> on

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
effect to you know whatever's going on

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.560 
effect to you know whatever's going on
like<00:03:15.400> maybe<00:03:15.610> we<00:03:15.790> could<00:03:15.940> see<00:03:16.060> some<00:03:16.209> stuff<00:03:16.420> like

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
like maybe we could see some stuff like

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
like maybe we could see some stuff like
back<00:03:16.750> in<00:03:16.930> world<00:03:17.110> at<00:03:17.200> war<00:03:17.320> if<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.440> guys

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.140 
back in world at war if you guys
remember<00:03:17.769> making<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.550> then<00:03:18.640> making<00:03:18.850> day

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
remember making and then making day

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.820 
remember making and then making day
makin<00:03:19.690> was<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> night<00:03:20.110> map<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:20.650> making

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
makin was a night map and then making

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.250 
makin was a night map and then making
day<00:03:21.130> was<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:22.180> know<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.390> same<00:03:22.600> map<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.170> was

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
day was you know the same map but it was

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.620 
day was you know the same map but it was
a<00:03:23.290> day<00:03:23.530> time<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.130> dramatically<00:03:25.090> changed

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
a day time and it dramatically changed

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.699 
a day time and it dramatically changed
the<00:03:25.720> way<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.110> map<00:03:26.260> played<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.620> was

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
the way that the map played it was

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.470 
the way that the map played it was
really<00:03:26.980> really<00:03:27.130> cool<00:03:27.400> or<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.209> know<00:03:28.300> maybe

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
really really cool or you know maybe

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.820 
really really cool or you know maybe
we'll<00:03:28.690> have<00:03:28.840> maps<00:03:29.260> where<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.620> weather

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
we'll have maps where the weather

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.350 
we'll have maps where the weather
actually<00:03:30.100> changes<00:03:30.760> while<00:03:30.880> you're<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.150> there

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
actually changes while you're in there

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.180 
actually changes while you're in there
you<00:03:31.450> know<00:03:31.570> like<00:03:31.720> storm<00:03:31.989> front<00:03:32.290> had<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.890> rain

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
you know like storm front had that rain

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.979 
you know like storm front had that rain
roll<00:03:33.519> in<00:03:33.700> or<00:03:33.940> maybe<00:03:34.150> we'll<00:03:34.390> have<00:03:34.510> one<00:03:34.690> where<00:03:34.840> we

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
roll in or maybe we'll have one where we

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.630 
roll in or maybe we'll have one where we
start<00:03:35.260> off<00:03:35.380> at<00:03:35.560> kind<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.769> dusk<00:03:36.010> where<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.400> can

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
start off at kind of dusk where you can

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.460 
start off at kind of dusk where you can
see<00:03:36.880> well<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.239> then<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.810> goes<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.350> know

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
see well and then it goes to you know

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.020 
see well and then it goes to you know
pitch-black<00:03:38.769> night<00:03:39.040> where<00:03:39.519> it's<00:03:39.580> tougher<00:03:39.940> to

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
pitch-black night where it's tougher to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.729 
pitch-black night where it's tougher to
see<00:03:40.180> or<00:03:40.360> maybe<00:03:40.540> we'll<00:03:41.080> have<00:03:41.200> something<00:03:41.500> like

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
see or maybe we'll have something like

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.070 
see or maybe we'll have something like
you<00:03:41.830> know<00:03:41.920> imagine<00:03:42.250> I'm<00:03:42.489> whiteout<00:03:42.880> if<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.660> 30
