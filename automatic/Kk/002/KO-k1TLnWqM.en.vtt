 when they told me after the game they 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.360
 puts to think that if in matches in this 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.360
 club the truth that means a lot 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.940

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.810
 with titles but happy happy to be able 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.489
 get a figure that out there is not 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.110
 so common in Argentine soccer and 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.290
 we take a tour of those 100 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.970
 matches which is the most recorded memory 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.530
 that you have or the party that most marked you 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.370
 no more than anything the titles 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.050
 Argentina cup local tournament titles 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.839
 that we can achieve are those that one by 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.190
 there he remembers more and that's when one out there 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.140
 it reaches the maximum it can hope for 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.989
 he leaves champion since it arrives until the club 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.280
 now you grew up sporting like 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.720
 it was evolution here in the mouth I'm more 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 great of argentina one of the most 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.830
 biggest of the world 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.680
 this obviously that expectations are going 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.899
 growing as time goes on and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.259
 good is one always aspires to be able to go to 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.210
 more by assigning things and finally 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.610
 participates in the best way this club 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.289
 gives you everything and good one out there treats 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.490
 to give him back in training and 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.690
 after the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.290
 matches the people the truth that 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.730
 in the love the support more than anything this 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 of the first match in Maria in 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.799
 with olimpo this the truth that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.890
 I have no words, the only thing I can 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.930
 say I say it sometimes I get serious 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.119
 for reality the only thing that can 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.810
 doing one is training being well and 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.780
 paid on the court is where one 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.320
 more than anything else you can do it and move 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.420
 what you feel 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.240
 from well inside on the court after 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.929
 they are acknowledgments as has been highlighted 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.090
 in a little message on my twitter account 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.370
 be always grateful and good this 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.890
 I am reiterative but I could future 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.420
 let's hope to continue giving them titles and 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.520
 joys to all the people the party 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.220
 number 100 was against years you did not receive 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.870
 no goal that is what rescues most 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.130
 of the performance of mouth in the debut in 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.980
 Internet 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.240
 and I think that we knew how to read the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.830
 game was played as we did there 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.970
 raise it during the week as the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.330
 technical wanted to raise what we could 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.330
 having won it we had several chances 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.130
 Obviously, our obligations 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.100
 in this club is to win and we can not 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.530
 stop us with a tie but if 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.080
 everything was the first game the boys 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.910
 I think they made a correct match 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.910
 this obviously we have to 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.300
 value all that but if we do not win the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.910
 weekend here 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.560
 that polino point is not going to be valued 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.120
 Do you think that mouth has a lot to see 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.490
 what happened recently here in mouth 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.320
 marked the titles and how it went to you 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.370
 in particular with your chance in the 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.960
 selection but if everything goes hand in hand and 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.110
 gives me the ability to play in search 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.850
 of 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.410
 that the coach of the national team sees me 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.890
 that is 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.170
 this by hand this 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.600
 and if something that is going well for me is going well 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.340
 then I think it's a set we should 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.090
 speaking in a talk with romÃ¡n how 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.420
 is the quiet group obviously with 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.870
 desire to be able to reverse 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.270
 this year that the objectives are not achieved 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.400
 but calm trying to train well 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.480
 and be good at matches 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.650
 to be able as I told you before 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.230
 to be able to demonstrate the playing field 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.270
 desire and the predisposition that this 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.280
 campus to revert lively to win 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.319

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.670

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.650
 Share it wants to end the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.010
 guys the doctors let's leave for 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.980

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.370
