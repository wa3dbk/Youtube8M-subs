00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.320 
just around the edges it's not like a
portrait<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.100> have<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.580> keep<00:02:38.730> yourself<00:02:38.880> in

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
portrait you have to keep yourself in

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.000 
portrait you have to keep yourself in
and<00:02:39.480> also<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:41.810> Mickey<00:02:42.810> that's<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:43.800> that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
and also with Mickey that's all that

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.710 
and also with Mickey that's all that
matters<00:02:44.370> my<00:02:44.550> chemistry<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.360> making

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
matters my chemistry and making

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.610 
matters my chemistry and making
consistent<00:02:47.959> there's<00:02:48.959> nothing<00:02:49.410> worse<00:02:49.590> than

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
consistent there's nothing worse than

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.520 
consistent there's nothing worse than
doing<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.250> tribal<00:02:50.730> where<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.150> all<00:02:51.330> these

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
doing a tribal where you have all these

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.210 
doing a tribal where you have all these
black<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.739> white<00:02:52.920> spots<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.860> I'll<00:02:55.860> show<00:02:56.070> you

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
black and white spots and I'll show you

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.250 
black and white spots and I'll show you
more<00:02:56.430> about<00:02:56.489> that<00:02:56.880> I'm<00:02:57.090> saving<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.780> then

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
more about that I'm saving and then

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.570 
more about that I'm saving and then
here's<00:02:58.500> I'll<00:02:58.650> here<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.950> technique<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.370> you

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
here's I'll here the technique that you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.780 
here's I'll here the technique that you
can<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.820> with<00:02:59.940> your<00:03:00.030> liner<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:01.400> lot<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.520> schools

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
can do with your liner a lot of schools

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.040 
can do with your liner a lot of schools
will<00:03:02.880> teach<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.330> come<00:03:03.510> back<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.840> with<00:03:03.989> a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
will teach you to come back in with a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.380 
will teach you to come back in with a
small<00:03:04.410> shader<00:03:04.770> or<00:03:04.980> whatever<00:03:05.280> but<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.270> could

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
small shader or whatever but you could

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.060 
small shader or whatever but you could
also<00:03:06.540> do<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:06.870> your<00:03:07.140> liner<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.860> that

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
also do with your liner this that

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.949 
also do with your liner this that
appeared<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:08.730> master<00:03:09.060> here<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.810> it

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
appeared in this master here this is it

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.740 
appeared in this master here this is it
in<00:03:10.140> an<00:03:10.290> hour<00:03:10.410> circular<00:03:11.130> motion<00:03:11.580> not<00:03:12.180> only<00:03:12.450> am<00:03:12.600> i

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
in an hour circular motion not only am i

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.080 
in an hour circular motion not only am i
going<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.260> circle<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.370> coming<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:14.940> and

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
going in a circle but I'm coming in and

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.440 
going in a circle but I'm coming in and
out<00:03:15.330> at<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.570> same<00:03:15.660> time

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
out at the same time

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.650 
out at the same time
and<00:03:18.450> keep<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.959> moving<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:20.480> if<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
and keep it moving like that if you

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.900 
and keep it moving like that if you
don't<00:03:21.780> do<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.320> that's<00:03:22.980> how<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.310> get<00:03:23.700> those

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
don't do that that's how you get those

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.850 
don't do that that's how you get those
jagged<00:03:24.360> spike<00:03:24.900> I'll<00:03:25.080> tell<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.470> get<00:03:25.620> those

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
jagged spike I'll tell you you get those

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.060 
jagged spike I'll tell you you get those
in<00:03:26.070> between<00:03:26.190> spots<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.720> you'll<00:03:28.140> see

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.200 

okay<00:03:33.170> but<00:03:34.170> if<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.410> look<00:03:34.620> carefully<00:03:35.210> you'll

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
okay but if you look carefully you'll

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:45.050 
okay but if you look carefully you'll
see<00:03:36.450> it's<00:03:36.660> not<00:03:36.870> bleeding<00:03:43.520> and<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.640> might<00:03:44.820> see

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
see it's not bleeding and you might see

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.860 
see it's not bleeding and you might see
a<00:03:45.090> little<00:03:45.300> bit<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.570> stuff<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.140> watch<00:03:46.470> look

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
a little bit of stuff in that watch look

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.380 
a little bit of stuff in that watch look
see<00:03:48.870> that

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.370 

okay<00:03:52.230> watch<00:03:52.830> I'll<00:03:53.100> show<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.520> blood

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
okay watch I'll show you that blood

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.930 
okay watch I'll show you that blood
sister<00:03:55.380> blood<00:03:55.620> platelet<00:03:56.100> watch<00:03:56.820> which<00:04:01.940> see

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
sister blood platelet watch which see

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.339 
sister blood platelet watch which see
that<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:04.110> look<00:04:04.350> when<00:04:05.070> I'm<00:04:05.190> done

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.979 

it's<00:04:08.920> not<00:04:09.159> bleeding<00:04:09.400> look<00:04:09.790> it's<00:04:10.420> done<00:04:10.719> it's

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
it's not bleeding look it's done it's

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.860 
it's not bleeding look it's done it's
already<00:04:11.319> starting<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.680> hell<00:04:12.239> if<00:04:13.239> that<00:04:13.510> doesn't

already starting to hell if that doesn't

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.479 
already starting to hell if that doesn't
happen<00:04:14.019> if<00:04:14.349> it's<00:04:14.530> still<00:04:14.799> bleeding<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.310> stuff

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
happen if it's still bleeding and stuff

because even if your needles in too deep
it's<00:04:47.229> just<00:04:47.620> like<00:04:47.889> getting<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:49.020> small<00:04:50.020> little
