00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:11.719
 hello together and welcome 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.929
 to a new video here at approx 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.000
 fotos.de and at the beginning I would like to 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.130
 first apologize for it in 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.470
 the last time very few videos to 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.390
 theme lightroom gave that will also again 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.280
 I would like to change that 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.700
 do a little good and have me 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.300
 I think about making a series 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.540
 lightroom and that's the name of the lightroom 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.120
 secrets in this series until now 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.670
 I will have ten consequences 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.980
 so the secrets of lightroom 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.600
 Dug out a bit there are a few 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.730
 you do not actually do any of the functions 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.360
 immediately thinks or knows that you 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.960
 there are 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.300
 or i want to show some things like that 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.520
 that if that sets you up like that, you 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.470
 then you could simply work faster 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.660
 lightroom so it should go in 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.579
 a total of ten in the next few weeks 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.050
 follow would have come to this and today in 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.649
 I'll show you the first one 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.840
 Maybe he works out of photoshop 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.310
 already knows and that is the so-called 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.619
 fade function 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.679
 that is, you can can in photoshop 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.289
 if you painted with the brush that 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.039
 what he paints or otherwise a tool 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.229
 used water 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.670
 the changes he made at the moment 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.130
 have made rules ranging from 0 to 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.259
 100 percent quasi the opacity and also 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.639
 You can do that here in lightroom 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.310
 but this feature is really great 

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:36.679
 very hidden but very good if 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.189
 you know where she is and that's what I show 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.009
 you now 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.109
 So I'd like to go there 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.659
 and here with the brush I am me 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.279
 I would like to have selected a few 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.799
 paint changes on the picture 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:51.349
 I make the brush for a first 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.670
 Bit smaller and let's see what 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:57.109
 we want to do 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.090
 I would like to get a little colder here 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.069
 would like to go a little bit lighter 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.939
 I'll just fit a few now 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.090
 things 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.659
 Of course I already have a lot here 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.090
 more on the picture on it but it works 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.910
 just a matter of showing that so the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.320
 Of course, that's too much now 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.720
 of course I would be here now 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.090
 regulator by hand always a bit 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.210
 Rule down and watch it fit 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.610
 but if you have that kind of 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.960
 combination of the regulator has found and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.090
 actually only opinion is 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.190
 now the intensity is really only 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.100
 too hard but the combination of mine 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.900
 regulator fits then you can do the following 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.940
 do and that is actually this 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.630
 secret tip I want to give you 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.900
 You click here on this triangle 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.370
 in the corner and then the following happens 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.130
 this box works together and you 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.980
 get an amount regulator and this one 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.470
 amount regulator has the value 22 at the moment 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.340
 why that is so I show you that is 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.760
 namely the highest value here would be 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.830
 These rules here simply on 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.680
 pushed farthest to the left if 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.140
 one sees that in comparison to the middle and 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.610
 if we fold that up and then 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.220
 we can just do this here 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.790
 intensity of this effect upwards 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.680
 regulate or just down regulate and 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.300
 Talking about how we customize it 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.970
 need here for example 10 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.550
 and then what happens is all the controllers 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.500
 you touched in the same 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.670
 proportions right notes left 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.890
 be moved 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.800
 that actually fades this 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.430
 function from the photoshop area very much 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.050
 very close 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.760
 and if you know that this function 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.180
 there then does that work with the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.500
 brush twice as much fun again 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.060
 if you do not have this function yet 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.800
 of opinion have known that you are 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.420
 others this feature definitely 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.100
 should also know me then 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.890
 like and share the video 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.989
 facebook and google + gives the video 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.400
 unconditional thumbs up easily 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.120

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.370
 click videos 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.780

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.110
 equipped that it should have been 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.790
 I'll be glad if he comes soon
