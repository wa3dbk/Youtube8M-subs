00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 why are trains running at 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.620
 left 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.170
 I bet that three quarters of the people 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.520
 here present of the same not 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.059
 noticed but now that you have it 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.230
 found 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.600
 do you want to know the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.310
 answer if yes watch this video the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.590
 first train line have been put 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.390
 in continental Europe has been 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.400
 in 1827 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.259
 at the time it connected Saint-Etienne and 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.359
 andrÃ©zieux in those times there she does not 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.070
 was used to transport the wii that is 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.630
 a carbon rock but I imagine that 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.310
 you do not suspect one 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.410
 now we we very quickly found a 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.360
 other utility so well that at that time 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.130
 there if he had measured the length of 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.940
 all paths make the whole world 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.680
 we would have reached the length of 38 km to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.650
 comparison title the earth does not 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.270
 than 40000 70 km in circumference 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.130
 finally let's go back to our sheep 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.510
 finally another 1 actually if the trains 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.470
 August on the left it's for a good reason 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.970
 precise 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.470
 the principle of the railroad was born in 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.820
 england and do you figure that our 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.920
 English neighbors barahir where the left 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.630
 when some western countries like 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.040
 for example France or the 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.659
 belgium wanted to order trains 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.460
 to the English well they received 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.380
 to be an Englishman so 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.060
 to drive left but it's good to 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.740
 note that some places uses the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.149
 normal system that is to say they 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.890
 roll to the right as for example 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.240
 Alsace or Lorraine simply 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.740
 because before he belonged to the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.299
 Germans who have them trains that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.829
 roll right there are also others 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.479
 country whose trains where the right by 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.159
 example denmark or turkey 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.990
 know also that it exists via 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.280
 trains like for example the thalys which 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.840
 are made to roll either right 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.880
 either on the left or by the fact that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.890
 has a steering wheel in the middle of the cabin 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.079
 I hope you enjoyed this episode
