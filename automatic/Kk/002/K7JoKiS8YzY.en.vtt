we'll make the body now stack these

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.830 
we'll make the body now stack these
pieces<00:00:28.500> together<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.070> make<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.429> chest<00:00:29.840> then

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
pieces together to make the chest then

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
stack on these for the back end now

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.319 
stack on these for the back end now
you'll<00:00:33.690> add<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> brick<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> middle<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
you'll add a brick to the middle and

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.430 
you'll add a brick to the middle and
something<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> top<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.899> connect<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> tail

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
something on the top to connect the tail

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.740 
something on the top to connect the tail
to<00:00:37.680> later<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.730> smoothen<00:00:39.149> out<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.270> top<00:00:39.570> with

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
to later then smoothen out the top with

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.979 
to later then smoothen out the top with
two<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> these<00:00:40.110> pieces<00:00:40.969> now<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.270> slide<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> rod

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
two of these pieces now just slide a rod

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
two of these pieces now just slide a rod
through<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.469> connect<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> legs<00:00:44.539> it<00:00:45.539> should

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
through to connect the legs it should

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
through to connect the legs it should
end<00:00:45.930> up<00:00:46.140> looking<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.460> onto<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
end up looking like this now onto the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.959 
end up looking like this now onto the
heads<00:00:48.680> each<00:00:49.680> head<00:00:50.039> shall<00:00:50.309> require<00:00:50.670> these

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
heads each head shall require these

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.729 
heads each head shall require these
pieces<00:00:53.449> begin<00:00:54.449> by<00:00:54.629> stacking<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.230> jaw<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
pieces begin by stacking the jaw in the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.979 
pieces begin by stacking the jaw in the
nose

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
nose

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.840 
nose
once<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.230> done<00:00:58.559> add<00:00:58.890> studs<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> sides

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
once that's done add studs to the sides

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.439 
once that's done add studs to the sides
of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> nose<00:01:01.579> now<00:01:02.579> you'll<00:01:02.789> need<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> add<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
of the nose now you'll need to add the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.830 
of the nose now you'll need to add the
cheeks<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> assemble<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> eyes<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.810> cheeks

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
cheeks and assemble the eyes the cheeks

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
cheeks and assemble the eyes the cheeks
go<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> attaching<00:01:08.790> stud<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
go on so that the attaching stud is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.789 
go on so that the attaching stud is
exactly<00:01:09.930> above<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.830> diagonal<00:01:11.430> opposite<00:01:12.030> stud

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
exactly above the diagonal opposite stud

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.710 
exactly above the diagonal opposite stud
now<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> where<00:01:14.369> things<00:01:14.640> split<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
now this is where things split the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
now this is where things split the
middle<00:01:16.020> head<00:01:16.229> will<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> 2<00:01:16.950> by<00:01:17.100> 2<00:01:17.159> brick
