00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
going to take a piece of hair from the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.930 
going to take a piece of hair from the
bottom<00:01:52.250> on<00:01:52.400> this<00:01:53.270> side<00:01:54.460> think<00:01:55.460> about<00:01:55.700> that

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
bottom on this side think about that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.830 
bottom on this side think about that
much<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.800> we're<00:01:58.580> going<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.820> put<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.570> bun

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
much and we're going to put the bun

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.740 
much and we're going to put the bun
inside<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:02.210> you're<00:02:02.300> going<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.450> have<00:02:02.570> to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
inside that so you're going to have to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
inside that so you're going to have to
move<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.080> around<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.560> little<00:02:03.590> bit<00:02:03.890> okay<00:02:05.770> stick

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
move it around a little bit okay stick

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.160 
move it around a little bit okay stick
it<00:02:06.920> in<00:02:07.100> there

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:22.140 

and<00:02:12.650> then<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.830> button

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.619 

and<00:02:23.800> that's<00:02:24.800> pretty<00:02:25.069> much<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.580> if<00:02:26.480> you

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
and that's pretty much it so if you

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.420 
and that's pretty much it so if you
don't<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> scrunchie<00:02:27.739> with<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.099> then
