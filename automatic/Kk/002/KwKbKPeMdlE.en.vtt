00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
accuracy 92s that's a little bit better

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.760

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.970 
that I was already using the super bowl
tom<00:04:53.940> brady<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.450> he<00:04:55.230> adds<00:04:55.410> an<00:04:55.560> addition<00:04:55.860> of

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
tom brady so he adds an addition of

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.500 
tom brady so he adds an addition of
speed<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.370> me<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:56.669> I'm<00:04:56.730> gonna<00:04:56.880> keep<00:04:57.120> him<00:04:57.330> for

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
speed to me so I'm gonna keep him for

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.510 
speed to me so I'm gonna keep him for
now<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:58.020> thought<00:04:58.440> he<00:04:58.560> would<00:04:58.680> be<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.830> bum<00:04:59.100> similar

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
now I thought he would be a bum similar

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.700 
now I thought he would be a bum similar
to<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.730> veteran<00:05:00.060> my<00:05:00.210> dick<00:05:00.480> just<00:05:00.870> 87<00:05:01.260> overall

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
to the veteran my dick just 87 overall

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.920 
to the veteran my dick just 87 overall
but<00:05:01.919> he's<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.130> lot<00:05:02.370> different<00:05:02.400> i<00:05:02.970> guess<00:05:03.630> that

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
but he's a lot different i guess that

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.780 
but he's a lot different i guess that
patch<00:05:04.110> accuracy<00:05:04.650> in<00:05:04.740> 92<00:05:05.130> has<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.370> lot<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.669> do

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
patch accuracy in 92 has a lot to do

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.980 
patch accuracy in 92 has a lot to do
with<00:05:05.820> that<00:05:06.030> even<00:05:06.240> though<00:05:06.419> his<00:05:06.540> deep<00:05:06.750> though

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
with that even though his deep though

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.560 
with that even though his deep though
all<00:05:07.290> is<00:05:07.530> 82<00:05:08.280> he<00:05:08.460> threw<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.700> ball<00:05:08.850> exactly<00:05:09.030> the

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570
