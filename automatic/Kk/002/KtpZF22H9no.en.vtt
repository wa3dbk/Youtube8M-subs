which<00:00:40.860> makes<00:00:41.100> sense<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> laptop<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.329> this

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
which makes sense for a laptop like this

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.139 
which makes sense for a laptop like this
but<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.950> you're<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> power<00:00:44.460> user<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.090> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
but if you're a power user and you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.660 
but if you're a power user and you
plugged<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.570> most<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.930> time<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
plugged in most of the time and you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.920 
plugged in most of the time and you
really<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> utilize<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> extra

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
really want to utilize the extra

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.470 
really want to utilize the extra
horsepower<00:00:49.520> there's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> way<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.090> turn<00:00:51.300> on

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
horsepower there's a way you can turn on

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.180 
horsepower there's a way you can turn on
that<00:00:51.629> graphics<00:00:52.050> card<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.379> keep<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that graphics card and keep it on so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.250 
that graphics card and keep it on so
it's<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:54.180> simple<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:55.110> head

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it's actually really simple so just head

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.790 
it's actually really simple so just head
up<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.039> battery<00:00:56.280> indicator<00:00:57.800> open

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
up here to your battery indicator open

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.630 
up here to your battery indicator open
energy<00:00:59.430> saver<00:00:59.730> preferences<00:01:01.340> then<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.489> see

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
energy saver preferences then you see

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.349 
energy saver preferences then you see
it's<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:03.030> here

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's right here

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.149 
it's right here
automatic<00:01:04.140> graphics<00:01:04.530> switching<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.530> box

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
automatic graphics switching so the box

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
automatic graphics switching so the box
is<00:01:08.340> by<00:01:08.640> default<00:01:08.909> checked<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.439> will<00:01:10.619> switch

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
is by default checked so it will switch

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
is by default checked so it will switch
between<00:01:11.100> graphics<00:01:11.729> cards<00:01:12.000> depending<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.570> if

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
between graphics cards depending on if

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
between graphics cards depending on if
it<00:01:12.869> needs<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.260> higher<00:01:13.439> performance<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.850> if

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it needs that higher performance but if

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.310 
it needs that higher performance but if
you<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.360> higher<00:01:15.540> performance<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.110> all

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you want that higher performance on all

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
you want that higher performance on all
the<00:01:16.470> time<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.920> uncheck<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> box<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the time just uncheck that box and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
the time just uncheck that box and
that's<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that's it that's how you get all the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.600 
that's it that's how you get all the
