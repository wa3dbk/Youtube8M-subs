this is the red color Ram and this is
the<00:01:25.710> green<00:01:25.920> color<00:01:26.220> round<00:01:26.460> I'll<00:01:26.939> swap<00:01:27.210> these

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the green color round I'll swap these

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.830 
the green color round I'll swap these
two<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.720> already<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.780> know

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
two out already and they you know

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.440 
two out already and they you know
everything<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.680> working<00:01:31.979> okay<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:33.329> now

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
everything was working okay and it now

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.060 
everything was working okay and it now
it<00:01:33.570> looks<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> one's<00:01:34.200> gone<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.530> well<00:01:34.680> so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it looks like this one's gone as well so

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.370 
it looks like this one's gone as well so
that's<00:01:35.490> great<00:01:35.759> I've<00:01:36.720> had<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> replace<00:01:37.200> these

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
that's great I've had to replace these

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.749 
that's great I've had to replace these
two<00:01:37.439> rounds<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.040> which<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.310> believe<00:01:38.549> with

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
two rounds here which I believe with

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.730 
two rounds here which I believe with
character<00:01:39.240> Rams<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.189> over<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:42.740> these

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
character Rams and then over here these

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310 
character Rams and then over here these
not<00:01:44.640> sure<00:01:44.790> exactly<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.420> these<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.140> what

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
not sure exactly what these I know what

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
not sure exactly what these I know what
these<00:01:46.439> rounds<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.939> see

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
these rounds are for that you can see

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.859 
these rounds are for that you can see
the<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:49.530> text<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.070> isn't<00:01:50.369> why

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the the text there isn't why

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.209 
the the text there isn't why
right<00:01:53.539> yeah<00:01:54.539> basically<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.200> another<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.189> of

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
right yeah basically it's another one of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.410 
right yeah basically it's another one of
those<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.000> power<00:01:57.179> I<00:01:57.210> haven't

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
those that's going on power I haven't

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.580 
those that's going on power I haven't
got<00:01:57.509> another<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> replace<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.409> at

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
got another one to replace it with at

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.880 
got another one to replace it with at
the<00:01:58.649> moment<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.780> yeah<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.319> mean<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.619> getting

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the moment but yeah I mean it's getting

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.319 
the moment but yeah I mean it's getting
there<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.039> suppose<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.880> kind<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.090> one

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
there I suppose but it's kind of one

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.789 
there I suppose but it's kind of one
step<00:02:03.539> forward<00:02:03.810> two<00:02:03.899> steps<00:02:04.319> back<00:02:04.409> at<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
step forward two steps back at the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.059 
step forward two steps back at the
moment<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.759> I've<00:02:06.090> ordered<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.420> parts<00:02:06.689> anyway

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
moment but I've ordered the parts anyway

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.609 
moment but I've ordered the parts anyway
so<00:02:08.069> once<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.479> parts<00:02:09.750> arrive<00:02:09.989> I'll<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.349> able<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
so once the parts arrive I'll be able to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.960 
so once the parts arrive I'll be able to
at<00:02:10.830> least<00:02:10.920> get<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.250> looking<00:02:11.700> correct<00:02:12.150> again

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
at least get it looking correct again

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.210 
at least get it looking correct again
but<00:02:14.970> yeah<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> think<00:02:16.019> before<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.709> happens<00:02:17.069> I'm

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
but yeah I think before that happens I'm

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.140 
but yeah I think before that happens I'm
probably<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.879> start<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
probably just going to start the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.199 
probably just going to start the
conversion<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.599> PC<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:20.099> feedback<00:02:20.580> I'm<00:02:21.000> not

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
conversion to PC the feedback I'm not

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.229 
conversion to PC the feedback I'm not
entirely<00:02:21.450> sure<00:02:21.540> what's<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:22.049> on<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
entirely sure what's going on there the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.940 
entirely sure what's going on there the
motor<00:02:24.690> drive<00:02:24.989> board<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.470> back<00:02:25.650> there

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
motor drive board in the back there

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.589 
motor drive board in the back there
apparently<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.910> doing<00:02:27.239> what<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.540> supposed

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
apparently is doing what it's supposed

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.699 
apparently is doing what it's supposed
to<00:02:28.019> do<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.810> little<00:02:31.019> brought<00:02:31.230> down<00:02:31.440> here

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
to do this little brought down here

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.470 
to do this little brought down here
again<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.130> supposed<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.579> apparently<00:02:33.180> doing

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
again is supposed to be apparently doing

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.660 
again is supposed to be apparently doing
what<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:33.720> supposed<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.989> be<00:02:34.079> doing<00:02:34.349> but<00:02:34.670> it's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
what it's supposed to be doing but it's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.390 
what it's supposed to be doing but it's
just<00:02:35.970> not<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.780> know<00:02:36.810> there's<00:02:37.110> no<00:02:37.400> resistance

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
just not you know there's no resistance

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.270 
just not you know there's no resistance
on<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.610> wheel<00:02:38.730> whatsoever<00:02:39.299> so<00:02:40.260> I'm<00:02:40.890> thinking

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
on the wheel whatsoever so I'm thinking

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.819 
on the wheel whatsoever so I'm thinking
screw<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> feedback<00:02:42.569> really<00:02:43.440> can't<00:02:43.769> be

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
screw the feedback really can't be

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.160 
screw the feedback really can't be
bothered<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.220> they're<00:02:44.870> just<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.019> go

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
bothered but they're just going to go

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.140 
bothered but they're just going to go
ahead<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.160> say<00:02:47.370> convert<00:02:47.700> over<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:47.970> PC

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
ahead and like I say convert over to PC

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.500 
ahead and like I say convert over to PC
I've<00:02:48.480> got<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:48.750> parts<00:02:49.049> now<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:50.299> you'll<00:02:51.299> get

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
I've got the parts now so you'll get

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.150 
I've got the parts now so you'll get
those<00:02:51.900> wheels<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.530> motion

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
those wheels in motion

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.809 
those wheels in motion
I've<00:02:53.849> got<00:02:54.060> taken<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.769> excuse<00:02:55.769> me<00:02:55.920> I've

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
I've got taken the excuse me I've

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.420 
I've got taken the excuse me I've
already<00:02:56.940> taken<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.239> cage<00:02:57.420> out<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.840> side

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
already taken the cage out of this side

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.470 
already taken the cage out of this side
so<00:02:59.430> then<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.760> can<00:03:00.079> plunk<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.260> PC<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.859> it<00:03:02.389> get<00:03:03.389> it

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
so then I can plunk a PC in it get it

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.879 
so then I can plunk a PC in it get it
all<00:03:03.569> wired<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.230> then<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.560> same<00:03:04.739> for

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
all wired up and then do the same for

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.099 
all wired up and then do the same for
this<00:03:05.010> side<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:06.510> I'm<00:03:06.569> gonna<00:03:06.660> wire<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.870> up<00:03:07.019> in

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
this side but I'm gonna wire it up in

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.729 
this side but I'm gonna wire it up in
such<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.349> way<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:07.799> can<00:03:07.980> still<00:03:08.250> plug<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.359> the

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
such a way that I can still plug in the

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.720 
such a way that I can still plug in the
original<00:03:10.739> main<00:03:10.889> boards<00:03:11.250> because<00:03:11.549> then

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
original main boards because then

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.610 
original main boards because then
obviously<00:03:11.870> once<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.019> parts<00:03:13.290> come<00:03:13.410> I'm<00:03:13.530> going

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
obviously once the parts come I'm going

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.460 
obviously once the parts come I'm going
to<00:03:13.709> want<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:14.209> repair<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.389> other<00:03:15.540> one<00:03:15.750> but<00:03:16.079> yeah

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
to want to repair the other one but yeah

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.050 
to want to repair the other one but yeah
I<00:03:16.500> guess<00:03:16.739> that's<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.130> for<00:03:17.160> now<00:03:17.370> pretty<00:03:17.880> much

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I guess that's it for now pretty much

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.300 
I guess that's it for now pretty much
the<00:03:18.299> only<00:03:18.660> update<00:03:19.200> I've<00:03:19.290> got<00:03:19.470> here<00:03:19.680> I've<00:03:20.130> got

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
the only update I've got here I've got

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.800 
the only update I've got here I've got
most<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.760> parts<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.090> need<00:03:21.120> now<00:03:21.419> I<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:21.569> need

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
most of the parts I need now I just need

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.750 
most of the parts I need now I just need
to<00:03:21.870> find<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.109> steering<00:03:22.470> wheel<00:03:22.500> for<00:03:22.829> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
to find a steering wheel for the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.539 
to find a steering wheel for the
right-hand<00:03:24.150> cab<00:03:24.470> or<00:03:25.470> left-hand<00:03:26.040> cabs<00:03:26.220> being

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
right-hand cab or left-hand cabs being

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.059 
right-hand cab or left-hand cabs being
on<00:03:26.639> which<00:03:26.760> one<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.940> decide<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.239> go<00:03:27.389> for<00:03:27.419> first

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
on which one I decide to go for first

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.349 
on which one I decide to go for first
but<00:03:29.069> yeah<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.459> guess<00:03:29.669> that's<00:03:29.849> pretty<00:03:30.030> much<00:03:30.150> it

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
but yeah I guess that's pretty much it

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:30.680 
but yeah I guess that's pretty much it
for<00:03:30.389> now

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
for now

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.979 
for now
so<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.700> promise<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> next<00:03:32.849> videos<00:03:33.269> not<00:03:33.780> going

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
so I promise the next videos not going

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.509 
so I promise the next videos not going
to<00:03:34.049> be<00:03:34.109> quite<00:03:34.349> so<00:03:35.599> not<00:03:36.599> so<00:03:36.840> today<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:37.889> fly<00:03:38.310> I

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
to be quite so not so today on the fly I

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.699 
to be quite so not so today on the fly I
guess<00:03:38.849> cuz<00:03:39.690> I'm<00:03:39.810> literally<00:03:40.109> just<00:03:40.230> recording

guess cuz I'm literally just recording

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.990 
guess cuz I'm literally just recording
this<00:03:40.799> on<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.220> played<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.519> straight<00:03:41.669> away<00:03:41.940> but
