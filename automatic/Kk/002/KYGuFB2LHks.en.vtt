around<00:00:18.779> i<00:00:19.199> think<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:19.590> around<00:00:19.680> halftime<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
around i think it's around halftime a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.670 
around i think it's around halftime a
little<00:00:20.520> bit<00:00:20.609> after<00:00:20.730> halftime<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.680> actually

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
little bit after halftime and actually

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.380 
little bit after halftime and actually
slowed<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.980> down<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.910> guys<00:00:24.119> could<00:00:24.269> go

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
slowed it down so you guys could go

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.470 
slowed it down so you guys could go
ahead<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.980> bull<00:00:26.609> fuckery<00:00:27.090> that
