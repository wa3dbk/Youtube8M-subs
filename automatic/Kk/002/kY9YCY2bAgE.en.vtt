00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
help of science if because today we

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.570 
help of science if because today we

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
science but because science is a

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.070 
science but because science is a
yardstick<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.880> unbelievers<00:03:59.390> atheist<00:03:59.900> I

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080
