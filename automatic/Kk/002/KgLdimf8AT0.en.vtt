that runs to the bottom of it that
doesn't<00:00:22.109> come<00:00:22.380> out<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.650> bottom<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.010> your

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
doesn't come out the bottom so your

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.980 
doesn't come out the bottom so your
poles<00:00:23.460> aren't<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> scrape<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
really proud of is the attachment system

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.459 
really proud of is the attachment system
it's<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> one-goal<00:00:59.250> attachment<00:01:00.090> system<00:01:00.469> what

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
it's a one-goal attachment system what

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
it's a one-goal attachment system what
you<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.489> take<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:03.120> pole<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it's a one hole system and it goes right

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.660 
it's a one hole system and it goes right
into<00:01:07.890> mallet<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:09.530> one<00:01:10.530> bolt<00:01:10.799> goes<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.520> on

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
into mallet and one bolt goes in here on

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
into mallet and one bolt goes in here on
this<00:01:11.790> side<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:13.020> there's<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> recessed

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
pocket for a lock not there so it's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.260 
pocket for a lock not there so it's
literally<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.530> tool<00:01:16.820> operation<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.150> can

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
