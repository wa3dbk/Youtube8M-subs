batteries<00:01:20.960> I<00:01:21.079> have<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.259> core<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:21.950> car<00:01:22.189> I

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
batteries I have a core of this car I

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.060 
batteries I have a core of this car I
think<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:23.149> battery<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:24.140> fact<00:01:24.439> one<00:01:24.860> of<00:01:24.890> our

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
think the battery is in fact one of our

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.620 
think the battery is in fact one of our
engineers<00:01:25.460> mentioned<00:01:25.939> that<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.329> a<00:01:26.420> four

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
engineers mentioned that this is a four

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.539 
engineers mentioned that this is a four
passenger<00:01:26.869> vehicle<00:01:27.649> but<00:01:28.070> there's<00:01:28.189> actually<00:01:28.340> a

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
passenger vehicle but there's actually a

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.950 
passenger vehicle but there's actually a
fifth<00:01:28.790> passenger<00:01:29.329> in<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.479> vehicle<00:01:29.600> which<00:01:29.930> is

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
fifth passenger in the vehicle which is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.780 
fifth passenger in the vehicle which is
the<00:01:30.439> battery<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.130> you've<00:01:31.250> got<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.579> think

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
the battery and you've got to think

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.310 
the battery and you've got to think
about<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:32.149> perspective<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:32.990> make<00:01:33.200> sure

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
about it that perspective to make sure

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.870 
about it that perspective to make sure
that<00:01:33.439> it's<00:01:33.619> cool<00:01:33.920> make<00:01:34.520> sure

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
that it's cool make sure

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.340 
that it's cool make sure
it's<00:01:35.030> at<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> right<00:01:35.479> temperature<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.170> we

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
it's at the right temperature so that we

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.530 
it's at the right temperature so that we
can<00:01:36.530> maximize<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.729> energy<00:01:38.119> from<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.509> battery

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
can maximize the energy from the battery

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.960 
can maximize the energy from the battery
in<00:01:39.110> order<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.470> propel<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.979> vehicle<00:01:40.009> now<00:01:40.909> the

metal hydride to where we are today with
lithium-ion<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:56.030> there's<00:01:56.180> still

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
lithium-ion and there's still

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.840 
lithium-ion and there's still
innovations<00:01:57.560> yet<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.070> come<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.789> know

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.820 
innovations yet to come you know
tomorrow<00:01:59.270> but<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.869> does<00:02:00.049> have<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.350> great

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
tomorrow but it does have a great

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.039 
tomorrow but it does have a great
opportunity<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.670> store<00:02:02.360> energy<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.990> the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
opportunity to store energy and the

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.779 
opportunity to store energy and the
energy<00:02:03.320> density<00:02:03.470> of<00:02:03.649> lithium-ion<00:02:04.220> is<00:02:04.549> a<00:02:04.580> lot

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
energy density of lithium-ion is a lot

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.120 
energy density of lithium-ion is a lot
better<00:02:05.000> than<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.270> ones<00:02:05.479> previous<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.470> so

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
better than the ones previous to that so

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.070 
better than the ones previous to that so
there<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.670> mechanism<00:02:07.970> by<00:02:08.330> which<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.780> do<00:02:08.929> it

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
there is a mechanism by which to do it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.840 
there is a mechanism by which to do it
and<00:02:09.350> we<00:02:09.920> think<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:10.250> ready<00:02:10.459> for<00:02:10.550> production

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
and we think it's ready for production

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.150 
and we think it's ready for production
now<00:02:11.840> bought<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> lot<00:02:12.350> of<00:02:12.440> works<00:02:12.620> gone<00:02:12.739> into

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
attached to the car so you had to make

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.150 
attached to the car so you had to make
sure<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.930> design<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.380> surface<00:02:27.799> in<00:02:27.950> such<00:02:28.130> a

sure you design the surface in such a

sure you design the surface in such a

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
turbulence of drag but it'd be very

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.800 
turbulence of drag but it'd be very
simple<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.709> just<00:02:36.769> design<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.549> pill-shaped<00:02:38.120> and

for<00:02:39.110> efficiency<00:02:39.730> we're<00:02:40.730> designers<00:02:41.060> so

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
for efficiency we're designers so

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.840

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.009 
styling why is the car still has to look
good<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.329> have<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.540> think<00:02:44.690> about<00:02:44.780> things

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
good so you have to think about things

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.949 
good so you have to think about things

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
be put in place also a big part of this

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.550 
be put in place also a big part of this
program<00:03:32.240> is<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.480> cost<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:32.990> vehicle<00:03:33.140> and

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
program is the cost of the vehicle and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.350 
program is the cost of the vehicle and
to<00:03:33.860> make<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.070> more<00:03:34.250> appealing<00:03:34.670> again<00:03:35.120> because

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
to make it more appealing again because

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.600 
to make it more appealing again because
we're<00:03:35.570> intending<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.410> get<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.650> thing<00:03:36.860> into

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
we're intending to get this thing into

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.070 
we're intending to get this thing into
very<00:03:37.910> mass<00:03:38.180> production<00:03:38.780> make<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:38.990> more

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
very mass production make it more

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.390 
very mass production make it more
appealing<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.530> consumers<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.070> means<00:03:40.190> we<00:03:40.280> kind

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
appealing to consumers it means we kind

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.550 
appealing to consumers it means we kind
of<00:03:40.459> gets<00:03:40.580> cost<00:03:40.790> down<00:03:41.030> one<00:03:41.660> way<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.140> look<00:03:42.410> at

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
of gets cost down one way is to look at

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.130 
of gets cost down one way is to look at
incentives<00:03:42.980> what<00:03:43.520> can<00:03:43.760> local<00:03:44.570> communities<00:03:44.990> do

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
incentives what can local communities do

miles<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.590> we're<00:03:54.860> working<00:03:54.950> very<00:03:55.130> carefully

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
miles so we're working very carefully

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.670 
miles so we're working very carefully
with<00:03:55.790> these<00:03:55.910> communities<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:57.350> work<00:03:57.530> on

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
and then this public charging

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.420 
and then this public charging
infrastructure<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.500> should<00:04:03.950> be<00:04:04.040> set<00:04:04.280> up

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
infrastructure that should be set up

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.190 
infrastructure that should be set up
again<00:04:04.610> it's<00:04:04.850> not<00:04:05.000> really<00:04:05.570> critical<00:04:05.959> on<00:04:06.080> day

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
again it's not really critical on day

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.080 
again it's not really critical on day
one<00:04:06.440> but<00:04:06.830> some<00:04:07.070> of<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.250> goes<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.459> long<00:04:07.760> way<00:04:08.030> to

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
one but some of that goes a long way to

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.610 
one but some of that goes a long way to
making<00:04:08.300> people<00:04:08.660> feel<00:04:08.810> comfortable<00:04:09.020> but

probably isn't a car that I'm looking
forward<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.630> driving<00:04:14.840> more<00:04:15.290> than<00:04:15.320> this<00:04:15.709> one<00:04:15.920> if

forward to driving more than this one if
GM<00:04:16.880> gets<00:04:17.120> his<00:04:17.269> car<00:04:17.510> right<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.959> could<00:04:18.109> be<00:04:18.140> a<00:04:18.229> real
