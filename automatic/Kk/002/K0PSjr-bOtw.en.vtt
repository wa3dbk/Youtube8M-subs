was<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.280> good<00:00:58.489> evaluation<00:00:58.699> for<00:00:59.329> us<00:00:59.420> going<00:01:00.140> in<00:01:00.320> to

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
was a good evaluation for us going in to

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.630 
was a good evaluation for us going in to
see<00:01:00.649> a<00:01:00.680> different<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.730> different<00:01:02.350> color<00:01:03.610> see<00:01:04.610> a

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
see a different a different color see a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.039 
see a different a different color see a
different<00:01:04.970> opponent<00:01:05.239> our<00:01:05.570> guys<00:01:05.750> were

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
different opponent our guys were

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.109 
different opponent our guys were
probably<00:01:06.950> tired<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.549> beating<00:01:07.700> up<00:01:07.880> on<00:01:08.090> each

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
probably tired of beating up on each

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.710 
probably tired of beating up on each
other<00:01:08.420> all<00:01:08.600> week<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:09.290> think<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:10.720> twenties

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
other all week but I think that twenties

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.510 
other all week but I think that twenties
group<00:01:12.020> overall<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.860> second<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.340> third

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
group overall the second and third

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.630 
group overall the second and third
really<00:01:14.360> gave<00:01:14.540> us<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.960> game<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.830> we<00:01:16.280> can<00:01:16.460> go

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
really gave us a game that we can go

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.399 
really gave us a game that we can go
away<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.119> look<00:01:17.390> at<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.600> film<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.020> try<00:01:18.290> to

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
away and look at the film and try to

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.350 
away and look at the film and try to
evaluate<00:01:18.649> where<00:01:19.130> our<00:01:19.250> guys<00:01:19.430> are<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:19.940> we

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
evaluate where our guys are so we

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.149 
evaluate where our guys are so we
appreciate<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:21.050> was<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.380> thought<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:21.979> was<00:01:22.100> a

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
appreciate that was I thought it was a

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.340 
appreciate that was I thought it was a
pretty<00:01:22.399> good<00:01:22.550> tilt<00:01:22.880> overall<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.630> think<00:01:24.229> was

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
pretty good tilt overall I think was

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.270 
pretty good tilt overall I think was
pretty<00:01:24.530> good<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:24.800> was<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> little<00:01:25.070> bit<00:01:25.159> awkward

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
pretty good it was a little bit awkward

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.580 
pretty good it was a little bit awkward

it's always a little bit a little bit

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.060 
it's always a little bit a little bit
odd<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.840> know<00:01:32.960> jumping<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.740> playing<00:01:33.950> with

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
you know build some chemistry maybe a

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.340 
you know build some chemistry maybe a
couple<00:01:37.550> passes<00:01:37.700> were<00:01:38.090> off<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.869> know<00:01:38.929> I<00:01:38.990> led

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
couple passes were off you know I led

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.529 
couple passes were off you know I led
talked<00:01:39.619> on<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.800> few<00:01:40.039> passes<00:01:40.399> where<00:01:40.550> I'm<00:01:41.450> you

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
talked on a few passes where I'm you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.700 
talked on a few passes where I'm you
know<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.630> should<00:01:41.810> have<00:01:41.840> put<00:01:42.020> on<00:01:42.110> his<00:01:42.229> tape<00:01:42.440> or

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
know I should have put on his tape or

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.219 
know I should have put on his tape or
maybe<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:42.950> little<00:01:43.220> behind<00:01:43.520> him<00:01:43.700> or<00:01:44.000> but<00:01:44.899> I<00:01:45.050> think

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
maybe a little behind him or but I think

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.480 
maybe a little behind him or but I think
overall<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.770> was<00:01:45.860> really<00:01:46.070> good<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.399> know

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
overall it was really good you know

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.609 
overall it was really good you know
there's<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.789> there's<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.929> lot<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.140> skill<00:01:48.350> on<00:01:48.470> that

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
there's a there's a lot of skill on that

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.230 
there's a there's a lot of skill on that
team<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:48.979> think<00:01:49.159> we<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.700> created<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.060> lot<00:01:50.179> of

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
team I think we we created a lot of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.760 
team I think we we created a lot of
offense<00:01:50.630> definitely<00:01:51.110> areas<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.440> our<00:01:51.530> game<00:01:51.679> we

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
offense definitely areas of our game we

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.800 
offense definitely areas of our game we
need<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.920> clean<00:01:52.130> up<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:53.240> know<00:01:53.330> I<00:01:53.360> think<00:01:53.659> we

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
need to clean up and you know I think we

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.999 
need to clean up and you know I think we
could<00:01:53.869> be<00:01:53.960> quicker<00:01:54.170> on<00:01:54.259> our<00:01:54.409> changes<00:01:54.800> better

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
could be quicker on our changes better

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.889 
could be quicker on our changes better
awareness<00:01:55.759> on<00:01:56.060> face<00:01:56.240> off<00:01:56.420> just<00:01:56.690> things<00:01:56.840> like

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
awareness on face off just things like

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.779 
awareness on face off just things like
that<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.170> little<00:01:58.130> break<00:01:58.310> downs<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:58.640> led<00:01:58.759> to

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
that that little break downs that led to

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.850 
that that little break downs that led to
goals<00:01:59.030> for<00:01:59.240> them<00:01:59.360> but<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.810> think<00:02:00.229> overall<00:02:00.740> I

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
goals for them but I think overall I

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.229 
goals for them but I think overall I
mean<00:02:01.190> we<00:02:01.369> wanted<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.670> go<00:02:01.729> out<00:02:01.819> there<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.060> put

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
mean we wanted to go out there and put

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.300 
mean we wanted to go out there and put
at<00:02:02.330> least<00:02:02.390> 40<00:02:02.780> shots<00:02:02.959> on<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.289> on<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.950> net<00:02:04.099> and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
at least 40 shots on the on the net and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.770 
at least 40 shots on the on the net and
we<00:02:04.580> did<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.910> and<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.090> wanted<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.420> hold<00:02:05.509> him<00:02:05.630> to

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
we did that and we wanted to hold him to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.930 
we did that and we wanted to hold him to
around<00:02:05.959> 20<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:06.349> did<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.099> mean<00:02:07.849> I<00:02:07.880> think

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
around 20 we did that so I mean I think

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.910 
around 20 we did that so I mean I think
it<00:02:08.119> was<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.270> good<00:02:08.390> game<00:02:08.539> we<00:02:09.259> certainly<00:02:09.649> get<00:02:09.770> an

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
it was a good game we certainly get an

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.589 
it was a good game we certainly get an
indication<00:02:10.250> where<00:02:10.849> some<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.300> chemistry

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
indication where some of the chemistry

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.350 
indication where some of the chemistry
is<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:13.010> felt<00:02:13.250> good<00:02:13.400> about<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.730> couple<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.150> lines

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
is we felt good about a couple of lines

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.309 
is we felt good about a couple of lines
anyway<00:02:15.459> obviously<00:02:16.459> Jack's<00:02:17.390> line<00:02:17.690> has<00:02:18.080> been

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
anyway obviously Jack's line has been

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.100 
anyway obviously Jack's line has been
together<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:19.370> been<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.640> same<00:02:19.819> group<00:02:20.150> coming

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
together it's been the same group coming

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.410 
together it's been the same group coming
out<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.379> Lake<00:02:21.500> Placid<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.489> they'd<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:22.790> really

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
out of Lake Placid and they'd be really

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.970 
out of Lake Placid and they'd be really
the<00:02:23.540> best<00:02:23.720> thing<00:02:23.930> about<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.319> line<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.800> that

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
the best thing about that line is that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.380 
the best thing about that line is that
when<00:02:25.250> they're<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.580> bench<00:02:25.819> they're

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
when they're on the bench they're

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.600 
when they're on the bench they're
talking<00:02:26.810> about<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.920> starts<00:02:28.220> with<00:02:28.340> Jack

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
talking about it and it starts with Jack

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.449 
talking about it and it starts with Jack
Jack<00:02:29.060> does<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.300> great<00:02:29.540> job<00:02:29.920> speaking<00:02:30.920> almost

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
they like playing together they had

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.729 
they like playing together they had
great<00:02:49.550> jump<00:02:49.819> their<00:02:50.750> little<00:02:51.110> buzz<00:02:51.260> saws<00:02:51.500> out

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
great jump their little buzz saws out

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.250 
great jump their little buzz saws out
there<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.129> did<00:02:52.580> very<00:02:52.790> well<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:53.209> mean<00:02:53.660> there's

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
there and did very well I mean there's

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.110 
there and did very well I mean there's
great<00:02:54.530> leadership<00:02:54.860> qualities<00:02:55.010> with<00:02:55.910> this

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
great leadership qualities with this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.930 
great leadership qualities with this
group<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.690> think<00:02:57.140> that's<00:02:57.530> been<00:02:57.709> unique<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
group I think that's been unique in the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.309 
group I think that's been unique in the
three<00:02:59.180> tournaments<00:02:59.629> that<00:02:59.720> I've<00:02:59.840> been<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.050> part

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
three tournaments that I've been a part

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.100 
three tournaments that I've been a part
of<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.620> past

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
of in the past

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.020 
of in the past
is<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.860> really<00:03:02.100> comes<00:03:02.310> down<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.730> Greek

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
is it really comes down to a Greek

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.910 
is it really comes down to a Greek
character<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.960> then<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> leadership<00:03:04.530> and

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
character and then the leadership and

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.730 
character and then the leadership and
it's<00:03:05.220> not<00:03:05.340> just<00:03:05.580> one<00:03:05.760> leader<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.720> it's<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.290> group

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
it's not just one leader so it's a group

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.950 
it's not just one leader so it's a group
of<00:03:07.950> leaders<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:08.550> do<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.300> good<00:03:09.570> group

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.980 
of leaders and we do have a good group
in<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.290> locker<00:03:10.530> room<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:11.040> leaders<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.630> like

very creative in the offensive zone I
mean<00:06:00.869> our<00:06:00.989> probably<00:06:01.589> our<00:06:01.709> best<00:06:01.949> defense<00:06:02.369> is

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:02.549 
mean our probably our best defense is

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:06.079 
mean our probably our best defense is
going<00:06:02.699> to<00:06:02.759> be<00:06:02.849> having<00:06:03.509> the<00:06:03.599> puck<00:06:03.779> and<00:06:04.909> that<00:06:05.909> is
