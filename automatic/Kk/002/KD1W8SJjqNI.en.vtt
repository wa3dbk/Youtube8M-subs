00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
want to draw a little circle on here and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.739 
want to draw a little circle on here and
then<00:00:49.190> using<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.850> pencil<00:00:50.120> or<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:51.260> pen<00:00:51.289> just<00:00:52.300> draw<00:00:53.300> a

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
then using a pencil or a pen just draw a

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:58.360 
then using a pencil or a pen just draw a
spiral<00:00:54.559> on<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:56.120> leather<00:00:56.769> and<00:00:57.769> starting<00:00:58.249> from

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
spiral on that leather and starting from

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.090 
spiral on that leather and starting from
the<00:00:58.460> middle<00:00:58.640> or<00:00:59.620> actually<00:01:00.620> started<00:01:00.890> from<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
the middle or actually started from the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.439 
the middle or actually started from the
outside<00:01:01.429> would<00:01:01.550> be<00:01:01.579> a<00:01:01.760> little<00:01:02.030> bit<00:01:02.120> better<00:01:02.210> for

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
outside would be a little bit better for

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.250 
outside would be a little bit better for
this<00:01:02.570> one<00:01:02.749> just<00:01:02.929> kind<00:01:03.679> of<00:01:03.769> trim<00:01:04.100> all<00:01:05.000> around

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260

this one just kind of trim all around
that<00:01:06.260> spiral<00:01:07.570> until<00:01:08.570> I<00:01:09.370> could<00:01:10.370> pull<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.700> out

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
that spiral until I could pull it out

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.920 
that spiral until I could pull it out
and<00:01:11.090> have<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:12.110> nice<00:01:12.830> little<00:01:13.010> strip<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:14.720> usually
