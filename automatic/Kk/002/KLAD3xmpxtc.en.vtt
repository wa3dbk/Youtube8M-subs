00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
fingerprint scanner like the one found

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.230 
fingerprint scanner like the one found

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
this fingerprint scanner will be twice

this fingerprint scanner will be twice

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
me a fingerprint scanner isn't something

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.870 
me a fingerprint scanner isn't something
that<00:01:57.390> i<00:01:57.540> look<00:01:57.869> forward<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.829> phone<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that i look forward to in a phone it's a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.209 
that i look forward to in a phone it's a
nice<00:02:00.060> feature<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.899> secure<00:02:01.320> fast<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
nice feature and it's secure fast and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.910 
nice feature and it's secure fast and
easy<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.299> use<00:02:03.329> maybe<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.860> not

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
easy to use maybe but it's just not

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.530 
easy to use maybe but it's just not
something<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.490> i<00:02:05.520> usually<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.060> excited

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
something that i usually get excited

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.570 
something that i usually get excited
about<00:02:06.659> when<00:02:06.960> i'm<00:02:07.079> buying<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.560> phone<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.369> i'm

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
about when i'm buying a phone but i'm

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.949 
about when i'm buying a phone but i'm
sure<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> lot<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.149> people<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.569> find<00:02:09.810> it

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
sure that a lot of people will find it

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.809 
sure that a lot of people will find it
to<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
to be a

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.520 
to be a
really<00:02:10.939> nice<00:02:11.060> addition<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.780> one<00:02:12.019> plus<00:02:12.260> two

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
really nice addition to the one plus two

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.989 
really nice addition to the one plus two
but<00:02:12.859> if<00:02:13.040> you're<00:02:13.189> someone<00:02:13.459> who<00:02:13.609> uses<00:02:13.819> a

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:13.999 
but if you're someone who uses a

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.000 
but if you're someone who uses a
fingerprint<00:02:14.659> scanner<00:02:14.719> on<00:02:15.109> a<00:02:15.139> daily<00:02:15.409> basis

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
fingerprint scanner on a daily basis

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.530 
fingerprint scanner on a daily basis
then<00:02:16.189> you<00:02:16.310> should<00:02:16.459> definitely<00:02:16.609> be<00:02:17.060> excited

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
then you should definitely be excited

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.509 
then you should definitely be excited
for<00:02:17.749> this<00:02:17.870> one<00:02:18.409> plus<00:02:18.620> promises<00:02:19.189> a<00:02:19.219> lot<00:02:19.430> of

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
for this one plus promises a lot of

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.250 
for this one plus promises a lot of
great<00:02:19.730> things<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.359> and<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.049> physical

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
great things for it and it's a physical

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.050 
great things for it and it's a physical
scanner<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:22.040> it'll<00:02:22.189> definitely<00:02:22.400> work<00:02:22.670> better

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
scanner so it'll definitely work better

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.119 
scanner so it'll definitely work better
than<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.719> virtual<00:02:24.139> one<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.560> number<00:02:24.680> four<00:02:24.950> is

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
than a virtual one and number four is

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.309 
than a virtual one and number four is
the<00:02:25.310> battery<00:02:25.670> size<00:02:25.969> so<00:02:26.389> the<00:02:26.480> oneplus<00:02:26.810> one<00:02:26.959> has

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
the battery size so the oneplus one has

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.589 
the battery size so the oneplus one has
a<00:02:27.590> 3100<00:02:28.370> milliamp<00:02:28.760> hour<00:02:28.879> battery<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.540> is

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
a 3100 milliamp hour battery that is

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.470 
a 3100 milliamp hour battery that is
fantastic<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.889> oneplus<00:02:31.250> one<00:02:31.310> has<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:32.299> of<00:02:32.389> the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
fantastic the oneplus one has one of the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.330 
fantastic the oneplus one has one of the
best<00:02:32.689> battery<00:02:32.959> lives<00:02:33.319> I've<00:02:33.530> seen<00:02:33.829> in<00:02:34.069> any

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
best battery lives I've seen in any

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.729 
best battery lives I've seen in any
phone<00:02:34.609> period<00:02:35.329> so<00:02:36.139> the<00:02:36.260> one<00:02:36.379> plus<00:02:36.530> two<00:02:36.709> is

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
phone period so the one plus two is

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.490 
phone period so the one plus two is
rumored<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.400> have<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.989> 3300<00:02:38.989> milliamp<00:02:39.379> hour

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
rumored to have a 3300 milliamp hour

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500 
rumored to have a 3300 milliamp hour
battery<00:02:39.530> which<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.519> obviously<00:02:40.939> slightly

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
battery which is obviously slightly

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.899 
battery which is obviously slightly
larger<00:02:42.019> so<00:02:42.499> we're<00:02:42.620> probably<00:02:42.859> going<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.489> see<00:02:43.700> a

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
larger so we're probably going to see a

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.569 
larger so we're probably going to see a
pretty<00:02:44.299> good<00:02:44.480> battery<00:02:44.810> life<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.620> 1+2<00:02:46.219> now

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
pretty good battery life on the 1+2 now

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.860 
pretty good battery life on the 1+2 now
some<00:02:46.849> rumors<00:02:47.090> have<00:02:47.269> been<00:02:47.359> saying<00:02:47.629> that<00:02:47.750> the

some rumors have been saying that the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.740 
some rumors have been saying that the
one<00:02:48.049> poster<00:02:48.409> will<00:02:48.590> have<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.799> slightly<00:02:49.219> larger

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
one poster will have a slightly larger

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.050 
one poster will have a slightly larger
5.7<00:02:50.750> inch<00:02:50.870> quad<00:02:51.290> HD<00:02:51.319> display<00:02:51.680> which<00:02:52.459> could

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
5.7 inch quad HD display which could

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.789 
5.7 inch quad HD display which could
technically<00:02:53.449> affect<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.930> battery<00:02:54.230> life<00:02:54.439> but

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
technically affect the battery life but

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.429 
technically affect the battery life but
honestly<00:02:55.489> 3,300<00:02:56.299> milliamp<00:02:56.599> hours<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.109> a<00:02:57.139> lot

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
honestly 3,300 milliamp hours is a lot

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.289 
honestly 3,300 milliamp hours is a lot
of<00:02:57.500> battery<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.159> it's<00:02:58.639> also<00:02:58.790> being<00:02:59.030> paired

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
of battery and it's also being paired

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.659 
of battery and it's also being paired
with<00:02:59.389> the<00:02:59.540> Snapdragon<00:03:00.230> 810<00:03:00.530> processor<00:03:00.739> which

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
with the Snapdragon 810 processor which

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.550 
with the Snapdragon 810 processor which
is<00:03:01.849> not<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.269> great<00:03:02.449> on<00:03:02.659> battery<00:03:03.019> life<00:03:03.230> but

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
is not so great on battery life but

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.959 
is not so great on battery life but
hopefully<00:03:03.919> they'll<00:03:04.129> work<00:03:04.370> on<00:03:04.549> it<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:04.939> just

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
hopefully they'll work on it and just

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.209 
hopefully they'll work on it and just
make<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.689> better<00:03:05.930> version<00:03:06.199> of<00:03:06.469> this<00:03:06.680> processor

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219 
make a better version of this processor

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.670 
make a better version of this processor
for<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.120> oneplus<00:03:08.569> two<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.109> number<00:03:09.230> three<00:03:09.349> we

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
for the oneplus two and number three we

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.369 
for the oneplus two and number three we
have<00:03:09.859> a<00:03:10.040> USB<00:03:10.340> type-c<00:03:10.849> connection<00:03:11.780> now<00:03:12.109> this<00:03:12.319> is

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
have a USB type-c connection now this is

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.599 
have a USB type-c connection now this is
something<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.919> I<00:03:12.980> think<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.340> lot<00:03:13.489> of<00:03:13.519> people

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
something that I think a lot of people

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.330 
something that I think a lot of people
don't<00:03:14.030> really<00:03:14.269> care<00:03:14.540> about<00:03:14.659> but<00:03:15.079> honestly<00:03:15.829> USB

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
don't really care about but honestly USB

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.599 
don't really care about but honestly USB
type-c<00:03:16.639> is<00:03:17.090> apparently<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.409> future<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:19.069> USB

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
type-c is apparently the future of USB

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.509 
type-c is apparently the future of USB
it's<00:03:19.879> a<00:03:20.090> far<00:03:20.419> more<00:03:20.689> efficient<00:03:21.259> way<00:03:21.439> of

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
it's a far more efficient way of

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.129 
it's a far more efficient way of
connecting<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.239> powering<00:03:23.569> your<00:03:23.689> device

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
connecting and just powering your device

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.110 
connecting and just powering your device
in<00:03:24.349> general<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:25.220> also<00:03:25.430> has<00:03:25.669> a<00:03:25.699> couple<00:03:26.030> of

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
in general it also has a couple of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.369 
in general it also has a couple of
really<00:03:26.269> nice<00:03:26.509> features<00:03:26.569> like<00:03:27.199> it's

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
really nice features like it's

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.770 
really nice features like it's
reversible<00:03:27.949> it's<00:03:28.280> backwards<00:03:29.000> compatible<00:03:29.599> and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
reversible it's backwards compatible and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.289 
reversible it's backwards compatible and
one<00:03:30.379> plus<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.829> working<00:03:31.220> on<00:03:31.340> adding<00:03:31.699> even<00:03:32.030> more

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
one plus is working on adding even more

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.780 
one plus is working on adding even more
features<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.680> this<00:03:33.799> connection<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.549> the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
features to this connection on the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.849 
features to this connection on the
oneplus<00:03:35.209> 2<00:03:35.509> and<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.229> this<00:03:36.379> makes<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.709> one

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
oneplus 2 and so this makes the one

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.439 
oneplus 2 and so this makes the one
close<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.099> one<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.579> few<00:03:37.819> phones<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.329> the

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
close to one of the few phones in the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.020 
close to one of the few phones in the
world<00:03:38.479> to<00:03:38.900> have<00:03:39.079> a<00:03:39.290> USB<00:03:39.650> type-c<00:03:40.129> connection

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
world to have a USB type-c connection

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.749 
world to have a USB type-c connection
and<00:03:41.239> one<00:03:41.720> plus<00:03:41.989> also<00:03:42.560> confirm<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.220> rumor<00:03:43.579> for

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:43.759 
and one plus also confirm this rumor for

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.330 
and one plus also confirm this rumor for
sure<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.180> we<00:03:44.299> do<00:03:44.509> know<00:03:44.720> absolutely<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.680> the

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
sure so we do know absolutely that the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.219 
sure so we do know absolutely that the
one<00:03:46.489> poster<00:03:46.849> will<00:03:47.000> have<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.449> USB<00:03:47.780> type-c

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:48.229 
one poster will have a USB type-c

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:50.409 
one poster will have a USB type-c
connection<00:03:49.069> now<00:03:49.549> it's<00:03:49.699> also<00:03:49.909> backwards

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
connection now it's also backwards

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.270 
connection now it's also backwards
compatible<00:03:50.989> which<00:03:51.139> is<00:03:51.290> really<00:03:51.530> nice<00:03:51.769> because

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
compatible which is really nice because

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.580 
compatible which is really nice because
people<00:03:52.759> who<00:03:52.879> have<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.329> one<00:03:53.599> plus<00:03:53.750> one<00:03:53.930> like<00:03:54.319> me

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
people who have a one plus one like me

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.670 
people who have a one plus one like me
can<00:03:55.099> still<00:03:55.370> use<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:55.879> USB<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.989> regular<00:03:57.379> USB

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
can still use the USB the regular USB

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.580 
can still use the USB the regular USB
cord<00:03:58.189> and<00:03:58.430> power<00:03:58.879> the<00:03:59.180> oneplus<00:03:59.569> 2<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.079> my<00:04:00.349> top

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
cord and power the oneplus 2 and my top

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.949 
cord and power the oneplus 2 and my top
second<00:04:00.979> rumored<00:04:01.250> feature<00:04:01.459> is<00:04:01.819> the<00:04:01.849> camera<00:04:02.599> so

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
second rumored feature is the camera so

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.110 
second rumored feature is the camera so
the<00:04:03.049> camera<00:04:03.349> on<00:04:03.379> the<00:04:03.590> one<00:04:03.709> plus<00:04:03.949> one<00:04:04.069> is<00:04:04.250> okay

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the camera on the one plus one is okay

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.990 
the camera on the one plus one is okay
it's<00:04:05.509> actually<00:04:05.629> good<00:04:06.139> not<00:04:06.530> bad<00:04:06.739> at<00:04:06.949> all<00:04:07.069> but<00:04:07.819> it

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
it's actually good not bad at all but it

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.300 
it's actually good not bad at all but it
definitely<00:04:08.239> could<00:04:08.659> be<00:04:08.719> improved<00:04:09.139> I<00:04:09.530> shoots<00:04:10.009> 4k

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
definitely could be improved I shoots 4k

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.129 
definitely could be improved I shoots 4k
which<00:04:10.519> is<00:04:10.849> really<00:04:11.030> nice<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.449> it<00:04:11.569> has<00:04:11.689> 13

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
which is really nice and it has 13

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.619 
which is really nice and it has 13
megapixels<00:04:12.859> and<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.879> one<00:04:14.060> poster<00:04:14.449> will

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
megapixels and the one poster will

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.990 
megapixels and the one poster will
apparently<00:04:15.019> have<00:04:15.229> a<00:04:15.409> 16<00:04:15.949> megapixel<00:04:16.070> bump<00:04:16.729> and

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
apparently have a 16 megapixel bump and

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.330 
apparently have a 16 megapixel bump and
an<00:04:17.449> 8<00:04:17.599> megapixel<00:04:17.750> front-facing<00:04:18.469> camera<00:04:19.159> and

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
an 8 megapixel front-facing camera and

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.289 
an 8 megapixel front-facing camera and
it<00:04:19.729> will<00:04:19.849> still<00:04:20.090> be<00:04:20.209> able<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.449> shoot<00:04:20.719> 4k

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
it will still be able to shoot 4k

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.149 
it will still be able to shoot 4k
video<00:04:21.539> which<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.900> really<00:04:22.259> great<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.830> camera

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
video which is really great the camera

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.860 
video which is really great the camera
on<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.430> one<00:04:23.610> also<00:04:23.970> didn't<00:04:24.270> have<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.629> best

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
on the one also didn't have the best

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.990 
on the one also didn't have the best
low-light<00:04:25.379> performance<00:04:25.409> and<00:04:26.310> intended<00:04:26.789> to

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
low-light performance and intended to

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.140 
low-light performance and intended to
sort<00:04:27.569> of<00:04:27.659> over<00:04:27.960> expose<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.830> over<00:04:29.550> saturate

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
sort of over expose and over saturate

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.730 
sort of over expose and over saturate
some<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.599> colors<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.229> we're<00:04:31.379> hoping<00:04:31.680> that

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
some of the colors so we're hoping that

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.950 
some of the colors so we're hoping that
the<00:04:32.490> camera<00:04:32.789> on<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:33.060> two<00:04:33.270> will<00:04:33.509> definitely

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
the camera on the two will definitely

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.740 
the camera on the two will definitely
fix<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:34.770> we<00:04:35.460> still<00:04:35.909> don't<00:04:36.210> know<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.389> whole

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
fix that but we still don't know a whole

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.379 
fix that but we still don't know a whole
lot<00:04:36.810> about<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.409> camera<00:04:37.770> on<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.220> 21<00:04:39.150> plus

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
lot about the camera on the 21 plus

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.059 
lot about the camera on the 21 plus
hasn't<00:04:39.750> really<00:04:39.930> set<00:04:40.139> a<00:04:40.319> whole<00:04:40.560> lot<00:04:40.770> about<00:04:40.919> it

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
hasn't really set a whole lot about it

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.580 
hasn't really set a whole lot about it
but<00:04:41.460> we're<00:04:41.909> just<00:04:41.970> hoping<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.629> have<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.169> better

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
but we're just hoping to have a better

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.649 
but we're just hoping to have a better
camera<00:04:43.979> that<00:04:44.430> shoots<00:04:44.639> slightly<00:04:45.449> better

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
camera that shoots slightly better

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.719 
camera that shoots slightly better
pictures<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.349> videos<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.159> finally<00:04:47.610> the

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
pictures and videos and finally the

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.399 
pictures and videos and finally the
feature<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.210> i'm<00:04:48.300> most<00:04:48.449> excited<00:04:48.659> about<00:04:49.080> on

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
feature that i'm most excited about on

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.589 
feature that i'm most excited about on
the<00:04:49.560> one<00:04:49.740> plus<00:04:50.009> two<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:50.280> an<00:04:50.639> all<00:04:50.819> metal<00:04:51.060> design

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
the one plus two is an all metal design

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.110 
the one plus two is an all metal design
so<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.319> one<00:04:52.470> post<00:04:52.710> one<00:04:52.800> feels<00:04:53.220> fantastic<00:04:53.520> in

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
so the one post one feels fantastic in

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.570 
so the one post one feels fantastic in
the<00:04:54.180> hand<00:04:54.419> it<00:04:54.629> has<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:55.199> sandstone<00:04:56.159> sort<00:04:56.490> of

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
the hand it has a sandstone sort of

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.010 
the hand it has a sandstone sort of
texture<00:04:56.940> on<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.150> bag<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.509> feels<00:04:57.719> really

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
texture on the bag that feels really

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.529 
texture on the bag that feels really
grippy<00:04:58.379> and<00:04:58.590> really<00:04:59.099> natural<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.699> hold<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.240> I

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
grippy and really natural to hold and I

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.360 
grippy and really natural to hold and I
really<00:05:00.810> like<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.020> but<00:05:01.979> an<00:05:02.069> all<00:05:02.219> metal

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
really like that but an all metal

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.300 
really like that but an all metal
chassis<00:05:02.940> would<00:05:03.210> be<00:05:03.360> fantastic<00:05:03.750> especially<00:05:04.469> if

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
chassis would be fantastic especially if

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.800 
chassis would be fantastic especially if
they<00:05:05.460> could<00:05:05.639> keep<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:05.969> price<00:05:06.210> range<00:05:06.539> under

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
they could keep the price range under

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.080 
they could keep the price range under
four<00:05:07.199> hundred<00:05:07.530> dollars<00:05:07.560> now<00:05:08.219> obviously<00:05:08.639> this

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
four hundred dollars now obviously this

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.330 
four hundred dollars now obviously this
doesn't<00:05:09.330> feel<00:05:09.810> cheap<00:05:09.900> by<00:05:10.379> any<00:05:10.409> means<00:05:10.770> but<00:05:11.099> an

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
doesn't feel cheap by any means but an

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.430 
doesn't feel cheap by any means but an
all<00:05:11.520> metal<00:05:11.639> chassis<00:05:12.240> would<00:05:12.569> make<00:05:13.080> this<00:05:13.199> phone

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
all metal chassis would make this phone

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.770 
all metal chassis would make this phone
look<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.129> feel<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.669> little<00:05:15.060> bit<00:05:15.210> more<00:05:15.360> premium

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
look and feel a little bit more premium

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.990 
look and feel a little bit more premium
which<00:05:16.050> doesn't<00:05:16.590> harm<00:05:16.770> anything<00:05:17.039> obviously

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
which doesn't harm anything obviously

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.240 
which doesn't harm anything obviously
metal<00:05:18.389> has<00:05:18.569> its<00:05:18.810> pros<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.199> cons<00:05:19.530> it<00:05:19.830> scratches

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
metal has its pros and cons it scratches

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.339 
metal has its pros and cons it scratches
really<00:05:20.490> easily<00:05:20.819> it's<00:05:21.360> also<00:05:21.569> really<00:05:21.840> slippery

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
really easily it's also really slippery

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.469 
really easily it's also really slippery
but<00:05:22.979> it's<00:05:23.250> really<00:05:23.400> up<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.789> you<00:05:23.819> in<00:05:24.060> what<00:05:24.300> you

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
but it's really up to you in what you

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.839 
but it's really up to you in what you
prefer<00:05:24.719> there's<00:05:25.409> been<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:25.770> ton<00:05:26.099> of<00:05:26.159> leaks<00:05:26.490> any

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
prefer there's been a ton of leaks any

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.870 
prefer there's been a ton of leaks any
ton<00:05:27.210> of<00:05:27.330> pictures<00:05:27.509> showing<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.800> 1+2<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.550> be<00:05:29.669> a

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
ton of pictures showing the 1+2 to be a

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.330 
ton of pictures showing the 1+2 to be a
metal<00:05:30.240> phone<00:05:30.479> so<00:05:31.139> it<00:05:31.289> will<00:05:31.560> most<00:05:31.800> likely<00:05:32.009> have

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
metal phone so it will most likely have

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.950 
metal phone so it will most likely have
that<00:05:32.580> but<00:05:32.819> we<00:05:32.969> still<00:05:33.240> don't<00:05:33.539> know<00:05:33.659> for<00:05:33.750> sure

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
that but we still don't know for sure

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.719 
that but we still don't know for sure
and<00:05:34.319> that's<00:05:34.650> basically<00:05:34.889> I<00:05:35.130> think<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.460> guys<00:05:35.610> so

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.129 
and that's basically I think you guys so
