applied it but I'll take another bit
you're<00:00:54.960> already<00:00:55.079> putting<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.680> I've

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
you're already putting this one on I've

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.959 
you're already putting this one on I've
had<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> couple<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.910> weeks

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
had it on there for a couple of weeks

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.330 
had it on there for a couple of weeks
now<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.710> happy<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
now and I'm really really happy with it

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.349 
now and I'm really really happy with it
so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> thought<00:00:59.699> I'd<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> quick<00:01:00.149> breakdown

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
so I thought I'd have a quick breakdown

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
so I thought I'd have a quick breakdown
of<00:01:00.570> what's<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.500> why<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.370> good

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
of what's on there and why it's so good

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.990 
of what's on there and why it's so good
so<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:04.189> quick<00:01:05.189> overview<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.610> what's<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
so a quick overview of what's on the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.890 
so a quick overview of what's on the
packaging<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:07.080> 0.2<00:01:07.590> 4<00:01:07.860> mil<00:01:08.040> thick<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.900> that's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
packaging not 0.2 4 mil thick so that's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.890 
packaging not 0.2 4 mil thick so that's
that's<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> proof<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.100> how<00:01:11.220> thin<00:01:11.900> this

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's the proof of just how thin this

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
that's the proof of just how thin this
really<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.799> compare<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.490> with

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
really is and when I compare that with

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
really is and when I compare that with
the<00:01:15.090> device<00:01:15.360> itself<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the device itself you can see that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
the device itself you can see that
there's<00:01:16.710> absolutely<00:01:16.890> no<00:01:17.310> height<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.420> got

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
there's absolutely no height if I got

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.960 
there's absolutely no height if I got
the<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:18.780> angle<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.200> there's<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:19.530> height

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
the right angle there there's no height

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
the right angle there there's no height
gained<00:01:20.970> from<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.900> screen<00:01:22.140> protector<00:01:22.650> on

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
gained from that screen protector on

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.910 
gained from that screen protector on
this<00:01:23.100> device<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.610> all<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.560> really<00:01:25.560> sits

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
this device at all and that really sits

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.679 
this device at all and that really sits
nice<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.640> flush<00:01:26.850> when<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> run<00:01:27.299> your<00:01:27.420> fingers

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
nice and flush when you run your fingers

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.280 
nice and flush when you run your fingers
over<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:29.299> know<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> lot<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> glass<00:01:31.049> screen

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
over I know that a lot of glass screen

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
over I know that a lot of glass screen
protectors<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:32.400> still<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> very

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
protectors are still going to do a very

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
protectors are still going to do a very
similar<00:01:33.570> job<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:34.439> keeping<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.979> screen

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
similar job of keeping the screen

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.620 
similar job of keeping the screen
protected<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.820> don't<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:36.240> any<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.479> them

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
protected but I don't think any of them

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.530 
protected but I don't think any of them
are<00:01:36.990> quite<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.439> think<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.890> has<00:01:38.040> an<00:01:38.159> 8<00:01:38.340> 8<00:01:39.150> or<00:01:39.360> 9

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
are quite I think it has an 8 8 or 9

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270 
are quite I think it has an 8 8 or 9
surface<00:01:40.079> hardness<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.890> really

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
surface hardness so this is really

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
surface hardness so this is really
really<00:01:41.490> shatter<00:01:41.909> resistant<00:01:42.420> nice<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.409> tough

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
really shatter resistant nice and tough

really shatter resistant nice and tough
and<00:01:43.890> sorry<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.909> shatters<00:01:45.299> isten<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:46.200> not

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and sorry it shatters isten it's not

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.020 
and sorry it shatters isten it's not
gonna<00:01:46.530> damage<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.340> screen<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
ever does fall and crack and the surface

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179 
ever does fall and crack and the surface
on<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.320> handy<00:01:52.799> feature<00:01:52.829> as

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
on this one is a really handy feature as

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.569 
on this one is a really handy feature as
well<00:01:53.810> non-absorbent<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.140> oil<00:01:55.619> oil<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.399> water

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
well non-absorbent so oil oil and water

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.760 
well non-absorbent so oil oil and water
aren't<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.420> absorb<00:01:58.079> into<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.530> screen

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
aren't going to absorb into that screen

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.499 
aren't going to absorb into that screen
at<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.280> means<00:01:59.549> whenever<00:01:59.759> you're

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
at all so that means whenever you're

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
at all so that means whenever you're
using<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.899> screen<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> lot<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.680> you've<00:02:01.950> got

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
using the screen a lot or you've got

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.130 
using the screen a lot or you've got
particularly<00:02:02.460> sweaty<00:02:02.700> hands<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:04.020> not

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
particularly sweaty hands you're not

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.600 
particularly sweaty hands you're not
going<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.350> leave<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> mark<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> screen

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
going to leave a mark on the screen

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.250 
going to leave a mark on the screen
absorb<00:02:05.970> Atal<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:06.690> can<00:02:06.840> wipe<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.050> off

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
absorb Atal and you can wipe that off

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.050 
absorb Atal and you can wipe that off
really<00:02:07.500> quickly<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.610> would<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:08.910> good

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
really quickly and it would be as good

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.560 
really quickly and it would be as good
as<00:02:09.180> new

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
as new

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.400 
as new
so<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:11.070> means<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.660> any<00:02:12.660> chance<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.260> have

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so that means that any chance you have

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.110 
so that means that any chance you have
at<00:02:13.560> scratching<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.100> screen<00:02:14.400> or<00:02:14.700> leaving<00:02:15.000> any
