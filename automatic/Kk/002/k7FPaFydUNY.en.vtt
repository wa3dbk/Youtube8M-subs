Phillips<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:05.220> this<00:00:05.460> video<00:00:05.730> we're<00:00:06.029> going<00:00:06.150> to

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
Phillips in this video we're going to

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.020 
Phillips in this video we're going to
look<00:00:06.359> at<00:00:06.509> emerging<00:00:06.960> right<00:00:07.200> at<00:00:07.470> T<00:00:07.680> junctions<00:00:08.069> if

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
look at emerging right at T junctions if

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.310 
look at emerging right at T junctions if
you've<00:00:09.179> not<00:00:09.300> seen<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.630> emerging<00:00:09.960> left<00:00:10.170> video

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
you've not seen the emerging left video

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.020 
you've not seen the emerging left video
yet<00:00:10.650> look<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.460> first<00:00:11.639> because<00:00:11.940> it

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
yet look at that one first because it

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.780 
yet look at that one first because it
will<00:00:12.150> help<00:00:13.190> when<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.280> come<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> t-junction

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
will help when we come to a t-junction

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.609 
will help when we come to a t-junction
we<00:00:15.179> need<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.450> recognize<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.170> first<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.500> all

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
we need to recognize it first of all

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.590 
we need to recognize it first of all
look<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:16.980> signs<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.310> markings<00:00:17.699> or<00:00:17.970> if<00:00:18.480> there

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
look for signs and markings or if there

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.849 
look for signs and markings or if there
aren't<00:00:18.720> innate<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.289> tell<00:00:19.439> me<00:00:19.529> coming<00:00:19.770> to

aren't innate you can tell me coming to
the<00:00:19.949> end<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> road<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.760> know<00:00:21.000> it's

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the end of the road so you know it's

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.540 
the end of the road so you know it's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
going to be an image you would go

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.970 
going to be an image you would go

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
to do that occasionally if there's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.600 
to do that occasionally if there's
parked<00:00:34.590> cars<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> right<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.489> it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
parked cars on the right here it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.100 
parked cars on the right here it
wouldn't<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:35.910> safe<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.149> get<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.540> close<00:00:36.780> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
wouldn't be safe to get as close so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.049 
wouldn't be safe to get as close so
consider<00:00:37.770> whether<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> obstruct

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
consider whether it's going to obstruct

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.670 
consider whether it's going to obstruct
anybody<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.719> position<00:00:40.379> over<00:00:40.559> there

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
anybody if you do position over there

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.530 
anybody if you do position over there
but<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.340> clear<00:00:41.579> left<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> center

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
but if it's clear left of center

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.450 
but if it's clear left of center
position<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.620> allows<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> traffic

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
position and that allows of the traffic

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.450 
position and that allows of the traffic
room<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.000> through<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.600> turn<00:00:45.780> left<00:00:46.460> speed

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
room to get through and turn left speed

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.060 
room to get through and turn left speed
that<00:00:48.300> needs<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.320> relation<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.800> what

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that needs to be in relation to what

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
that needs to be in relation to what
vision<00:00:50.370> you've<00:00:50.520> got<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.270> an<00:00:51.390> open

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
vision you've got so if it's an open

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.590 
vision you've got so if it's an open
junction<00:00:52.370> then<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.940> perhaps<00:00:54.059> get<00:00:54.300> second

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
junction then we can perhaps get second

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
junction then we can perhaps get second
gear<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.809> continuous<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.590> clear<00:00:55.800> but

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
gear and continuous is clear but

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
gear and continuous is clear but
generally<00:00:56.610> speaking<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.300> we're<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
generally speaking if we're going to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.270 
generally speaking if we're going to
emerge<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.070> closed

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
emerge it's going to be a closed

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
emerge it's going to be a closed
junction<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.879> therefore<00:01:00.660> we'd<00:01:00.899> need<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.199> first

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
junction and therefore we'd need a first

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
junction and therefore we'd need a first
gear<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> we'd<00:01:02.730> need<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.969> pause<00:01:03.180> at<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
gear and we'd need to pause at the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.329 
gear and we'd need to pause at the
junction<00:01:03.780> itself<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:04.920> imagine<00:01:05.220> this

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
junction itself so what imagine this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.560 
junction itself so what imagine this
time<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> closed<00:01:05.909> chain<00:01:06.119> from<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.330> can't

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
time it's a closed chain from the can't

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
time it's a closed chain from the can't
see<00:01:06.720> through<00:01:06.869> these<00:01:07.020> bushes<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:08.340> going

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
see through these bushes and we're going

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.969 
see through these bushes and we're going
to<00:01:08.549> pause<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> end<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.930> slowed<00:01:10.260> down<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to pause at the end so slowed down the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.620 
to pause at the end so slowed down the
clutch<00:01:11.159> goes<00:01:11.400> down<00:01:11.670> about<00:01:12.240> two<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.600> three

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
clutch goes down about two to three

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
clutch goes down about two to three
counts<00:01:12.930> before<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> end<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.430> earlier

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
counts before the end and the earlier

counts before the end and the earlier
than<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.330> coasting<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.049> too<00:01:16.140> long

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
than that would be coasting for too long

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
than that would be coasting for too long
which<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.220> cause<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> car<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.909> maybe<00:01:18.060> speed

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
which would cause the car to maybe speed

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.429 
which would cause the car to maybe speed
up<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:18.750> wouldn't<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.049> under<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.290> much

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
