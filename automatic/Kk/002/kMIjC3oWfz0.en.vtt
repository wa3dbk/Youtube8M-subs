one<00:00:00.390> ordinary<00:00:00.930> pen<00:00:01.399> placed<00:00:02.399> in<00:00:02.669> one<00:00:02.970> ordinary

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
one ordinary pen placed in one ordinary

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.130 
one ordinary pen placed in one ordinary
glass<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:04.020> water<00:00:05.120> place<00:00:06.120> it<00:00:06.330> down<00:00:06.480> straight

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
glass of water place it down straight

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.839 
glass of water place it down straight
and<00:00:07.500> it's<00:00:08.099> magnified<00:00:09.380> then<00:00:10.380> we<00:00:11.190> tilt<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.639> pen

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
and it's magnified then we tilt the pen

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.410 
and it's magnified then we tilt the pen
and<00:00:12.259> suddenly<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.500> looks<00:00:13.710> bent<00:00:14.240> what<00:00:15.240> is

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
and suddenly it looks bent what is

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:24.080 
and suddenly it looks bent what is
happening<00:00:15.929> here<00:00:21.949> first<00:00:22.949> let's<00:00:23.519> start<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:24.000> an

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
happening here first let's start with an

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.099 
happening here first let's start with an
analogy<00:00:24.660> say<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> car<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.519> racetrack

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
analogy say we have a car on a racetrack

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.529 
analogy say we have a car on a racetrack
surrounded<00:00:28.109> by<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> rough<00:00:28.619> duct<00:00:28.939> when<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> :<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
surrounded by a rough duct when the : a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.030 
surrounded by a rough duct when the : a
racetrack<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.289> carries<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.769> their<00:00:31.949> own

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
racetrack it carries on their own

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.209 
racetrack it carries on their own
forwards<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> same<00:00:33.300> speed<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:34.920> one

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
forwards at the same speed but when one

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.880 
forwards at the same speed but when one
wheel<00:00:35.460> hits<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.180> dirt<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.200> friction<00:00:37.680> causes

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
wheel hits the dirt the friction causes

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.040 
wheel hits the dirt the friction causes
that<00:00:38.219> wheel<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:38.820> slower<00:00:39.180> than<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> wheel

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
that wheel to go slower than the wheel

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.350 
that wheel to go slower than the wheel
on<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> other<00:00:40.320> side<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:41.700> acts<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
on the other side so this will acts as a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.950 
on the other side so this will acts as a
pivot<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.649> car<00:00:43.860> spins<00:00:44.219> around<00:00:44.690> now<00:00:45.690> let's

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
pivot and the car spins around now let's

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
pivot and the car spins around now let's
use<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.410> analogy<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.160> explain<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.670> light

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
use that analogy to explain how light

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.110 
use that analogy to explain how light
travels<00:00:48.329> through<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.539> block<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.960> glass

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
travels through a block of glass

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.060 
travels through a block of glass
initially<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.270> start<00:00:51.570> during<00:00:51.750> rains<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.980> we

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
initially we start during rains then we

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.410 
initially we start during rains then we
realize<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.640> had<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.059> light

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
realize that we had to think about light

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.049 
realize that we had to think about light
as<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> wave<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.500> situation<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.910> mean

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
as a wave in this situation so that mean

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.260 
as a wave in this situation so that mean
water<00:00:57.270> fly<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> diagram<00:00:58.460> light<00:00:59.460> travels<00:00:59.879> slower

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
water fly a diagram light travels slower

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.139 
water fly a diagram light travels slower
through<00:01:00.629> glass<00:01:00.899> block<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.640> same<00:01:02.850> thing

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
through glass block so the same thing

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.759 
through glass block so the same thing
happens<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.660> we've<00:01:03.809> happened<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> car<00:01:04.500> as

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
happens as we've happened to the car as

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010 
happens as we've happened to the car as
soon<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.250> part<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> wave<00:01:05.909> touches<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
soon as one part of the wave touches the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.850 
soon as one part of the wave touches the
slower<00:01:07.350> denser<00:01:08.280> glass<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:09.600> bends<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.290> starts

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
slower denser glass it bends and starts

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
slower denser glass it bends and starts
moving<00:01:10.950> slower<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> reaches<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
moving slower and then it reaches the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.980 
moving slower and then it reaches the
outside<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.920> lopsy<00:01:14.549> happens<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.720> moves

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
outside and lopsy happens it moves

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.280 
outside and lopsy happens it moves
faster<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> bends<00:01:17.159> back<00:01:17.490> again<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.080> use

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
faster and bends back again you can use

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
faster and bends back again you can use
this<00:01:19.409> analogy<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.280> remember<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.970> weird

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
this analogy to remember that weird

light<00:01:21.390> travels<00:01:21.720> into<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> denser<00:01:22.590> material<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
light travels into a denser material it

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.850 
light travels into a denser material it
travels<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.119> Worzel<00:01:24.509> normal<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
travels to Worzel normal and when it

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
travels to Worzel normal and when it
travels<00:01:26.189> into<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> less<00:01:26.700> dense<00:01:26.909> material<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
travels into a less dense material it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.890 
travels into a less dense material it
travels<00:01:28.259> away<00:01:28.439> from<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> normal<00:01:29.600> now<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.659> can

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
travels away from the normal now we can

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
travels away from the normal now we can
go<00:01:31.020> back<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.500> original<00:01:31.670> demonstration

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
go back to the original demonstration

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.870 
go back to the original demonstration
and<00:01:32.880> explain<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.720> using<00:01:33.990> refraction<00:01:34.880> you'll

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and explain that using refraction you'll

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
and explain that using refraction you'll
notice<00:01:36.270> however<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.590> pretty<00:01:38.040> much

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
notice however that it is pretty much

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.490 
notice however that it is pretty much
the<00:01:38.520> same<00:01:38.790> type<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.180> ray<00:01:39.479> diagram<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the same type of ray diagram and the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.219 
the same type of ray diagram and the
same<00:01:40.770> concepts<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:42.180> explored<00:01:42.689> last<00:01:42.990> week

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
same concepts as we explored last week

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
same concepts as we explored last week
with<00:01:43.500> convex<00:01:43.979> lenses<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.180> see<00:01:45.509> here<00:01:45.750> we

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
with convex lenses you can see here we

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.960 
with convex lenses you can see here we
end<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> magnified<00:01:47.070> image<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.729> we

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
end up with the magnified image as we

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.990 
end up with the magnified image as we
saw<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> pen<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.649> tilted<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.399> off<00:01:50.820> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
saw when the pen is tilted and off to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
saw when the pen is tilted and off to
the<00:01:51.030> side<00:01:51.149> however<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.590> try<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> draw<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the side however and we try to draw a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
the side however and we try to draw a
ray<00:01:53.460> diagram<00:01:53.490> straight<00:01:54.270> from<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> pen<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.200> our

ray diagram straight from the pen to our
eyes<00:01:55.729> we<00:01:56.729> noticed<00:01:57.180> refraction<00:01:57.960> causes<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
eyes we noticed refraction causes the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920 
eyes we noticed refraction causes the
light<00:01:58.890> rays<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.430> bend<00:01:59.640> straight<00:02:00.360> off<00:02:00.570> away

from our eyes to solve this we need to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.800 
from our eyes to solve this we need to
