that I like to use instead of having to
blow-dry<00:00:51.460> your<00:00:51.850> hair<00:00:51.909> straight<00:00:52.420> I<00:00:52.600> am<00:00:53.199> all

hair straight I cannot do it I have like
zero<00:00:57.269> coordination<00:00:58.269> so<00:00:58.809> I<00:00:58.839> basically<00:00:59.710> take<00:01:00.220> a

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
zero coordination so I basically take a

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.060 
zero coordination so I basically take a
different<00:01:01.180> step<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.989> prevent<00:01:02.409> my<00:01:02.589> hair<00:01:02.860> from

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
different step to prevent my hair from

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.160 
different step to prevent my hair from
going<00:01:03.280> into<00:01:03.580> tiny<00:01:03.909> little<00:01:04.030> ringlets<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:05.019> then

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
going into tiny little ringlets and then

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.560 
going into tiny little ringlets and then
having<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.619> brush<00:01:06.369> my<00:01:06.580> hair<00:01:06.610> through<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.330> and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
having to brush my hair through that and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.109 
having to brush my hair through that and
then<00:01:07.960> ending<00:01:08.409> up<00:01:08.530> with<00:01:08.770> this<00:01:08.920> big<00:01:09.220> fat<00:01:09.580> afro

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
then ending up with this big fat afro

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.940 
then ending up with this big fat afro
which<00:01:10.360> always<00:01:10.600> happens<00:01:11.080> with<00:01:11.200> me<00:01:11.409> so<00:01:11.830> this

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
which always happens with me so this

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.740 
which always happens with me so this
just<00:01:12.100> prevents<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:12.850> stage<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.390> just<00:01:13.420> cuts

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
just prevents that stage it just cuts

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.539 
just prevents that stage it just cuts
out<00:01:13.990> but<00:01:14.290> say<00:01:14.439> that<00:01:14.470> it<00:01:14.680> cuts<00:01:14.920> down<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.159> frizz

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
out but say that it cuts down the frizz

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.609 
out but say that it cuts down the frizz
in<00:01:15.880> half<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:16.689> even<00:01:17.020> if<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.170> don't<00:01:17.350> have<00:01:17.409> curly

very<00:01:48.700> coarse<00:01:49.120> and<00:01:49.570> when<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.530> let<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:51.070> dry<00:01:51.100> it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
very coarse and when I let it dry it

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.970 
very coarse and when I let it dry it
does<00:01:52.150> spring<00:01:52.900> up<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.260> turn<00:01:53.500> into<00:01:53.860> these

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
does spring up and turn into these

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.100 
does spring up and turn into these
really<00:01:54.220> bouncy<00:01:54.760> curls<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.480> when<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:55.840> brush

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
really bouncy curls and when you brush

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.020 
really bouncy curls and when you brush
through<00:01:56.409> them<00:01:56.650> cause<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.280> just<00:01:57.550> turns<00:01:57.850> into

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
through them cause it just turns into

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.120 
through them cause it just turns into
frizz<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:59.110> what<00:01:59.260> I<00:01:59.290> basically<00:01:59.500> done<00:01:59.890> last

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
frizz so what I basically done last

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.980 
frizz so what I basically done last
night<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.550> wash<00:02:00.760> my<00:02:01.000> hair<00:02:01.240> applied<00:02:01.690> all<00:02:01.900> my

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
night is wash my hair applied all my

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.690 
night is wash my hair applied all my
hair<00:02:02.200> products<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.920> my<00:02:03.070> hair<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.550> then

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
hair products to my hair and then

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.850 
hair products to my hair and then
literally<00:02:04.150> tied<00:02:04.510> my<00:02:04.780> hair<00:02:05.020> into<00:02:05.470> these<00:02:05.650> really

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
literally tied my hair into these really

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.160 
literally tied my hair into these really
tight<00:02:06.250> braids<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:07.000> either<00:02:07.360> side<00:02:07.659> of<00:02:07.690> my<00:02:07.900> head

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
tight braids on either side of my head

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.229 
tight braids on either side of my head
so<00:02:08.649> when<00:02:08.769> I<00:02:08.800> take<00:02:09.069> out<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.489> braids<00:02:09.729> it's<00:02:10.060> gonna

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
so when I take out the braids it's gonna

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.210 
so when I take out the braids it's gonna
reveal<00:02:10.539> these<00:02:10.780> kind<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.260> waves<00:02:11.500> instead<00:02:12.010> of

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
reveal these kind of waves instead of

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.160 
reveal these kind of waves instead of
them<00:02:12.340> really<00:02:12.670> ringlets<00:02:13.030> écoles<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.019> just

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
them really ringlets écoles so it just

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.300 
them really ringlets écoles so it just
makes<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.409> a<00:02:14.500> lot<00:02:14.620> easier<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:15.010> me<00:02:15.280> to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
makes it a lot easier for me to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.119 
makes it a lot easier for me to
straighten<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.150> hate<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.409> blow-dry<00:02:17.650> my<00:02:17.920> hair

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
straighten I hate to blow-dry my hair

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.070 
straighten I hate to blow-dry my hair
straight<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.120> can't<00:02:19.420> do<00:02:19.659> it<00:02:19.810> I'm<00:02:19.930> really

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
straight like I can't do it I'm really

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.760 
straight like I can't do it I'm really
uncoordinated<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.190> like<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.459> don't

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
uncoordinated like that like I don't

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.800 
uncoordinated like that like I don't
going<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.880> trying<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.180> do<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.570> unless

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
going like that trying to do it unless

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.080 
going like that trying to do it unless
someone<00:02:24.170> else<00:02:24.320> does<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.590> for<00:02:24.830> me<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:25.730> ends

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
someone else does it for me it just ends

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.620 
someone else does it for me it just ends
up<00:02:26.150> looking

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
up looking

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.900 
up looking
frizzy<00:02:27.290> again<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:28.460> find<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
frizzy again so I just find this is the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.970 
frizzy again so I just find this is the
best<00:02:29.180> way<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.390> works<00:02:29.720> for<00:02:29.870> me<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.290> can<00:02:30.710> do<00:02:30.860> it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
best way that works for me I can do it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.800 
best way that works for me I can do it
straight<00:02:31.250> from<00:02:31.460> frizzy<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.120> well<00:02:32.360> but<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.660> just

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
straight from frizzy as well but it just

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.500 
straight from frizzy as well but it just
takes<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.110> lot<00:02:33.230> longer<00:02:34.030> okay<00:02:35.030> guys<00:02:35.210> so<00:02:35.390> we're

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
takes a lot longer okay guys so we're

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.150 
takes a lot longer okay guys so we're
gonna<00:02:35.630> get<00:02:35.780> started<00:02:36.050> off<00:02:36.290> by<00:02:36.470> removing<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
gonna get started off by removing the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.800 
gonna get started off by removing the
braids<00:02:37.580> from<00:02:37.940> our<00:02:38.180> hair<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.600> we're<00:02:38.750> just

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
braids from our hair and we're just

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.170 
braids from our hair and we're just
gonna<00:02:38.990> start<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.320> unravel<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.610> braids<00:02:40.880> from

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
gonna start to unravel the braids from

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.150 
gonna start to unravel the braids from
the<00:02:41.360> bottom<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.020> once<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.830> braid<00:02:43.010> is

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
the bottom and once the braid is

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.610 
the bottom and once the braid is
completely<00:02:43.640> out<00:02:43.850> its<00:02:44.120> about<00:02:44.420> half<00:02:44.870> as<00:02:45.200> frizzy

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
completely out its about half as frizzy

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.920 
completely out its about half as frizzy
as<00:02:45.800> my<00:02:46.070> hair<00:02:46.340> would<00:02:46.610> usually<00:02:46.790> be<00:02:47.060> which<00:02:47.750> is

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
as my hair would usually be which is

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.110 
as my hair would usually be which is
pretty<00:02:48.200> amazing<00:02:48.860> considering<00:02:49.250> how<00:02:49.580> curly<00:02:50.000> and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
pretty amazing considering how curly and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.090 
pretty amazing considering how curly and
frizzy<00:02:50.330> my<00:02:50.600> hair<00:02:50.810> naturally<00:02:51.230> gets<00:02:51.470> so

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
frizzy my hair naturally gets so

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100 
frizzy my hair naturally gets so
obviously<00:02:52.490> this<00:02:52.610> isn't<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:53.060> solution<00:02:53.690> to

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
obviously this isn't a solution to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.530 
obviously this isn't a solution to
remove<00:02:54.680> frizz<00:02:55.280> completely<00:02:55.970> but<00:02:56.390> it's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
remove frizz completely but it's

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.630 
remove frizz completely but it's
definitely<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.990> lot<00:02:57.380> less<00:02:57.560> frizzy<00:02:57.890> ah<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.400> looks

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
definitely a lot less frizzy ah it looks

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.970 
definitely a lot less frizzy ah it looks
just<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.000> lot<00:02:59.270> flatter<00:02:59.570> so<00:03:00.290> what<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.470> like<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.830> do

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
just a lot flatter so what I like to do

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.040 
just a lot flatter so what I like to do
is<00:03:01.160> just<00:03:01.340> section<00:03:01.760> my<00:03:01.940> hair<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.450> have<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.570> small

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
is just section my hair and have a small

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.230 
is just section my hair and have a small
section<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.800> begin<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.520> comb<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.970> through

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
section and begin to comb that through

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.460 
section and begin to comb that through
with<00:03:05.420> my<00:03:05.570> tangle<00:03:06.050> teezer

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
with my tangle teezer

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.110 
with my tangle teezer
and<00:03:06.650> obviously<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:07.310> was<00:03:07.520> already<00:03:07.760> combed

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
and obviously this was already combed

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.030 
and obviously this was already combed
through<00:03:08.390> before<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.110> have<00:03:09.530> put<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.770> into<00:03:09.950> the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
through before I have put it into the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.800 
through before I have put it into the
braid<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:10.700> I'm<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:10.970> going<00:03:11.180> over<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.600> just<00:03:11.630> to

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
braid so I'm just going over it just to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.550 
braid so I'm just going over it just to
make<00:03:11.960> sure<00:03:12.110> there<00:03:12.260> are<00:03:12.350> no<00:03:12.440> tangles<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:14.560> then

spraying this over each section and
allowing<00:03:21.740> it<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.830> dry<00:03:22.070> before<00:03:22.550> we<00:03:22.610> straighten

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
allowing it to dry before we straighten

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.050 
allowing it to dry before we straighten
and<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.160> next<00:03:25.400> part<00:03:25.610> is<00:03:25.700> pretty

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
and then the next part is pretty

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.730 
and then the next part is pretty
standard<00:03:26.420> but<00:03:26.750> just<00:03:26.900> gonna<00:03:27.020> go<00:03:27.170> over<00:03:27.530> with<00:03:27.680> my

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
standard but just gonna go over with my

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.330 
standard but just gonna go over with my
ghd's<00:03:28.580> these<00:03:28.910> ghd's<00:03:29.540> are<00:03:29.810> amazing<00:03:33.130> these<00:03:34.130> are

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
ghd's these ghd's are amazing these are

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.220 
ghd's these ghd's are amazing these are
the<00:03:34.430> larger<00:03:34.820> ones<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.150> there<00:03:35.540> are<00:03:35.630> three<00:03:35.959> sizes

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
the larger ones so there are three sizes

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.590 
the larger ones so there are three sizes
of<00:03:36.530> GHGs<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.160> believe<00:03:37.520> and<00:03:37.850> this<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.270> bigger

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
of GHGs I believe and this is the bigger

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.600 
of GHGs I believe and this is the bigger
one<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.050> basically<00:03:39.350> covers<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.800> larger<00:03:40.310> part

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
one so it basically covers a larger part

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.280 
one so it basically covers a larger part
of<00:03:40.730> hair<00:03:40.970> which<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.450> really<00:03:41.600> good<00:03:41.959> for<00:03:42.110> someone

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
of hair which is really good for someone

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.170 
of hair which is really good for someone
with<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.560> lot<00:03:42.740> of<00:03:42.770> hair<00:03:43.070> like<00:03:43.220> me<00:03:43.490> so<00:03:44.000> what<00:03:44.120> I

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
with a lot of hair like me so what I

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.180 
with a lot of hair like me so what I
like<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.480> do<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:45.050> go<00:03:45.260> from<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.740> top<00:03:45.770> and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
like to do is just go from the top and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.890 
like to do is just go from the top and
just<00:03:46.370> take<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.730> down<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.090> bottom<00:03:47.540> I'm

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
just take it down to the bottom I'm

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.210 
just take it down to the bottom I'm
gonna<00:03:48.140> start<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.560> speed<00:03:48.800> through<00:03:49.100> this

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
gonna start to speed through this

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.460 
gonna start to speed through this
because<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.640> does<00:03:49.820> take<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.180> while<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.930> then<00:03:51.260> in

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
because it does take a while and then in

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.440 
because it does take a while and then in
between<00:03:51.620> each<00:03:51.860> section<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.550> like<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.910> just<00:03:53.090> comb

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
between each section I like to just comb

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.850 
between each section I like to just comb
it<00:03:53.600> through<00:03:53.630> just<00:03:54.020> to<00:03:54.140> make<00:03:54.200> sure<00:03:54.350> I've<00:03:54.709> gone

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
it through just to make sure I've gone

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.980 
it through just to make sure I've gone
all<00:03:55.160> tangles<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.970> just<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.510> make<00:03:56.660> sure<00:03:56.840> that

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
all tangles and just to make sure that

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.270 
all tangles and just to make sure that
I'm<00:03:57.110> making<00:03:57.440> sure<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.860> everything<00:03:58.160> is

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
combing it through and that just

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:38.110 
combing it through and that just
prevents<00:04:12.050> any<00:04:12.260> hair<00:04:12.590> from<00:04:12.770> tangling<00:04:13.310> up

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.270

back of my head as well just to make

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.750 
back of my head as well just to make
sure<00:04:42.110> there<00:04:42.260> are<00:04:42.350> no<00:04:42.470> kinks<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.130> making<00:04:43.610> sure

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
to straighten as tight to the root as

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:58.159 
to straighten as tight to the root as
possible

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.570 
looks nice and straight so now once I
finished<00:05:15.840> straightening<00:05:16.439> the<00:05:16.560> top<00:05:16.770> section<00:05:17.310> I

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
finished straightening the top section I

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.700 
finished straightening the top section I
just<00:05:17.610> saw<00:05:17.909> place<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:18.449> where<00:05:18.569> I<00:05:18.599> want<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.139> when

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
just saw place it where I want to when

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.769 
just saw place it where I want to when
it's<00:05:19.860> firstly<00:05:20.249> washed<00:05:20.520> I<00:05:20.849> like<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.240> put<00:05:21.479> it<00:05:21.659> in

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
it's firstly washed I like to put it in

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.269 
it's firstly washed I like to put it in
the<00:05:21.930> middle<00:05:22.289> and<00:05:22.529> then<00:05:22.620> when<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.919> starts<00:05:23.189> to

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
the middle and then when it starts to

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.070 
the middle and then when it starts to
get<00:05:23.400> greasy<00:05:23.879> out<00:05:23.999> I<00:05:24.180> always<00:05:24.360> tend<00:05:24.719> to<00:05:24.810> like

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
get greasy out I always tend to like

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.559 
get greasy out I always tend to like
flip<00:05:25.830> over<00:05:26.039> because<00:05:26.430> it's<00:05:26.610> easier<00:05:26.969> to<00:05:27.120> conceal

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
flip over because it's easier to conceal
