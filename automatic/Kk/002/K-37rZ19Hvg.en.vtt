days everybody seems to have one of
these<00:00:07.020> things<00:00:07.350> on<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.160> pocket<00:00:08.610> video<00:00:08.760> camera

these things on the pocket video camera
and<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.170> problem<00:00:10.530> isn't<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.190> can't

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
and the problem isn't that it can't

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.459 
and the problem isn't that it can't
produce<00:00:11.969> high<00:00:12.300> quality<00:00:12.330> video<00:00:13.019> or<00:00:13.170> certainly

actual video quality itself the issue is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.920 
actual video quality itself the issue is
is<00:00:20.580> most<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.000> these<00:00:21.060> cameras<00:00:21.449> don't<00:00:21.660> have

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
is most of these cameras don't have

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.179 
is most of these cameras don't have
something<00:00:22.199> called<00:00:22.439> optical<00:00:22.859> image
