00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
plan for it in the near future so I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.220 
plan for it in the near future so I
basically<00:00:37.489> was<00:00:38.000> on<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.210> three-month<00:00:38.720> stretch

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
basically was on a three-month stretch

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.350 
basically was on a three-month stretch
and<00:00:39.620> if<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:40.370> guys<00:00:40.520> don't<00:00:40.760> know<00:00:41.030> what<00:00:41.210> that

and if you guys don't know what that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.300 
and if you guys don't know what that
means<00:00:41.630> that<00:00:41.989> three-month<00:00:42.320> stretch<00:00:42.680> is<00:00:42.920> not

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
means that three-month stretch is not

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.940 
means that three-month stretch is not
getting<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:44.000> touch-up<00:00:44.360> relaxer<00:00:45.200> for<00:00:45.740> a

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
getting a touch-up relaxer for a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.820 
getting a touch-up relaxer for a
prolonged<00:00:46.730> amount<00:00:47.450> of<00:00:47.660> time<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.410> said<00:00:48.680> how

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
prolonged amount of time you said how

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.180 
prolonged amount of time you said how
long<00:00:49.040> you<00:00:49.220> want<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.490> be<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.060> get<00:00:50.990> it<00:00:51.170> done<00:00:51.380> once

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
long you want to be and get it done once

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.630 
long you want to be and get it done once
that<00:00:52.490> time<00:00:52.730> is<00:00:52.970> up<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.070> typically<00:00:55.070> people<00:00:55.340> get

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
that time is up so typically people get

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.490 
that time is up so typically people get
this<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:56.150> I<00:00:56.180> think<00:00:56.450> it's<00:00:56.600> like<00:00:56.780> six<00:00:57.200> to<00:00:57.350> eight

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
this that I think it's like six to eight

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.650 
this that I think it's like six to eight
weeks<00:00:57.560> I<00:00:58.010> think<00:00:58.190> that's<00:00:58.310> way<00:00:58.670> too<00:00:58.970> soon<00:00:59.210> I<00:00:59.420> used

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
weeks I think that's way too soon I used

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.990 
weeks I think that's way too soon I used
to<00:00:59.720> get<00:00:59.870> mine<00:01:00.050> done<00:01:00.080> that<00:01:00.410> that<00:01:00.950> quick<00:01:01.310> that

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
to get mine done that that quick that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.350 
to get mine done that that quick that
often<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:02.990> now<00:01:03.380> I<00:01:03.410> do<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.309> every<00:01:04.489> three<00:01:04.909> months

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
often but now I do it every three months

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.030 
often but now I do it every three months
and<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:05.600> try<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:05.900> stick<00:01:06.259> to<00:01:06.409> that<00:01:06.530> before<00:01:07.009> I

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
and I try and stick to that before I

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.730 
and I try and stick to that before I
used<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.490> like<00:01:07.700> stretch<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.240> four<00:01:08.509> months

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
used to like stretch it to four months

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.359 
used to like stretch it to four months
and<00:01:09.740> no<00:01:10.250> I'm<00:01:10.579> sticking<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.030> once<00:01:11.869> every<00:01:12.369> three

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
and no I'm sticking to once every three

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.190
