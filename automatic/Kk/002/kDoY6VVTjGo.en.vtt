00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.260
 once asked on guild wars maquoy 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.880
 on the tarmac is what I'm going in 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.890
 do project millions of points of 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.869
 karma I can not spend them there I 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 gave a simple trick fast enough 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 to empty your karma and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.150
 turn into po so there before two 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.619
 little tips 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.689
 so before you start this guide it's 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.460
 to empty completely or at least the most 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.200
 possible your inventory and take 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.239
 also a character who can wear the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.950
 light armor then as soon as everything is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.600
 ready we want to go to the point of 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.309
 wailing passage to the coast of the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.500
 bloody tide that is right in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.360
 under the rule then go back to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.309
 the heart teach crab farming at 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.559
 cog n spoke to bram rajoub 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 buy him all the hunting gloves 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 Cravans Art blue fabric have 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 than 266 karma that you can wear 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.309
 in your inventory and left 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.680
 always a free slot 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.850
 we will then see why here problem to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.320
 this step if you still do not have 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.699
 of light character is that at each 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.019
 once you go buy a glove he wants 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 you ask you do you really want to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.750
 buy it because you can not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.460
 to prevail and that's so it's important 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.890
 to have a light character for a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.240
 save you time and not 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 become crazy whenever you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.210
 go buy a glove next step 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.290
 now that we are loaded like 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.740
 merry is to go to the forge 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 mystical 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.799
 then we will not use that of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.090
 lyon barley otherwise we will make a thousand 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.299
 go back and we'll lose time 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.670
 crazy 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.740
 the technique here is free and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.479
 downright shamelessly without moving a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.920
 hair and go in mcm so on the map 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.180
 border of your server and 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.189
 to use the waypoint of the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.990
 garrison just below 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.340
 of your point of arrival and when you go 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.689
 to leave even seme we will find ourselves 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.250
 simply in front of the seller of 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.110
 karma and so on 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.270
 the technique here of transformation because 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.310
 my hope will be based on the fact 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.600
 to recycle equipment but advocates 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.130
 what we will have is that everything we have 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.990
 made as a weapon we can not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.470
 recycle so we will go through the force 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.270
 mystical 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.710
 we're going to throw four big ones inside 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.869
 who will take out a glove that we 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 will be able to recycle and seen that gloves so 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 via the mystic forge we can be 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.189
 recycled and since the gloves obtained 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.570
 are between the level us 44 and 63 we 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.100
 let's get some falls from 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.420
 the ain who do they really have a strong 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.020
 market value and who will be able to get 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.670
 sell the most expensive 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.950
 so always recycled the gloves with a 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.200
 rudimentary recycling needed 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.270
 So the first white because 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.490
 it does not cost so we will say 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.260
 nothing is the cheapest and we have not 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.600
 need the percentage that allows for 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.040
 so retrieve improvements or 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.480
 loot and rare materials on his 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.950
 gloves now wanted surely 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.270
 understood the technique will make you 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.550
 going back and forth between this merchant from 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.920
 Karma mystique strength and recycling 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.420
 until we are going to say empty and the maximum 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.010
 of your karma or at least empty a 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.450
 part of your karma little remark 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.830
 here is that I asked you to 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.060
 always keep a free slot 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.200
 in your inventory simply 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.270
 because you are going to arrive in Toulouse 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.920
 so to the mystical forge and that when 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.820
 you will have to swing four teeth 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.170
 if you do not have at least one 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.270
 free slot in your bag 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.160
 you will have to throw a glove or throw 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.720
 another object so it's easier to 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.070
 always keep a free slot 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.320
 when you go to buy your gloves 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.210
 little advice again for ag 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.910
 of which for the sort of posts and levante of 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.620
 Falling sestak of one do not blur 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.350
 the market so try to sell your 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.300
 stack by 250 a stack she is selling 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.800
 you give one a stack she gets 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.600
 sells you give one and it's because 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.250
 that's very important because this 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.380
 kind of football will bring down and 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.450
 crumble the price of flax and that's it 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.340
 not very good for you or for moderating 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.990
 to finish we will use a simple 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.550
 calculation so that we calculate the 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.200
 current profitability of his technique 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.480
 so there you need four big 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.660
 will recycle what equates to 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.550
 do 4 x 266 karma which the price of a 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.560
 great unity as we need it 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.950
 four years multiplies it by 4 which we 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.840
 gives 1064 karma by recycling 1064 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.730
 karma it's a little on average a 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.880
 comma 5 fall from one to each 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.720
 recycling one blow we will do 1064 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.550
 karma / 1.5 which equals 709 carmes 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.709
 so we'll say that a fall from one 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.890
 equals 709 karma on average 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.400
 now the price of linen and 4 p 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.750
 75 pc the unit so that's a value to 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.590
 change whenever you want 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.450
 redo the calculation 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.790
 so that's 0.04 75 in. 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.670
 divide the value so in that ahmad of a 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.440
 fall of one who of 709 carmine by the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.890
 current unit price to the ag who's who 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.520
 does 709 karma / 0.04 cent 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.280
 seventy-five countries giving here 14 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.109
 1966 karma so we can say that 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.880
 every fifteen thousand karma you go 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.889
 can you make a country where is this 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.500
 equals one million carmat is 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.700
 equal to 67 inches currently so the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.070
 profitability of this technique is going 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.150
 really varied depending on your luck the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.400
 price to ajv etc 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.410
 so if like me you had more than 3 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.820
 million 4 million karma recover 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.230
 so it's true that it's going to take a 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.880
 some time go back and forth 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.410
 recycling etc 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.060
 but it's a technique he's very 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.050
 really easy and who can report 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.000
 a lot of money 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.500
 especially if you have a lot 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.770
 carmat sleeping in your door 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.810
 change 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.580
 and that's the end of this little tutorial 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.720
 farm or rather kharmatou conversion 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.530
 mouth so thank you for having 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.120

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.500
 and as usual I thank all 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.540

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.040
 or shares another way of 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.960
 support the chain and dash is so

 your addition gilbert the art of thorns 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.530
 in a small link below in the 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.169
 description of the video that is a link 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.550
 sponsored official pavano netbook which 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.560
 allows me to touch a certain 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.820
 percentage on every sale or they 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.650
 have the chain to develop and 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.210
 who also help me personally nothing 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.400
 obviously also organize competitions 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.050
 and besides, there is one who will not 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.060
 delay I tell you so next time 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.060
 in the next video go all
