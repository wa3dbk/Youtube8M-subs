00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.300
Slowly minutes float away into the distance

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.210
Don't expect to see them anymore

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.020
Even if giving up the past is a pity

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.180
The best course is still ahead

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.160
Like a carpet, like a carpet

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.080
A long journey spreads ahead

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
And it pushes up against the sky

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.160
Everyone, everyone

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.090
believe in the best

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.050
Rolling, Rolling

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.190
Blue Wagon

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.060
On accident we might have hurt someone

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.010
The calendar will not keep that day

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.110
To hasten the new adventures, friends

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.040
Hey, add some speed for us, train driver!

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.280
Like a carpet, like a carpet

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.190
A long journey spreads ahead

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.240
And it pushes up against the sky

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.000
Everyone, everyone

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.260
believe in the best

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.160
Rolling, Rolling

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000
Blue Wagon

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.190
The blue wagon is running, swinging,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.150
The fast train picks up speed

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.240
Oh, why is this day ending

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.140
I wish it would last a whole year!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.190
Like a carpet, like a carpet

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.120
A long journey spreads ahead

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.230
And it pushes up against the sky

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.240
Everyone, everyone

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.190
believe in the best

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.150
Rolling, Rolling

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.000
Blue Wagon
