00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.500
 Welcome to the orbit of Medellin 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.010
 my name is elena de casa 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.300
 and the governor predicted the reign that is your link in this system 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.060
 this is not as isolated as calder and sota did a commander 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.939
 that is how he referred to a certain discretion 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.730
 it is essential to ensure access to the angel's forge 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.130
 hostel manager 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 that says the captain agencies 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.460
 and the forge of the angel and if the most important factory in the sector 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.530
 to use 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.850
 it is necessary to request permission from the pantyh governor and his council with 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.470
 years in advance 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.710
 I have it possible that there is a way to provide access to the forge of 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.200
 Angel 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.860
 lately meridien undergoes attacks by the ee and have managed to damage 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.590
 considerably parts of our supply infrastructure and 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.110
 communications 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.120
 the meridian imperial guard already has a lot of work controlling the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.770
 uprisings of the slums 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.400
 they do not have the ability to also face the 70 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.990
 if I could make use of your experience in this field quique tu hombres 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.020
 the governor pantys cafeteria grant this permission to use the forge of the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.530
 Angel 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.850
 we will transmit the cervera tuvisa sightings to the planetarium 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.960
 that's why they did 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.080
 let me diana decades ago 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.450
 but this is an atypical behavior 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.450
 the nobility has always closed the eyes to the problems of the people 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.680
 if the nobles have paid attention to the problem it occurs because the payoffs will have 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.840
 assaulted even more important 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.979
 they will recognize it when the sky is coming after throwing ideas 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.680
 and once again hungry 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.300
 with the encouragement since noon this Monday in the financial newspaper the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.860
 meridian 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.320
 I have the activity 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.860
 vibrant comeback of dead animals 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.220
 there are no atmospheric changes 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.270
 the government of canada 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.840
 check the marcelo sensors again 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.860
 the fleet of jan brewer is left no time in its path
