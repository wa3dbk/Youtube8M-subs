00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
ending to the movie but it's just the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.550 
ending to the movie but it's just the
beginning<00:01:51.650> for<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:52.070> as<00:01:52.280> well<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.670> mean<00:01:53.560> that

playing<00:02:09.860> against<00:02:10.220> wolves<00:02:10.580> now<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:11.590> hope<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:12.829> I

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:12.859 
playing against wolves now I hope so I

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.970 
playing against wolves now I hope so I
mean<00:02:13.219> the<00:02:13.969> Gotha<00:02:14.209> picks<00:02:14.359> a<00:02:14.419> team<00:02:14.629> and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
mean the Gotha picks a team and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.229 
mean the Gotha picks a team and
hopefully<00:02:15.980> with<00:02:16.099> my<00:02:16.340> performance<00:02:16.639> a<00:02:16.909> day<00:02:17.060> can

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
hopefully with my performance a day can

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.110 
hopefully with my performance a day can
show<00:02:17.389> them<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.629> they<00:02:17.779> can

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
show them that they can

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.850 
show them that they can
for<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.140> think<00:02:19.440> he<00:02:19.530> knows<00:02:19.709> that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
for this now and I think he knows that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.360 
for this now and I think he knows that
so<00:02:20.250> hopefully<00:02:21.680> at<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.769> end<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.069> all<00:02:23.190> was
