starts in the center or starts on the
outside<00:00:24.110> doesn't<00:00:24.770> really<00:00:25.160> matter<00:00:25.490> either<00:00:25.730> way

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
outside doesn't really matter either way

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.950 
outside doesn't really matter either way
I'm<00:00:26.270> gonna<00:00:26.360> start<00:00:26.720> in<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.230> center<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.960> we

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
I'm gonna start in the center and we

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.070 
I'm gonna start in the center and we
comb<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:30.440> hair<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:30.920> it's<00:00:31.039> all<00:00:31.220> smooth<00:00:31.730> and<00:00:32.540> you

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
comb the hair so it's all smooth and you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.660 
comb the hair so it's all smooth and you
need<00:00:33.260> to<00:00:33.410> find<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.890> center<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:34.489> head

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
need to find the center of the head

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.930 
need to find the center of the head
since<00:00:34.940> that's<00:00:35.180> where<00:00:35.390> we're<00:00:35.570> starting<00:00:36.699> and<00:00:37.699> it

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
since that's where we're starting and it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.619 
since that's where we're starting and it
is<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.120> lace<00:00:38.559> braid<00:00:40.989> lace<00:00:41.989> means<00:00:43.030> that<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.360> only

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
is a lace braid lace means that you only

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.060 
is a lace braid lace means that you only
gather<00:00:45.050> from<00:00:45.530> one<00:00:45.920> side<00:00:47.379> so<00:00:48.379> we<00:00:48.589> are<00:00:48.710> going<00:00:48.920> to

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
gather from one side so we are going to

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.850 
gather from one side so we are going to
gather<00:00:49.479> put<00:00:50.479> the<00:00:50.629> same<00:00:50.870> side<00:00:51.229> all<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.739> way

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
gather put the same side all the way

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.140 
gather put the same side all the way
around<00:00:52.330> so<00:00:53.330> we<00:00:53.449> take<00:00:53.720> this<00:00:54.040> bit<00:00:55.040> of<00:00:55.159> hair<00:00:55.400> in

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
around so we take this bit of hair in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.530 
around so we take this bit of hair in
the<00:00:56.180> center<00:00:57.339> break<00:00:58.339> it<00:00:58.519> into<00:00:58.670> three<00:00:58.790> strands

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
the center break it into three strands

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.450 
the center break it into three strands
you<00:01:00.110> can<00:01:00.229> do<00:01:00.320> it<00:01:00.409> with<00:01:00.500> any<00:01:00.650> number<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.040> strands

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
you can do it with any number of strands

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.609 
you can do it with any number of strands
I'm<00:01:01.699> choosing<00:01:02.150> to<00:01:02.180> do<00:01:02.390> three<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:07.130> we<00:01:07.520> make<00:01:08.619> one

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
I'm choosing to do three and we make one

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.590 
I'm choosing to do three and we make one
pass<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:11.330> pass<00:01:11.600> three<00:01:12.560> pass<00:01:13.119> from<00:01:14.119> there<00:01:14.360> we

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
pass to pass three pass from there we

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.430 
pass to pass three pass from there we
start<00:01:14.990> lacing<00:01:15.470> our<00:01:16.010> braid<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:17.600> we<00:01:17.900> take<00:01:18.170> a

start lacing our braid so we take a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.730 
start lacing our braid so we take a
little<00:01:18.860> bit<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.220> hair<00:01:19.690> from<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.840> outside<00:01:20.900> put

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740

it in middle and we braid we're gonna do
this<00:01:25.480> until<00:01:26.480> the<00:01:27.230> entire<00:01:27.890> head<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:29.000> done<00:01:29.270> this

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
this until the entire head is done this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.930 
this until the entire head is done this
is<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.900> spiral<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.830> we're<00:01:31.100> gonna<00:01:31.220> add<00:01:31.580> but<00:01:31.880> you

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
is a spiral and we're gonna add but you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.490 
is a spiral and we're gonna add but you
may<00:01:32.060> take<00:01:32.300> these<00:01:32.510> gathers<00:01:32.900> we're<00:01:33.140> just<00:01:33.350> gonna

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
make sure that we're making a circle as

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.730 
make sure that we're making a circle as
we<00:01:38.180> go<00:01:38.360> around<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:38.840> I'm<00:01:38.930> not<00:01:39.110> gonna<00:01:39.290> take<00:01:39.530> these

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
we go around so I'm not gonna take these

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.170 
we go around so I'm not gonna take these
gathers<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.750> shape<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:43.190> square<00:01:43.670> I'm<00:01:44.000> not

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
gathers in the shape of a square I'm not

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.120 
gathers in the shape of a square I'm not
gonna<00:01:44.360> take<00:01:44.570> them<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.590> shape<00:01:45.800> of<00:01:45.980> a

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
gonna take them in the shape of a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.280 
gonna take them in the shape of a
rectangle<00:01:46.310> we're<00:01:47.000> gonna<00:01:47.120> take<00:01:47.450> these<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.080> that

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
rectangle we're gonna take these so that

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.400 
rectangle we're gonna take these so that
as<00:01:48.530> we<00:01:49.280> pick<00:01:49.550> them<00:01:49.670> up<00:01:49.910> they're<00:01:50.630> creating<00:01:51.260> a

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
as we pick them up they're creating a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.090 
as we pick them up they're creating a
circular<00:01:51.950> pattern<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:54.020> we're<00:01:54.409> gonna<00:01:54.530> do<00:01:54.890> this

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
circular pattern and we're gonna do this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.300 
circular pattern and we're gonna do this
probably<00:01:55.460> for<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.970> next<00:01:56.590> 15<00:01:57.590> minutes<00:01:57.950> and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
probably for the next 15 minutes and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.120 
probably for the next 15 minutes and
then<00:01:59.270> I'll<00:01:59.420> shorten<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.020> video<00:02:00.140> down<00:02:00.680> so

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
then I'll shorten the video down so

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.870 
then I'll shorten the video down so
you'll<00:02:01.280> see<00:02:01.490> they're<00:02:01.670> moving<00:02:02.030> fast<00:02:02.300> motion

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
you'll see they're moving fast motion

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.219 
you'll see they're moving fast motion
and<00:02:04.880> as<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:06.320> can<00:02:06.530> see<00:02:06.830> all<00:02:07.820> I'm<00:02:08.330> doing<00:02:08.810> it's

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
and as you can see all I'm doing it's

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.970 
and as you can see all I'm doing it's
picking<00:02:09.769> up<00:02:09.860> hair<00:02:10.220> from<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:11.569> outside<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
picking up hair from the outside of the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.970 
picking up hair from the outside of the
braid<00:02:13.780> gathering<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.930> into<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.530> center

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
braid gathering it into the center

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.059 
braid gathering it into the center
strand

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
strand

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.470 
strand
and<00:02:17.159> I'm<00:02:17.459> moving<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.629> circle<00:02:19.909> all<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:20.969> time

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and I'm moving in a circle all the time

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.839 
and I'm moving in a circle all the time
every<00:02:22.200> time<00:02:22.409> I<00:02:22.439> take<00:02:22.829> it<00:02:22.980> gathers<00:02:23.370> pick<00:02:23.670> up

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
every time I take it gathers pick up

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.569 
every time I take it gathers pick up
again<00:02:24.150> put<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.139> the<00:02:25.290> middle<00:02:25.469> and<00:02:25.799> then<00:02:26.489> I

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
again put it in the middle and then I

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.170 
again put it in the middle and then I
move<00:02:26.849> my<00:02:27.030> body<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.989> little<00:02:28.040> bit<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.819> we<00:02:29.969> do

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
move my body just a little bit and we do

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.250 
move my body just a little bit and we do
this<00:02:30.389> the<00:02:30.599> entire<00:02:30.719> time<00:02:31.340> takes<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.489> long<00:02:32.700> time

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
this the entire time takes a long time

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.580 
this the entire time takes a long time
requires<00:02:34.260> patience

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:03:30.600 

you

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.660 

so<00:03:31.210> as<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.690> can<00:03:31.870> see<00:03:31.930> we<00:03:32.650> spiraled<00:03:33.130> around<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
so as you can see we spiraled around the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.720 
so as you can see we spiraled around the
head<00:03:34.020> repeatedly<00:03:35.020> until<00:03:35.770> we<00:03:35.920> ran<00:03:36.100> out<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.370> hair

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
head repeatedly until we ran out of hair

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.270 
head repeatedly until we ran out of hair
then<00:03:37.450> we<00:03:37.630> breathe<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.930> tail<00:03:38.380> all<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.070> way<00:03:39.220> to

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
then we breathe the tail all the way to

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.840 
then we breathe the tail all the way to
the<00:03:39.670> bitter<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:41.070> last<00:03:42.070> hair<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.610> have

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
the bitter and the last hair you have

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.230 
the bitter and the last hair you have
left<00:03:43.150> over<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:44.380> better

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
left over to better

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.820 
left over to better
notice<00:03:46.240> how<00:03:46.390> I'm<00:03:46.540> splitting<00:03:47.110> off<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.530> thick

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
notice how I'm splitting off the thick

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.330 
notice how I'm splitting off the thick
tail<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:49.300> making<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:50.020> go<00:03:50.230> into<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.830> thinner

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
tail and making it go into the thinner

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.330 
tail and making it go into the thinner
tail<00:03:51.670> pieces<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:53.320> that<00:03:53.350> all<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.860> pieces<00:03:54.070> are

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
tail pieces so that all the pieces are

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.000 
tail pieces so that all the pieces are
equal<00:03:54.850> in<00:03:55.030> size<00:03:55.270> so<00:03:56.110> that<00:03:56.290> we<00:03:56.440> can<00:03:56.590> continue

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
equal in size so that we can continue

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.950 
equal in size so that we can continue
braiding<00:03:57.400> them<00:03:57.730> all<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.300> way<00:03:58.390> out<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
braiding them all the way out to the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.810 
braiding them all the way out to the
very<00:03:58.990> end<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:01.630> reason<00:04:01.840> has<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.560> important<00:04:03.160> is

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
very end the reason has so important is

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.180 
very end the reason has so important is
so<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:04.300> we<00:04:04.450> don't<00:04:04.690> have<00:04:04.990> a<00:04:05.020> large<00:04:05.380> tail<00:04:05.830> left

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
so that we don't have a large tail left

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.670 
so that we don't have a large tail left
over<00:04:06.730> really<00:04:07.210> to<00:04:07.390> try<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.660> tuck<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.350> pin

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
over really to try to tuck and pin

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.699 
over really to try to tuck and pin
there's<00:04:09.190> not<00:04:09.400> really<00:04:09.730> anywhere<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:11.080> tuck<00:04:11.350> or

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
there's not really anywhere to tuck or

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:41.490 
there's not really anywhere to tuck or
pin<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.570> more<00:04:13.840> it's<00:04:40.290> wrapping<00:04:41.290> this

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
pin it so the more it's wrapping this

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:54.840 
pin it so the more it's wrapping this
around<00:04:45.750> we<00:04:46.750> use<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:46.990> body<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:52.060> attach<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:53.850> to

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
around we use a body to attach it and to

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.180 
around we use a body to attach it and to
help<00:04:55.060> make<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.450> disappear<00:04:56.140> I'm<00:04:56.590> gonna<00:04:56.830> stick

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
help make it disappear I'm gonna stick

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:05.000 
help make it disappear I'm gonna stick
it<00:04:57.340> under<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.820> braid<00:04:58.270> like<00:04:59.230> that

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:15.850 

there<00:05:06.010> is<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:07.330> spiral
