00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.020 
some over here there's one and another
one<00:02:50.190> over<00:02:50.370> here<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.260> i<00:02:52.260> click<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.650> one<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.430> i

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030

click<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.420> one<00:02:54.480> they<00:02:55.170> don't<00:02:55.549> like<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:57.140> think

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
click this one they don't like I think

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.839 
click this one they don't like I think
what<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.620> when<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.130> right<00:02:59.370> click<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.790> it

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
what it is is when you right click on it

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.640 
what it is is when you right click on it
and<00:03:00.060> find<00:03:00.720> another<00:03:00.840> pig<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.450> guess<00:03:03.650> wants

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
and find another pig that I guess wants

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.530 
and find another pig that I guess wants
to<00:03:05.430> make<00:03:06.000> out<00:03:06.239> or<00:03:06.690> do<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.530> digby<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.540> they

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
that's basically what happens but it

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.199 
that's basically what happens but it
doesn't<00:03:12.420> attract<00:03:12.780> them<00:03:12.959> like<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.109> magnet<00:03:14.209> like
