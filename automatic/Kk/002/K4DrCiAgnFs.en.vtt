00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 of pinch typical of any 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.750
 smartphone the first thing we would do for 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.639
 example is connect our phone 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.460
 mobile and for that we would go to the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.710
 settings screen we would go to the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 bluetooth option 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.750
 we would look for bluetooth devices 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.170
 that we had and in this case you see 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:28.710
 that I have a device connected is 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.950
 this sony xperia x3 according to starting 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.250
 from here 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.890
 we would be ready to start 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.650
 to work for example with the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.560
 phone applications of our 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.330
 phone such as recovering 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.620
 calls that we have in speed dial 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.680
 memorized go to the history of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.140
 calls for example or in the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.800
 menu activities as the functions 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.800
 of marker 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.829
 of call history agenda 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.300
 etc 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.340
 own of any hands phone 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.950
 free 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.039
 additionally we have what you 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.560
 commented on all the information regarding 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.659
 our trip here you have for example the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.700
 instant consumption obviously not 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.560
 we are circulating but here it would give us 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.759
 the instant consumption of our trip 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.580
 average consumption autonomy a historical one 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.030
 travel history feature 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:37.720
 additional functions like for example 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.720
 customize the tapestry the clock and so on 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.440
 we also have the typical functions of 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.740
 Audio 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.080
 for example if I wanted to choose now 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.000
 the source for example from the phone 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.659
 connected I would listen 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.439
 as you see 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.439
 right now 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.220
 the source of the phone is ringing 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.450
 obviously from here we could also 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.840
 control all options related to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.790
 severe acute balances and so on 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.790
 from the system itself 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.010
 all right 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.130
 what more functions do we find as 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.470
 application already installed within the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.740
 system we find the application aha 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.540
 aha is a set of applications that 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:41.300
 allows us to access a multitude of 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.660
 example digital radio channels by 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.660
 example 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.269
 and we are now on a digital radio 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.870
 pre-selected we have the option to 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.870
 look for them 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.849
 other options such as search 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.099
 custom places that we can then 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.459
 take us to our browser or other 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.340
 configuration options or even 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.799
 access the podcast social networks that 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.569
 want to have recorded so as 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.230
 I say this installation 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.340
 this application better said comes already 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 preloaded in our system 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.310
 all right 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.960
 more applications of the system with him then 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.390
 we have the application as I said 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.210
 mirror link this system is compatible 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.160
 with mirror link so that the system 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.990
 can work requires three 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.270
 conditions first that the system does not 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.670
 be compatible with mirror link in this 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.700
 case it is second that the phone that 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.190
 we are using sea mirror link in 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.260
 this case also is and in third 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.660
 place in the applications that we are going to 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.490
 see they are compatible with fast link that 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.330
 the ones we have are also for 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.620
 show us what I would come here 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.010
 drag would enter this menu of 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.909
 herd of options I would go to settings 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.909
 and from here 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.989
 If the camera allows me, you can see that 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.510
 the screen is completely duplicated 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.139
 if I can move through him 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.650
 of own you can 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.069
 system screen or I can move to 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.669
 through the phone itself to access 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:37.039
 to the applications that I want in this 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.210
 case if I wanted to for example access 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:43.729
 to my browser then from here 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.409
 and I want to 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:52.629
 in this case for example we would be in 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:55.669
 the blog as you can see from our wave drives 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:59.330
 totally replicated the same as I see 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:03.669
 in my phone I see it on the screen of 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.669
 honda with the one located on the bus 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.520
 in agreement
