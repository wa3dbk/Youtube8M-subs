let's<00:02:08.009> check<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> bulb<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.259> see<00:02:10.340> if<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
let's check the bulb and see if the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.929 
let's check the bulb and see if the
filament<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.390> broke

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
filament is broke

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.140 
filament is broke
and<00:02:15.319> yep<00:02:16.319> see<00:02:17.219> how<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.459> has<00:02:17.549> double<00:02:17.939> filament

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and yep see how it has double filament

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.899 
and yep see how it has double filament
all<00:02:18.989> right<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.049> broken<00:02:22.459> all<00:02:23.459> right<00:02:23.609> so

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
all right so that is broken all right so

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.660 
all right so that is broken all right so
the<00:02:24.840> size<00:02:25.079> that<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.620> need<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.219> on<00:02:26.459> your

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
the size that you need to get on your

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.429 
the size that you need to get on your
bulbs<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.799> one<00:02:28.799> one<00:02:29.280> five<00:02:29.670> seven<00:02:30.329> now<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.290> can

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
bulbs is one one five seven now you can

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.229 
bulbs is one one five seven now you can
get<00:02:31.590> brighter<00:02:31.889> ones<00:02:32.250> but<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.549> was<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:32.700> suggest

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.459 
anything to melt in there um I got this
uh<00:02:36.480> autozone<00:02:37.139> for<00:02:37.560> 4.99<00:02:38.209> okay<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.290> take<00:02:40.290> your

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
uh autozone for 4.99 okay so take your

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.569 
uh autozone for 4.99 okay so take your
new<00:02:40.620> bulb<00:02:40.889> out<00:02:42.680> obviously<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:44.249> want<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.489> make

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
sure that that filaments good yep all

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.959 
sure that that filaments good yep all
right<00:02:48.959> repeat<00:02:49.439> process<00:02:50.129> but<00:02:50.370> turn<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.730> other

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:50.969 
right repeat process but turn the other

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:51.439 
right repeat process but turn the other
way

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:51.449 
way

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.349 
way
stick<00:02:51.840> your<00:02:51.870> bulb<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.790> just<00:02:53.790> press<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.269> a

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
stick your bulb in just press in a

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.670 
stick your bulb in just press in a
little<00:02:54.719> bit<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.139> don't<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.409> to<00:02:55.469> break<00:02:55.620> it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
little bit you don't want to break it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.729 
little bit you don't want to break it
and<00:02:55.949> then<00:02:56.340> turn<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.269> right<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.780> before<00:02:58.650> we

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
and then turn to the right and before we

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.030 
and then turn to the right and before we
assemble<00:02:58.889> everything<00:02:59.760> reassemble<00:03:00.829> we<00:03:01.829> want

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
assemble everything reassemble we want

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.550 
assemble everything reassemble we want
to<00:03:02.129> just<00:03:02.250> go<00:03:02.430> ahead<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.819> test<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:04.379> this

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
to just go ahead and test it so this

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.979 
to just go ahead and test it so this
should<00:03:04.859> come<00:03:05.099> along<00:03:05.840> yep<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:08.129> so<00:03:08.819> all<00:03:09.659> so

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
should come along yep it's on so all so

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.860 
should come along yep it's on so all so
let's<00:03:10.829> go<00:03:10.980> ahead<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.219> hit<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.549> brake<00:03:11.790> light

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.960 

okay<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.260> works<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.919> real<00:03:17.790> simple

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
okay so that works and real simple

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.899 
okay so that works and real simple
process<00:03:18.259> don't<00:03:19.259> want<00:03:19.439> to<00:03:19.530> waste<00:03:19.829> your<00:03:20.009> battery

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
process don't want to waste your battery

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.749 
process don't want to waste your battery
turn<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.299> off<00:03:21.739> real<00:03:22.739> simple<00:03:23.069> process<00:03:23.189> let's

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:23.759 
turn that off real simple process let's

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.259 
turn that off real simple process let's
go<00:03:23.939> ahead<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.269> put<00:03:25.430> let's<00:03:26.430> go<00:03:26.609> ahead<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.150> put

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
go ahead and put let's go ahead and put

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.960 
go ahead and put let's go ahead and put
the<00:03:27.359> flap<00:03:27.540> on<00:03:30.620> kind<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.680> wiggle<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.370> till<00:03:32.879> it

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the flap on kind of wiggle it till it

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.710 
the flap on kind of wiggle it till it
gets<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.479> there<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.930> then<00:03:35.150> put<00:03:36.150> your<00:03:36.389> screws

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
gets in there and then put your screws

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.449 
gets in there and then put your screws
in<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:40.879> you<00:03:41.879> are<00:03:42.090> pretty<00:03:42.389> much<00:03:42.540> finished

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
in and you are pretty much finished

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.710 
in and you are pretty much finished
right<00:03:44.459> there<00:03:44.639> so<00:03:45.269> that's<00:03:45.359> how<00:03:45.509> you<00:03:45.599> change

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
right there so that's how you change

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.099 
right there so that's how you change
your<00:03:46.199> taillight<00:03:46.949> or<00:03:47.159> brake<00:03:47.459> light<00:03:47.699> in<00:03:47.879> a<00:03:48.449> 2005

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
your taillight or brake light in a 2005

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:55.729 
your taillight or brake light in a 2005
Kawasaki<00:03:49.769> Ninja<00:03:51.349> 250r<00:03:52.729> and<00:03:54.139> I<00:03:55.139> assume<00:03:55.709> that

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
Kawasaki Ninja 250r and I assume that

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.699 
Kawasaki Ninja 250r and I assume that
most<00:03:56.750> motorcycles<00:03:57.750> do<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.049> way<00:03:59.359> that's

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
most motorcycles do this way that's

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.920 
most motorcycles do this way that's
that's<00:04:01.709> how<00:04:02.009> you<00:04:02.069> do<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.430> with<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.359> one<00:04:03.419> so

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
that's how you do it with this one so

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.530 
that's how you do it with this one so
hopefully<00:04:04.439> helped<00:04:04.859> you<00:04:04.919> guys<00:04:05.040> out<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.540> catch

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
hopefully helped you guys out and catch

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.590 
hopefully helped you guys out and catch
my<00:04:06.780> other<00:04:06.930> videos<00:04:07.199> thanks
