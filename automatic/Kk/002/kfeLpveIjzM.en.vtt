00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.659
 for you 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.380
 how about friends of net media good 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.360
 this time we are going to do one of the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.860
 gadgets that are sounding a lot 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320
 during the next months and that still 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.780
 does not go on sale here in Mexico that is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.270
 the new microsoft tablet windows 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.010
 surface let's explain more or less 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.780
 what is it that has outside the center 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.000
 you see the camera the camcorder for 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.040
 take pictures is at the center 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 precisely to facilitate the capture 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.710
 from the same ones on one side we see 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.840
 the famous blocking button by blocking 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.630
 ignition of the equipment on this side 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.910
 we have the up and down button 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.510
 volume in addition to the port for 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.090
 hearing aids or external speakers of this 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.570
 side is one of the speakers of the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.360
 of the equipment already included and here we have a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.670
 USB input and a microusb input 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.320
 in addition to the entry for the charger and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.380
 charger is this that we have from this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.640
 side highlights very basic very simple to 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.710
 what all the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.990
 others with their new gadgets and has the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.640
 advantage that is magnetic which 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.259
 makes it much easier to be at 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.549
 time to connect it is not a 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.010
 surprise rt 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.950
 I want to show you the capacity is not 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.730
 to record the gabo that is unasur face rt 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.100
 of 64 gb here in the part of those in the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.860
 part of the nomenclatures and at the same 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.290
 time to reveal this kick opens 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.870
 stand of the surface which allows us 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.670
 stop our surface without any without 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.920
 no anxiety of an attachment 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 additional and the other thing that I wanted them 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.350
 show is that we have the keyboard case 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.480
 from microsoft which contains all the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.010
 alphanumeric characters and it also has 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.840
 shortcuts can be these 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.990
 direct for several of the functions of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.520
 the surface rt in addition to the trackpad and the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.140
 two classic mouse buttons 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.850
 which we will show in a while more 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.270
 now if we go to the system part 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.000
 operative so that they see it as 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.650
 I was trying try windows 8 r t which 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.360
 can allow the user to configure 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.430
 in two ways your experience through 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.290
 of the famous styles is to say these 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.229
 small icons that the user has in 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.270
 the screen the explorer the part of the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.980
 windows store or you can add new 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.230
 applications or programs to the party 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.560
 details in this case I added word 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.870
 2003 and excel 2013 sorry 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.730
 but if the user is not used 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.680
 to this part that is totally tactile 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.170
 has the possibility of returning to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.900
 classic windows is to say the part where 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.459
 we can see windows we can see icons 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.319
 we can see all the functions at 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.819
 that we are obviously used to 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.290
 there is no start button which gives them 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.630
 it's going to cause a bit of trouble because 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.880
 Microsoft completely disappeared it 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.819
 but good the surface is completely 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.410
 touch everywhere to all the menus 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.800
 you can navigate through the finger 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.750
 we can access the explorer we can see 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.010
 the part of ccoo is what the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.260
 menus the files of our 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.600
 computer consult applications 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.810
 everything is available via touch 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.970
 or if they have a peripheral or keyboard 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.489
 the keyboard case can see that it appears 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.560
 the classic mouse cursor as you 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.450
 talked about this classic cursor serves in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.200
 automatic like any other here I 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.299
 I can close minimize windows draw the 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.980
 additional option of the window the 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.069
 additional options for windows 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.280
 choose icons drag it if I want 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.790
 in my window open images 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.010
 we have an image the advantage it has 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.390
 windows 7 with surface is that being 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.980
 totally tactile the new system 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.290
 operative is even within this 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.720
 environment we can take advantage of some of 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.270
 functions like for example make your 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.600
 mail pinchi pinchi pinchi out that is 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.030
 to enlarge or decrease decrease 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.370
 images and we can also spend 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.840
 even for example there are functions in the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.340
 two and we want to flip the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.660
 image there is 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.370
 notice does not react very well but good 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.340
 there we have it, they are not part of the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.680
 functions all files are 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.420
 totally fully functional and 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.760
 we even have the option of if they have 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.500
 usb those extra peripherals which 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.930
 it is a great help for those who 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.340
 they work a lot with information enough 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.569
 connect 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.609
 to the surface rt the equipment 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.190
 there they have for details that they see that 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.750
 does not react very well but good 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.150
 removable disk drives are 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.130
 completely recognizable and within 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.780
 these can see all files 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.840
 they have I have there is a word document 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.360
 I have a pdf will have to download readers of 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.190
 pdf I have one and moore to see one 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.740
 movie will have to download a player 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.180
 of movies has a couple of photos and 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.300
 has a couple of screenshots 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.460
 let's go to the navigation part in 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.900
 internet which is very similar to what 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.770
 offers in the rest of the tablets 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.970
 we can grow the screen grow 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.090
 simply navigation can occur 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.370
 through the keyboard or as they came 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.320
 talking directly on screen one 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.229
 you can take out the virtual keyboard from 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.060
 team and there start typing 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.099
 disadvantages as we have talked about it 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.370
 a couple of moments is microsoft not 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:08.590
 includes applications as basic as 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.660
 camera to record and to take and 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.400
 Capture images or record video 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.680
 one has to download an application 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.180
 of windows torÃ¡ that is to say it does not come from 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.919
 factory is not much problem is a 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.270
 free application but anyway 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.289
 it's something that should be inside the 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.300
 tablet already 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.499
 is the windows store and here you can see 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.389
 a lot of applications that already 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:27.129
 are available the same thing happens for 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.860
 the part of videos there is not an application 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.680
 that is to say your factory surface you will not be able to 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.360
 play videos and audios less than 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.159
 that your download is an application of 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.139
 new from the windows store which is 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.389
 our opinion should not be because 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.059
 speak should come pre-configured 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.619
 from the factory we also noticed that there is a 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.599
 couple of details with the part of the 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:48.460
 applications and a couple of hidden menus 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.469
 the user has to pull these parts 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.809
 to see the singh part of baix is to be 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.699
 or if you want from this other side you can 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:57.550
 do to see what are the menus that 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.399
 they are running not everything that is 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.379
 running or you can do it lower and there 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:03.699
 see for screens that is that they are the 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.529
 applications that have stayed in the 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.360
 background running the cities has a 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.860
 couple of problems when running a 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.180
 a lot of applications in this 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.539
 case for example we are running a 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.219
 html5 test of the famous fish tank in 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.509
 this moment we are running forever 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.339
 every two that are running to 13 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.770
 frames per second and nothing more for 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.909
 compare them with the one with ipad and maybe the 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.800
 most recent that no longer exists in the 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.639
 market we are running the same 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.249
 It is always expensive 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.499
 and if you can see the third ipad 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:32.419
 generation that can no longer be mexico 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:34.460
 but it no longer exists commercially 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.469
 is running at 21 frames per second 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.409
 the 100 fish while the cities 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:41.569
 is running them at 14 to 14 frames per 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.939
 second is to say the performance is a bit 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.159
 slower not for that bad but if it's a 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:47.449
 bit slower which should not do 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:49.639
 these clumsy contains all the 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.979
 applications all updates 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.349
 a day then good because there is a 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:57.110
 small workshop one really has all 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.490
 the microsoft applications so 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.710
 less much of the applications of 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.289
 microsoft in this case I have the windows 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.639
 2013 preview and basically as if what 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.389
 I did on any computer 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:10.219
 I can start typing on my computer the 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.710
 case is that the surface meets great 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:14.599
 part of the needs of the 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.599
 users to convert precisely the 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.219
 tablet on a computer equipment to what 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.289
 price that is the question it costs 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.939
 around 600 dollars the team this 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.310
 model is particularly a bit more expensive 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:28.279
 round almost two thousand dollars because it's from 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.860
 64 gigabytes is a little heavier than 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:31.990
 the ipad that the ipad or that the samsung 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.880
 galaxy 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.500
 and they have for the problem there are a couple of 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.750
 menus that cost us a lot of work 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.060
 to configure as part of the wireless 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.770
 access and which was quite complicated to 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.510
 do it but at the end of accounts good
