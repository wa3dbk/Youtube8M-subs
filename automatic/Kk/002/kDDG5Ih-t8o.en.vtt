 Good, such a new country, a new taste test. We are in South Africa right now and you can't 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.769
 come around this country and not try Biltong. So that's what I'm here in this 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.640
 brown paper bag. 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:21.039
 So Biltong is a dry cure meat similar to beef jerky and that's what it looks like. 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.119
 So we have some cattle biltong ourselves but believe you can get different kinds 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:36.730
 meat. Like venison or ostrich. this is cow. And it is very difficult and soft, but it is 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.920
 make a very nice snack, so let's say you drive the bus or go on a very long journey 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.780
 It's kind of nice to just fill a bag and be munching away. This is what we have 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.079
 do for the past few days. 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.260
 So for me Biltong is kind of like premium Biltong. And there are three major differences. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.980
 First, it is cut a lot thicker. Second, they use vinegar in the healing process 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.689
 with salt and pepper. What's a bit different from ordinary Biltong that's not 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.439
 no vinegar whatsoever. And the third most important difference is Biltong is not smoked while 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.569
 Biltong is. 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:22.380
 Okay, so the buying process? What was awesome is that we are kind of like 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.639
 which would be considered a deli specialized in Biltong. And when we were in there 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:32.029
 all of these different kinds of dried meat hang in different sections. There was 

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:36.729
 one that was venison, there was one that was regular, there was a premium kind. I can not 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.299
 remember, but there was a fourth kind as well. And anyways, what you want to do is pick up this one 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.189
 meat off a hook and bring it to these ladies who would then make it through a grinder 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.849
 and it will go in the bag so. so it was a very cool to just be involved there 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.099
 in the process. And it just makes it a lot more special. And the other thing I really like 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.349
 noted that a big difference is that the quality of the actual meat itself is a 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:08.479
 Much better than what comes out say packaged pre-packaged things you would find in a store. 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.400
 So the word Biltong. What does it mean? I actually had to look it up, but now I can 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.430
 tell you. So 'Bil' appears to come from the Dutch word for cross and 'Tong' means strip 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 or tongue. But unlike the common belief Biltong is not made of tongue bull's, so 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.010
 Don't be afraid to try it because it is. 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.500
 What do you have in your hand over there? All right, and last but not least we have something 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.430
 called Cabanossi what kind of a dried pepperoni stick looks like. We also picked this up 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:47.939
 at the same store we have the Biltong. so I'm going to try it. Yes, so it is a kind 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:56.700
 from like a fatty salami stick. Again, soft, salty, tasty. I think it makes a big one 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.510
 snack. Which one do you think would be better? or do you both like them? 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.640
 I do like them two, but it reminds me of salami or like a pepperoni stick so it is 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.340
 something I'm familiar with. So I quite enjoy the smell. Another bite. 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.049
 So when you visit South Africa, unless of course you are a vegetarian, be sure 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.930
 Try Biltong. I swear it's pretty much addicting. I can't seem to stop myself here.
