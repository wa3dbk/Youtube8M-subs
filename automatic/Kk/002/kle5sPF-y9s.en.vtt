hello<00:00:00.690> and<00:00:00.960> today<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.340> be<00:00:02.520> making

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hello and today we're going to be making

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.980 
hello and today we're going to be making
potassium<00:00:04.200> nitrate<00:00:05.210> so<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.540> chemicals

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
potassium nitrate so the chemicals

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.770 
potassium nitrate so the chemicals
you'll<00:00:07.140> need<00:00:07.379> for<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.830> are<00:00:08.780> potassium

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
you'll need for this are potassium

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.919 
you'll need for this are potassium
chloride<00:00:10.519> which<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.790> be<00:00:11.910> bought<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.630> salt

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
chloride which can be bought as a salt

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.130 
chloride which can be bought as a salt
substitute<00:00:13.639> and<00:00:15.980> ammonium<00:00:16.980> nitrate<00:00:18.140> which

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
substitute and ammonium nitrate which

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.920 
substitute and ammonium nitrate which
can<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.560> got<00:00:19.859> from<00:00:19.980> instant<00:00:20.160> cold<00:00:20.609> packs<00:00:23.930> okay

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
can be got from instant cold packs okay

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.000 
can be got from instant cold packs okay
so<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.619> need<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.189> weigh<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.880> our

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
so first we need to weigh out our

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.070 
so first we need to weigh out our
ammonium<00:00:29.010> nitrate

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
ammonium nitrate

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.459 
ammonium nitrate
so<00:00:32.030> the<00:00:33.030> quantity<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.930> using<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
so the quantity I'm going to be using is

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:52.630 
so the quantity I'm going to be using is
30<00:00:35.370> grams<00:00:38.930> so

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:02.110 

and<00:00:53.080> that<00:00:54.080> is<00:00:55.360> 30.00<00:00:56.360> grams<00:01:00.310> so<00:01:01.310> and<00:01:01.670> then<00:01:01.910> we

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
and that is 30.00 grams so and then we

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.530 
and that is 30.00 grams so and then we
need<00:01:02.240> to<00:01:02.300> add<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:03.580> minimal<00:01:04.580> amount<00:01:04.820> of<00:01:04.910> water<00:01:05.180> to

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
need to add a minimal amount of water to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.860 
need to add a minimal amount of water to
completely<00:01:05.720> dissolve<00:01:06.050> it<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.550> in<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.240> graduated

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
completely dissolve it so in a graduated

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.730 
completely dissolve it so in a graduated
cylinder<00:01:10.120> measure<00:01:11.120> out<00:01:11.360> 25<00:01:12.290> milliliters<00:01:12.740> of

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
cylinder measure out 25 milliliters of

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.160 
cylinder measure out 25 milliliters of
water<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.160> then<00:01:16.430> add<00:01:16.790> another<00:01:17.479> five<00:01:17.810> with<00:01:18.140> a

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
water and then add another five with a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.930 
water and then add another five with a
graduated<00:01:18.740> pipette<00:01:21.010> so<00:01:22.010> then<00:01:22.400> we<00:01:22.610> need<00:01:22.760> to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
graduated pipette so then we need to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.390 
graduated pipette so then we need to
filter<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.050> solution<00:01:24.220> into<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:27.130> conical<00:01:28.130> flask

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
filter the solution into a conical flask

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.930 
filter the solution into a conical flask
and<00:01:28.869> your<00:01:29.869> potassium<00:01:30.140> chloride<00:01:30.590> okay<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:31.520> here

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
and your potassium chloride okay so here

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.210 
and your potassium chloride okay so here
I<00:01:32.180> have<00:01:32.890> weighed<00:01:33.890> out<00:01:34.090> 30<00:01:35.500> point<00:01:36.500> zero<00:01:36.830> five

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
I have weighed out 30 point zero five

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.820 
I have weighed out 30 point zero five
grams<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:38.950> potassium<00:01:39.950> chloride<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:41.649> we<00:01:42.649> need

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
grams of potassium chloride and we need

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.490 
grams of potassium chloride and we need
to<00:01:43.869> filter<00:01:44.869> off<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.979> anti-caking<00:01:46.430> agent<00:01:47.060> in

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
to filter off the anti-caking agent in

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.340 
to filter off the anti-caking agent in
the<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.729> amoA<00:01:50.000> in<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.509> ammonium<00:01:50.899> nitrate

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
the in the amoA in the ammonium nitrate

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.380 
the in the amoA in the ammonium nitrate
solution<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:53.710> therefore<00:01:54.790> getting<00:01:55.790> rid

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
solution and and therefore getting rid

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.250 
solution and and therefore getting rid
of<00:01:56.420> all<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.720> contaminants<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:59.260> should

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
of all the contaminants so I should

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.899 
of all the contaminants so I should
explain<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.860> added<00:02:00.979> another<00:02:01.159> ten<00:02:01.640> point

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
explain that I added another ten point

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.719 
explain that I added another ten point
two<00:02:02.060> five<00:02:02.299> grams<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.990> ammonium<00:02:03.409> nitrate

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
two five grams of ammonium nitrate

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.240 
two five grams of ammonium nitrate
because<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:04.970> got<00:02:05.659> my<00:02:05.810> stoichiometry<00:02:06.250> slightly

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
because I got my stoichiometry slightly

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.710 
because I got my stoichiometry slightly
wrong<00:02:07.929> so<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.380> now<00:02:09.830> have<00:02:09.860> four<00:02:10.280> 2.25<00:02:11.090> grams<00:02:11.450> of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
wrong so I now have four 2.25 grams of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.199 
wrong so I now have four 2.25 grams of
ammonium<00:02:12.140> nitrate<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:15.519> thirty<00:02:16.519> point<00:02:16.940> zero

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
ammonium nitrate and thirty point zero

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.680 
ammonium nitrate and thirty point zero
five<00:02:17.450> grams<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:18.489> potassium<00:02:19.489> chloride<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.540> now

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
five grams of potassium chloride so now

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:34.300 
five grams of potassium chloride so now
we<00:02:20.750> need<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.230> filter<00:02:21.709> it

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.250 

okay<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.370> now<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.690> makes<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.050> fully

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
okay so now the that makes it fully

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.559 
okay so now the that makes it fully
filtered<00:02:37.709> through<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:38.970> going<00:02:39.540> to

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
filtered through and I'm going to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.820 
filtered through and I'm going to
transfer<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:44.569> mixture<00:02:45.569> from<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.379> beaker

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
transfer the mixture from this beaker

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.680 
transfer the mixture from this beaker
into<00:02:47.340> another<00:02:47.580> beaker<00:02:47.819> which<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.480> hot

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
into another beaker which is in a hot

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.930 
into another beaker which is in a hot
water<00:02:48.870> bath

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
water bath

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.520 
water bath
okay<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.000> I've<00:02:51.500> stirred<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:54.120> mixture<00:02:54.930> from

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
okay so I've stirred the mixture from

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.619 
okay so I've stirred the mixture from
the<00:02:56.660> from<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.810> flask<00:02:58.019> in<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> hot<00:02:58.440> water<00:02:58.620> bath

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
the from the flask in a hot water bath

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.809 
the from the flask in a hot water bath
to<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:01.170> point<00:03:01.410> where<00:03:01.560> there<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.709> no<00:03:02.040> residue<00:03:02.640> of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.070 

and<00:03:27.150> then<00:03:28.150> after<00:03:29.010> you've<00:03:30.010> got<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:31.080> mixture

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
and then after you've got the mixture

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.589 
and then after you've got the mixture
out<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:35.019> hot<00:03:35.590> water<00:03:35.860> bath<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:37.180> just<00:03:37.390> want

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
out of the hot water bath you just want

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.930 
out of the hot water bath you just want
to<00:03:37.690> transfer<00:03:38.379> it<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:39.150> another<00:03:40.150> beaker<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.940> put

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
to transfer it to another beaker and put

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.740 
to transfer it to another beaker and put
it<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.510> freezer<00:03:43.780> just<00:03:48.480> transfer<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.510> into

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
it in the freezer just transfer it into

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.800 
it in the freezer just transfer it into
this<00:03:50.250> Jam<00:03:51.250> glass<00:03:51.550> press<00:03:51.849> it<00:03:51.940> into<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.209> beaker

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
this Jam glass press it into the beaker

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:03.030 
this Jam glass press it into the beaker
it's<00:03:53.019> wedged<00:03:53.200> into<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.650> freezer<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.739> then

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
it's wedged into the freezer and then

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.710 
it's wedged into the freezer and then
you<00:04:03.340> just<00:04:03.610> got<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.970> leave<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:06.209> solution<00:04:07.209> in

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
you just got to leave the solution in

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.509 
you just got to leave the solution in
the<00:04:08.349> freezer<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:09.430> cool<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:11.140> we'll<00:04:12.040> see<00:04:12.250> what

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
the freezer to cool and we'll see what

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.229 
the freezer to cool and we'll see what
happens

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
happens

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.280 
happens
later<00:04:13.989> on<00:04:14.430> okay<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:15.489> it's<00:04:16.000> been<00:04:16.239> in<00:04:16.450> here<00:04:16.780> for

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
later on okay so it's been in here for

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.770 
later on okay so it's been in here for
about<00:04:17.609> two<00:04:18.609> hours<00:04:18.639> now<00:04:19.380> so<00:04:20.380> let's<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.889> look

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
about two hours now so let's have a look

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:31.170 
about two hours now so let's have a look
at<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:24.040> crystals<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:27.660> already<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:30.760> can<00:04:30.940> see

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
at the crystals and already you can see

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.719 
at the crystals and already you can see
a<00:04:31.590> good<00:04:33.720> sort<00:04:34.720> of<00:04:36.240> needle-like<00:04:37.979> crystals<00:04:38.979> easy

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
a good sort of needle-like crystals easy

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.690 
a good sort of needle-like crystals easy
and<00:04:39.850> better<00:04:40.000> there<00:04:41.100> but<00:04:42.100> I'm<00:04:42.340> going<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.580> leave

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
and better there but I'm going to leave

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.020 
and better there but I'm going to leave
them<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.000> here<00:04:43.300> overnight<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:45.639> fully

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
them in here overnight to fully

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.560 
them in here overnight to fully
crystallize<00:04:46.539> up<00:04:47.789> okay<00:04:48.789> so<00:04:48.850> having<00:04:49.090> been<00:04:49.330> in

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
crystallize up okay so having been in

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
crystallize up okay so having been in
the<00:04:49.780> freezer<00:04:50.260> overnight<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:52.120> here<00:04:52.590> pretty

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
the freezer overnight and here pretty

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.940 
the freezer overnight and here pretty
good<00:04:53.889> yield<00:04:54.280> of<00:04:54.580> potassium<00:04:55.360> nitrate<00:04:55.840> at<00:04:56.830> the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
good yield of potassium nitrate at the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:05.219 
good yield of potassium nitrate at the
bottom<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:59.639> we'll<00:05:00.639> get<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.850> beaker<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:04.229> they

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
bottom so we'll get a beaker and they

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:14.440 
bottom so we'll get a beaker and they
can<00:05:05.470> talk<00:05:05.740> we<00:05:07.020> look<00:05:08.020> good

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.220 

now<00:05:15.170> you<00:05:15.230> can<00:05:15.530> see<00:05:15.770> our<00:05:16.690> wet<00:05:17.690> potassium

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
now you can see our wet potassium

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.620 
now you can see our wet potassium
nitrate<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.890> there<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:19.580> my<00:05:19.880> product<00:05:20.240> of

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
nitrate and there is my product of

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.460 
nitrate and there is my product of
potassium<00:05:21.260> nitrate<00:05:22.810> so<00:05:23.810> I'm<00:05:24.140> going<00:05:24.290> to<00:05:24.380> leave

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
potassium nitrate so I'm going to leave

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.850 
potassium nitrate so I'm going to leave
it<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.710> dry<00:05:25.630> thoroughly<00:05:26.630> throughout<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.650> day

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
it to dry thoroughly throughout the day

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.270 
it to dry thoroughly throughout the day
and<00:05:28.130> then<00:05:29.000> I'll<00:05:29.650> show<00:05:30.650> it<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.920> you<00:05:31.010> when<00:05:31.130> I

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
and then I'll show it to you when I

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.560 
and then I'll show it to you when I
dried<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:31.850> crushed<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.570> crystals<00:05:32.990> there<00:05:33.860> are

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
dried and crushed the crystals there are

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.900 
dried and crushed the crystals there are
23<00:05:35.570> grams<00:05:35.840> of<00:05:36.200> pretty<00:05:37.190> pure<00:05:37.520> potassium

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
23 grams of pretty pure potassium

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.520 
23 grams of pretty pure potassium
nitrate<00:05:38.890> so<00:05:39.890> oh<00:05:40.310> this<00:05:41.150> is<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.360> pretty<00:05:42.110> good<00:05:42.290> year

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
nitrate so oh this is a pretty good year

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.240 
nitrate so oh this is a pretty good year
for<00:05:42.560> me

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
for me

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.700 
for me
because<00:05:44.120> I<00:05:44.630> knew<00:05:45.020> that<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.320> theoretical

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
because I knew that the theoretical

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.630 
because I knew that the theoretical
yield<00:05:46.070> was<00:05:46.490> 39<00:05:47.090> grams<00:05:47.590> but<00:05:48.590> I<00:05:48.800> knew<00:05:49.040> that<00:05:49.070> 13

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
yield was 39 grams but I knew that 13

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.100 
yield was 39 grams but I knew that 13
grams<00:05:50.000> of<00:05:50.300> it<00:05:50.390> would<00:05:50.510> dissolve<00:05:50.660> in<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.020> water

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
grams of it would dissolve in the water

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.380 
grams of it would dissolve in the water
and<00:05:51.770> wouldn't<00:05:52.130> be<00:05:52.310> wouldn't<00:05:52.730> recrystallize

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
and wouldn't be wouldn't recrystallize

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.330 
and wouldn't be wouldn't recrystallize
out<00:05:53.570> so<00:05:53.780> I<00:05:53.810> knew<00:05:54.050> that<00:05:54.080> 26<00:05:54.740> grams<00:05:55.010> was<00:05:55.220> the

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
out so I knew that 26 grams was the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.120 
out so I knew that 26 grams was the
maximum<00:05:56.020> which<00:05:57.020> means<00:05:57.050> that<00:05:57.680> I've<00:05:57.860> got<00:05:58.100> a

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
maximum which means that I've got a

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.740 
maximum which means that I've got a
theoretical<00:05:58.940> yield<00:05:59.210> of<00:05:59.570> about<00:06:00.280> 90%<00:06:01.600> which<00:06:02.600> is

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
theoretical yield of about 90% which is

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.890 
theoretical yield of about 90% which is
pretty<00:06:02.960> good<00:06:03.200> for<00:06:03.460> someone<00:06:04.460> like<00:06:04.580> me<00:06:04.900> so

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
pretty good for someone like me so

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.900 
pretty good for someone like me so
that's<00:06:06.350> how<00:06:06.500> you<00:06:06.560> make<00:06:06.680> potassium<00:06:07.490> nitrate

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
that's how you make potassium nitrate

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.670 
that's how you make potassium nitrate
