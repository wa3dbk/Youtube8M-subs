00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.580
 probably the most important car of the 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.410
 This year's car salons in Paris stands 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.269
 on the stand of vw the gulf of 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.860
 Seventh generation will be from his fans 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.169
 expected and from the competition 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.269
 dreaded 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.890
 In terms of consumption, VW has some in 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.239
 move set around the new golf 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.039
 to make it more efficient 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.079
 but not only new engines alone 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.399
 was sufficient for this in all areas 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:35.170
 meticulous detail work was needed for 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.030
 us designer was the subject of efficiency 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.010
 Aerodynamics a huge challenge 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.019
 we have the new golf aerodynamics 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.800
 designed and at the bluemotion 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.030
 Variant again refilled with 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.980
 special spoilers in the back part 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.410
 area of ​​the vehicle around there 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.170
 demolition edges form the again 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.679
 a significant cw value projection 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.629
 to back up 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.339
 the bluemotion variant is the 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.019
 sparmeister among the golf versions 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.030
 but it will be one again 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.390
 sporty golf against clear that is 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.860
 traditionally the gti has the new gti 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.170
 over his predecessor once again 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.610
 ten horsepower will increase and make 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.550
 now 220 ps enough for 246 km / h 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.130
 top speed and a 6.6 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.300
 seconds sprint from the stand to 100 km 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.280
 h but also the golf with the rimmed 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.990
 grille has become more efficient 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.350
 he should be on average six 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.080
 Satisfy liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.150
 no matter if gti or not the golf 7 is 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.960
 without exaggeration probably the best golf 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.820
 that ever existed 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.400
 optically as desired by the customer 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.870
 rather an evolution technically one 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.430
 revolution 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.560
 the newest technologies also concerning 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.660
 the safety of both the active 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.300
 Security with assistance systems as 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.350
 also with passive safety 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.810
 restraint systems between structure 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.840
 Disputes are the golf built 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.960
 The golf is absolutely on the great stand 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.760
 the technology and offers everything currently 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.440
 is feasible at the entry price 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.550
 compared to the predecessor remained the same 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.470
 is there with the seventh generation 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.470
 now golf for the money
