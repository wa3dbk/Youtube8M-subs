00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.779
 or the cherubs that you are before 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.180
 to start with the questions we're going to 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.969
 move to the mill that we had in the aquarium 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.849
 small 40 liters with brackish water to the 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.219
 160-liter aquarium where there is water 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.840
 normal sweet mainly we are going to 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.279
 make this change because with the months 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.170
 I've been seeing that there's not much 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.270
 difference between the water aquarium 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.490
 brackish with the moli and aquarium of water 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.170
 sweet I will not acclimatize you a 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.060
 aquarium to the other one because as you can see 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.160
 in the video is an aquarium next to the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.469
 another and I have them with the same quality of 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.420
 water and the same parameters the mill 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.890
 big male that you see go through there what 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.170
 I have tried to dedicate in all ways 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.760
 possible and I have not managed to improve 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.739
 situation that has anyway 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.480
 it seems that it has survived and for now 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.030
 there is good throughout the whole 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.920
 recording seems to be that this little 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.410
 I died as is normal in every aquarium 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.030
 again it has gone a little pale but 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.770
 with the passage of minutes it has gone 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.140
 adapting and we have also put a 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.719
 little bit of food to get used to 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.699
 little faster as usual and from 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.289
 moment it seems that everything is going well so 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.570
 we'll see how it goes in future videos 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.090
 tomás and I crazy says hello I've seen almost 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.460
 all your videos I have an aquarium of 130 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.740
 with six bronze runners eight guppies 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.570
 eight little zebras and a couple has seen 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.670
 grama ramírez and they gave me a gift 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.140
 40 liter full aquarium 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.390
 well there I can put a appear of 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.369
 ramirez and it's only for them to raise with their 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.979
 plants and trunk the biotope plan for 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.659
 the two fish just tell me about that or 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.549
 I could put some correctors 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.750
 also with the ramires and with what 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.159
 you know on guard philias when you 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.079
 you will buy a large aquarium with 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.329
 difficult fish varieties that what 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.340
 let's see you're a crack an aquarium of 40 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.079
 liters to reproduce reality if it's 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.459
 well and in fact it is what is recommended 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.110
 although it can be done in trees more 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.670
 big clear is with enough 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.619
 vegetation and some trunks and 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.390
 hiding places keeping good changes of 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.069
 water so it is super clean and no 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.810
 there are problems in the putting would not put 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.849
 the runners that are definitely going to 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.770
 eat some fingerlings on the subject 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.719
 of putting difficult fish in my aquariums 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.189
 at the moment you can not afford melo but it's 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.349
 one of the future ideas for the channel 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.849
 nor with health says hello daily in 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.420
 aquarium when I was making a change 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.030
 of water 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.099
 the lamp that is of these exploded 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.079
 because water came in and everything fell into the aquarium 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.819
 what to get everything but it will be that the 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.889
 chemicals that has the focus that does not 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.650
 they hurt these light bulbs contain 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.829
 mercury vapor inside your post 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.510
 or apparently when they get wet it explodes me 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.790
 It has been difficult to find out but it is supposed 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.500
 that when the bulb explodes though 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.599
 has very little mercury 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.159
 should fall to the bottom of the aquarium so 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.079
 that the best thing I think it would be to go 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.720
 forming little by little more or less each 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.640
 two days a part of the fund removing the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.590
 less in each change 30 percent 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.599
 of water so there is not a big 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.159
 impact on bacteria and from 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.299
 there simply to cross the fingers already 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.790
 see if the aquarium does not have any 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.829
 problem anthony dejesús says hello jose 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.019
 Greetings again you know I have a 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.720
 I wanted that this embuchada is one of the 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.459
 the chromatic video euros but I do not know how 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.349
 I'm going to feed the fry you could 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.209
 help me with what I have to give them in 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.040
 these moments is already in the first 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.930
 within the same community aquarium 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.060
 after they go where I owe them 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.889
 place I can leave them inside the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.409
 paridera or should I place them in a new 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.780
 aquarium the female will take an average of 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.519
 21 days according to the temperature in releasing 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.139
 the fry of the mouth then at 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.689
 take so long to release the 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.239
 fry is supposed to be 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.459
 outside the container to control 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.799
 your area and a few days before his 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.190
 21 days put it in the container for 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.350
 That 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.210
 the fry in this way would you get 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.710
 that most of them lived 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.660
 you can also leave the female 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.640
 loose by the aquarium so that she 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.440
 welcome your area and have quietly to 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.270
 the fry on their own will take care of them and 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.920
 others like other secrets but you 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.720
 you risk that some other fry will 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.580
 die or eat the other fish the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.080
 essential nutrition should be with 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.150
 artemia and reaction hatched or 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.070
 If you can not, you can also 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.810
 you can give him frozen food for fish 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.430
 but well crushed you can also 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.980
 use food for cichlids 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.320
 adults but well crushed or porridges 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.900
 as for example with components like 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.000
 seafood fish or crustaceans and everything 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.530
 rest do not doubt that if you take the fish 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.690
 for the aquarium and they are not yet what 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.520
 Large enough other fish 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.800
 they will eat them once they have acquired 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.420
 certain size so they do not eat them and 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.490
 your aquarium is big enough 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.380
 you could provide them with enough hiding places 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.570
 where they only fit and do not fit 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.130
 the adult fish and release them by the 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.230
 aquarium in the opposite case his 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.180
 would be to put them in another aquarium reyna dre 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.120
 and says I have a question I have a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.200
 Aquarium of 99 long by 45 high 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.660
 by 40 wide 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.850
 I have several fish and placed plants and 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.950
 I change them almost constantly since 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.990
 the time die they would like to put them 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.460
 but I'm afraid that it hurts my fish 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.710
 would like to know how to do it 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.660
 correctly thank you although you have a 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.430
 aquarium of about 180 liters and there are already 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.650
 a lot with times and it's going to be a chore 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.280
 long and heavy the best way to pay 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.230
 your aquarium 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.970
 would be to put a very nutritious substrate 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.920
 little by little it is to say if it was to give a 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.720
 corner of the aquarium and below the 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.610
 gravel put a couple of handfuls of the fertilizer 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.620
 in one or two days do the same 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.600
 operation and so on until 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.760
 complete the aquarium this must be like this 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.070
 for normal nutritive substrates 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.630
 because otherwise intoxicate already in 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.430
 water although you must know that today in 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.890
 day there are also other substrates that are 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.900
 nutritious and do not need to be capped if 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.820
 you get them because you take away many 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.650
 middle steps after this subscriber 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.970
 you can plant quietly in fact 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.620
 it is very possible that the plants do not 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.900
 ask for fertilizer during the first weeks 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.430
 then it will be necessary to prune according to the 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.170
 type of plants that you put and which you 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.000
 I recommend starting easy on 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.920
 everything of fast growth since these 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.960
 plants among other things besides that 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.780
 they will grow easily they will help you with 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.820
 the diego algae question hello I have a 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.560
 I doubt I have a crescent beta and a 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.210
 beta female but I want to know how old 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.340
 must have the beta to be able 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.800
 put eggs in the nest that made the 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.080
 beta thanks for your help the beta 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.669
 can be reproduced after 5 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.330
 weeks or something else but it's not 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.669
 recommendable 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.610
 Ideally, starting at 6 months or 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.750
 better the 9 as many already know 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.940
 reproduce fish at an age too 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.610
 early results in parents 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.889
 they end up having bad health that they die 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.120
 or that the fry also happens what 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.160
 same why when we go to buy 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.110
 new fish is better not to buy the 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.669
 awarded because we do not know the age 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.470
 of the fish or who's the reign 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.520
 since if it 's from a brother then 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.960
 there will also be problems 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.610
 well I did not want the day to come 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.470
 I had to say this but 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.570
 lately I am no longer able to answer 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.940
 all your doubts by much with 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.710
 effort is impossible to reach everyone and 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.630
 I think the only thing left to do 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.460
 is to try to improve the videos and 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.320
 answer as best you can in each one 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.509
 of them I hope you understand it though 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.180
 if any of you who subscribe 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.919
 I would understand it and I would see it 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.840
 normal as my main idea was 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.090
 answer all but good too 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.889
 another of the main ideas is to make 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.090
 videos to help people so 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.639
 I would continue doing them with all my 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.560
 efforts and I will try to help them 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.689
