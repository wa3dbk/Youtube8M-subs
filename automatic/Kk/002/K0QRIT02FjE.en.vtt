00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
towards his inhibitor to it so as I'm

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.120 
towards his inhibitor to it so as I'm
not<00:01:34.049> too<00:01:34.170> sure<00:01:34.350> he<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.560> keep<00:01:34.710> them<00:01:34.890> away<00:01:35.100> from

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130

this<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.670> did<00:01:35.970> keeping<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.329> damage<00:01:36.659> down

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
this one I did keeping that damage down

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
this one I did keeping that damage down
going<00:01:37.049> down<00:01:37.110> bottom<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.979> joint<00:01:38.130> house<00:01:38.400> gone

going down bottom in a joint house gone

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.010 
going down bottom in a joint house gone
down<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:38.909> that's<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.180> inhibitor<00:01:39.689> s'alright

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
down but that's an inhibitor s'alright

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.679 
down but that's an inhibitor s'alright
but<00:01:40.470> gammak<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.700> incredible<00:01:41.850> they're

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
but gammak that's incredible they're

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.030 
but gammak that's incredible they're
just<00:01:42.899> built<00:01:43.110> an<00:01:43.229> exposé<00:01:43.500> inhibitor<00:01:43.890> that's

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
just built an exposé inhibitor that's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880 
just built an exposé inhibitor that's
massive<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> 13-minute<00:01:46.170> inhibitor<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
massive that is a 13-minute inhibitor to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
massive that is a 13-minute inhibitor to
that<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.280> very<00:01:47.610> quick<00:01:47.970> there<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.750> does

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that is very quick there and it does

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
that is very quick there and it does

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
dragon of course he did a damage down I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.120 
dragon of course he did a damage down I

think that was all cyanide hoping he

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.440 
think that was all cyanide hoping he
could<00:01:59.250> catch<00:01:59.490> something<00:01:59.520> out<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.210> instead

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
