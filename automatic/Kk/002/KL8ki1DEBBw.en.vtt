00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hello everyone, I am William. Dr. Anzeleg 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Welcome to the Muse Anti-aging Channel 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 I want to share good news with you here. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Every day, our life expectancy will be extended by six hours. You are not mistaken, it is six hours! 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Increase by 25% every day! 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 From the 20th century to the 21st century 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 The average life expectancy of human beings has been extended from 45 to 85 years old. Why? 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 Because we are getting healthier! 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 But what is the definition of healthier? 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.599
 The word "health" is very important to us. 

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.599
 We must understand health! 

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:14.599
 Health is an important issue that people all over the world care about. 

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:22.599
 The ancient Greeks believed that health comes from a perfect physiological balance. 

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:28.599
 For Indians, health means living in harmony with nature. 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:39.600
 Chinese ancestors believe that health is the reaction of energy, that is, "qi" 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.599
 Western health care, with a focus on disease and treatment 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:57.599
 Based on the concept of science and experiment, millions of people have continued their lives and their life expectancy has been greatly extended. 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:03.599
 The extension of life is gratifying and brings new ideas to our society. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 We are no longer so concerned about treating diseases or saving lives, but instead demanding the quality of life. 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.180
 For most people, health means "no disease." 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.659
 "I am not sick, so I am very healthy!" 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.740
 this is not right! 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:36.259
 All chronic diseases will be detected over the years and will enhance or weaken our physical, psychological and emotional conditions. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:47.099
 Already deeply rooted in our genes or habits that may be overweight or eating 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.900
 Such definition of health is not enough, scientists need a new indicator 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.000
 How do we optimize our health? 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.539
 How do we set clear indicators so that we can say aloud 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.699
 "I am very healthy!" 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.780
 Or "My health is very good!" 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.219
 "My physical and mental state is so good that I can't be better!" 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.479
 In order to optimize health, scientists have changed their perspectives to think 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.180
 They study how the human body responds to environmental changes or stress 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:42.300
 Detecting the ability and speed of the body to return to a healthy state after undergoing changes or stress 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.780
 They call this ability "body balance" 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:04:00.899
 Body balance refers to the ability of the body to remain stable when faced with a constantly changing environment. 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.039
 This is a scientific definition 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.840
 In order to understand this basic concept, we can think about it. 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:23.800
 Suppose we are all born on the cable between the two towers. 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:35.300
 Our parents, everyoneâ€™s parents, are people who live on the cable 24 hours a day. 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:48.819
 In order to avoid falling, it is always necessary to maintain dynamic balance. 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.439
 Dynamic balance not only affects hundreds of muscles in the body, but also refers to all human functions and five senses. 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.620
 Their brains will assess strategic choices and emotional management when faced with danger 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.840
 And this is the state of 24 hours a day! 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
 This is the balance of the body! 

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:24.479
 Life is two extreme but complementary forces, criss-crossing 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:35.020
 On the one hand, we have the power to drive the biochemical reactions in the body and consume energy. 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:46.180
 On the other hand, we also have the power of static, like sleep will alleviate biochemical reactions and energy consumption. 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:52.479
 Our goal is to switch between static and dynamic 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.160
 Homeostasis is the most appropriate response to constant changes 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.960
 And permanent change is the core of life. 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.259
 The human body has to deal with thousands of changes every second. 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.800
 And must quickly restore balance 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.080
 When we lose this ability to adjust, we will get sick and then age 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.500
 Finally, we still have to go back to how to define health issues. 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:31.899
 Modern human health refers to the body's ability to adapt to constant changes. 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.779
 This ability to adapt can be achieved through a complex but consistent, well-organized system 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.600
 Create a state of balance that is often challenged and exhibits dynamic ups and downs 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:57.900
 If this fine balance is continuously endangered, it will lead to loss of body function. 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:04.800
 The result is a lesion, including aging 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.039
 Muse understands the importance of homeostasis 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:19.220
 The goal of the full range of products is to strengthen the ability to rebuild balance 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:26.160
 ........... 

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:34.479
 Feile Youth Capsule helps to extend telomeres and reverse the aging forces that make telomeres shorter 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.879
 This is the young generation of Muse! 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.200
 I am William. Anzeleg...I am the young generation of Muse! 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.379
 Thank you for watching, we will see you next time!
