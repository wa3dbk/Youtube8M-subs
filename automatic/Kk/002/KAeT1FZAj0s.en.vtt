in<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:51.490> in<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.790> environment<00:02:52.860> I'm<00:02:53.860> going<00:02:54.100> to

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
in that in that environment I'm going to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.930 
in that in that environment I'm going to
stop<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.730> test<00:02:55.000> voluntary<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.950> use

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
stop that test voluntary and then use

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.410 
stop that test voluntary and then use
the<00:02:58.120> same<00:02:58.420> dialogue<00:02:59.130> from<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.340> beginning<00:03:00.790> to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
the same dialogue from the beginning to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.660 
the same dialogue from the beginning to
localize<00:03:01.870> in<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.410> portion<00:03:02.650> map<00:03:02.920> go<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.400> that

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
localize in that portion map go to that

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.910 
localize in that portion map go to that
all<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.030> have<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.270> do<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.570> good<00:03:04.780> test<00:03:05.110> localize

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
all you have to do is good test localize

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.410 
all you have to do is good test localize
and<00:03:06.840> then<00:03:07.840> by<00:03:08.739> using<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:09.220> same<00:03:09.489> system<00:03:10.000> this

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
and then by using the same system this

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.590 
and then by using the same system this
is<00:03:10.600> how<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.680> system<00:03:12.070> works<00:03:12.370> now<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:12.850> keep<00:03:13.270> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
is how the system works now and keep the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.440 
is how the system works now and keep the
robot<00:03:13.930> localized<00:03:14.410> cheers<00:03:15.130> by<00:03:15.370> using<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
multicolor localization stability test

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.750 
multicolor localization stability test
and<00:03:21.070> anytime<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> quick<00:03:23.920> view<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.250> what

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
and anytime this is a quick view of what

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.090 
and anytime this is a quick view of what
cuddle<00:03:25.540> can<00:03:25.720> do<00:03:25.930> in<00:03:26.170> terms<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:26.500> localization

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
cuddle can do in terms of localization

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.550 
cuddle can do in terms of localization
with<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.120> data<00:03:28.330> you've<00:03:28.900> seen<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.350> it's

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
with the data you've seen that it's

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.530 
with the data you've seen that it's
possible<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:30.280> localize<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:30.970> complete<00:03:31.330> map

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
possible to localize in a complete map

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.560 
possible to localize in a complete map
or<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.110> also<00:03:32.290> possible<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.920> localize<00:03:33.570> just

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
or it's also possible to localize just

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.019 
or it's also possible to localize just
by<00:03:34.810> using<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.470> partial<00:03:36.100> map<00:03:36.900> thank<00:03:37.900> you
