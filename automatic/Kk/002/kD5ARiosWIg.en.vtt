00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 surely you will have heard them in 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.810
 repeated occasions that we encourage the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 Good reading, then, Martin appeared now 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.849
 reinforce this message with some tips 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.849
 in this section that is your improvement 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.810
 thanks to new ideas we enter this 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.730
 section of your operations where we are going to 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.770
 know a little more about the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.080
 importance of reading reading 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.790
 quick but its good understanding more 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.560
 clear that filtering well how about miguel 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.020
 guzmán movement that good too 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.750
 record me here hey how nice it is to have 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.980
 a chance to read fast I've had 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.260
 the possibility to meet people who read 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.600
 thousands of words per minute and what 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.150
 they understand everything that is outrageous this 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.400
 It is truly impressive because 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.989
 Sometimes you want to read fast and you go 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.870
 losing the idea and you have to go back 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.629
 and you have to pick up good not at first 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.870
 Let's not forget that reading is 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.600
 as they say a habit then if you 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.739
 you do not have the habit of reading 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.659
 constantly the brain does not establish 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.450
 the neuron connections needed to 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.280
 achieve it then one practice but 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.100
 there are tips that will help you 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.200
 understand reading for example what 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.170
 first thing you have to understand is our 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.479
 brain when he can not read very fast 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.580
 it does it with an area of ​​the hemisphere 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.290
 left what does this mean 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.260
 in the left hemisphere is made 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.460
 for maths for reading 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.330
 precisely to articulate the language 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.150
 and others but we can know the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.910
 world that means this all there is a thousand 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.770
 things that for those to know that 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.560
 are happening you do not use the reason 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.410
 example if you are driving a car 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.140
 and you do not have to reason to give yourself 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.320
 mind that you hit without explaining if you 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.390
 you see you turn to a fruit bowl and you see a mango 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.100
 and a banana not if you 're reasoning for 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.580
 write down the difference 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.580
 that is called cognitive process 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.080
 cognitive you know the world 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.740
 go ahead and practice 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.560
 good the words the reading also 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.709
 works with the cognitive process is 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.220
 say you see a word and you do not have to 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.290
 read it your console as the touch pad 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.200
 as a block you just with seeing your 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.850
 automatically overcome the brain you 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.410
 lets know that the word is 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.940
 saying overcoming and with the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.950
 training is the whole sheet I want 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.000
 think not with training what 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.030
 do you see 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.130
 the words do not read the words but 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.900
 know the words you hear Martin and 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.939
 have some 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.269
 I know it has utility but it has some 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:46.400
 end read fast so that occasionally 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:48.650
 For example, a lawyer does not depend because 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.569
 they are right that is to read is a pleasure and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.030
 we should sit down rich with coffee 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.220
 more and give us the time to do this 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.609
 in fact it is what forms the habit 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.409
 correct reading exactly and that 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.629
 it is correct we can not deny it without 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.180
 However, think of a lawyer who has 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.220
 have to review 10 trials in a day in a 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.680
 tomorrow and you have to arrive and ask for the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.560
 records and draw the conclusions 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.959
 I need a quick lesson but I do not know 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.409
 explain in the matter of people that 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.450
 is dedicated to that is inferred the exact 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:23.659
 perfect or a college student 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.790
 you have to read and take an analysis 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.500
 synthesis and have to submit it for 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.170
 in two days if you want to do the best 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.290
 possible not then there are many moments 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.290
 of utility and then we use a 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.239
 technique where each person in their homes 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.580
 can take a text the one that the 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.430
 prefer 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.040
 do the following take a pen one 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.230
 preferably one ink pen 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.070
 different from the one they are reading and 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.830
 place a point above the words 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.140
 from the line to the middle of the word 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.900
 Above, put a period in each word 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.540
 in each word a little dot and 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.990
 get used to that when you are reading 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.970
 they see the point and they know the word truth 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.160
 in one stroke see her so single blow 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.900
 but this technique helps a lot you 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.150
 you are going to focus on the point that is 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.550
 above the word in the lower half you 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.470
 You are looking at the points but allow your 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.330
 brain this is practical they are not going to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.370
 do to the first one is impossible that's 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.160
 practice but you will allow your 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.730
 brain that knows the words 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.640
 and you're going to start feeling that moment 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.850
 where your reading starts to flow 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.490
 wonderful way without worshiping you of 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.680
 discern the letters and then that is 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.969
 a technique that helps a lot the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.369
 next technique that helps the very same 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.799
 I said it and it has to do with 

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:50.619
 understanding that is what he said insta ua 

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:54.789
 compression valve said yes you are 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:56.860
 able to draw it you have understood it if 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.259
 did not explain what does this mean if you're 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.529
 able to draw it you have understood it is 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:05.439
 that we all have the ability 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:08.229
 than the ability to visualize what is 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:10.029
 is saying we are visualizing if 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.429
 right now the friends who are watching us 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:15.009
 on television for example say start 

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:17.709
 with a story once when I went 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.929
 to the sinkhole he was walking 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:21.579
 between the two mountains to the bottom and 

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:24.099
 accelerate the view 

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:26.529
 I saw an eagle flying in the blue sky 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.839
 Now all the people were imagining what 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.939
 I was saying everyone was watching 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.709
 in your mind that's why you can understand me 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.479
 but if I start talking about a 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:36.399
 atomic particle accelerator in 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.589
 germany and I say that the accelerator 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:41.289
 particle atomic projects the 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:44.019
 photons and the moment they crash 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.299
 and the roll in all the moles is that it 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:48.740
 break in the tachyons between people 

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:51.500
 can not see what I'm saying 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.470
 if you mentally can not see what 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.680
 you are reading you are not understanding 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.610
 If you did not explain that complete, it's better 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.849
 make a stop a stop and say what 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.680
 is this that I can not visualize why 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.169
 ainstein the very instant said 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:13.039
 see how strong if you are able to 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.539
 draw it you have understood that you want 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.440
 say forget the drawing for you 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.000
 can you draw 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.310
 first you have to see you have to 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.159
 visualize first if you visualize drawings 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.080
 but if you do not visualize that you draw and 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:26.120
 that people when they read also 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.990
 of the puntito council besides that 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.940
 advice need to go visualizing what 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.470
 is reading at the speed that is going 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.319
 reading as when they talk to you 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.849
 gossip tells you at high speed and 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.889
 you visualize this everything perfectly 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.860
 well and without problems is the same when 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.360
 you are reading and when you visualize what 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.130
 have you understood whether the idea is not 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.930
 concentrate on reading word by word 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.330
 follow the lines but at the time 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.500
 you are seeing the letters go visualizing 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.729
 exactly if you can advance faster 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.710
 very fast and with understanding they go 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:58.839
 learn the people who practice it 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.729
 well then if you need this type 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:03.129
 of long technique since no and if not 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:05.469
 read calmly and a coffee is very 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.849
 good the shape of the beautiful additive in the 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:09.249
 straight line practice of the boiled 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:12.009
 accelerating portugal and goal in its 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:13.599
 objective intelligence dot com for more 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.159
 information although there are many thanks 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.930
 more thanks tomorrow we're going to 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:18.729
 see the handle of the new the honor 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.849
 so what is the honor let's see 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.849
 morning
