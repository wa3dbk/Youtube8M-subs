00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
which basically means Walt they no

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.900 
which basically means Walt they no
longer<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.860> zero<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.220> another<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.730> one

set your scoreboard to 1001 so um see
here<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:49.650> gonna<00:03:49.799> set<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.130> 1001<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:52.010> it's

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
here it's gonna set it to 1001 and it's

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.280 
here it's gonna set it to 1001 and it's
actually<00:03:53.280> looking<00:03:53.579> for<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> player<00:03:54.480> whose

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
actually looking for a player whose

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.220 
actually looking for a player whose
score<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.769> 1001<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.700> that's<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.060> maximum<00:03:57.390> so

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
score is 1001 and that's the maximum so

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.590 
score is 1001 and that's the maximum so
here<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.769> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.100> set<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.370> past<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.359> so

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
here is going to set it past that so

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.710 
here is going to set it past that so
they<00:04:00.810> can't<00:04:01.109> actually<00:04:01.320> get<00:04:01.560> diamonds<00:04:01.799> anymore

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
they can't actually get diamonds anymore

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.530 
they can't actually get diamonds anymore
so<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:04.019> makes<00:04:04.560> sense<00:04:04.620> yeah<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.519> know<00:04:05.640> that

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
so that makes sense yeah you know that

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.810 
so that makes sense yeah you know that
should<00:04:06.690> make<00:04:06.810> sense<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.320> yeah<00:04:08.160> if<00:04:08.430> it's<00:04:08.609> not

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
should make sense and yeah if it's not

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.849 
should make sense and yeah if it's not
the<00:04:09.030> correct<00:04:09.239> item<00:04:09.630> basically<00:04:10.019> it'll<00:04:10.500> sit<00:04:10.799> in

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
the correct item basically it'll sit in

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.620 
the correct item basically it'll sit in
this<00:04:10.920> hopper<00:04:11.220> for<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.430> couple<00:04:11.640> seconds<00:04:11.940> you'll

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
this hopper for a couple seconds you'll

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.849 
this hopper for a couple seconds you'll
see<00:04:12.840> but<00:04:13.049> then<00:04:13.170> it's<00:04:13.290> actually<00:04:13.560> we're<00:04:13.650> going

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
see but then it's actually we're going

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.310 
see but then it's actually we're going
to<00:04:14.100> replace<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.299> hopper<00:04:15.660> with<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.200> new

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
to replace the hopper with the new

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.930 
to replace the hopper with the new
hopper<00:04:16.500> with<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.100> coming<00:04:17.310> block<00:04:17.489> there<00:04:17.729> so

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
hopper with that coming block there so

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.499 
hopper with that coming block there so
that<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:19.079> hopper<00:04:19.289> doesn't<00:04:19.590> get<00:04:19.709> congest

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 
that this hopper doesn't get congest

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.480 
that this hopper doesn't get congest
so<00:04:21.139> I<00:04:21.169> hope<00:04:21.350> that<00:04:21.500> makes<00:04:21.620> sense<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.949> you<00:04:22.250> guys

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490
