set then you have a stronger set and
this<00:02:03.570> set<00:02:03.810> has<00:02:03.960> been<00:02:04.229> extremely<00:02:05.009> extremely

actually that I figured out myself
of<00:02:14.030> when<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.120> look<00:02:15.239> at<00:02:15.359> em<00:02:15.480> 15<00:02:15.659> look<00:02:16.140> at<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
pain lambs you're just like why did they

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.110 
pain lambs you're just like why did they
print<00:02:18.629> five<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.109> them<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.609> why<00:02:20.609> did<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.909> print

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
print five of them and why did it print

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.179

the five enemy colors when they have

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.640 
the five enemy colors when they have
pretty<00:02:23.939> much<00:02:24.060> stated<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.049> they<00:02:25.230> want<00:02:25.469> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
pretty much stated that they want the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.410 
pretty much stated that they want the
block<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.280> stable<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.849> one<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.209> colors

block to be stable and one of the colors

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.580 
block to be stable and one of the colors
to<00:02:27.719> be<00:02:27.920> no<00:02:28.920> fair<00:02:29.909> and<00:02:30.150> balanced<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:30.870> block<00:02:31.170> play

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
to be no fair and balanced so block play

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.530 
to be no fair and balanced so block play
which<00:02:32.129> is<00:02:32.280> more<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.879> more<00:02:33.000> important<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
which is more and more important to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.899 
which is more and more important to
whether<00:02:33.719> the<00:02:33.930> coast<00:02:34.139> is<00:02:34.349> people<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.370> design

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
whether the coast is people can design

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.940 
whether the coast is people can design
different<00:02:36.329> decks<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.439> only<00:02:37.530> have<00:02:37.739> five

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
different decks but you only have five

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.860 
different decks but you only have five
of<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.250> enemy<00:02:38.549> colors<00:02:38.879> when<00:02:39.090> they<00:02:39.209> had<00:02:39.450> stated

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
of the enemy colors when they had stated

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.140 
of the enemy colors when they had stated
that<00:02:40.139> from<00:02:40.680> now<00:02:40.829> on<00:02:40.859> they<00:02:41.280> want<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.519> print<00:02:41.700> ten

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that from now on they want to print ten

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.539 
that from now on they want to print ten
ten<00:02:42.480> ten<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.989> want<00:02:43.139> to<00:02:43.200> print<00:02:43.349> all<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.859> duel

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
ten ten you want to print all the duel

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.970 
ten ten you want to print all the duel
and<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.060> enemy<00:02:45.209> colors<00:02:45.689> it<00:02:46.470> might<00:02:46.709> be<00:02:46.950> a

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
and the enemy colors it might be a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.250 
and the enemy colors it might be a
reason<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.639> and<00:02:47.970> logically<00:02:48.870> make<00:02:49.019> sense

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
reason for that and logically make sense

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.940 
reason for that and logically make sense
to<00:02:49.439> me<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:50.659> why<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.720> next<00:02:52.290> step<00:02:52.439> will<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.620> very

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
to me but why the next step will be very

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.069 
to me but why the next step will be very
good<00:02:53.280> or<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:54.120> land<00:02:54.389> I'm<00:02:54.629> not<00:02:54.750> saying<00:02:54.959> that

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
good or the land I'm not saying that

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.080 
good or the land I'm not saying that
link<00:02:55.500> will<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.919> next<00:02:56.069> step<00:02:56.430> I'm<00:02:56.790> saying

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
link will be in the next step I'm saying

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.220 
link will be in the next step I'm saying
that<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.389> legs<00:02:57.629> should<00:02:58.019> be<00:02:58.579> at<00:02:59.579> least

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
that the legs should be at least

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.720 
that the legs should be at least
balloting<00:03:01.230> these<00:03:01.409> skylands<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.280> don't<00:03:02.549> know<00:03:02.639> if

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
balloting these skylands I don't know if

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
balloting these skylands I don't know if
they<00:03:02.819> will<00:03:02.849> be<00:03:03.090> good<00:03:03.299> as<00:03:03.359> these<00:03:03.750> shock<00:03:04.019> lines

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
they will be good as these shock lines

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.729 
they will be good as these shock lines
but<00:03:05.750> maybe<00:03:06.750> there<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.049> totally<00:03:07.500> different

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
but maybe there are totally different

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.690 
but maybe there are totally different
lands<00:03:09.169> however<00:03:10.169> they<00:03:10.319> shirt<00:03:10.650> sheep<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.310> surd

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
lands however they shirt sheep the surd

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.339 
lands however they shirt sheep the surd
see<00:03:12.510> more<00:03:12.900> play<00:03:13.730> then<00:03:14.730> um<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.930> pain<00:03:16.139> lands

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
see more play then um the pain lands

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.250 
see more play then um the pain lands
which<00:03:16.760> honestly<00:03:17.760> you're<00:03:18.030> terrible<00:03:18.479> this<00:03:19.109> is

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
which honestly you're terrible this is

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.979 
which honestly you're terrible this is
just<00:03:19.379> terrible<00:03:19.620> mana<00:03:20.010> basis<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:21.419> have<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.629> butt

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
just terrible mana basis to have a butt

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.360 
just terrible mana basis to have a butt
like<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.349> you're<00:03:22.530> forced<00:03:22.859> into<00:03:22.979> it<00:03:23.159> and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
like that you're forced into it and

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.800 
like that you're forced into it and
you're<00:03:23.639> forcing<00:03:23.940> through<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.269> five<00:03:24.419> enemy

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
you're forcing through the five enemy

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.930 
you're forcing through the five enemy
colors<00:03:25.109> there's<00:03:25.739> not<00:03:25.859> even<00:03:25.919> a<00:03:26.159> light<00:03:26.489> color<00:03:26.729> so

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
colors there's not even a light color so

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.339 
colors there's not even a light color so
it's<00:03:27.060> very<00:03:27.180> strange<00:03:27.629> but<00:03:27.959> there<00:03:28.079> might<00:03:28.199> be<00:03:28.229> a

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
it's very strange but there might be a

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.439 
it's very strange but there might be a
reason<00:03:28.409> for<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.919> I'm<00:03:29.129> going<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.340> speculate<00:03:29.699> I'd

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
reason for it I'm going to speculate I'd

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.199 
reason for it I'm going to speculate I'd
be<00:03:30.629> next<00:03:30.930> video
