logged in and if I picked up like
archeology<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.220> considering<00:01:41.220> it's

archeology and considering it's
gonna<00:01:41.400> boost<00:01:41.670> first<00:01:42.030> aid<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.630> assumed<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> would

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
gonna boost first aid I assumed it would

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.649 
gonna boost first aid I assumed it would
boost<00:01:43.979> fishing<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.700> cooking<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.149> archaeology

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
boost fishing and cooking in archaeology

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
boost fishing and cooking in archaeology
as<00:01:45.750> well<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:46.979> gonna<00:01:47.130> waste<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.490> time

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
as well I'm not gonna waste my time

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
as well I'm not gonna waste my time
confirming<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:49.110> way<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.500> there

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
confirming that but one way there there

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.499 
confirming that but one way there there
now<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:51.030> ahead<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> pick<00:01:51.390> your

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
now you can go ahead and pick your

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.240 
now you can go ahead and pick your
specialization<00:01:51.960> protections<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> want

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
specialization protections what I want

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.670 
specialization protections what I want
to<00:01:53.310> play<00:01:53.840> but<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.439> don't<00:01:55.500> know

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
to play but you know I don't know

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.600 
to play but you know I don't know
exactly<00:01:56.070> what<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.399> means<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:57.000> terms<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
exactly what this means in terms of I

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
exactly what this means in terms of I
assume<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.759> gonna<00:01:59.820> give<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.119> gear<00:02:00.329> maybe

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
assume it's gonna give you gear maybe

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.929 
assume it's gonna give you gear maybe
I'm<00:02:00.990> not<00:02:01.140> sure<00:02:01.350> how<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> works<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.759> is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
I'm not sure how it works but so this is

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
I'm not sure how it works but so this is
this<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.299> where<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.659> last<00:02:03.899> time<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
this is where we got last time the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.679 
this is where we got last time the
process<00:02:05.159> cannot<00:02:05.549> complete<00:02:06.000> unfortunately

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
process cannot complete unfortunately

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.320 
process cannot complete unfortunately
it's<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.860> guess<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> PTR<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it's I guess because it's on the PTR and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.729 
it's I guess because it's on the PTR and
this<00:02:09.629> kind<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.869> makes<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.200> bit<00:02:10.349> tricky<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
this kind of makes it a bit tricky for

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.870 
this kind of makes it a bit tricky for
me<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.280> from<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.900> apologize

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
me to go from here so I do apologize

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.000 
me to go from here so I do apologize
things<00:02:14.180> don't<00:02:14.450> go<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.380> way<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.530> want<00:02:15.770> them<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
things don't go the way I want them to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.770 
things don't go the way I want them to
vote<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.430> way<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.580> fixed<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.060> last<00:02:17.270> time<00:02:17.480> was<00:02:17.630> by

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
vote the way I fixed it last time was by

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.270 
vote the way I fixed it last time was by
switching<00:02:18.260> realms<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.830> trying<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.190> again

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
switching realms and trying it again

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.340 
switching realms and trying it again

gonna try that we're gonna hope this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.670 
gonna try that we're gonna hope this

interface<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.430> when<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.700> works<00:05:11.940> let's<00:05:12.840> go

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
interface and and when it works let's go

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.480 
interface and and when it works let's go
back<00:05:13.140> to<00:05:13.320> what<00:05:13.470> this<00:05:13.650> looked<00:05:13.890> like<00:05:13.950> previous

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
could just automatically get another

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.470 
could just automatically get another
free<00:05:22.290> one<00:05:22.500> anyway

free one anyway
the<00:05:24.750> interface<00:05:25.140> is<00:05:25.320> really<00:05:25.350> cool<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:26.100> like<00:05:26.730> the

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
the interface is really cool I like the

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.390 
the interface is really cool I like the
fact<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.120> says<00:05:27.360> processing<00:05:27.660> a<00:05:28.290> level<00:05:29.190> 90

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
fact that says processing a level 90

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.370 
fact that says processing a level 90
character<00:05:29.910> boost<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.660> that's<00:05:30.840> that's<00:05:31.169> a

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
character boost that that's that's a

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.080 
character boost that that's that's a
level<00:05:31.740> of<00:05:32.010> detail<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.640> don't<00:05:32.940> normally

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
level of detail that you don't normally

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.650 
level of detail that you don't normally
get<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:34.680> know<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:35.010> right<00:05:35.220> here<00:05:35.660> like

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
get and you know this right here like

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.000 
get and you know this right here like
you<00:05:36.960> could<00:05:37.110> even<00:05:37.260> create<00:05:37.470> a<00:05:37.620> new<00:05:37.770> character

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
you could even create a new character

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.570 
you could even create a new character
just<00:05:38.850> randomize<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.510> name<00:05:39.690> suit<00:05:40.080> happens

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
just randomize the name suit happens

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.680 
just randomize the name suit happens
yeah<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:41.610> mean<00:05:41.820> look<00:05:41.970> at<00:05:42.060> that<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.419> know<00:05:42.540> what<00:05:42.630> I

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
yeah I mean look at that you know what I

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.630 
yeah I mean look at that you know what I
mean<00:05:42.840> that's<00:05:42.960> that<00:05:43.350> is<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.980> like<00:05:44.310> that<00:05:44.490> that's

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
mean that's that is I like that that's

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.000 
mean that's that is I like that that's
high-level<00:05:45.180> quality<00:05:45.660> right<00:05:45.840> there<00:05:46.050> it's<00:05:46.800> very

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
high-level quality right there it's very

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.830 
high-level quality right there it's very
you<00:05:47.310> know<00:05:47.430> I<00:05:47.460> expected<00:05:48.120> this<00:05:48.240> to<00:05:48.390> be<00:05:48.419> very<00:05:48.660> much

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
you know I expected this to be very much

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.650 
you know I expected this to be very much
like<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.020> PTR<00:05:49.500> or<00:05:50.000> private<00:05:51.000> server<00:05:51.180> type<00:05:51.450> deal

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
like a PTR or private server type deal

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.930 
like a PTR or private server type deal
where<00:05:51.900> it's<00:05:52.050> like<00:05:52.200> just<00:05:52.830> immediately<00:05:53.340> get<00:05:53.669> all

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
where it's like just immediately get all

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.300 
where it's like just immediately get all
kind

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
kind

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.670 
kind
 and<00:05:54.820> it's<00:05:54.970> just<00:05:55.180> done<00:05:55.390> but<00:05:56.350> that's<00:05:56.470> not

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
 and it's just done but that's not

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.810 
 and it's just done but that's not
the<00:05:56.770> case<00:05:56.920> let's<00:05:57.250> see<00:05:57.310> what<00:05:57.430> happens<00:05:57.700> if<00:05:57.760> we

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
the case let's see what happens if we

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:07.470 
the case let's see what happens if we
try<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.060> login<00:06:05.280> you<00:06:06.280> cannot<00:06:06.580> log<00:06:06.820> in<00:06:06.850> until<00:06:07.360> the

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
try to login you cannot log in until the

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.210 
try to login you cannot log in until the
character<00:06:07.900> boost<00:06:08.110> process<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:08.890> recently

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
character boost process you recently

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.520 
character boost process you recently
initiated<00:06:09.520> it's<00:06:10.060> completed<00:06:10.510> so<00:06:11.200> there<00:06:11.350> you<00:06:11.410> go

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
initiated it's completed so there you go

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.710 
initiated it's completed so there you go
so<00:06:11.740> that's<00:06:11.860> that<00:06:12.160> so<00:06:12.490> button<00:06:13.300> up<00:06:13.390> top<00:06:13.570> to

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
so that's that so button up top to

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.380 
so that's that so button up top to
everyone<00:06:13.990> tested<00:06:14.320> out<00:06:14.760> PTR<00:06:15.760> five<00:06:16.000> point<00:06:16.240> four

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
everyone tested out PTR five point four

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.780 
everyone tested out PTR five point four
point<00:06:16.570> seven<00:06:16.840> obviously<00:06:17.350> coming<00:06:17.530> soon<00:06:17.800> now

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
point seven obviously coming soon now

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.550 
point seven obviously coming soon now
the<00:06:18.910> next<00:06:19.210> question<00:06:19.330> is<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:19.840> price<00:06:20.170> what<00:06:20.470> do

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
the next question is the price what do

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.200 
the next question is the price what do
we<00:06:20.650> think<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:20.920> price<00:06:21.160> is<00:06:21.340> gonna<00:06:21.460> be<00:06:21.670> I<00:06:21.880> think

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
we think the price is gonna be I think

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.850 
we think the price is gonna be I think
it's<00:06:22.510> gonna<00:06:22.600> be<00:06:22.810> fifty<00:06:23.170> United<00:06:23.440> States

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
it's gonna be fifty United States

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
it's gonna be fifty United States
dollars<00:06:24.270> we'll<00:06:25.270> see<00:06:25.480> but<00:06:26.380> realistically<00:06:27.100> it

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
dollars we'll see but realistically it

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.000 
dollars we'll see but realistically it
can't<00:06:28.300> be<00:06:28.510> less<00:06:28.810> than<00:06:28.840> than<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.680> other

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
can't be less than than the other

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.650 
can't be less than than the other
services<00:06:30.520> there's<00:06:30.760> no<00:06:30.910> way<00:06:31.090> it<00:06:31.240> can<00:06:31.330> be<00:06:31.390> less

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
services there's no way it can be less

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.700 
services there's no way it can be less
than<00:06:31.780> the<00:06:31.900> other<00:06:32.020> services

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
than the other services

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.500 
than the other services
it's<00:06:33.250> just<00:06:33.460> that<00:06:33.610> wouldn't<00:06:34.000> even<00:06:34.060> make<00:06:34.270> sense

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
it's just that wouldn't even make sense

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.650 
it's just that wouldn't even make sense
you<00:06:35.080> don't<00:06:35.230> even<00:06:35.440> like<00:06:35.650> if<00:06:35.800> you<00:06:35.920> could<00:06:36.040> buy<00:06:36.280> in

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
you don't even like if you could buy in

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.120 
you don't even like if you could buy in
94<00:06:37.660> less<00:06:37.870> than<00:06:38.050> it<00:06:38.140> would<00:06:38.260> cost<00:06:38.470> to<00:06:38.710> then<00:06:38.860> move

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
94 less than it would cost to then move

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.250 
94 less than it would cost to then move
that<00:06:39.340> ninety<00:06:39.760> to<00:06:39.910> a<00:06:39.940> different<00:06:40.270> server<00:06:40.510> like

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
that ninety to a different server like

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.320 
that ninety to a different server like
how<00:06:41.470> absurd<00:06:42.160> would<00:06:42.370> that<00:06:42.490> be<00:06:42.640> surely<00:06:43.030> buying

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
how absurd would that be surely buying

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.770 
how absurd would that be surely buying
the<00:06:43.510> ninety<00:06:43.840> would<00:06:43.990> be<00:06:44.140> but<00:06:44.890> I<00:06:45.100> don't<00:06:45.580> know<00:06:45.790> cuz

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
the ninety would be but I don't know cuz

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.970 
the ninety would be but I don't know cuz
he<00:06:46.870> would<00:06:46.990> just<00:06:47.110> you<00:06:47.440> would<00:06:47.470> just<00:06:47.710> buy<00:06:47.800> a<00:06:47.830> new

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
he would just you would just buy a new

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.830 
he would just you would just buy a new
90<00:06:48.370> if<00:06:48.460> that<00:06:48.610> was<00:06:48.700> case<00:06:48.880> so<00:06:49.360> it's<00:06:49.540> definitely

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
90 if that was case so it's definitely

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.660 
90 if that was case so it's definitely
gonna<00:06:49.990> be<00:06:50.110> more<00:06:50.500> you<00:06:51.220> know<00:06:51.310> what<00:06:51.400> I<00:06:51.430> mean<00:06:51.580> like

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
gonna be more you know what I mean like

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.520 
gonna be more you know what I mean like
rationalize<00:06:52.180> that<00:06:52.360> I<00:06:52.630> hadn't<00:06:53.380> thought<00:06:53.470> of

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
rationalize that I hadn't thought of

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.340 
rationalize that I hadn't thought of
that<00:06:53.650> until<00:06:54.010> now<00:06:54.160> if<00:06:54.790> it<00:06:55.510> was<00:06:55.690> less<00:06:55.960> than<00:06:56.260> you

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
that until now if it was less than you

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.480 
that until now if it was less than you
were<00:06:56.440> just<00:06:56.620> buying<00:06:56.770> you<00:06:56.980> ninety<00:06:57.310> if<00:06:57.400> you

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
were just buying you ninety if you

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
were just buying you ninety if you
didn't<00:06:57.640> want<00:06:57.760> to<00:06:57.790> move<00:06:57.910> the<00:06:58.000> character<00:06:58.150> that's

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
didn't want to move the character that's

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.840 
didn't want to move the character that's
obviously<00:06:59.140> not<00:06:59.380> gonna<00:06:59.500> happen<00:06:59.770> and<00:07:00.130> since

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
obviously not gonna happen and since

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.180 
obviously not gonna happen and since
both<00:07:01.120> together<00:07:01.600> the<00:07:01.930> faction<00:07:02.620> change<00:07:02.860> and<00:07:03.100> the

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
both together the faction change and the

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.130 
both together the faction change and the
realm<00:07:03.400> change<00:07:03.640> equate<00:07:03.970> to<00:07:04.000> fifty<00:07:04.420> US<00:07:04.690> dollars

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
realm change equate to fifty US dollars

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.740 
realm change equate to fifty US dollars
I<00:07:05.290> think<00:07:06.010> this<00:07:06.190> has<00:07:06.370> to<00:07:06.400> be<00:07:06.670> 50<00:07:07.030> US<00:07:07.240> dollars<00:07:07.270> if

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750 
I think this has to be 50 US dollars if

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.470 
I think this has to be 50 US dollars if
not<00:07:07.810> more<00:07:07.960> might<00:07:08.680> even<00:07:08.860> be<00:07:09.010> sixty<00:07:09.430> people<00:07:10.210> say

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:10.480 
not more might even be sixty people say

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.780 
not more might even be sixty people say
you<00:07:10.540> know<00:07:10.780> it's<00:07:11.410> image<00:07:11.710> still<00:07:11.890> agreed<00:07:12.370> little

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:12.790 
you know it's image still agreed little

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.240 
you know it's image still agreed little
greed<00:07:13.060> I<00:07:13.270> don't<00:07:13.810> agree<00:07:14.020> and<00:07:14.350> this<00:07:15.040> is<00:07:15.220> a

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
greed I don't agree and this is a

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.430 
greed I don't agree and this is a
completely<00:07:15.700> optional<00:07:16.000> service<00:07:16.600> and<00:07:16.810> the

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
completely optional service and the

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.350 
completely optional service and the
video<00:07:17.710> game<00:07:17.920> has<00:07:18.100> produced<00:07:18.490> more<00:07:18.670> content<00:07:19.210> in

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 
video game has produced more content in

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.240 
video game has produced more content in
this<00:07:19.540> last<00:07:19.810> expansion<00:07:20.230> there<00:07:20.860> was<00:07:20.980> probably

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
this last expansion there was probably

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.060 
this last expansion there was probably
more<00:07:21.430> content<00:07:21.910> released<00:07:22.150> in<00:07:22.330> 5.3<00:07:23.260> than<00:07:23.860> there

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.450 
any questions about the process you can

either ask me you could perhaps log on

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.360 
either ask me you could perhaps log on
the<00:07:46.090> PTR<00:07:46.360> yourself<00:07:46.750> or<00:07:47.440> you<00:07:47.740> can<00:07:47.920> just<00:07:48.130> get

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.370 
the PTR yourself or you can just get

the PTR yourself or you can just get
 I<00:07:48.940> mean<00:07:49.780> any<00:07:49.930> of<00:07:50.050> the<00:07:50.140> three<00:07:50.320> options

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:50.470 
 I mean any of the three options

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.600 
 I mean any of the three options
really<00:07:50.800> at<00:07:51.010> this<00:07:51.130> point<00:07:51.370> all<00:07:52.240> viable<00:07:52.750> so<00:07:53.610> see

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.610 
really at this point all viable so see

really at this point all viable so see
you<00:07:54.700> guys<00:07:54.880> in<00:07:55.320> another<00:07:56.320> video<00:07:56.680> probably

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:57.990 
you guys in another video probably

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.300

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.110 
which is also also possible at this

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.180 
which is also also possible at this
point
