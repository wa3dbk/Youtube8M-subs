00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
so I can get ready for bed and I looked

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.590 
so I can get ready for bed and I looked
down<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> floor<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:04.519> there's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> braid<00:01:06.150> on

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
down on the floor and there's a braid on

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
down on the floor and there's a braid on
the<00:01:06.810> floor<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.310> thought<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> back<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.119> its

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the floor and I thought the back of its

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
the floor and I thought the back of its
from<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> back<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.960> my<00:01:09.990> hair<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.830> ok<00:01:11.159> but

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
from the back of my hair which is ok but

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.460 
from the back of my hair which is ok but
I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> must<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.869> slipped<00:01:12.960> off<00:01:13.229> because

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I think it must have slipped off because

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.990 
I think it must have slipped off because
of<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.650> oil<00:01:13.820> but<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> look<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:17.000> it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of the oil but if you look at it it's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.289 
of the oil but if you look at it it's
really<00:01:18.299> big<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.560> hulu<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.460> whoever<00:01:20.850> did<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
really big the hulu so whoever did the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.640 
really big the hulu so whoever did the
braid<00:01:21.890> didn't<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.630> tight<00:01:24.630> enough<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.290> in

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.170 

and<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:28.860> stay<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.700> slip<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:29.970> out

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and then stay in and just slip right out

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.330 
and then stay in and just slip right out
