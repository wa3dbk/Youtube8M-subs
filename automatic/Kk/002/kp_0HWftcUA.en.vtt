Falls<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.920> story<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:57.440> lizard<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
Falls the story of this lizard in the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.299 
Falls the story of this lizard in the
Western<00:01:00.030> setting<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Western setting and what really is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.270 
Western setting and what really is
probably<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> best<00:01:03.030> part<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.510> movie<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
probably the best part of this movie is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.370 
probably the best part of this movie is
the<00:01:05.280> animation<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.119> probably<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> best<00:01:07.200> I've

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the animation is probably the best I've

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.820 
the animation is probably the best I've
ever<00:01:07.409> seen<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.340> mean<00:01:08.520> there's<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.560> really<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
ever seen I mean there's like really a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.969 
ever seen I mean there's like really a
lot<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.670> detail<00:01:12.150> every<00:01:13.020> single<00:01:13.680> character

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
lot of detail every single character

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.469 
lot of detail every single character
every<00:01:14.670> grain<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> sand<00:01:15.890> it's<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.610> well<00:01:18.119> done

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
every grain of sand it's very well done

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.620 
every grain of sand it's very well done
I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.350> worst<00:01:19.790> animated<00:01:20.790> character<00:01:21.390> in

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I think the worst animated character in

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.440 
I think the worst animated character in
Rango<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.710> Rango<00:01:23.280> himself<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.090> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
Rango is Rango himself and I think that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.520 
Rango is Rango himself and I think that
has<00:01:24.540> something<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> fact<00:01:25.229> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
has something to do with the fact that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.499 
has something to do with the fact that
everything<00:01:26.189> else<00:01:26.549> looks<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.450> more

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
everything else looks a lot more

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
everything else looks a lot more
realistic<00:01:28.080> than<00:01:28.380> him<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> because

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
realistic than him and this is because

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.140 
realistic than him and this is because
rainbow<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.110> bright<00:01:31.640> Rango<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> guess<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
rainbow was very bright Rango I guess is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.120 
rainbow was very bright Rango I guess is
supposed<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.630> stand<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> crowd<00:01:34.590> he's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
supposed to stand out of the crowd he's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.850 
supposed to stand out of the crowd he's
like<00:01:35.340> bright<00:01:36.060> salad<00:01:36.540> green<00:01:37.110> everything<00:01:37.500> else

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
like bright salad green everything else

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740 
like bright salad green everything else
is<00:01:38.070> more<00:01:38.280> realistic<00:01:38.549> colors<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.479> as

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is more realistic colors not as

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.609 
is more realistic colors not as
happy-go-lucky<00:01:40.460> more<00:01:42.200> sepia-toned<00:01:43.200> odd

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
happy-go-lucky more sepia-toned odd

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.789 
happy-go-lucky more sepia-toned odd
characters<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.820> he<00:01:45.570> kind<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.930> stands<00:01:46.680> out

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.310 
characters and he kind of stands out
while<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:48.060> blend<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> because<00:01:49.290> he

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
while they just blend in and because he

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590 
while they just blend in and because he
stands<00:01:49.770> out<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.189> he<00:01:50.729> looks<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.360> too
