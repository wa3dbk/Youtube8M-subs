abercrombie and fitch male model with
the<00:00:55.350> sword<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.799> of<00:00:55.890> course<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.220> hot<00:00:56.400> chick

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
the sword and of course the hot chick

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.420 
the sword and of course the hot chick
and<00:00:56.970> all<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.750> them<00:00:58.110> have<00:00:58.170> different<00:00:58.979> kinds<00:00:59.159> of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and all of them have different kinds of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.100 
and all of them have different kinds of
attacks<00:00:59.729> for<00:01:00.150> example<00:01:00.629> I've<00:01:00.750> noticed<00:01:01.049> the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
attacks for example I've noticed the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.710 
attacks for example I've noticed the
chick<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.470> faster<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.670> guy<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:03.089> the<00:01:03.120> sword

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
chick is faster the guy with the sword

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.410 
chick is faster the guy with the sword
I'm<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.739> really<00:01:04.920> sure<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.519> his<00:01:05.760> deal<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.000> but

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
I'm not really sure what his deal is but

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750 
I'm not really sure what his deal is but
I<00:01:06.600> did<00:01:06.930> notice<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.740> dwarf<00:01:08.190> is<00:01:08.430> probably

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
I did notice that the dwarf is probably

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.910 
I did notice that the dwarf is probably
the<00:01:08.880> best<00:01:09.090> character<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.380> only<00:01:10.409> does

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the best character because not only does

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.700 
the best character because not only does
he<00:01:10.979> hit<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> truck<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.840> also<00:01:13.049> he<00:01:13.229> seems<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
he hit like a truck but also he seems to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
he hit like a truck but also he seems to
have<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> best<00:01:14.070> range<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:15.510> they<00:01:16.260> all

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
have the best range and also they all

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
have the best range and also they all
have<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> attack<00:01:17.100> where<00:01:17.370> you<00:01:17.460> DoubleTap<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
have this attack where you DoubleTap and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.620 
have this attack where you DoubleTap and
run<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.800> press<00:01:20.040> hit<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:21.390> kind

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
run and then as you press hit they kind

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.950 
run and then as you press hit they kind
of<00:01:21.860> rush<00:01:22.860> into<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.520> kind<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.600> almost

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
of rush into you kind of an almost

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200 
of rush into you kind of an almost
tackle<00:01:25.440> if<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.460> seems<00:01:26.730> like<00:01:26.940> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
tackle if you will and it seems like the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.810 
tackle if you will and it seems like the
old<00:01:27.540> dwarf<00:01:27.990> character<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.980> perfect<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.700> that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
old dwarf character is perfect for that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.570 
old dwarf character is perfect for that
because<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.900> dude<00:01:31.050> has<00:01:31.320> horns<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.980> his<00:01:32.010> helmet

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
because the dude has horns on his helmet

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.960 
because the dude has horns on his helmet
I<00:01:32.790> mean<00:01:33.330> he's<00:01:33.540> half<00:01:33.810> bull<00:01:34.200> by<00:01:34.590> nature<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.790> he

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
I mean he's half bull by nature so he

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.450 
I mean he's half bull by nature so he
just<00:01:36.180> has<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.510> best<00:01:36.740> attack<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> comes

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
just has the best attack when it comes

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
just has the best attack when it comes
to<00:01:38.640> our<00:01:38.790> bum-rushing<00:01:39.420> enemies<00:01:40.020> even<00:01:40.680> looks

to our bum-rushing enemies even looks

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.430 
to our bum-rushing enemies even looks

he had a gigantic sword the game has a

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.730 
he had a gigantic sword the game has a
variety<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.520> different<00:01:53.820> mounts<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.560> can

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
variety of different mounts that you can

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.270 
variety of different mounts that you can
have<00:01:56.010> from<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.270> weird<00:01:57.570> beak<00:01:58.110> lizards<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
have from the weird beak lizards to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.690 
have from the weird beak lizards to
dragons<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:00.330> either<00:02:00.540> fire<00:02:01.440> projectiles<00:02:02.010> on

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
dragons that either fire projectiles on

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.970 
dragons that either fire projectiles on
the<00:02:02.790> floor<00:02:03.120> or<00:02:03.510> actually<00:02:04.409> shoot<00:02:04.710> projectiles

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
the floor or actually shoot projectiles

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.869 
the floor or actually shoot projectiles
out<00:02:05.730> at<00:02:06.180> far<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.440> distant<00:02:07.620> range<00:02:08.159> which<00:02:08.849> is

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
out at far and distant range which is

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.119 
out at far and distant range which is
probably<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.479> best<00:02:09.929> kind<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.379> mounts<00:02:10.709> but

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
probably the best kind of mounts but

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.920 
probably the best kind of mounts but
I've<00:02:11.550> noticed<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> mounts<00:02:12.330> are<00:02:12.480> more<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.840> a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
I've noticed the mounts are more of a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.170 
I've noticed the mounts are more of a
hassle<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.470> keep<00:02:13.830> than<00:02:14.129> actually<00:02:14.580> a

way to collect magic and different

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.050

characters can hold different amounts of
magic<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.019> that's<00:03:11.889> also<00:03:12.099> another<00:03:12.430> difference

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
magic and that's also another difference

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.520 
magic and that's also another difference
with<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.480> characters<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.049> even<00:03:14.290> though<00:03:14.379> the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
with the characters but even though the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.589 
with the characters but even though the

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
dwarf can't hold a lot of magic I still

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.360 
dwarf can't hold a lot of magic I still
think<00:03:16.840> pound-for-pound<00:03:17.439> he's<00:03:17.919> the<00:03:18.099> best

Sega Genesis and we basically had to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.030 
Sega Genesis and we basically had to
draw<00:03:30.760> straws<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.629> see<00:03:31.659> who<00:03:32.439> gets<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.769> play<00:03:32.889> as

draw straws to see who gets to play as
the<00:03:33.159> Viking<00:03:33.579> and<00:03:33.729> who<00:03:33.879> stuck<00:03:34.209> with<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.510> woman

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
the Viking and who stuck with the woman

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.589 
the Viking and who stuck with the woman
or<00:03:35.019> even<00:03:35.470> worse<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:36.310> guy<00:03:36.639> who<00:03:36.699> has<00:03:37.180> like<00:03:37.419> the

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
or even worse this guy who has like the

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.689 
or even worse this guy who has like the
worst<00:03:37.900> range<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:38.919> really<00:03:39.459> don't<00:03:39.609> see

use magic on any of the enemies before
boss<00:05:16.599> and<00:05:16.869> then<00:05:16.989> just<00:05:17.169> blow<00:05:18.159> your<00:05:18.429> whole<00:05:18.669> load
