it's<00:05:19.160> very<00:05:19.280> important<00:05:20.030> that<00:05:20.270> you<00:05:20.419> identify

it's very important that you identify

it's very important that you identify
which<00:05:21.229> one<00:05:21.440> of<00:05:21.470> these<00:05:21.680> pathways<00:05:22.010> is<00:05:22.669> involved

which one of these pathways is involved

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.140 
which one of these pathways is involved
if<00:05:23.630> you<00:05:23.810> have<00:05:24.110> a<00:05:24.140> horse<00:05:24.470> with<00:05:24.590> laminitis<00:05:25.310> the

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
if you have a horse with laminitis the

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.719 
if you have a horse with laminitis the
biggest<00:05:26.510> mistake<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.260> see<00:05:27.410> made<00:05:27.950> is<00:05:28.190> that

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
biggest mistake that I see made is that

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.180 
biggest mistake that I see made is that
people<00:05:29.330> get<00:05:29.540> carried<00:05:29.750> away<00:05:29.990> trying<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.770> treat

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
people get carried away trying to treat

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.520 
people get carried away trying to treat
the<00:05:31.370> disease<00:05:31.450> without<00:05:32.450> recognizing<00:05:33.320> which

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
the disease without recognizing which

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.790 
the disease without recognizing which

knowing which form is imperative to
successful<00:05:39.260> treatment<00:05:39.770> it's<00:05:40.640> also<00:05:40.880> important
