00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
things and love to do a lot of different

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.990 
things and love to do a lot of different
things<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.569> think<00:02:44.600> that<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.580> more<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:46.640> play

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
things and I think that the more we play

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.650 
things and I think that the more we play
live<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.590> more<00:02:48.830> we<00:02:49.340> record<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.450> more

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
live and the more we record and the more

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.690 
live and the more we record and the more
we<00:02:50.840> write<00:02:51.080> together<00:02:51.400> that's<00:02:52.400> going<00:02:52.640> to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
we write together that's going to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.750 
we write together that's going to
continue<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.830> evolve<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:57.590> music<00:02:58.069> is<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.519> think

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
continue to evolve the music is I think

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.900 
continue to evolve the music is I think
