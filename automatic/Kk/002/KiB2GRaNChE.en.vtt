 can deliver good results 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.079
 the phoenix guitar sgp has a design 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.210
 very cool with the classic gothic design 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.539
 require both remember with guitarists 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 years and years tony iommi rob crilly between 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 many others 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.239
 this review here as well as checking 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.890
 tracks were recorded with her today will 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.199
 know more about building a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.629
 the wood used for 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.549
 capture and other details and will also 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.200
 see the tests where you go only 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.010
 to check the sound that the instrument can 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.460
 to draw 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460
 come on 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.119
 psg already draws attention from afar by 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 your design is not 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.799
 and this model in the phoenix causes a good 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.110
 printing mainly for details 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.000
 and by painting that is very end 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.200
 this model allows you to choose 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 among three colors wine that is this one 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.439
 black and white 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.869
 the body of the guitar is to build the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.630
 conversely what gives the instrument 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.939
 a team with more middle and well defined 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.640
 here in the body we still have the shield of 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.060
 plastic that is black for all 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.190
 color options than the dsg bridge is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.740
 fixed and it can have its height 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.130
 controlled through two pivots that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.620
 underneath it supporting the side 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.140
 are two native hamburger scavengers 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.030
 of the brand Felix and these pickups are 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.470
 controlled by a selector switch. 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.400
 three positions 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.430
 two new volumes and two Latvians 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.280
 It is worth remembering that in csg if jec 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.799
 car stays in front and another pawn 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.900
 of the belt behind the body that here where 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.870
 we would become traditional models is a 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.359
 The tip of the guitar arm is built 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.609
 and mail and is screwed alcohol 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.250
 the scale that this part of the front 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.680
 where the houses and the traces are 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.910
 built in use the traces are of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.859
 average size 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.530
 the norm we found most of the 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.410
 guitars this guitar here has 22 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.930
 and the feeling of squeezing the doors is 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.810
 good for the wood by the weight of 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.150
 instrument from behind and also by 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.400
 regulation that in our instrument does not 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.650
 we notice gradients or something that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.620
 discomfort to tighten the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.840
 strings is sure to bend and even sg 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.859
 which makes it difficult to access the houses 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.260
 more students 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:20.030
