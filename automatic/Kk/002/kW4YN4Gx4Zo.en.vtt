00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
opinions to myself because I could

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.009 
thing to be a cowardly army officer and
I'm<00:03:23.860> not<00:03:24.010> scared<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.489> going<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.790> war<00:03:25.090> but<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.630> am

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
I'm not scared of going to war but I am

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.410 
I'm not scared of going to war but I am
scared<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.709> this<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.610> know<00:03:27.670> it's<00:03:27.940> messed<00:03:28.180> up

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
scared of this and I know it's messed up

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.259 
scared of this and I know it's messed up
too<00:03:28.720> because<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.530> strongly<00:03:30.250> believe<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.820> the

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
too because I strongly believe that the

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.650 
too because I strongly believe that the
best<00:03:31.299> way<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.870> advance<00:03:32.230> gay<00:03:32.799> rights<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:34.450> be

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
best way to advance gay rights is to be

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.990 
best way to advance gay rights is to be
a<00:03:34.690> normal<00:03:35.170> person<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.920> be<00:03:36.040> an<00:03:36.280> out-and-proud

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
a normal person to be an out-and-proud

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.100 
a normal person to be an out-and-proud
person<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.850> truly<00:03:39.850> show<00:03:40.180> your<00:03:40.510> love<00:03:40.780> for<00:03:41.019> your

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
person to truly show your love for your

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.680 
person to truly show your love for your
fellow<00:03:41.380> man<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:42.430> more<00:03:42.790> ways<00:03:42.970> than<00:03:43.030> one

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
fellow man in more ways than one

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.080 
fellow man in more ways than one
so<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.769> is<00:03:44.920> what<00:03:45.070> DOMA<00:03:45.340> comes<00:03:45.610> into<00:03:45.910> play

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
so this is what DOMA comes into play

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.470 
so this is what DOMA comes into play
because<00:03:46.420> ultimately<00:03:47.019> what<00:03:47.440> DOMA<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:48.070> is

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
because ultimately what DOMA is is

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.479 
because ultimately what DOMA is is
societal<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.630> governmental<00:03:50.470> support<00:03:50.650> of

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
societal and governmental support of

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.460 
societal and governmental support of
discrimination<00:03:52.360> against<00:03:52.750> gay<00:03:52.930> troops

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
discrimination against gay troops

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.120 
discrimination against gay troops
it's<00:03:54.220> what<00:03:54.670> supports<00:03:55.239> my<00:03:55.420> fears<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.170> it's

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
it's what supports my fears and it's

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.460 
it's what supports my fears and it's
what<00:03:57.370> isolates<00:03:57.880> me<00:03:58.150> if<00:03:58.660> there's<00:03:58.930> one<00:03:58.989> thing

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
what isolates me if there's one thing

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.840 
what isolates me if there's one thing
that<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.739> hear<00:03:59.950> all<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.400> time<00:04:00.610> in<00:04:00.760> the

that you hear all the time in the

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.720 
that you hear all the time in the
military<00:04:01.330> it's<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.110> strong<00:04:02.620> family<00:04:02.980> makes

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
military it's that a strong family makes

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.800 
military it's that a strong family makes
a<00:04:03.910> strong<00:04:04.330> soldier<00:04:04.930> what<00:04:05.739> DOMA<00:04:05.980> does<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.810> deny

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
a strong soldier what DOMA does is deny

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.810 
a strong soldier what DOMA does is deny
