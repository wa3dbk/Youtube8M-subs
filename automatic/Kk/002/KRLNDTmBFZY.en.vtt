in<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.870> lesson<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.620> are<00:00:01.740> going<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.040> learn

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
in this lesson we are going to learn

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.120 
in this lesson we are going to learn
about<00:00:02.490> diffusion<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.360> gases<00:00:03.799> this<00:00:04.799> will<00:00:04.980> help

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
about diffusion of gases this will help

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.400 
about diffusion of gases this will help
you<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.430> understand<00:00:06.000> how<00:00:06.210> gases<00:00:06.629> behave<00:00:06.839> and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
you to understand how gases behave and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.810 
you to understand how gases behave and
also<00:00:08.130> explain<00:00:08.580> why<00:00:08.610> smell<00:00:09.389> spread<00:00:10.700> before<00:00:11.700> we

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
also explain why smell spread before we

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.330 
also explain why smell spread before we
start<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.870> need<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.259> recall<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:13.860> solids

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
start you need to recall what solids

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.700 
start you need to recall what solids
liquids<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.000> gases<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.719> like<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.139> terms<00:00:16.590> of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
liquids and gases are like in terms of

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.939 
liquids and gases are like in terms of
their<00:00:16.890> particles<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:18.240> particular<00:00:18.810> I'd<00:00:19.680> like

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
their particles in particular I'd like

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.859 
their particles in particular I'd like
you<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> ask<00:00:20.490> yourself<00:00:20.939> how<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
you to ask yourself how are the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.250 
you to ask yourself how are the
particles<00:00:22.350> arranged<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.369> gas<00:00:24.050> pause<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
particles arranged in a gas pause the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.439 
particles arranged in a gas pause the
video<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.769> restart<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.699> when<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.970> think<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
video and restart it when you think you

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.310 
video and restart it when you think you
have<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> answer<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:30.119> answer<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
have the answer the answer is the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680 
have the answer the answer is the
particles<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> gas<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:32.669> spaced<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
particles in a gas are spaced out and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.080 
particles in a gas are spaced out and
move<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.469> very<00:00:34.920> quickly<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.640> random

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
move about very quickly in random

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.160 
move about very quickly in random
directions<00:00:36.620> did<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> right

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
directions did you get it right

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
directions did you get it right
this<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.440> course<00:00:40.550> explained<00:00:41.550> why<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> gas<00:00:42.360> takes

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this of course explained why a gas takes

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.080 
this of course explained why a gas takes
the<00:00:42.870> shape<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.200> its<00:00:43.350> container<00:00:43.700> it's<00:00:44.700> because

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the shape of its container it's because

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.209 
the shape of its container it's because
the<00:00:45.239> particles<00:00:45.870> will<00:00:46.230> each<00:00:46.500> continue<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the particles will each continue to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.610 
the particles will each continue to
travel<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> straight<00:00:47.969> line<00:00:48.210> until<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:49.440> hit

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
travel in a straight line until they hit

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
travel in a straight line until they hit
something<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.760> case<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> wall<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
something in this case the wall of the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.549 
something in this case the wall of the
container<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.120> smelly<00:00:54.510> gas<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.020> given<00:00:55.289> off

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
container so the smelly gas is given off

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.790 
container so the smelly gas is given off
by<00:00:55.590> rotting<00:00:56.399> vegetables<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> sealed<00:00:57.600> box

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
by rotting vegetables in a sealed box

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.170 
by rotting vegetables in a sealed box
will<00:00:58.800> fill<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> box<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.730> rotting

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
will fill the box with rotting

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
will fill the box with rotting
vegetables<00:01:00.719> smell<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.949> won't<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.699> able

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
vegetables smell but you won't be able

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.460 
vegetables smell but you won't be able
to<00:01:02.940> smell<00:01:03.359> them<00:01:03.570> outside<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.559> box<00:01:05.450> however

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
to smell them outside the box however

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
to smell them outside the box however
take<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> lid<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> box<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.760> those

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
take the lid of the box and those

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.630 
take the lid of the box and those
particles<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.290> no<00:01:10.530> longer<00:01:10.799> bounce<00:01:11.220> off<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
particles will no longer bounce off the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
particles will no longer bounce off the
lid<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.119> contained<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:13.650> start<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
lid and be contained they will start to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.520 
lid and be contained they will start to
escape<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.210> air<00:01:15.479> around<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.320> box

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
escape into the air around the box

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.249 
escape into the air around the box
you'll<00:01:17.520> soon<00:01:17.850> notice<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.360> effect<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.930> will

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
you'll soon notice the effect and will

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.109 
you'll soon notice the effect and will
be<00:01:19.350> able<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> smell<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.220> rotting<00:01:20.369> vegetables

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
be able to smell the rotting vegetables

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.530 
be able to smell the rotting vegetables
and<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:22.259> those<00:01:22.770> gas<00:01:23.189> particles<00:01:23.759> reaching

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and that's those gas particles reaching

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.539 
and that's those gas particles reaching
your<00:01:24.750> nose<00:01:25.049> by<00:01:25.770> diffusion<00:01:27.650> diffusion<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
your nose by diffusion diffusion is the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.609 
your nose by diffusion diffusion is the
random<00:01:30.060> movement<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:31.020> gas<00:01:31.259> through

examples of diffusion but smell is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.420 
examples of diffusion but smell is
probably<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.689> most<00:01:57.810> obvious<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.530> these

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
probably the most obvious one these

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.719 
probably the most obvious one these
could<00:01:59.820> be<00:02:00.000> food<00:02:00.509> smells<00:02:01.040> body<00:02:02.040> smells<00:02:02.490> from

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
could be food smells body smells from

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.300 
could be food smells body smells from
other<00:02:02.969> people<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:04.200> scent<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> plant

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
other people the scent that a plant

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.370 
other people the scent that a plant
gives<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:06.060> attract<00:02:06.390> pollinating<00:02:06.930> insects

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
gives off to attract pollinating insects

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.520 
gives off to attract pollinating insects
and<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:08.610> same<00:02:08.879> even<00:02:09.509> applies<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> smoke

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and the same even applies with the smoke
