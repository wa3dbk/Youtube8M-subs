running you log in real simple to get
started<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.850> network

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
started you just go to the network

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.209 
started you just go to the network
search<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.719> search<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.800> done<00:00:38.100> stuff<00:00:40.040> just<00:00:41.040> go

networks

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.290 

so<00:00:49.370> that's<00:00:49.489> all<00:00:49.609> you<00:00:49.670> got<00:00:49.789> to<00:00:49.879> do<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.059> get<00:00:50.149> ready

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
so that's all you got to do to get ready

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.270 
so that's all you got to do to get ready
once<00:00:50.870> you're<00:00:51.079> in<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.320> network<00:00:51.649> that's<00:00:52.039> pretty

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
once you're in the network that's pretty

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.700 
once you're in the network that's pretty
much<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:52.550> just<00:00:52.789> jump<00:00:53.090> into<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.329> game

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.260 

so<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.860> sort<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.130> main<00:00:59.280> menu<00:00:59.460> all<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.150> do
