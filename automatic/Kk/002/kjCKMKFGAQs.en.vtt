00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.490
 and all the same to that one backwards 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.020
 commenting and stringing with another mode that of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.379
 it has really rubbed me a lot and it's coming 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.499
 as a ring to the finger well that my paper or 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.659
 because the fact is that as you are going to see already 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.760
 who have just taken the tie either 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:19.070
 I entered euros today just or the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.110
 Thursday well let's say that the dedazo 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.450
 is about to fall I do not know when to go up 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.960
 this video in the case is that as you go to 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.030
 see let's stop mex in the minecraft 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.890
 so how are you going to hunt what 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.230
 typical that you are going to hunt a piglet what 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.570
 you kill with a machine of 200 tons 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.630
 the fact is that we have here our 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.390
 mex and these then craft were in a way 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.739
 quite unique all are these 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.380
 materials that you are seeing here put 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.149
 in this way but do not require any 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.920
 new man in principle for 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.470
 ingratiate all these all these are 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.480
 materials that as you know, they are 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.860
 let's just say that normalito are 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.870
 hard to get but then it deserves 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.660
 it's worth it because here we have how are you 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.960
 seeing gold to do just what 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.269
 comes the magnetic arms 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.560
 legs as we have here what is the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.500
 body the torso 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.600
 with a repeater and with an ether main card 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.159
 according to this let's say it's cool 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.090
 quite like here time with anti flame 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.369
 demands for it is a bit more 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.399
 tough we have this from here and then 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.320
 we also have part of him the 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.200
 pink chest the shoulder pads 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.729
 connections etcetera that goes with this and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.119
 then as you are seeing we have 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.509
 this together and tachan we can do 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.220
 our put together our mature but that 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.899
 I'm going to show you is right now 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.729
 that will also come to me super well 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.920
 because this afternoon doing and could 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.990
 hunt people and we are going to exhibit here 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.369
 we have two different types of mex but 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.470
 Well practically have at the moment 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.509
 the same skills and then they will go 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.909
 changing the good things about this that is 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.740
 that you just climb on and how 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.380
 you are going to see then you can walk with 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.110
 this piece of bug as you see then with 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.849
 a lot but of course this bug does not 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.789
 walks nothing then what you have to 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.880
 to do is catch and give coal as you see 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.950
 here just this starts to work 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.509
 As you can see I do not know if you have seen here 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.120
 that this starts to work and will go 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.829
 consuming coal we climb and go to 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.540
 start walking to see a couple of 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.099
 little pigs 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.859
 and now we give the key 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.930
 forgiveness with which the attack comes out and in 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.609
 This case, as you can see, is unique 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.500
 is implemented right now is the one 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.349
 burn but more than more the little hills with 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.700
 a flamethrower that's a bit to see if 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.349
 it takes me a little more angle the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.730
 panorama be after you see more than the 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.530
 laser jet 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.230
 Well, that's exactly what I'm seeing 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.800
 around here that are cerritos and that is not 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.790
 puts three points but do not analyze 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.790
 is what happens 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.950
 if you get the two bits intended 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.230
 that's how we are here 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.910
 that's how the men who come 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.260
 an uncle with that is a flu and fat that 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.290
 Well you have to have a little more 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 careful but it's a blast of heat in the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.260
 face and dies or 20,000 connects to da 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.000
 you do not know how it gets and here we have 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.910
 the other peak you are going to see then it is 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.360
 practically the same we are going to put you here 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.210
 worth the carbon and we can move if 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.280
 we give it at the same time as it is put to 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.810
 that we can go down see is like a 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.730
 change of camera but you see as the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.360
 doll goes down and stays stuck in the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.460
 So you can move by stretching 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.810
 move you do not move but nevertheless you 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.730
 yes you can move to both sides and 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.570
 hit with the sword et cetera and if 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.000
 we have to be 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.190
 let's say that pending we decided with 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.700
 a boy with a big one comes a zombie 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.700
 here 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.960
 this is the doll 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.070
 and then you wonder how long the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.920
 These months, not because they are not very 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.590
 resistant indeed this one you 're 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.480
 seeing here then nothing more than 12 is for 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.580
 data however this you see that is 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.690
 Who have not touched at the moment 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.370
 they only hold three spaces of 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.720
 diamond that I have checked and as 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.710
 You are seeing, because they do not move here 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.160
 all the pieces 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.300
 I think practically 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.130
 practically 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.239
 all the pieces here I'm seeing that 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.730
 he gave me back this he had two legs and in 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.980
 instead of the parts above that are the 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.200
 shoulders has returned me only bars 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.910
 from 'iron but I'm practically lacking 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.080
 catch these two bars of these from 'iron 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.319
 what was done with this 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.419
 that is to say he has lost these six iron 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.280
 by two and three others or is practically 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.039
 do not lose the rank is as I say 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.439
 when when you die and then as you have 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:47.009
 seen they are also saving what has 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:49.500
 gone getting that you're going to have me 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.969
 here is salt if you here have a 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.620
 inventory that you forget to document oslo 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.120
 before then everything that goes 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.070
 choosing when you go on top of this 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.889
 bug 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.050
 Now we can walk 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.180
 sorry 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.590
 time set to approach the day 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.590
 let's put coal here 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:15.039
 there are those who had coal 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.590
 getting into the center and everything we go 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.009
 we finding, as I say 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.830
 it's going to be caught directly if not 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.720
 is to us is directly directly 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.720
 to the inventory of the doll 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.960
 just at the exit but as you see 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.090
 see if we have full inventory or 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.069
 simply because the rgp will be 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.720
 directly with the inventory here 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.520
 of the press machine that some has 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.590
 caught other years directly and others 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.630
 more image here in chicken we have been 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.940
 here the good thing is that this is all 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.099
 are still under construction is a boost if 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.080
 I'm not wrong so good for now 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.220
 As I say, there is a lot left but it is 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.009
 pretty much what has been the 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.110
 I'll go I hope you liked it 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.110
 study it and reveals us goodbye
