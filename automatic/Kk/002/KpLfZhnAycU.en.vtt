00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.280
 they never have there speak 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.239
 to succeed 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.080
 the individual 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.310
 well 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 raymond baer then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.050
 good evening 6 the TV that counts he entrusted to the microphone 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.080
 quietly this terrorist act new york and playing on his guitar 59 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.600
 as soon as they like it so much that they thought it was going to be used more 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.870
 was going to make a replica speak that steve jobs but in the middle 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.940
 characteristic so at 839 the horse is at the club 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.480
 then suddenly all that we'll see 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.060
 because simply 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.730
 as opposed to easels so% 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.780
 all the bodies passing through the body so the difference because all 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 little less tension on the body so it's a lot clearer more 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 easily these effects a little spaghetto 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.970
 at the level of microphones 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.950
 the continent where it was too cold for each site that the group 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.130
 Helvetian 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.670
 it's still a TV but percent with a little less the peak to 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.580
 ice in the ears that some models 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.580
 for his horse book and sincere it's interesting 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.020
 so we do not have the raised stuff like to put the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.260
 usual ashtray 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.240
 so that allows 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.490
 this activation strength by connecting to the city center 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 that's not stupid against the strings are briefly done 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.890
 last modification and not least that you could appreciate the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.460
 good beginnings of demonstration 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.780
 it's true the head reversal that is more pronounced than the theme 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.659
 classic blow we have more room to make waves of opponents the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.230
 che the sign of the head 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.429
 like these r 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.500
 happy 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.800
 you are the course entrance you can also jumped from 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.739
 here it works it's good 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.469
 humor 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.539
 quiet 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:25.079
 we assure them an excellent address this victory he is far from 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:25.760
 acquired 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.129
 a different meeting brief it is a loss of advanced 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.129
 we saw one day arrive 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.029

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.029
 Amen 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.129

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.989
 yes he was 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.989
 he is 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.859
 no 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:19.749
 to go away
