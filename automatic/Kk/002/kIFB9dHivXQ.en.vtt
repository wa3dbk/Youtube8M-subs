 posting a new video lesson 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.309
 So, guys, in this video lesson, I want to 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.710
 say that there is a lot of people when 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:10.380
 install windows 8 zero point or 8.1 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.159
 if you encounter them know the message here at 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.049
 product key entered product key 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
 does not match any image from the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.990
 windows available for installation 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.590
 enter a different product key 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.759
 There you can not install windows 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.159
 8 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:35.880
 Why does this happen? 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.759
 factory comes with original windows 8 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 the original windows 8.1 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.200
 when are you formatting from sda this? 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.829
 and because in bios it has already been configured to 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.659
 give this error when you format 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.439

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.939
