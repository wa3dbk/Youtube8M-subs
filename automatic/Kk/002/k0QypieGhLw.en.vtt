00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 good I'm six books to read and today I 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.130
 I bring a new bust that bears a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.720
 time without making a book is almost 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.720
 interesting so I hope you like it 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.260
 the tag I bring you today is the putter 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.520
 definitive that is one that I find 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.880
 quite interesting because they are like 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.080
 questions a little more personal shadows 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.669
 different from those that are usually done like this 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.990
 that I'm not going to do anything and I hope that 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.220
 like it and keep it short the video is worth 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.199
 because what I want is to make a video 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.449
 short so we'll see if possible 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.879
 tides reading in the car depends on 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.340
 normally not before if it happened to me in 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.199
 plan could not or it was impossible not 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.699
 it could be okay but now the truth is that 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.809
 yes I can read in the car what 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.400
 I do not read much because I do not 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.870
 I find a comfortable position to not be 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.430
 that is in plan super hooked then 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.290
 I do not usually walk around a lot in the car 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 another has a unique and special style 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.469
 for you I think I'm going to say sally 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.300
 greene because I think he has a style 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.190
 quite peculiar quite different very 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.960
 very original risky and that test 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.030
 many things and I think she is a writer 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.030
 spectacular harry potter or twilight 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.810
 I'm going to say Harry Potter Twilight Voucher 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.700
 it's fine but it's not comparable with 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.560
 harry potter this to carry backpack and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.660
 that you carry in it part of books floor 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.010
 bring my backpack from the university the 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.620
 what I use for college and if not 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.570
 I have one that is where it is good 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.729
 like a yellow of these roll sack 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.190
 it is worth carrying it always or the kindle 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.900
 or a book and I usually carry my portfolio 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.880
 headphones to listen to music a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.290
 mobile phone charger because it has not been 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.750
 from home without a mobile phone charger and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.100
 I usually carry some sweets 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.050
 or something to eat because I'm a whore 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.729
 fat girl worth books with or without 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.070
 illustrations man to see the books 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 with illustrations are fine but in the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.360
 most of the books that I have are without 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.890
 illustrations and it depends on the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.630
 story so they are required 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.550
 illustrations or not the books that have 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 I like illustrations but if not 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.899
 they have no offense and nothing 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.399
 Ok, so I do not care about a book that 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.840
 have tweet and when it happened a little more 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.940
 of time you realized that no 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.500
 was worth nothing with hans hash I think that's what 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.520
 What happened to me is the fact that the law 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.050
 put five stars on five 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.690
 because it seems like a last but what 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.790
 I reread some time ago and I thought 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.530
 like many things like that failed him 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.880
 that the fas have a story 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.640
 funny about some book of your 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.680
 childhood or if there is a story in 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.880
 reality is sad in which to see me 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.280
 I had a lot of books worth of this 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.930
 boat is' steam and finally red or 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.730
 from a lot of types of books then of 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.230
 these of total children from time to time 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.120
 because my grandmother came to my room and I 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.230
 asked to see if he had any book what 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.090
 keep doing I do not keep asking 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.490
 books but sometimes like other years I 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.010
 I was honored that an older person 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.470
 I asked my child of 8 or 10 years 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.750
 books you know because the sapphire bland 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.400
 my books people that or you know are 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.930
 super adult books genre was then 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.300
 once my grandmother put a book of 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.800
 steamboat 'red series and I 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.270
 she lost and she does not explain it to him why 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.060
 you talk to me like I plan to spend their 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.710
 books worth reading and clear statuary 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.970
 we have to appreciate the books and I 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.530
 at least he will never lost a book and 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.330
 there is a little bit and it was the first time 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.070
 in your life and it was a book of mine then 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.020
 it was like a very thematic story and very 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.790
 sad and I still have not recovered 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.650
 I do not really remember the book 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.410
 that was I think it was a book like that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.910
 the son was like the father of the father and the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.680
 father was was treated like a son not 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.700
 it will be very big, I did not really read it or 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.500
 I left it unread 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.400
 but good the most finite book of your 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.019
 Well, it's worth going around here 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.110
 is I think this is the most book 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.209
 finite that I have 80 pages or so 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.910
 it calls to the most laggards of edith 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.260
 wharton in Victorian plan and such and I think 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.030
 which is the finest book that I have 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.950
 shelves the fattest book of your 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.739
 bookshelf a stephen king the one of the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.200
 needle does not and has 1500 the dome has 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.150
 like 1200 or that of stephen king 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.980
 you write and if so, you see yourself as written 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.440
 in the future if I write myself writing 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.120
 many years many many when I 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.010
 I was in sixth grade of elementary school I already had 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.900
 some history out there that still the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.730
 I keep but to know when it continues 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.739
 forward and if I see myself in the future as 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.900
 writer I have to finish novels and it 's 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.310
 to the favorite classic I have not read many 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.470
 really but I think I'm going to say 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.230
 fahrenheit 451 because I thought 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.060
 spectacular or be great it's worth it 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.069
 read the world read at school if 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.220
 also the language art classes or 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.220
 literature 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.739
 we will see language and literature always 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.940
 the silk two together and the truth is that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.800
 literature I was very good at 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.470
 bachelor language not so much because what 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.960
 syntax it seems like a garbage but if it 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.420
 I was good, I was not a bright student 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.920
 but it is mine 2000 of arts yes that me 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.420
 it was good and I got very good marks 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.340
 selectivity but art seems to me 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.720
 fascinating or art I love and yes 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.100
 that I was good at and it's been 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.260
 delivered a book that you have already read 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.270
 already be completely what you would do then 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.700
 I would say a lot I'm sorry I did not like it 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.740
 the ticket that I change it or something like that I do not know 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.870
 I'm not a fake whore, I'm going to say no 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.280
 I like what I was with, similar to 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.990
 Harry Potter or the eyes of man 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.780
 but that is not so well known fuck is 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.280
 that there are comparisons also or later 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.160
 have looked like the hunger games 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.020
 the anti-Fukuda hunt and it would look like Harry 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.430
 potter for no idea the truth what is your 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.830
 favorite word I've ever 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.360
 thought but right now I do not fall this 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.730
 that I have a couple but serious so 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.220
 there is a which one is not considered 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.830
 nerd ort or trip 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.460
 what the fuck is that in plan yes but the 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.710
 others do not 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.090
 Well, look, I'm geek, what's up with the geeks? 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.130
 they are the best people in the world 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.960
 Vampires or fairies if the fairies are roll 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.670
 dark I like the creatures 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.710
 these have a twist they do not use 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.840
 fairies of adjabiya I'll turn you into 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.550
 princess but I do not know if you understand me 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.540
 well then that ghosts men are 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.550
 Wolfman 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.100
 valentine world where isa vampires 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.270
 zombies I like more pretty more than 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.270
 the vampires to see that the vampires 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.200
 they are fine but the zombies are cool 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.030
 amorous triangle we have forbidden it 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.380
 it depends if it is well worn the 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.270
 example cázarez is shadow of the 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.190
 origins the love triangle te science 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.770
 will is amazing is super good 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.390
 carried or is it amazing is not 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.250
 these loving triangles of a plan or 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.760
 ten children the silver is silly fucking the 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.410
 ass is not worth it is not like vila no no no 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.850
 the same thing is very well taken that 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.770
 kind of love triangles and in 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.930
 brought incredible perfect love 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.280
 forbidden I also like but also 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.500
 they have to be well taken because what 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.210
 typical of or my god I'm a geek led 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.130
 a fast I'm super fat and nobody 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.320
 he wants in high school but suddenly 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.910
 the most good footballer roque fucks 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.380
 He has chosen me all and we will be 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.350
 boyfriends is a planet 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.030
 Then if you have something that you say is worth it 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.380
 yes yes and finally somatic book 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.840
 goodbye action with some background 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.880
 romantic there are many new ones a little bit 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.940
 example fallen angels have that roll 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.710
 forbidden love action good love is 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.230
 weird but come on there are so many 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.790
 books in this plan I like it is not done 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.530
 a story is well taken 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.050
 regardless of the subject of the 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.670
 characters if they are as a whole and in 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.740
 I do not care what it is 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.700
 really use and it's already true until 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.440
 the video and I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.970
 I have not always stayed long 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.350
 I say at the end they are in videos of 20 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.740
 hours finally see you in the next 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.070
