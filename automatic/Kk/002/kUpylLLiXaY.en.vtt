00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.730
 very good again colombia challenge from twitter on this occasion is not going to be a 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.470
 mere cookies and not a first cupcake 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.930
 As you can see, it does not have much of a cupcake shape, but both the flavor and the 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.319
 texture this wrong in some forums 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.300
 for this mega challenge we are going to need sugar 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.319
 I for fruits of the forest 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.649
 sodium bicarbonate 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.350
 flour 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.420
 egg whites 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510
 Butter 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 and his position has started because that theme and villa 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.770
 but sorry, sorry 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.320
 the essential is also missing 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 the Cranberries 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.290
 to start we will process 230 grams of flour and we will mix them with the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 sodium bicarbonate the sugar and the country then 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.360
 for this recipe 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.830
 the selected a docum of fruits of the forest as you see the vote is very large 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.360
 so I'm going to separate 150 milliliters of yogurt 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.909
 on the other hand 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.170
 we will split three egg whites sylvie more let's lower a little the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.320
 calories the more batteries until you see that it comes out a little foamy without 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.020
 never get to snow 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.620
 and to this we must add 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.630
 the sugar sent ccoo the essence of vanilla 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.930
 the yogurt 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.430
 i the 100 grams of keel spinach let's beat hard until 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.620
 let's see that lavagna sessa butter 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.620
 at that time we will add the blueberries 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.990
 I will mix the cranberries very slowly so they do not break 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:19.139
 in the deep vessel let's say mixed marine we'll make a little because in the 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.249
 medium 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:25.359
 we will put the mixture of aralar we do not like terÃ¡n and we will remove slowly 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:30.039
 with your friend until we see that all the mixture is without lumps with you 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.039
 scientific 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:40.309
 for the good forest many people have used a flanera I have opted for 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:45.209
 is this species after container where this section has been confessed by the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.919
 shape 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.729
 what we are going to do is line the compact and vegetable 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.149
 let's beat 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:55.439
 the mixture and with the preheated oven about 120 of 10 190 degrees or so 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.929
 we will put the mega cupcake inside 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:05.799
 we will lower the temperature to about 150 degrees plus or minus 160 check 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.799
 cost more with the massmart s cupcake 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.229
 we will cover with a plate for what 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:13.349
 why 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.379
 go slowly up the cupcake but do not burn us at last when 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.870
 let's see that it has gone up a bit then we breathe on set and we let it 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.739
 I finished 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.069
 It will take about 50 minutes 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.649
