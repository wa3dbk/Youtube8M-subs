00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.059
 whatsup youtube my name is me and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.670
 Today in the video it is once again 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.960
 I have to strong advance wolfer 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.880
 again the latest news for you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.160
 if you still remember in may 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.080
 it was in an issue of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.910
 gameinformer already an interview with 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.070
 sledgehammer games and there they said 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.279
 that forces the advanced uav one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.720
 own brand new engine will at that time 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.269
 There were a few more here, of course 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.610
 also very skeptical because they are 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.710
 affirmed ghost also said and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 i can not get any idea of 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 recognize a new engine 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.750
 they only have this quake engine again 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.680
 taken and just improved 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 but that's clear 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.289
 and now I can only say there is 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.969
 but a new edition of the magazine that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.719
 is very very cool in America so it 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.989
 is also with us in Germany 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.809
 maybe who knows is one is one 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.190
 videogame electronics magazine easy and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.230
 there was another interview with 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.210
 sledgehammer games and there they have 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 now the whole topic again more exactly 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.260
 addressed and explained and they meant 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.900
 really the engine is from scratch 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.820
 rebuilt and not on this 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.560
 creation built like the others call 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.010
 of duty parts and that will be the first 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.930
 be part of the really really whole now 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.369
 newly built with a new engine 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.710
 Of course it will still share the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.720
 old engine of the old engine code 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.130
 are are still present 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.810
 of course it should still be 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.520
 kinda a little call of duty 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.250
 resemble and I am a completely new player 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.560
 but be the old engine is almost 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.659
 not again have to be recognizable, the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 you definitely said and here I am 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.079
 already very curious what the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 have for that because if now really 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.320
 so robots and all these suits 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.509
 I can do that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.430
 understand that maybe there is one 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 need new engine because that in this 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.869
 old forces because he was not at all 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.369
 fit in I am very curious if 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.409
 Maybe the whole thing will not work out then 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.180
 more so affirmed feels by the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.040
 I was not able to trail this way yet 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.229
 take a lot or if that is different now 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.909
 or not because the first cinematic 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.409
 trailer were but I'm on everyone 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.060
 case already very excited we should yes 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.490
 soon the first gameplay the right one 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.079
 get gameplays and then I will 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.759
 of course report back to you like 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.379
 Of course I would be very happy 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.870
 Now if we have a little discussion in 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.730
 start the comments 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.670
 Of course, he tries to argue 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.349
 and not just say yes I do not know 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.879
 hate call of duty and they make him 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.209
 also new engine fucking call of duty 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.310
 but he really tries your time 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.440
 reinzubringen opinions and tell me times 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.579
 what you think about the whole topic 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.349
 I can only say I would be very happy 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.299
 happy if there is a new engine 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.730
 and I do not think that either 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.709
 countries game sets iverson yes we will 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.540
 build a whole new engine and 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.640
 then they do not do it then me 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.110
 I am very confident 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.329
 because he is call of duty 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.530
 Of course you can call him 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.780
 of duty is now getting year by year 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.549
 worse the sales figures go but 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.319
 not really down though 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.569
 the community we are now on youtube 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.879
 says cost is not exactly right now 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.190
 the best call of duty then you can 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.379
 the sales figures already see that call 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.870
 Of Duty is still a top seller 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.310
 and still top is here but I 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.170
 Guess they also want this 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.329
 community that we have on youtube 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.920
 and in general all the power 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.900
 Community back to vote a bit 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.730
 and push on their side and with 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.140
 a brand new engine now 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.639
 really nothing more to do with those 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.160
 old call of duty has little to do 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.389
 they can definitely do that 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.919
 Now my opinion as I said 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.269
 write me yours in the comments 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.400
 Of course I would always have one 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.200
 thumbs upwards if you like mine 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.060
 Of course, video and support would be great 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.560
 if you like it has but only 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.079
 Let me see you tomorrow in the morning 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.079
