for<00:00:20.070> him<00:00:20.160> onto<00:00:20.460> his<00:00:20.490> candles<00:00:21.270> okay<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.020> think

for him onto his candles okay I think

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380 
for him onto his candles okay I think
it's<00:00:22.740> hard<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.340> step<00:00:23.580> down<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.939> easiest

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it's hard to have step down the easiest

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.609 
it's hard to have step down the easiest
way<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> put<00:00:25.019> your<00:00:25.080> cap<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> first

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
way to do is put your cap on the first

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.589 
way to do is put your cap on the first
fret<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.099> tune<00:00:26.760> your<00:00:26.910> guitar<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.269> standard

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
fret and tune your guitar to standard

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.060 
fret and tune your guitar to standard
tuning<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.140> take<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.410> cable<00:00:28.529> off<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
tuning and take your cable off and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.669 
tuning and take your cable off and
you'll<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.340> half<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> step<00:00:30.510> down<00:00:30.630> tuning<00:00:31.019> but

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you'll have half a step down tuning but

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.770 
you'll have half a step down tuning but
if<00:00:31.890> that's<00:00:32.099> difficult<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.730> completely<00:00:33.480> fine

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
if that's difficult it's completely fine

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.360 
if that's difficult it's completely fine
you<00:00:34.110> keep<00:00:34.440> your<00:00:34.620> ATAR<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:34.950> standard<00:00:35.190> tuning

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you keep your ATAR and standard tuning

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
you keep your ATAR and standard tuning
it<00:00:35.520> sounds<00:00:35.790> fine<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.210> way<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.440> won't

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it sounds fine that way but it won't

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
it sounds fine that way but it won't
sound<00:00:38.070> exactly<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:38.879> she<00:00:39.059> plays<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.450> on

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
sound exactly the way she plays it on

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.670 
sound exactly the way she plays it on
the<00:00:39.629> record<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.140> would<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> half<00:00:40.649> step

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the record it would be a half step

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.170 
the record it would be a half step
higher<00:00:40.950> which<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.280> fine<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.730> could<00:00:41.820> play<00:00:42.030> you

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
teach you guys is the bridge but just a

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.020 
teach you guys is the bridge but just a
few<00:05:35.979> at<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.280> bridge<00:05:36.460> before<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:36.759> went<00:05:36.880> to<00:05:36.910> it

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
few at the bridge before you went to it

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.730 
few at the bridge before you went to it
is<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.539> chorus<00:05:38.080> before<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.560> bridge

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
is that the chorus before the bridge

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.300
