a spiderweb shade with the hardtop and
I'm<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.240> say<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.599> think<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.200> working

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
I'm going to say I think it's working

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.060 
I'm going to say I think it's working
well<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.790> was<00:00:12.389> able<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.750> resolve<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.650> problem

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
well I was able to resolve the problem

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.680 
well I was able to resolve the problem
of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:15.080> sagginess<00:00:16.369> if<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.550> take<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> look<00:00:18.420> here

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
of the sagginess if you take a look here

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
of the sagginess if you take a look here
I'm<00:00:18.810> kind<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.859> panning<00:00:20.130> around<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.520> not

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
I'm kind of panning around it's not

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
I'm kind of panning around it's not
sagging<00:00:21.840> nearly<00:00:22.529> as<00:00:22.619> much<00:00:22.769> as<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.160> before

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
sagging nearly as much as it was before

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.019 
sagging nearly as much as it was before
so<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.920> way<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> fixed<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.699> was

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
so the way the way that I fixed that was

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
so the way the way that I fixed that was
I<00:00:27.500> actually<00:00:29.510> moved<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.070> installation<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
I actually moved the installation of the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.010 
I actually moved the installation of the
front<00:00:34.309> spider<00:00:35.309> ball<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.360> way<00:00:36.480> far

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
front spider ball here all the way far

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.869 
front spider ball here all the way far
forward<00:00:37.380> I'm<00:00:37.469> gonna<00:00:37.620> take<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> driver<00:00:38.700> side

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
forward I'm gonna take the driver side

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.369 
forward I'm gonna take the driver side
freedom<00:00:39.210> top<00:00:39.360> off<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.870> second<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> show

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
freedom top off it just a second to show

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.220 
freedom top off it just a second to show
you<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.420> by<00:00:42.420> moving<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.840> forward<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you that but by moving that forward and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.330 
you that but by moving that forward and
kind<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.410> routing<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.739> through<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.980> channel

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
kind of routing it through the channel

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.760 
kind of routing it through the channel
it<00:00:44.489> helped<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.059> lot<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.750> keeping<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.410> taut

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
it helped a lot with keeping this taut

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.279 
it helped a lot with keeping this taut
so<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.390> go<00:00:48.510> ahead<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.750> remove<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
so I'm going to go ahead and remove the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.310 
so I'm going to go ahead and remove the
driver<00:00:49.890> side<00:00:49.950> freedom<00:00:50.399> panel<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> one

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
driver side freedom panel now and one

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.840 
driver side freedom panel now and one
other<00:00:52.469> thing<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> mention<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.399> those

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of you with the hardtop these screwing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
of you with the hardtop these screwing
things<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.940> don't<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> put<00:00:57.570> them<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
things you don't have to put them in a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.189 
things you don't have to put them in a
friend<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> mine<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.940> my<00:01:00.059> jeep<00:01:00.660> group<00:01:00.930> here

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
friend of mine in my jeep group here

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.869 
friend of mine in my jeep group here
told<00:01:01.469> me<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.160> don't<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> run<00:01:02.760> with

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
told me that you don't have to run with

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.609 
told me that you don't have to run with
these<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.239> they're<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:03.870> only<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.559> if

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
these in they're really only for if

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.780 
these in they're really only for if
you're<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.040> putting<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> hardtop

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you're going to be putting the hardtop

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.000 
you're going to be putting the hardtop
on<00:01:06.860> while<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:09.090> rest<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> top<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.650> off<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
on while the rest of the top is off so I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.340 
on while the rest of the top is off so I
guess<00:01:11.040> putting<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> freedom<00:01:12.299> tops<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.600> Amy<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
guess putting the freedom tops on Amy so

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.420 
guess putting the freedom tops on Amy so
you<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> roll<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.010> them<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.280> I've

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you don't have to roll with them on I've

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.950 
you don't have to roll with them on I've
not<00:01:14.610> had<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> last<00:01:15.570> couple<00:01:15.900> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.830 
not had them in for the last couple of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
kind of routed it underneath this fabric

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.640 
kind of routed it underneath this fabric
here<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:32.120> within<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.420> plastic<00:03:34.019> channel<00:03:34.530> I

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
here and within this plastic channel I

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.780 
here and within this plastic channel I
don't<00:03:34.859> know<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.040> there's<00:03:35.190> any<00:03:35.340> better<00:03:35.579> way<00:03:35.760> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
don't know if there's any better way I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.539 
don't know if there's any better way I
can<00:03:36.030> show<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.359> that<00:03:37.100> but<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:38.220> kind<00:03:38.489> of

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
can show you that but it just kind of

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.800 
can show you that but it just kind of
comes<00:03:38.760> around<00:03:39.980> here<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:42.209> kind<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.569> pulled

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
comes around here and I kind of pulled

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.620 
comes around here and I kind of pulled
this<00:03:42.959> back<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.340> probably<00:03:44.760> see<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.000> here<00:03:45.209> kind

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
this back and probably see it here kind

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.599 
this back and probably see it here kind
of<00:03:45.660> pulled<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:45.989> back<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.440> routed<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.459> that

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
of pulled that back and routed it that

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.030 
of pulled that back and routed it that
way<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:47.819> by<00:03:48.600> putting<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:48.989> in<00:03:49.109> there<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.769> keeps

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
way so by putting it in there it keeps

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.640 
way so by putting it in there it keeps
it<00:03:50.190> pretty<00:03:50.400> taut<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:52.019> prevents<00:03:52.560> the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
it pretty taut so it prevents the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.580 
it pretty taut so it prevents the
sagging<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.670> works<00:03:54.209> pretty<00:03:54.420> well<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:55.260> I

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
sagging and it works pretty well so I

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.720 
sagging and it works pretty well so I
just<00:03:55.769> wanted<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.069> post<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.310> little<00:03:56.609> update

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
just wanted to post this little update
