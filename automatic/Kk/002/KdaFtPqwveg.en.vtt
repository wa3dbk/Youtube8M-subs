00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi the roses today it is and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.710
 March carpet invited me to make a gag 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.759
 water coachella 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.470
 so I do not know if you know 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.540
 coach is there but it's a festival that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.830
 is taking place in the united states in california 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.230
 it's a festival of art and music 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.990
 with a rather particular style we will 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.130
 say bohemian chic and pi and I told myself 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.289
 that it would be nice for me to make you a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.050
 throw of look and so it's gone then 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.600
 for jewelry I already have some kind of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.949
 bracelets rings finally I do not know what 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.140
 that you think about it but frankly I 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.269
 find it very beautiful very fine here 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.520
 I love I also have a little crown 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.399
 of flowers we often see in the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.530
 festivals that we put right here I also 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 a small chain two feet here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.940
 who is nice enough with small 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.660
 leaves at home I really find her 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.460
 super rebel 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.079
 so all the jewels you show 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.960
 to buy at claire's is enough to 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.629
 his purposes like the bracelets rings 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.090
 I also have private ephemeral tattoos from 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.100
 the mark 6 or it is the adornment 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.480
 dreamcatcher and now we will go 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.280
 to the makeup category 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.110
 so I made antin 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.960
 could really make your complexion 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.670
 usual and I'm going to do makeup 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.040
 eyes with the chocolate bar waste 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.360
 too faced so I take a brush and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.250
 his father or ok so I take a brush 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.650
 and store and I take this color a 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.140
 little penniless and I just put it 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.880
 in the clip to sebral exactly 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.409
 orpea in the hollow of the eye 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.539
 I intend to stay on something 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.950
 still light enough on the eyes 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.570
 that's it to do something very 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.299
 marked as if not who and it's a 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.189
 festival it's very hot we danced 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.720
 that it was there we sing so I did not 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.159
 want to find myself with black in 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.079
 bottom of youngsters in what then 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.280
 so here after I understand a 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.840
 a little darker color for 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.090
 intensify anyway a little more 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 look after I take a big brush 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.689
 fade hours and I'm going to melt everything 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.880
 I take a flat brush from home 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.740
 sephora and I take a beige color 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.700
 clear that I put on the entire eyelid 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.289
 mobile and with my little finger I take 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.099
 a hard enough color and that I put 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.849
 in the inner corner of the eye 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.890
 so I'm going to show you something 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.539
 we saw a lot last year 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.450
 at the coachella festival it's small 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.940
 points in fact we can do so here or 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.650
 above the eyebrows so at the base in 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.040
 it's a bny illuminator 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.519
 site 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.890
 I think to develop for that but I 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.290
 find that it goes very well 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.299
 here after I'm going to put some sort of 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.180
 it's not a lipstick actually is 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.829
 neither a gloss and his anger a little nil r I 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.940
 find it very very connected it's a product 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:35.060
 who high school student november 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.800
 and here we are heading is over 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.360
 now we go to tattoo so 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.720
 it's a bit like Malabar tattoos 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.630
 or cut the drawing after we remove the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.030
 small plastic film will be applied in 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.960
 the occurrence and so far we take the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.140
 small sponges 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.030
 we forget girls and hop we build as 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.800

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.960
 the time 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.070
 So here we go a little bit and after 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.680
 about twenty seconds 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.830
 we can take off and see what that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.830
