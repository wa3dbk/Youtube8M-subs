00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
before the 500 meter final so he was a

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.849 
before the 500 meter final so he was a
little<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.230> tired<00:04:10.440> on<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.680> last

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
little bit tired on the last

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:11.509 
little bit tired on the last
straightaway

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
straightaway

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.249 
straightaway
otherwise<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.329> think<00:04:12.359> they<00:04:12.660> would<00:04:12.810> be<00:04:12.930> for<00:04:13.109> sure

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
otherwise I think they would be for sure

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.219 
otherwise I think they would be for sure
good<00:04:13.560> for<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.799> medal<00:04:14.100> he<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.430> final<00:04:14.790> two

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
good for a medal he and the final two

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.330 
good for a medal he and the final two
things<00:04:16.229> where<00:04:16.440> they<00:04:16.590> went<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.799> little<00:04:16.919> early

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
things where they went a little early

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.999 
things where they went a little early
and<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:18.389> track<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.350> conditions<00:04:19.769> brought

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
and the track and the conditions brought

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.860 
and the track and the conditions brought
everything<00:04:20.280> back<00:04:20.430> together<00:04:20.699> and<00:04:21.150> if<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:21.750> go

yeah it's gonna be hard to catch them
yeah<00:05:26.599> let's<00:05:26.990> see<00:05:27.169> if<00:05:27.409> somebody<00:05:27.860> can<00:05:27.919> do<00:05:28.190> it<00:05:28.310> and

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
yeah let's see if somebody can do it and

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.050 
yeah let's see if somebody can do it and
it's<00:05:28.669> Bart<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:32.090> actually<00:05:32.720> yes<00:05:33.819> Belgium<00:05:34.819> going

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
it's Bart and actually yes Belgium going

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.180 
it's Bart and actually yes Belgium going
in<00:05:35.210> second<00:05:35.569> place<00:05:35.659> entry<00:05:36.020> barrier<00:05:36.500> in<00:05:36.680> front<00:05:37.009> I

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
in second place entry barrier in front I

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.570 
in second place entry barrier in front I

lot<00:05:58.849> of<00:05:58.969> races<00:05:59.360> already<00:05:59.569> today<00:06:00.110> let's<00:06:00.770> see<00:06:00.979> if

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
lot of races already today let's see if

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.300 
lot of races already today let's see if
we<00:06:01.520> can<00:06:01.789> finish<00:06:02.030> it<00:06:02.300> off<00:06:02.449> and<00:06:03.199> we<00:06:03.800> haven't<00:06:04.069> sir

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
place we have barred so this is probably

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.999 
place we have barred so this is probably
also<00:06:07.460> could<00:06:08.090> be<00:06:08.120> a<00:06:08.270> big<00:06:08.479> surprise<00:06:08.810> and<00:06:09.620> for<00:06:09.860> all
