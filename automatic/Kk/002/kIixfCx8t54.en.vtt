00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.505
It is time for
our "Get Up" makeover

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:05.739
six-month follow up.

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:07.074
I love this.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.809
I know
how you do.

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.677
You might remember Amy.
Sure.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.746
Whose co-workers thought
this overworked

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.815
people pleaser
needed a day of pampering

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.884
and a new look to snag
her a man.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.652
Oh.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.888
Wow, that is hideous.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.857
Ohh...
Somebody's gonna
die alone.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.325
So six months ago,

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.227
Lisa, our
makeover expert--

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:28.595
I love her.
I know.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.897
She's the best in
the business.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.132
She went to work
and she turned that

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.168
into this.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.536
( applauding )
That's a beautiful
woman.

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:36.870
I know.
She looks terrific.

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:38.205
She looks great.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.107
So Lisa is at her
house live--

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.742
Hmm?
And we're gonna
check in

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.978
and see how she's been
maintaining her new look.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.915
Hi guys, I am so excited
to see Amy

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.117
and how
pretty she looks.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.154
( screaming )

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.289
Oh!
( laughing )

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:56.423
I'm sorry,

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.926
I think I may
have the wrong house, I--

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.360
Amy?

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.795
Yeah, you
have the right house.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.397
623 Supermodel Lane.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.065
Get in here,
you lifesaver.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.967
Oh.
Hi!

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.335
Oh, my God.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.870
I knew that you
would think

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.705
I wouldn't be able
to keep this look going on,

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.540
but check it out!

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.108
I did it, girl!

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.310
We did it!

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.313
What happened to your--
your hair?

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.215
Well, you know what,
I knew if I shampooed it,

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.317
I would lose
this beachy-wave thing

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.818
that you guys created,

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.386
so I just been
skipping it.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:27.821
I mean,
you were right.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.089
I don't have to
blow-dry it.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.091
I don't
have to wash it.

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:32.492
It's so easy.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.494
No, I definitely
never said

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.230
you didn't
have to wash it.

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:37.931
I thought you
said that.
I never said that.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.666
So...

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.769
Why is there an elliptical
in the bathtub?

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:44.404
Oh, you know what?
Oh, my God.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:45.839
I never had space
for it before,

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:47.140
but I just
thought, you know,

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:49.343
now that the bathroom's kind
of like irrelevant,

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.512
just go for it,
you know?

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.280
I mean, why not have
a fierce booty

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.382
to match my
slamming new style?

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.550
Oh, my God.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.919
You haven't been
showering, is that--

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:00.487
Uh, no, no.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.556
But people have been
showering me...

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.391
with compliments.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:05.893
Well, it looks like you
haven't even

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.394
washed your face.

00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:10.063
Okay, okay,
yeah, you know what?

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:13.333
I loved that smokey-eye thing
that you guys did,

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.435
so I knew
I couldn't recreate it,

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:16.904
so I just let it
bake in.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.705
Well, you didn't have
to recreate it.

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.541
It's just mascara,
just an extra layer.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:21.675
It's easy.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.677
Right, right, right,
but I'm like a total idiot.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.181
So that's why it's important
that I'm hot.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.616
Have you even changed
your clothes?

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.785
No, I didn't.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.421
And now I can't.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:35.489
( man )
Excuse me, ma'am...

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:36.823
is this your residence?

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:38.926
We've had some complaints
about a foul smell here.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.094
Hi, I live here.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.564
Uh, the neighbors are
worried that

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.998
someone may have died.

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:47.100
Oh, no,
nobody died,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.535
but my body is sick.

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:50.571
Hi, I'm Amy.

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:54.174
Boyfriend alert.

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:55.676
Hi.
Hi.

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:56.810
( giggling )

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:03.784
