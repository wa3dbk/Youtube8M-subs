Wincott<00:01:29.729> done<00:01:30.689> tint<00:01:32.119> but<00:01:33.119> otherwise<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.970> looks

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
Wincott done tint but otherwise it looks

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.219 
Wincott done tint but otherwise it looks
again<00:01:37.049> cool<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:39.000> goes<00:01:39.180> nicely<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.840> hailer

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
again cool it goes nicely with my hailer

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.149 
again cool it goes nicely with my hailer
each<00:01:40.380> assault<00:01:40.920> rifle<00:01:42.680> it's<00:01:43.680> done<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
each assault rifle it's done for the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.120 
each assault rifle it's done for the
same<00:01:44.430> kind<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> looks<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:46.290> suppose<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
same kind of looks and I suppose it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.749 
same kind of looks and I suppose it
could<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.250> cool<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.200> we<00:01:49.200> call<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.759> action

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
could be cool for a we call it a action

00:01:50.759 --> 00:02:00.260 
could be cool for a we call it a action
scene<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.090> well

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.940
