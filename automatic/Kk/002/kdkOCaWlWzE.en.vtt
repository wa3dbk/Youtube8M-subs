00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 as every year at this time has 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.040
 place a phenomenon that makes us 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.080
 Let's stay awake until the wee hours of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.970
 the night looking at the sky and no no we 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.860
 we refer to the ball of the penalty of sergio 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.049
 branches - but one of the most important phenomena 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.940
 summer's spectacular the persecuted 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.740
 that's why we came here 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.449
 to the planetarium to talk to Juan 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 antonio bernedo technical chief of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.100
 planetary and tell us why it is 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.939
 produces this good phenomenon the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.519
 perseides occur as a consequence 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.329
 of the particles that my 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.760
 comet in orbit around the sun and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.809
 comets the swift attlee has a period 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.090
 of 130 years around the sun and when 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 it happens then it is detaching small 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.820
 particles but those particles are 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.270
 they remain in the orbit of the sun in that same 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.970
 orbit we could put that would come by 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.390
 here they cross the orbit of the certain 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.740
 and on this date the earth goes through that 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.050
 area and swallows those particles ie 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.420
 it goes through the particle sector and 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.960
 it seems that they come from a part of the sky 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.490
 that area of â€‹â€‹the sky looking towards the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.120
 address in which they come would see 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.890
 I persecute because they are called perseides when 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.630
 our planet passes through this region the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.940
 pieces of kite enter the atmosphere 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.190
 at a speed of up to 59 kilometers 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.200
 per second and these asteroids can 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.890
 reach 10,000 degrees Celsius and 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.159
 shine for it for a second 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.310
 the perseides occur in about 20 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.360
 days centered on day 12 in this case 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.090
 the night of 12 to 13 is to say that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.640
 We have 10 more days and 10 days we have 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.020
 had ahead to see them what 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.270
 happens is that they have the maximum at night 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.840
 from 12 to 13 and from there goes 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 lowering the number of shooting stars 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.200
 that we can see this has in theory still 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.410
 more 100 is to say that we could see some 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.570
 100 shooting stars per hour is to say 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.360
 one per minute but that's in 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.560
 perfect conditions is to say let's 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.290
 watch 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.930
 less than half we're going to see about 50 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.459
 per hour so you already know how to remember 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.750
 tonight everyone to look at the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.750
 sky and enjoy the perseides
