00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello, today I want to talk about 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.099
 lock having a code mechanism 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.019
 secrecy 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.049
 we have such a lock very often 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.839
 found on garages but this instance 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.720
 I have our hair on the garage in such a lock 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.320
 either site since it has a very powerful 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 bed frame 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.350
 and fastens on four screws rather 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.350
 only 12 millimeters diameter will be y 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.219
 I was here the nut was 17 and 10 at 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.280
 10 that is 10 millimeters and studs 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.520
 You can put such a lock and tighten 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.110
 so that mom don't grieve that is 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 lock design does not allow for its 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.930
 setting to move the lock body 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.270
 which is very important for the garage that is the lock 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.390
 workable has a control stick 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.250
 bolt on the inside 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.059
 in order to open the lock it is necessary 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.520
 dial code 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:05.640
 let's type under mean hourly 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:13.850
 I go to 120 and installation by eye 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:19.460
 in 11 12 now at 6 and at 7 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:23.369
 I rearrange the key I open the lock 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:28.770
 Here is a situation when the cat is typed 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.369
 the ability to control the deadbolt from the inside then 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.079
 I have now openly closed in 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.060
 This situation is the person who 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.509
 will have keys with weapons of course 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.470
 great 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.470
 this lock 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:48.150
 now a minute let's see what's there 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.310
 inside, I think all of you are too 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.960
 I wonder how it works 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.690
 Of course there must be four gas 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.780
 disk and channel code mechanism contains 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.780
 four discs made of aluminum 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.550
 like everything in this castle almost 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.229
 corpus and region rige too for time and 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.400
 but it has a very large cross section on 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.660
 hacking take problematic what else 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.480
 I wonder if 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.170
 here this business set a little under 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.510
 another angle will change the lock code 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.600
 Ie drives about already unwind 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.030
 differently and in this castle can be 3 times 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.400
 change and maybe more 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.510
 I never thought about it 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.060
 not 39 times 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.860
 you can change the lock code, that is 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.630
 castle recoding available 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.550
 legs can hardly do it myself 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.560
 the owner of the castle is better to do it all the same in 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.480
 workshop 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.050
 Here is a lock and times I think that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.470
 the times of the Soviet Union and now they have 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.209
 Us these locks still serve faithfully 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.290
 I think this lock will still serve 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.290
 bye everyone
