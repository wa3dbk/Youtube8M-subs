00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 and what's up kids is a river and because of 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.990
 video that was up a month ago 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.620
 a video that presented you to a server 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.680
 of the hunger games ' 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.490
 how that video has had then I think that 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.130
 more than 4,000 views and more likes 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.070
 that this likes so let me tell myself that I've 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.220
 motivated has encouraged me to do another 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.020
 video of a new server of the games 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.210
 of hunger 'that has cost me his 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.390
 find it because as you well know me 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.800
 I like to find that is to teach you 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.219
 servers that are to say virgins 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.839
 are new or there are few people 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.059
 well, we are as well said in a 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.570
 new video from a server the games of the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.510
 hungry ' how good this one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.660
 this server has a capacity 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.770
 of 250 people and the bad thing is that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.980
 normally it's between 25 does not arrive 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.309
 to 30 people so I take advantage 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.460
 make the video so that you can 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.350
 see and enter the server and let's say 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.340
 that within a month and a half month two 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.600
 months this server is full and so that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.330
 can keep moving forward because the truth 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.470
 this side server has few people 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.170
 but it has some sands because 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.080
 Pretty good 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.450
 and well let's teach a little what 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.110
 is 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.170
 the server and it's worth this would be the spawn one 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.789
 Once you enter you can register here 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.149
 it tells you nothing is recorded the 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.119
 password and you see it let's not say 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.299
 then you throw yourself and we fall here 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.909
 server is quite large despite the 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.789
 few people there and sorry if not 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.310
 You are looking a little weird as you see a 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.689
 computer is a bit my squirrel and I have 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.789
 the rendering in time because no 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.979
 you see this completely but it's 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.710
 quite big as you see very good 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.170
 decoration up we have flags 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.900
 a lot of flags and good 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.610
 we have the beep out there we have parkour 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.370
 the parkour here is very good 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.060
 if it's really good enough 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.430
 as well 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.150
 our moment here to top off stop 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.769
 survival the world 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.459
 has words that I have not tried 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.110
 servers of the world no premium 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.970
 he still has a lot to squeeze out but 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.880
 good lohan 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.290
 well those would be the mini-games so 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.110
 say it here 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.990
 we would enter parkour 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.490
 that I've tried is pretty good 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.530
 first level then of 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.110
 to be the first level the first level 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.230
 it is quite difficult the boat that has 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.120
 Well, it's pretty cool and we're going to 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.800
 see here 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.300
 ah 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.300
 let's go there to see 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.740
 to see the servers I say the sands 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.080
 sorry 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.930
 As you can see we know both the sands in 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.939
 waiting 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.969
 from what I said before is because of 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.010
 that one here is in game that's because 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.319
 to the few people who have the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.959
 server 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.469
 the server is not mine but I would like 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.109
 that it entered is that it is the server to 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:38.139
 less than 100 people because the server 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.359
 it has enough quality and would not 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.389
 ok get in here and play to throw your 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.799
 games with lots of people and etcetera 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.019
 because in the other video of the games 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.120
 of hunger 'that I did as I have noticed 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.250
 now that when the brain comes in 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.210
 many times it is full and before 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.090
 I was full 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.090
 and to see this simply in half is worth 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.660
 deactivated is worth it, this would be here in 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.150
 world repair as you see the world 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.360
 Well, it is not 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.400
 is not yet well done we have the 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.419
 own hunt 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.109
 and well let's say that this is the server 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:22.770
 has a lot of hunger games ' 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.830
 has flours from the world that are being 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.920
 doing and have mini-games as separate 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.840
 paintball propaganda and so on 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.090
 very pretty 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.820
 I say that I have the rendering in tain 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.340
 and that's why you see a little bit like that 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.620
 bit poop a little shit but that 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.449
 have a computer and I can put the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.139
 rendering to extreme because it will be seen 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.770
 pretty good as you see has the beep that 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.139
 good the beep 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.020
 me right now on this server, not what 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.040
 I would recommend because either I say 250 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.040
 people there are only 25 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.410

 the more people there are better because they look 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:33.099
 that the server is giant 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.830
 very beautiful and with the speed pixel art in 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.980
 the wall 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.620
 and well this is the videogames server 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.960
 Hunger Games sands are 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.350
 like the sands of the servers 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.070
 premium is to say the sands that play 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.720

 encourage you to come we will continue the 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.100
 server because it would be pretty fun
