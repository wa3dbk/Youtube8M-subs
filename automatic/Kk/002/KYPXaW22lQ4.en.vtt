going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> act<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.020> seal<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.470> here's<00:01:43.649> your

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
going to act like a seal so here's your

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.190 
going to act like a seal so here's your
skin<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.909> seal<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> foundation

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
skin the seal and then the foundation

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.230 
skin the seal and then the foundation
and<00:01:46.770> that's<00:01:47.250> why<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.579> foundation<00:01:48.090> last

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and that's why your foundation last

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.420 
and that's why your foundation last
longer<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.689> same<00:01:49.020> way<00:01:49.259> your<00:01:49.530> eyeshadow<00:01:49.950> works

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
longer the same way your eyeshadow works

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.980 
longer the same way your eyeshadow works
the<00:01:50.520> next<00:01:50.880> thing<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.479> pores<00:01:51.750> are

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the next thing is that your pores are

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.960 
the next thing is that your pores are
diminished<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.920> softer<00:01:53.369> same<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.759> fine

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
diminished and softer same with fine

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.660 
diminished and softer same with fine
lines<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.750> again<00:01:55.470> you're<00:01:55.950> filling<00:01:56.520> in

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
lines because again you're filling in

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.160 
lines because again you're filling in
all<00:01:56.820> these<00:01:57.000> areas<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
all these areas and so that the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.190 
all these areas and so that the
foundation<00:01:58.799> doesn't<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.219> sit<00:01:59.610> inside<00:02:00.540> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
foundation doesn't just sit inside of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800 
foundation doesn't just sit inside of
your<00:02:01.740> pore<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.340> filling<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:03.630> making

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
your pore and filling up and then making

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.300 
your pore and filling up and then making
it<00:02:03.899> very<00:02:04.110> obvious<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.159> either

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it very obvious that you have either

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.800 
it very obvious that you have either
large<00:02:05.579> pores<00:02:05.909> or<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.210> even<00:02:06.420> helps<00:02:06.600> amplify

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
large pores or it even helps amplify

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.529 
large pores or it even helps amplify
your<00:02:07.110> pores<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.920> example<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.330> lot<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
your pores for example I have a lot of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.479 
your pores for example I have a lot of
blackheads<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.170> my<00:02:10.319> nose<00:02:10.500> when<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> take<00:02:11.310> them

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
blackheads on my nose when I take them

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:11.960 
blackheads on my nose when I take them
out

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
out

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.240 
out
if<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.510> stood<00:02:12.720> put<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.020> foundation<00:02:13.800> I'll<00:02:14.100> have

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
if I stood put on foundation I'll have

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.710 
if I stood put on foundation I'll have
the<00:02:14.370> nice<00:02:14.550> little<00:02:14.760> foundation<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.540> whole

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the nice little foundation in a whole

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.750 
the nice little foundation in a whole
bunch<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.960> little<00:02:16.140> spots<00:02:16.500> where<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
bunch of little spots where the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.940 
bunch of little spots where the
foundation<00:02:18.180> has<00:02:18.300> filled<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.780> all<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.530> my<00:02:19.650> pores

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
foundation has filled in all of my pores

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.760 
foundation has filled in all of my pores
so<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.640> why<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.880> need<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.510> primer<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.500> fill

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
so that's why I need that primer to fill

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.470 
so that's why I need that primer to fill
it<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.240> smooth

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
it in so that I have like a smooth

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.240 
it in so that I have like a smooth
application<00:02:25.050> with<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.230> foundation<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:25.890> it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
application with the foundation so it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.830 
application with the foundation so it
all<00:02:26.430> works<00:02:26.670> hand<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.060> hand<00:02:27.330> with<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.600> primer

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
all works hand in hand with the primer

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.120 
all works hand in hand with the primer
and<00:02:28.020> that's<00:02:28.200> why<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:28.530> important

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and that's why it's really important

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.440 
and that's why it's really important
this<00:02:29.250> would<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.580> one<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.030> important<00:02:30.330> ones

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
this would be one of the important ones

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.810 
this would be one of the important ones
for<00:02:30.630> me<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.080> my<00:02:31.320> primer<00:02:31.770> has<00:02:32.070> an<00:02:32.250> SPF<00:02:32.400> of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
for me is that my primer has an SPF of

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.300 
for me is that my primer has an SPF of
50<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.540> that's<00:02:34.050> why<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.710> because<00:02:34.890> I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
50 and so that's why I like it because I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.070 
50 and so that's why I like it because I
could<00:02:35.940> just<00:02:36.120> put<00:02:36.240> my<00:02:36.270> moisturizer<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:36.960> my

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
could just put my moisturizer on my

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.260 
could just put my moisturizer on my
primer<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.950> I'm<00:02:38.280> good<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.550> go<00:02:38.580> especially<00:02:39.000> if

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
primer and I'm good to go especially if

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.400 
primer and I'm good to go especially if
you<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.540> an<00:02:39.660> illuminating<00:02:40.290> primer

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you have like an illuminating primer

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.800 
you have like an illuminating primer
then<00:02:41.160> chances<00:02:42.120> are<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.330> don't<00:02:42.420> even<00:02:42.600> need<00:02:42.750> to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
then chances are you don't even need to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.960 
then chances are you don't even need to
our<00:02:43.020> foundation<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> summer<00:02:44.670> time
