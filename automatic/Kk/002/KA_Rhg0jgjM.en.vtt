 sony ericsson worked properly 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.890
 head of the region 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.890
 wireless headset 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.409
 in order to better understand how it works 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:16.939
 this key is terrifying musical 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.349
 contest deny 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.550
 so that no one has a result 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 whose fire 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.069
 the radio starts 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:32.300
 in front of years five questioning rub so 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.140
 way transmits an apa euro m in the first 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.450
 reading at noon exclusively for 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.650
 visibility around them 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.650
 than later in Russia 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.310
 e.on pro 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.760
 Well, as I understand it, but alas it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.830
 the device can be no longer but with 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.250
 the phone's just managed 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 according to the work 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.430
 that is, not only signs such as 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.740
 such 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.240
 but revenue growth dramatically telecom 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.240
 here now let's try 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.700
 the phone turns off 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 further and the headset still works 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 do you understand 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.760
 accordingly what can we hit again 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.830
 that bold experiment 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.250
 here is my house it is indicative that is 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.620
 doubled the headset to do 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.840
 this trick 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 not half a h myself 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.660
 it includes what 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.910
 from similar tours by the way this is 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.230
 takes away the sixth 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.920
 model 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.340
 will not slip active help after so 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.220
 will be 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 and we are talking about moving 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.500
 Well, I do not know whether the complex checks 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.780
 revealed that one sandwich cause 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.200
 this will be paid 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 here to the responsible 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 will be far away 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.399
 villagers reasons 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.179
 villagers 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.489
 So 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.829
 headset connects 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.799
 by automatic 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.599
 cooked a few days 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.110
 any include 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.500
 the truth will still be open strong 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.699
 storm 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.239
 you'll see 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.469
 badge 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.229
 already all connected 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.189
 still interesting 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.189
 what he wanted to show about headsets 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.689
 but 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.459
 in general, in my opinion one of the first 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.679
 of questions 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.679
 other 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.319
 Apparently the prosecutor's office came 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.189
 device is connected to 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.599
 particular dream 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.060
 that is, you can directly from the field 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.519
 see citizens see 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.309
 how exactly we Tomsk murat 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:02.069
 happens 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.279
 here 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.109
 for granted 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.499
 on the radio you can run 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.279
 church player 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.689
 Ministry of Finance 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.689
 so thinking is generally done 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.429
 so let not here and then 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.409
 receptionist him 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.669
 so she spent the night 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.669
 started to work 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.939
 the radio was already released items 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.299
 rules 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.159
 he has been acting for a year and a half 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.089
 what is the function 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:39.529
 in the program right here appeared 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.179
 link were scored elections in the city 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.509
 lingerie underwear londoners in parallel 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.859
 you can install that from the street 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.149
 but for now this information will be 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:51.609
 revised 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.819
 three are skeptical enough 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.899
 lost in this mode online 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:59.609
 clementing tuktamysheva will 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.199
 sport 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.189
 by the way you can believe that here 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.189
 which yuri sparrows had to do it 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.499
 of the year 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.610
 ford three fouls sides 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.459
 the keyboard is breaking what we can 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.590
 in it in general, then I think for many it 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.189
 will be plus
