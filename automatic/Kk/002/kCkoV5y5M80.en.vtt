the general features the batteries

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.610 
the general features the batteries
already<00:02:41.520> been<00:02:41.670> inserted<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.450> there<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.720> is

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.200 

and<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:51.180> back<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.600> can<00:02:51.720> see<00:02:51.870> here<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> steel

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
and the back you can see here is a steel

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.910 
and the back you can see here is a steel
steel<00:02:54.210> rear<00:02:54.510> housing<00:02:54.690> it's<00:02:55.140> very<00:02:55.350> durable<00:02:55.590> it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
steel rear housing it's very durable it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.210 
steel rear housing it's very durable it
also<00:02:56.250> looks<00:02:56.460> very<00:02:56.520> classy<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.330> device

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
also looks very classy on the device

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:18.000 
also looks very classy on the device
very<00:02:59.220> shiny

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.890 

so<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.970> SIM<00:03:19.180> card<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.480> I've<00:03:19.599> inserted

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
so the the SIM card that I've inserted

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.839 
so the the SIM card that I've inserted
here<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.319> actually<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.739> non<00:03:21.069> registered<00:03:21.310> SIM

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
here is actually a non registered SIM

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.039 
here is actually a non registered SIM
card<00:03:22.120> which<00:03:22.330> means<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.720> hasn't<00:03:22.900> been

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
card which means it hasn't been

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.619 
card which means it hasn't been
activated<00:03:23.500> with<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.739> network<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:25.510> not

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
activated with a network so it's not

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.960 
activated with a network so it's not
gonna<00:03:25.720> register<00:03:25.959> on<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.379> network<00:03:26.680> but<00:03:26.970> will

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
gonna register on the network but will

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.130 
gonna register on the network but will
