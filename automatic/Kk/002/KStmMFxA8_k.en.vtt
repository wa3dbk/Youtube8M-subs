and kill him before he burns down to the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.500 
and kill him before he burns down to the
ground<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.660> each<00:01:04.500> time<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:05.189> fall<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:06.450> do

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
ground and each time they fall they do

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.450 
ground and each time they fall they do
fall<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:06.960> different<00:01:07.470> patterns<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.070> let<00:01:08.189> me<00:01:08.280> see

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
fall in different patterns so let me see

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
fall in different patterns so let me see
if<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> different<00:01:09.390> pattern<00:01:12.170> most

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
if we can get a different pattern most

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.420 
if we can get a different pattern most
of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> time<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.619> tend<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.159> fall

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
of the time they tend to just fall

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.920 
of the time they tend to just fall
straight<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> ground<00:01:15.630> but

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
straight down to the ground but

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
straight down to the ground but
sometimes<00:01:16.290> you'll<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> high<00:01:17.220> their

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
sometimes you'll have like a high their

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.520
