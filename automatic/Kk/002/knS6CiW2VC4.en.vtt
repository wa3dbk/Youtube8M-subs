 I bring another review of some books if 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.620
 I say another because a few days ago 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.500
 he reviewed the lipsticks of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.740
 uairÃ©n wild called super center 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.539
 stage I 'm going to leave a link here 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.449
 Interested but I bring you my little one 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.340
 review of these that are glosses and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.800
 they're also from the werewolf brand and from the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.420
 geek collection I have 5 for 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 show them so I'm going to start 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.920
 showing them the packaging of these books 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.690
 it's like I mentioned they are from boer in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.530

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.540

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.450

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.200
 here also has ferggy packaging 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.870
 it seems like glasses listen to me not 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.750
 I like them for nothing, it seems to me that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.690
 packaging is a little hippie colors 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.270
 they are very beautiful there are 10 colors in the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.479
 collection have colors as well hard 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.610
 or the negri like the one I bring now and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.860
 they have very fuchsia colors too 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.229
 they even have a beautiful adif or love 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.660
 the pigmentation yes is good because as 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.840
 they say it's a jean lexus so the 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.390
 dress extend to give way well this one 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.869
 is very strong and long-lasting is what 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.550
 that are the lifting is supposed to dalt is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 that with the site's ecological heart 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.900
 the lips the price of this is less than 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.490
 4 dollars they often have the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.470
 coupons I did not buy them with Paul with 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.050
 pompoms because I did not find them but 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.910
 you can even when they are new 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.460
 they always have a dollar discount 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.470
 make up on the same stand these are 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.000
 with the all new fergie collection 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.950
 so it's going to be super easy to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.840
 you look for it or enter world dance 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.670
 It was where I bought mine as 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 I said I have five my power and can you 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.759
 do your nights the applicator is this is 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.759
 It has a very flat two key shape 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.039
 sides now let's talk about the formula 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.549
 when he calls, talk about this for the first time 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.549
 once the color I loved has like a 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:14.660
 know my opinion everyone is 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.700
 different I felt like that taste like 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.790
 almond au ments many people maybe 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.660
 you smell plastic smell at least 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.750
 apply I did this and I felt like very 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.360
 sticky like a very sticky formula 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.370
 the duration of these is less than three 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.650
 hours will last you says it's a 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 long duration there are classes that you 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.329
 three posts and it does not show that the three 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.709
 put these if you feel the lips 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.930
 you can feel that you have to have 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.329
 applied a gloss and if you are 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.549
 interested in these glosses I know 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.900
 I recommend using them with a lipstick these 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.640
 they are from berg and this is a color of them 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.350
 this bullet 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.510
 the one that I bring right now the lips 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.310
 but I'm going to make a switch with the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:06.420
 those that are called legendary face number 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.569
 305 is like that and I'm just going to rush and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.000
 Gives you a nice gloss 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.830
 That is I like I do not know if you can 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.350
 see the glow that I bring now 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.200
 the lips and it's a perfect gloss me 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.720
 love pigmentation is good first 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.370
 that I'm going to show you is this nur that is 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.310
 like a very off pink rosita 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.070
 how you have to call it and the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.630
 Lovely food as I said is 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.810
 feels very different from gas 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.990
 others to another type of balloons that that 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.570
 it seemed unique different then this 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:48.450
 as you can see this is the legendary 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.610
 face a-305 the color itself is beautiful 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.720
 the partners there may be some or 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.450
 the brightness that the next one is called 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.190
 to draw a 9 ep that this is a 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.100
 Very beautiful brig 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.240
 I turn a little purple and repeat the 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.660
 pigmentation is exaggerated terrific there 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.710
 is this color this from here small 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.049
 is that this I loved this was the one 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.690
 I went to change because I had 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.310
 broken 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.310
 because this here 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.070
 This look how beautiful this color is a 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.130
 working fuchsia well strong pudding comes to 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.640
 307 fabulous and the last one is this one 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.440
 moradito that I loved to follow this 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.390
 is this also I'm going to leave photos 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.220
 so they can see how the lips look and 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.330
 good girls that has been my little 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.160
 review about these closet Uruguay 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.380
 alex in my opinion I do know 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.810
 I recommend to me if I like name is 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.360
 for nothing that feeling is not euro see and 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.280
 a color and as I said synthetic the world 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.200
 it's different you should know if the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.940
 they have what they think of these the 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.800
 pigmentation is what I like the least 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.740
 You can use this one that I bring 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.470
 right now I love it is a good color 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.240
 it's a good color when you apply 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.670
 this blog you feel a sensation like 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.350
 wet is something a little bit a texture 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.200
 very different from any other blog 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.630
 at the beginning as I said I felt that 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.420
 sticky but if you apply a lipstick 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.060
 under perfect I can not 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.470
 forget to mention that these do not go 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.670
 to reserve the lips so that's 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.610
 good 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.500
 duration after 34 hours that they were 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.660
 goes the gloss or the shine you have the 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.730
 little color of the lips or the lip dye 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.160
 stein I hope you have served them this 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.640
 review and if you liked give me here a 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.290
