is<00:01:06.510> vertical<00:01:07.510> we<00:01:08.410> will<00:01:08.590> change<00:01:08.800> this<00:01:09.070> right

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
is vertical we will change this right

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.320 
is vertical we will change this right
now<00:01:09.550> into<00:01:10.530> horizontal<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.820> our<00:01:12.970> battery

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
now into horizontal with our battery

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.810 
now into horizontal with our battery
switch<00:01:13.630> first<00:01:14.290> of<00:01:14.440> all<00:01:14.560> take<00:01:14.800> off<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.490> screw

we<00:01:16.030> deliver<00:01:16.480> with<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.720> battery<00:01:17.080> switch<00:01:17.640> next

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
we deliver with a battery switch next

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.460 
we deliver with a battery switch next
step<00:01:19.840> will<00:01:20.170> be<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.710> connect<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:22.470> negative

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
step will be to connect the negative

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.060 
step will be to connect the negative
cable<00:01:23.950> with<00:01:24.400> our<00:01:24.700> paddle<00:01:25.150> switch<00:01:25.920> right<00:01:26.920> now
