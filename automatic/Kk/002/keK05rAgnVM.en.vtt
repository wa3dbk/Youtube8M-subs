00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
think what other than Baines and Walker

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.880 
think what other than Baines and Walker
so<00:04:11.849> basic<00:04:12.180> yeah<00:04:12.390> they<00:04:12.569> both<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.989> full<00:04:13.650> start

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
so basic yeah they both have full start

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.890 
so basic yeah they both have full start
and<00:04:14.040> then<00:04:14.159> for<00:04:14.819> up<00:04:14.939> front<00:04:15.120> now<00:04:15.450> this<00:04:15.659> is<00:04:15.720> the

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
and then for up front now this is the

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.170 
and then for up front now this is the
part<00:04:15.989> where<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.470> gets<00:04:16.949> tricky<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.549> way<00:04:17.669> we

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
part where it gets tricky in a way we

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.240 
part where it gets tricky in a way we
have<00:04:18.299> something<00:04:18.630> XO<00:04:18.900> who's<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.320> great<00:04:19.889> upfront

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
have something XO who's a great upfront

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.800 
have something XO who's a great upfront
place<00:04:20.519> what<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.880> patient<00:04:21.299> needs<00:04:21.329> that<00:04:21.630> night

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
place what the patient needs that night

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.270 
place what the patient needs that night
you<00:04:21.959> want<00:04:22.109> a

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
you want a

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.030 
you want a
believe<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.639> on<00:04:22.760> which<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.420> freakin<00:04:23.990> fast<00:04:24.590> ads

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
believe it on which is freakin fast ads

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.490 
believe it on which is freakin fast ads
so<00:04:25.850> we<00:04:26.330> don't<00:04:26.480> need<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.750> put<00:04:26.840> any<00:04:27.020> attribute

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
so we don't need to put any attribute

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.750 
so we don't need to put any attribute
that<00:04:27.530> finishes<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.100> off<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.550> put<00:04:28.700> the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
that finishes that off so you put the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.400 
that finishes that off so you put the
finisher<00:04:29.090> attribute<00:04:29.540> which<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:29.780> heading<00:04:30.200> and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
finisher attribute which is heading and

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.620 
finisher attribute which is heading and
shop<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.370> makes<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.669> shot<00:04:31.970> as<00:04:32.120> powerful<00:04:32.570> as

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
shop so it makes it shot as powerful as

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.690 
shop so it makes it shot as powerful as
you<00:04:32.750> need<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.230> it's<00:04:33.770> heading<00:04:34.070> great<00:04:34.460> so

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
you need it and it's heading great so

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.870 
you need it and it's heading great so
corners<00:04:35.180> they'll<00:04:35.570> be<00:04:35.600> going<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:36.020> um<00:04:36.669> but<00:04:37.669> if

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
corners they'll be going in um but if

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.070 
corners they'll be going in um but if
you<00:04:38.060> don't<00:04:38.180> want<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.360> go<00:04:38.419> for<00:04:38.570> more<00:04:38.660> expensive

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
option I can buy and because I didn't

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.460 
option I can buy and because I didn't
have<00:04:40.730> that<00:04:40.910> much<00:04:41.030> money<00:04:41.210> but<00:04:41.990> if<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.320> want<00:04:42.440> to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
have that much money but if you want to

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.460 
have that much money but if you want to
go<00:04:42.590> for<00:04:42.830> Aguero<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:44.120> place<00:04:44.300> maxi<00:04:44.690> great

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470

striking<00:04:49.190> against<00:04:49.550> game<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:50.090> think<00:04:50.690> he'll<00:04:50.930> be

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
striking against game I think he'll be

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.440 
striking against game I think he'll be
in<00:04:51.290> competition<00:04:51.500> with<00:04:51.919> Suarez<00:04:52.400> but<00:04:53.000> not<00:04:53.270> much

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
in competition with Suarez but not much

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.150 
in competition with Suarez but not much
competition<00:04:53.660> because<00:04:54.410> Aguero's<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:54.890> black

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
competition because Aguero's a black

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.430 
competition because Aguero's a black
grey<00:04:55.340> player<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:56.360> guys<00:04:56.570> as<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.930> said<00:04:56.990> this<00:04:57.230> is<00:04:57.320> my

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
grey player so guys as I said this is my

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.159 
grey player so guys as I said this is my
first<00:04:57.710> ever<00:04:57.919> BPL<00:04:58.669> squad<00:04:58.850> builder<00:04:59.180> it's<00:04:59.840> 84

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
first ever BPL squad builder it's 84

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.190 
first ever BPL squad builder it's 84
rated<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.650> but<00:05:01.190> 98<00:05:01.700> chemistry<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.360> can't<00:05:02.900> see

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
rated and but 98 chemistry I can't see

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.420 
rated and but 98 chemistry I can't see
where<00:05:03.440> it's<00:05:03.590> going<00:05:03.770> wrong<00:05:03.950> I<00:05:04.040> think<00:05:04.280> it's

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
where it's going wrong I think it's

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.190 
where it's going wrong I think it's
mainly<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.700> winger's<00:05:05.090> that's<00:05:05.750> making<00:05:06.080> the

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
mainly the winger's that's making the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.050 
mainly the winger's that's making the
chemistry<00:05:06.530> go<00:05:06.650> wrong<00:05:06.860> but<00:05:07.340> as<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.490> said<00:05:07.610> yes<00:05:07.850> my
