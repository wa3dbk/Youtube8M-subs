00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.890
 well it was all kids are species to 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.670
 youtube and in the previous video os 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.250
 I will teach how to install the beta of 7.1 without 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.020
 be development in this video explain you 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.390
 a little bit the news that this 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.840
 beta so you can decide if it's worth it 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.839
 update or not to this new version of 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.490
 them 7.1 in the description of the video os 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.189
 I will leave the previous video in which 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.990
 explained how to install the beta is worth 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.660
 if someone is interested in installing it 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.490
 after seeing this video as kids 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.800
 the main improvements that we found 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.900
 in there is a 7.1 are in 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.290
 accessibility to access 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.910
 accessibility we had general adjustments and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.790
 would offer us here the section 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.770
 good accessibility the first improvement 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.810
 that we find in accessibility between 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.060
 the text in bold before when 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.220
 we enable this option is valid so that 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.530
 make the changes we had to turn off 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.420
 our device and return it to 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.090
 turn on so that the text would change in 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.250
 bold now just with leaving 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.010
 adjustments and re-enter as you go to 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.160
 see the text is already 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.440
 in bold good another new option that 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.300
 there in accessibility is to increase the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.280
 contrast that as you are seeing it 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.070
 it divides into reducing transparency and 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.470
 darken colors good as all 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.360
 you will already know there is a 7 and a lot 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.360
 of transparencies is valid in the center of 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.120
 notifications in the dock and 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.700
 folders is worth as it is a good title 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.640
 With this option it all 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.040
 transparencies would become opaque under 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.290
 my point of view the truth is that it remains 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.900
 pretty ugly and I just find him 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.060
 meaning to this if apple thinks well 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 good at reducing a bit the consumption of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.560
 ram on devices like the iphone 4 that 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.570
 they go a little fairer and make them a 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.790
 little bit more fluid and not the truth is 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.830
 that I do not find the sense another 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.530
 option that appears in increase contrast 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.140
 is darken colors that is good 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 to improve a bit the contrast between 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.260
 the colors in year 7 also in the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.750
 accessibility we find another 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.990
 innovation that is called dark keyboard 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.570
 good as you see me right now I have 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.090
 blank is worth as you are seeing and 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.850
 enabling this option I would change it 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.120
 to black, ok, let's enable the go 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.300
 to return to notes is how you see the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.030
 keyboard would happen to be something else new 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.120
 that we find in 17.1 is in the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.160
 notification center as you see when 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.800
 I'm going to anything goes now appears a 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.630
 text that puts no notification and in 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.140
 unattended notifies me 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.450
 I did not understand in seven points 0.4 not 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.700
 nothing else appeared that has changed 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.250
 in the notification center is that 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.960
 they have changed the weather icon of it 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.470
 It's worth not seeing here why we're here 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.750
 on an iPad and it does not bring the application of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.120
 time in 6.5 is the application 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.330
 camera would show us a new option 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.960
 which is called hdr auto when we removed 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.570
 a burst of photos our device 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.700
 I would automatically choose the best good 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.420
 how is this version seen 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.190
 7.1 brings more visual improvements than other 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.470
 thing to me personally has 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.319
 disappointed a bit because I expected 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.360
 something more than 7 years 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.700
 you can put me in the comments what 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.430
 do you think 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.819
 in the description of the video below I'm going to 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.610
 leave you good link to a video that 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.830
 I made so you can download this beta 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.750

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.550
