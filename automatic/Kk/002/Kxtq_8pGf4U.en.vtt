00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.580
 well here we are at home and charity of Sara should be on air 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.800
 real mallorca no need 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.360
 with your party as a townhouse get what you do is now investigated 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.539
 good our 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.079
 our kitchen my kitchen 3 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.890
 I'm really Mallorcan cuisine 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.159
 efe 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.839
 I have put my personality 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:34.360
 it means that it is not that he pushes with all my respects the others 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.290
 kitchen is shaped like france 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.769
 i in in she sings her kitchen but 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.729
 I want to believe that they fixed kitchen as something 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.870
 What is Mallorcan cuisine? 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 percent my vision of this kitchen i nowadays because it voted maybe 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.730
 more radical 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.780
 it's mostly because my my idea of ​​the future that is the third local producer 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.810
 so 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.440
 Mallorcan cuisine in sirte is limited 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.340
 to stop the traditional but I think we need the product that we have 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.450
 here and think about the future of this kitchen what does quote a renovation 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.930
 phillips a little min my present and my future 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.420
 who owns local plants 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.660
 and also in little time the na 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.619
 barack obama cuisine has been done if a few years ago it is evident that you need 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 in full form a reset activity because they are two producers 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.280
 the products and its all the people that are required in the product that we have here 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.829
 why 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.659
 In a way, Héctor has been contemplating the option of Majorca tourism 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.270
 nozar in the invaded with lots of outer science products are 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.420
 also of the fruits here 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.770
 i say maybe 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.060
 they arrived little 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.050
 the attention towards that Mallorcan kitchen 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.890
 often treated 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.300
 what for me really has the value of 2 local 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.580
 I nevertheless teach to be able to teach that they do not have it 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.840
 visitor 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.730
 that we have as a result of that if you want this to be haute cuisine 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.830
 Even if it is a simple Mallorcan comayagua or any elaboration 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.150
 it happens that we have to take care of it round it out fc2 flavors of always 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.579
 traditional 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.769
 but or renewed because it is a challenge calafate is a challenge 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:27.229
 what you have to think min not many but one way is that you respect a lot 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:28.599
 flavor by the end 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.209
 i the opi otherwise you have to take a step forward not 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:36.229
 by stress is a little what we are doing is people are 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.239
 very very happy is very comfortable with this type of kitchen 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:43.199

 they are surprised sometimes ddd 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.139
 this taste as natural as authentic as cooking his mother 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.999
 but with the presentation or with a way of liking the theater because its 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:55.799
 mandate 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.239
