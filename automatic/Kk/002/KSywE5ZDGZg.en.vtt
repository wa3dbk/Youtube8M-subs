00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.170 
but now it's like one long stroke yeah
it<00:02:26.080> really<00:02:26.350> works<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.250> micro<00:02:27.700> closed<00:02:27.970> up

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
it really works as a micro closed up

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.690 
it really works as a micro closed up
like<00:02:28.240> that<00:02:28.540> i'm<00:02:28.780> really<00:02:29.260> digging<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.700> like

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
like that i'm really digging that like

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.730 
like that i'm really digging that like
it's<00:02:30.880> actually<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> i<00:02:31.750> think<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
it's actually the i think this is the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.680 
it's actually the i think this is the
the<00:02:32.950> i<00:02:33.160> think<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:33.970> closest<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.570> get

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the i think this is the closest we get

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.740 
the i think this is the closest we get
to<00:02:34.750> dance<00:02:35.080> face<00:02:35.380> in<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.860> whole<00:02:36.010> film<00:02:36.250> yeah<00:02:36.880> so

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
to dance face in the whole film yeah so

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.180 
to dance face in the whole film yeah so
those<00:02:37.870> pores<00:02:38.230> are<00:02:38.440> really<00:02:38.650> gonna<00:02:38.770> have<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
those pores are really gonna have to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.340 
those pores are really gonna have to
hold<00:02:39.310> out<00:02:39.690> alright<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.870> right<00:02:40.900> here<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.260> where

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
I might tweak the camera a little bit to

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.360 
I might tweak the camera a little bit to
get<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.060> little<00:03:47.180> bit<00:03:47.390> like<00:03:47.990> you<00:03:48.170> had<00:03:48.380> what<00:03:49.250> you

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
get a little bit like you had what you

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.650 
get a little bit like you had what you
guys<00:03:49.490> had<00:03:49.700> before<00:03:50.000> was<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.240> nose<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.630> eyes

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
guys had before was the nose the eyes

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.750 
guys had before was the nose the eyes
and<00:03:50.990> a<00:03:51.050> lot<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.530> forehead<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.610> we've

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
and a lot of the forehead and so we've

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.120 
and a lot of the forehead and so we've
gotten<00:03:53.060> rid<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.240> a<00:03:53.360> lot<00:03:53.510> much<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.740> forehead

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
here but I think I yeah just move over

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.750 
here but I think I yeah just move over
to<00:03:57.590> get<00:03:57.740> a<00:03:57.770> little<00:03:57.980> bit<00:03:58.070> more<00:03:58.220> forehead<00:03:58.730> a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
to get a little bit more forehead a

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.880 
to get a little bit more forehead a
little<00:03:58.850> bit<00:03:59.150> less<00:03:59.300> mouth<00:03:59.570> look<00:04:00.500> at<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.710> eyes

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
little bit less mouth look at the eyes

so that's looking yeah good just trying
to<00:04:23.060> think<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.300> there's<00:04:23.420> any<00:04:23.540> linkage<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.500> we

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
to think of there's any linkage that we

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.050 
to think of there's any linkage that we
want<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.250> see<00:04:25.400> other<00:04:25.520> than<00:04:25.760> at<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.940> beginning
