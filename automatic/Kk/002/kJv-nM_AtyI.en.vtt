00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
know everybody knows you can use cattail

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.980 
know everybody knows you can use cattail
fluff<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:25.590> start<00:03:25.860> fire<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.870> everybody<00:03:27.870> else

in<00:03:28.110> knows<00:03:28.230> how<00:03:28.350> quickly<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.860> goes<00:03:29.120> again<00:03:30.530> take

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
in knows how quickly it goes again take

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.760 
in knows how quickly it goes again take
a<00:03:31.560> few<00:03:31.770> drops<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.640> mineral<00:03:33.000> oil<00:03:36.500> put<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.650> on

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
a few drops of the mineral oil put it on

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:58.520 
a few drops of the mineral oil put it on
the<00:03:38.010> cattail<00:03:38.820> fluff<00:03:53.840> notice<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:57.530> one

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
the cattail fluff notice that the one

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.580 
the cattail fluff notice that the one
the<00:03:58.650> right<00:03:58.800> without<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.160> mineral<00:03:59.460> oil<00:04:00.590> goes

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
the right without the mineral oil goes

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.110 
the right without the mineral oil goes
out<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.620> patches<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.190> spark<00:04:05.490> easily<00:04:05.910> and

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
out so it patches the spark easily and

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.990 
out so it patches the spark easily and
then<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.570> will<00:04:06.690> continue<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.260> burn<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:08.820> can

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
then it will continue to burn and I can

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.800 
then it will continue to burn and I can
keep<00:04:09.260> sparking<00:04:10.260> one<00:04:10.560> over<00:04:10.800> there<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:12.570> she'll

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
keep sparking one over there and she'll

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.020 
keep sparking one over there and she'll
go<00:04:12.960> up<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.320> stuff<00:04:14.570> but<00:04:15.570> this<00:04:15.750> one<00:04:16.020> would<00:04:16.230> be

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030
