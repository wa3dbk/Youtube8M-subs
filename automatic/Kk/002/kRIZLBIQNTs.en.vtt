00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
bucks pretty good quality but I decided

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.480 
bucks pretty good quality but I decided
I<00:00:18.900> wanted<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.289> make<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.619> look<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.130> little<00:00:20.250> bit

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
I wanted to make it look a little bit

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.670 
I wanted to make it look a little bit
more<00:00:20.760> realistic<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.660> went<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> store

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
more realistic so I went to the store

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.390 
more realistic so I went to the store
and<00:00:22.949> buy<00:00:23.130> my<00:00:23.310> cell<00:00:23.580> phone<00:00:23.960> it's<00:00:24.960> tulip<00:00:25.680> slick

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and buy my cell phone it's tulip slick

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.750 
and buy my cell phone it's tulip slick
puffy<00:00:26.880> paint<00:00:27.150> looking<00:00:27.960> stuff<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.800> guess<00:00:29.550> it's

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
puffy paint looking stuff I guess it's

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.030 
puffy paint looking stuff I guess it's
posed<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.510> me<00:00:30.630> better<00:00:30.869> than<00:00:31.140> puffy<00:00:31.590> paint<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
posed to me better than puffy paint it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.540 
posed to me better than puffy paint it
doesn't<00:00:32.369> tear<00:00:32.640> apart<00:00:32.870> it's<00:00:33.870> about<00:00:33.960> anything

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
doesn't tear apart it's about anything

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.229 
doesn't tear apart it's about anything
