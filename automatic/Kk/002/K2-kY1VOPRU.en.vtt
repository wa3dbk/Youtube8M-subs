course you can make mistakes because
everybody<00:04:38.750> does<00:04:39.020> even<00:04:39.500> native<00:04:40.100> speakers<00:04:40.610> so

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
everybody does even native speakers so

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.230 
everybody does even native speakers so
it's<00:04:41.060> not<00:04:41.270> a<00:04:41.330> big<00:04:41.570> deal<00:04:41.750> however<00:04:42.139> of<00:04:42.860> course

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
it's not a big deal however of course

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.510 
it's not a big deal however of course
well<00:04:44.240> there<00:04:45.020> should<00:04:45.380> be<00:04:45.410> not<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:45.949> many<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.340> them

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
well there should be not so many of them

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.550 
well there should be not so many of them
they<00:04:47.120> may<00:04:47.419> are<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.780> most<00:04:47.930> important<00:04:48.380> thing

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
they may are the most important thing

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.980 
they may are the most important thing
that<00:04:48.919> other<00:04:49.310> people<00:04:49.880> should<00:04:49.910> understand<00:04:50.630> you

so the communicative well aspect would

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.480 
so the communicative well aspect would
work<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:56.180> group<00:04:56.509> activities<00:04:57.199> also<00:04:57.530> boost<00:04:58.160> your

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
progress it's a good idea for instance

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.610 
progress it's a good idea for instance
when<00:05:01.639> I<00:05:01.880> studied<00:05:02.360> at<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.509> university<00:05:03.050> I<00:05:03.229> went

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
when I studied at the university I went

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.760 
when I studied at the university I went
to<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.009> British<00:05:04.340> Council<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:05.479> we<00:05:06.320> had<00:05:06.500> some

chat<00:05:07.070> with<00:05:07.370> other<00:05:07.610> people<00:05:08.030> studying<00:05:08.389> English

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
chat with other people studying English

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.219 
chat with other people studying English
and<00:05:09.050> there<00:05:09.380> was<00:05:09.530> one<00:05:09.770> native<00:05:10.190> speaker<00:05:10.930> so<00:05:11.930> it

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
and there was one native speaker so it

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.070 
and there was one native speaker so it
was<00:05:12.440> quite<00:05:12.680> useful<00:05:12.710> because<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.789> had<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.389> talk

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
for quite a long period of time however

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.930 
for quite a long period of time however
when<00:05:17.539> these<00:05:18.080> groups<00:05:18.500> are<00:05:18.710> too<00:05:19.220> big<00:05:19.610> of<00:05:19.910> course

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
when these groups are too big of course

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.969 
when these groups are too big of course
it's<00:05:20.419> not<00:05:20.570> actually<00:05:21.080> very<00:05:21.110> good<00:05:21.349> because<00:05:21.560> you

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
it's not actually very good because you

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.830
