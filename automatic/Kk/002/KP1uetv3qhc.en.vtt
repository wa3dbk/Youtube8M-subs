anyway um I think I was saying but the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.990 
anyway um I think I was saying but the
reason<00:02:19.920> I'm<00:02:20.100> out<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.220> breath<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:20.880> I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
reason I'm out of breath is because I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
reason I'm out of breath is because I
just<00:02:21.180> drank<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.660> whole<00:02:21.780> bunch<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.140> water<00:02:22.290> I've

just drank a whole bunch of water I've
been<00:02:23.580> really<00:02:23.760> bad<00:02:24.000> about<00:02:24.240> getting<00:02:24.540> my<00:02:24.780> liquids

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
