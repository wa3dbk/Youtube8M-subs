good<00:00:35.829> critic<00:00:36.130> which<00:00:36.520> I<00:00:36.670> think<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:38.190> side<00:00:39.190> where

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
good critic which I think the side where

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.430 
good critic which I think the side where
workplace<00:00:39.850> well<00:00:40.120> you<00:00:40.300> know<00:00:40.420> has<00:00:40.780> no<00:00:40.989> chances

well<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.180> think<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.659> mystery<00:01:37.960> ball<00:01:38.170> has<00:01:38.440> done

well I think the mystery ball has done
the<00:01:38.740> trick<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:39.130> him<00:01:39.250> because<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.659> think<00:01:41.260> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the trick for him because I think the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.750 
the trick for him because I think the
most<00:01:42.820> batsmen<00:01:43.500> find<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.650> hard<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.979> pick<00:01:45.159> even

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
most batsmen find it hard to pick even

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.289

voting in a nurse because I think is the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.569 
voting in a nurse because I think is the

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
yeah whatever endo did you think the

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:23.530 
yeah whatever endo did you think the
light<00:02:14.670> was<00:02:14.790> bad<00:02:14.940> enough<00:02:15.150> scoffs<00:02:20.420> sighs<00:02:21.420> about

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
light was bad enough scoffs sighs about

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.490 
light was bad enough scoffs sighs about
how<00:02:24.540> easy<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.989> task<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.500> chopper<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:27.170> well<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
how easy a task a chopper to you well a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.620 
how easy a task a chopper to you well a
little<00:02:29.099> but<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.610> couldn't<00:02:29.849> name<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.150> thing

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
little but it couldn't name one thing

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.789 
little but it couldn't name one thing
but<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:34.140> should<00:02:34.380> be<00:02:34.560> something

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
but I think that it should be something

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.850 
but I think that it should be something
you<00:02:35.010> know<00:02:35.220> which<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.630> should<00:02:36.840> play<00:02:37.500> well<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
you know which we should play well and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.240 
you know which we should play well and
achieve<00:02:38.400> because<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:39.299> think<00:02:40.040> there's<00:02:41.040> nothing

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
achieve because I think there's nothing

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.400 
achieve because I think there's nothing
being<00:02:41.579> touched<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.120> my<00:02:42.180> opinion<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.230> I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
being touched in my opinion and then I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.830 
being touched in my opinion and then I
think<00:02:43.829> if<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.130> batsman<00:02:44.400> whoever<00:02:44.730> has<00:02:44.970> played

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
think if the batsman whoever has played

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.410 
think if the batsman whoever has played
as<00:02:45.989> short<00:02:46.319> little<00:02:46.920> years<00:02:47.579> but<00:02:47.790> run<00:02:47.970> with<00:02:48.269> it

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
as short little years but run with it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.960 
as short little years but run with it
and<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.319> mother<00:02:49.560> who<00:02:49.799> kept<00:02:50.310> their<00:02:50.670> line<00:02:50.819> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
and the mother who kept their line and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.030 
and the mother who kept their line and
answer<00:02:51.480> beginning<00:02:52.079> with<00:02:52.200> if<00:02:52.470> there's<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.829> fair

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
answer beginning with if there's a fair

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.160 
answer beginning with if there's a fair
chance<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.489> everyone<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.019> my

innings<00:03:33.569> in<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:33.900> series<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:35.239> since<00:03:36.239> this

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
innings in this series and since this

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.120 
innings in this series and since this
girl<00:03:36.630> started<00:03:37.020> up<00:03:37.230> I've<00:03:37.470> also<00:03:37.800> had<00:03:37.980> about

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
girl started up I've also had about

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.240 
girl started up I've also had about
three<00:03:38.520> weeks<00:03:38.700> with<00:03:38.819> Robert<00:03:39.239> runs<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:40.069> it<00:03:41.069> was

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
three weeks with Robert runs and it was

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.860 
three weeks with Robert runs and it was
always<00:03:41.400> going<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.819> be<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.360> because<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
always going to be like that because the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.010 
always going to be like that because the
given<00:03:43.110> conditions<00:03:44.060> sometimes<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.750> wouldn't

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
given conditions sometimes you wouldn't

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.080 
given conditions sometimes you wouldn't
be<00:03:46.200> able<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.410> play<00:03:46.650> any<00:03:46.830> shorter<00:03:47.400> with<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
be able to play any shorter with the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.449 
be able to play any shorter with the
kind<00:03:48.270> of<00:03:48.390> bowling<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:48.930> they<00:03:49.110> were<00:03:49.340> we<00:03:50.340> were

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
kind of bowling but they were we were

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.690 
kind of bowling but they were we were
getting<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.569> think<00:03:52.099> it's<00:03:53.099> just<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.550> the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
getting and I think it's just that the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.640 
getting and I think it's just that the
pages<00:03:53.940> should<00:03:54.269> be<00:03:54.450> lying<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.840> know<00:03:54.989> whoever

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
pages should be lying you know whoever

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.050 
pages should be lying you know whoever
does<00:03:56.640> well<00:03:56.880> he<00:03:57.450> should<00:03:57.690> dominate<00:03:58.110> because

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
does well he should dominate because

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.640 
does well he should dominate because
sometimes<00:04:00.060> it's<00:04:00.450> this<00:04:00.750> no<00:04:01.290> chance<00:04:01.560> for

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
sometimes it's this no chance for

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.680 
sometimes it's this no chance for
batsmen<00:04:02.130> on<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.700> tracks<00:04:03.180> we<00:04:03.360> had<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.600> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
batsmen on the tracks we had in the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.330 
batsmen on the tracks we had in the
previous<00:04:03.930> two<00:04:04.230> Test<00:04:04.440> matches<00:04:04.620> if<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> catches

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
previous two Test matches if the catches

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.490 
previous two Test matches if the catches
were<00:04:05.459> not<00:04:05.640> drunk<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:06.030> think<00:04:06.239> they<00:04:06.390> would<00:04:07.319> finish

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
were not drunk I think they would finish

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.059 
were not drunk I think they would finish
in<00:04:07.739> two<00:04:07.860> days<00:04:09.080> how<00:04:10.080> hard<00:04:10.319> is<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.470> will<00:04:10.739> keep

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
in two days how hard is it will keep

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.640 
in two days how hard is it will keep
faith<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.060> confidence<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:13.200> your<00:04:13.350> Salah

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
faith and confidence in your Salah

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.430 
faith and confidence in your Salah
during<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.730> series<00:04:15.060> as<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.239> whole<00:04:15.440> obviously

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
during the series as a whole obviously

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.770 
during the series as a whole obviously
started<00:04:16.799> badly<00:04:17.040> when<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:18.299> probably<00:04:18.570> felt

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
started badly when you probably felt

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.080 
started badly when you probably felt
that<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.109> have<00:04:19.290> this<00:04:19.410> in<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:19.979> had<00:04:20.940> any

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
that you have this in you I had any

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.000 
that you have this in you I had any
patient<00:04:21.540> come<00:04:21.930> out<00:04:22.079> how<00:04:22.290> does<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.740> mean<00:04:22.889> to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
patient come out how does it mean to

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.710 
patient come out how does it mean to
keep<00:04:23.130> every<00:04:23.400> one<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:24.090> same<00:04:24.300> opinion<00:04:26.720> well

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
keep every one of the same opinion well

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.490 
keep every one of the same opinion well
I<00:04:27.840> think<00:04:27.900> it's<00:04:28.650> been<00:04:29.900> it's<00:04:30.900> been<00:04:30.960> good<00:04:31.229> on<00:04:31.289> the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
I think it's been it's been good on the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.830 
I think it's been it's been good on the
part<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.860> everyone<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.669> every<00:04:33.390> individual

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
part of everyone and every individual

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.900 
part of everyone and every individual
because<00:04:33.960> obviously<00:04:34.500> they<00:04:35.130> also<00:04:35.400> have<00:04:35.640> kept

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
because obviously they also have kept

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.360 
because obviously they also have kept
themselves<00:04:36.120> up<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.830> with<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.860> very<00:04:38.130> less

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
themselves up and with a very less

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.130 
themselves up and with a very less
experience<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.090> they<00:04:39.210> had<00:04:39.360> behind<00:04:39.690> them<00:04:39.930> I

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
experience that they had behind them I

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.920 
experience that they had behind them I
think<00:04:40.919> this<00:04:41.490> shows<00:04:41.729> they<00:04:42.000> might<00:04:42.240> describe<00:04:42.600> and

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
think this shows they might describe and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.659 
think this shows they might describe and
I<00:04:43.110> think<00:04:43.350> these<00:04:43.530> guys<00:04:43.590> are<00:04:43.830> learning<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
I think these guys are learning it the

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.279 
I think these guys are learning it the
heart<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.150> which<00:04:45.419> will<00:04:45.630> help<00:04:45.900> them<00:04:46.140> in

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
heart of it which will help them in

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.270 
heart of it which will help them in
their<00:04:46.320> futures<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.789> also<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.240> think<00:04:49.160> we<00:04:50.160> had<00:04:50.250> a

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
their futures and also I think we had a

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.090 
their futures and also I think we had a
very<00:04:50.990> good<00:04:51.990> game<00:04:52.050> against<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.680> Aussie<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:52.979> the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
very good game against the Aussie is the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.040 
very good game against the Aussie is the
second<00:04:53.430> Testament<00:04:53.850> which<00:04:54.630> they<00:04:54.900> will

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
second Testament which they will

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.990 
second Testament which they will
remember<00:04:55.229> all<00:04:55.590> their<00:04:55.740> lives<00:04:55.979> because<00:04:56.400> nobody

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
remember all their lives because nobody

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.090 
remember all their lives because nobody
you<00:04:57.660> know<00:04:57.810> before<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.320> game<00:04:58.500> would<00:04:58.740> say<00:04:58.919> that

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
you know before the game would say that

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.740 
you know before the game would say that
Pakistan<00:04:59.610> would<00:04:59.729> win<00:04:59.940> that<00:04:59.970> with<00:05:00.270> five

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
Pakistan would win that with five

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.100 
Pakistan would win that with five
capitals<00:05:01.140> played<00:05:01.789> but<00:05:02.789> still<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.090> think<00:05:03.240> it's

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
capitals played but still I think it's

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.380 
capitals played but still I think it's
the<00:05:04.229> character<00:05:04.560> of<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.800> individuals<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.430> I

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
the character of the individuals and I

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.020 
the character of the individuals and I
think<00:05:06.979> all<00:05:07.979> of<00:05:08.039> them<00:05:08.370> have<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.550> future<00:05:08.789> for

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
think all of them have a future for

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.950 
think all of them have a future for
Pakistan<00:05:09.479> so<00:05:09.690> they<00:05:10.440> know<00:05:10.620> it's<00:05:10.770> hard<00:05:11.010> because

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
Pakistan so they know it's hard because

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.600 
Pakistan so they know it's hard because
the<00:05:12.960> way<00:05:13.140> they<00:05:13.320> are<00:05:13.350> of<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.740> box<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.130> team<00:05:14.340> is

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
the way they are of the box and team is

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.700 
the way they are of the box and team is
not<00:05:15.150> some<00:05:15.360> home<00:05:15.539> obviously<00:05:15.810> they've<00:05:16.350> done

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
not some home obviously they've done

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.650 
not some home obviously they've done
some<00:05:17.010> good<00:05:17.160> things<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.610> come<00:05:17.640> here<00:05:18.000> every
