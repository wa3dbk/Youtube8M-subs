of<00:03:23.950> yourself<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.520> little<00:03:24.730> bit<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.060> really

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
of yourself a little bit so you really

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:40.570 
of yourself a little bit so you really
got<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.390> check<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:26.740> make<00:03:26.770> sure

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.060 

okay<00:03:41.240> we<00:03:41.570> get<00:03:41.750> into<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:41.960> last<00:03:42.320> little<00:03:42.830> bit

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
okay we get into the last little bit

00:03:43.070 --> 00:04:25.140 
okay we get into the last little bit
here

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.040 

again<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.900> last<00:04:26.290> loop<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.810> then<00:04:28.960> we're

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
again it's a last loop and then we're

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.240 
again it's a last loop and then we're
just<00:04:29.080> gonna<00:04:29.260> take<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.710> off<00:04:29.830> like<00:04:29.980> we<00:04:30.130> normally

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
just gonna take it off like we normally

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.750 
just gonna take it off like we normally
would<00:04:30.810> play<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.930> on<00:04:32.050> our<00:04:32.230> loop<00:04:32.470> it's<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> last

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
would play it on our loop it's the last

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.320 
would play it on our loop it's the last
loop<00:04:34.199> get<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.320> back<00:04:35.500> over<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.919> front<00:04:36.240> give<00:04:37.240> it

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
loop get the back over the front give it

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.969 
loop get the back over the front give it
a<00:04:37.360> little<00:04:37.510> tug<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:37.990> kind<00:04:38.169> of<00:04:38.199> bring<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.560> down

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
a little tug and kind of bring it down

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.370 
a little tug and kind of bring it down
through<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.460> project<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.810> it's<00:04:40.900> oh<00:04:41.080> now

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
through the project so it's oh now

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.090 
through the project so it's oh now
you're<00:04:41.500> still<00:04:41.680> gonna<00:04:41.770> have<00:04:41.949> your<00:04:42.070> own

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
you're still gonna have your own

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
you're still gonna have your own
attached<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.550> gonna<00:04:42.699> have<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:42.880> cut<00:04:43.030> yourself

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
attached is gonna have to cut yourself

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.180 
attached is gonna have to cut yourself
an<00:04:43.449> extra<00:04:43.660> but<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:44.620> gives<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:44.800> an<00:04:44.889> idea<00:04:44.919> that

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
an extra but that gives you an idea that

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.060 
an extra but that gives you an idea that
yeah<00:04:45.669> here<00:04:45.970> we<00:04:46.000> are<00:04:46.380> we've<00:04:47.380> got<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:48.990> five-foot

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
yeah here we are we've got a five-foot

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.879 
yeah here we are we've got a five-foot
mom<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:52.240> know<00:04:52.389> and<00:04:52.630> now<00:04:53.470> we're<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.740> gonna

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
mom you know and now we're just gonna

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.830 
mom you know and now we're just gonna
close<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.280> off<00:04:54.400> here<00:04:54.699> so<00:04:54.910> what<00:04:55.030> I<00:04:55.090> tend<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.660> do

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
close it off here so what I tend to do

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.050 
close it off here so what I tend to do
they<00:04:56.050> some<00:04:56.380> scissors<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:59.460> then<00:05:00.460> where<00:05:00.760> the

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
they some scissors and then where the

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.879 
they some scissors and then where the
tail<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:01.780> no<00:05:02.320> cut

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
tail is no cut

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.950 
tail is no cut
however<00:05:03.880> much<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.210> see<00:05:04.389> fit<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.750> use<00:05:04.870> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
however much you see fit I use the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.050 
however much you see fit I use the
weight<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.200> get<00:05:05.290> myself<00:05:05.500> more<00:05:05.770> than<00:05:05.830> a<00:05:06.220> little

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
weight to get myself more than a little

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.580 
weight to get myself more than a little
and<00:05:07.419> I<00:05:07.479> need<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.690> get<00:05:07.750> some<00:05:07.900> new<00:05:07.930> scissors<00:05:09.300> okay

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
and I need to get some new scissors okay

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.469 
and I need to get some new scissors okay
so<00:05:12.600> all<00:05:13.600> I<00:05:13.660> do<00:05:13.810> here<00:05:14.700> if<00:05:15.700> I'm<00:05:15.880> putting<00:05:16.270> that

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
so all I do here if I'm putting that

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.730 
so all I do here if I'm putting that
last<00:05:16.750> little<00:05:17.050> strands<00:05:17.470> through<00:05:18.210> oops<00:05:19.590> do<00:05:20.590> that

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
last little strands through oops do that

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.110 
last little strands through oops do that
last<00:05:20.979> loop<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.430> give<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:21.669> a<00:05:21.729> little<00:05:21.760> tug

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
last loop and I give it a little tug

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.270 
last loop and I give it a little tug
okay<00:05:23.020> lock<00:05:23.350> it<00:05:23.380> in<00:05:23.560> place<00:05:23.680> and<00:05:23.770> what<00:05:24.070> I<00:05:24.130> might

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
okay lock it in place and what I might

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.360 
okay lock it in place and what I might
do<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:24.610> going<00:05:24.760> on<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.150> side<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.860> go<00:05:27.010> into<00:05:27.190> a

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
do is going on to the side and go into a

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.690 
do is going on to the side and go into a
loop<00:05:27.639> next<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.680> grab<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:31.090> again<00:05:32.700> and

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
loop next to it and grab that again and

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.850 
loop next to it and grab that again and
grab<00:05:34.630> it<00:05:34.840> again<00:05:34.870> doing<00:05:35.380> a<00:05:35.470> little<00:05:35.710> loop

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
grab it again doing a little loop

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.770 
grab it again doing a little loop
through<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.220> just<00:05:36.430> so<00:05:37.060> since<00:05:37.330> kind<00:05:37.539> of<00:05:37.600> have<00:05:37.690> to

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
through it just so since kind of have to

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.490 
through it just so since kind of have to
secure<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:38.289> mom<00:05:38.500> so<00:05:38.860> cannot<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:41.050> then<00:05:41.169> I<00:05:41.260> put

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
secure it mom so cannot and then I put

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.730 
secure it mom so cannot and then I put
away<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.800> tools<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:44.050> you<00:05:44.110> just<00:05:44.380> would<00:05:44.500> check

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
away the tools and you just would check

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.839 
away the tools and you just would check
out<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:44.979> make<00:05:45.099> sure<00:05:45.130> it's<00:05:45.310> tight<00:05:45.460> enough<00:05:45.639> it<00:05:45.760> if

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
out it make sure it's tight enough it if

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.100 
out it make sure it's tight enough it if
you<00:05:45.940> really<00:05:46.240> want<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.419> be<00:05:46.479> secure<00:05:46.780> some<00:05:46.990> time

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
you really want to be secure some time

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.210 
you really want to be secure some time
what<00:05:47.260> I'd<00:05:47.349> like<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:47.590> do<00:05:47.770> is<00:05:47.860> I<00:05:47.919> just<00:05:48.070> like<00:05:48.160> to

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
what I'd like to do is I just like to

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.980 
what I'd like to do is I just like to
put<00:05:48.370> another<00:05:48.520> little<00:05:48.700> just<00:05:49.570> slipping<00:05:49.750> on<00:05:49.960> the

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
put another little just slipping on the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.779 
put another little just slipping on the
end<00:05:50.410> of<00:05:50.530> it<00:05:50.650> okay<00:05:53.039> and<00:05:54.039> then<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.310> will<00:05:54.430> just<00:05:54.580> trim

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
end of it okay and then I will just trim

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:03.159 
end of it okay and then I will just trim
it<00:05:54.820> again

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.100 

hmm<00:06:03.979> and<00:06:04.729> what<00:06:04.909> you<00:06:05.030> can<00:06:05.240> do<00:06:05.419> if<00:06:05.539> you<00:06:05.659> want<00:06:05.689> with

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.920 
hmm and what you can do if you want with
this<00:06:06.259> tail<00:06:07.389> burning<00:06:08.389> of<00:06:08.449> the<00:06:08.539> tails<00:06:08.780> because

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
this tail burning of the tails because

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.300 
this tail burning of the tails because
I've<00:06:09.080> got<00:06:09.229> a<00:06:09.259> bunch<00:06:09.469> that<00:06:09.680> I<00:06:09.710> threw<00:06:09.979> here<00:06:10.159> that

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
I've got a bunch that I threw here that

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.249 
I've got a bunch that I threw here that
I've<00:06:10.400> got<00:06:10.430> to<00:06:10.759> fix<00:06:11.449> and<00:06:11.689> little<00:06:11.900> strings<00:06:12.139> that

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
I've got to fix and little strings that

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:12.820 
I've got to fix and little strings that
are<00:06:12.379> hanging

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
are hanging

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.800 
are hanging
you<00:06:13.460> could<00:06:13.610> try<00:06:13.729> hiding<00:06:13.909> it<00:06:14.120> in<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.389> project

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
you could try hiding it in the project

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.749 
you could try hiding it in the project
we'll<00:06:14.900> just<00:06:15.050> simply<00:06:15.319> going<00:06:16.129> next<00:06:16.460> to<00:06:16.580> it<00:06:16.669> and

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759

me of a lot of didn't products I've done

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.110 
me of a lot of didn't products I've done
by<00:07:17.770> looking<00:07:18.009> at<00:07:18.099> the<00:07:18.220> colors<00:07:18.580> so<00:07:18.820> that's<00:07:18.970> why<00:07:19.090> I

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 
by looking at the colors so that's why I

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.700 
by looking at the colors so that's why I
wanted<00:07:19.330> to<00:07:19.419> something<00:07:19.570> like<00:07:19.690> this<00:07:19.840> it<00:07:20.050> may<00:07:20.530> not

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
wanted to something like this it may not

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.950 
wanted to something like this it may not
be<00:07:21.039> totally<00:07:21.880> pretty<00:07:22.240> to<00:07:22.449> have<00:07:22.539> put<00:07:22.720> his<00:07:22.840> eyes

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
be totally pretty to have put his eyes

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.710 
be totally pretty to have put his eyes
but<00:07:23.860> it's<00:07:23.979> just<00:07:24.039> more<00:07:24.310> of<00:07:24.340> a<00:07:24.460> fun<00:07:25.389> little<00:07:25.419> like

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720

throwing<00:07:26.050> something<00:07:26.320> together<00:07:26.530> and<00:07:26.949> now<00:07:27.250> I

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
throwing something together and now I

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.520 
throwing something together and now I
just<00:07:28.509> thought<00:07:28.810> it<00:07:28.870> was<00:07:28.960> kind<00:07:29.139> of<00:07:29.169> a<00:07:29.259> cool<00:07:29.380> idea

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.530 
just thought it was kind of a cool idea

just<00:07:29.889> do<00:07:30.069> it<00:07:30.159> with<00:07:30.250> the<00:07:30.340> scrap<00:07:30.610> so<00:07:30.909> this<00:07:31.030> is

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
just do it with the scrap so this is

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.300 
just do it with the scrap so this is
what<00:07:31.300> it<00:07:31.360> is<00:07:31.509> and<00:07:31.810> that<00:07:32.470> is<00:07:32.620> how<00:07:32.740> you<00:07:32.800> cast<00:07:33.099> off

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.310 
what it is and that is how you cast off

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.730 
what it is and that is how you cast off
the<00:07:33.759> da<00:07:33.909> infinity<00:07:34.300> Zulu<00:07:34.720> if<00:07:35.289> you've<00:07:35.470> tie<00:07:35.680> it

the da infinity Zulu if you've tie it

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.810 
the da infinity Zulu if you've tie it
off<00:07:35.889> in<00:07:36.009> the<00:07:36.099> end<00:07:36.130> you<00:07:36.400> want<00:07:36.460> to<00:07:36.550> go<00:07:36.639> back
