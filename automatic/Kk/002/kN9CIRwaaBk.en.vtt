weighing in at 4.5 kilos it's a good
thing<00:04:35.640> if<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:35.940> start<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.300> project<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:37.080> always

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
thing if you start a project you always

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.010 
thing if you start a project you always
have<00:04:37.590> benchmark<00:04:38.250> products<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:39.420> always<00:04:39.690> can

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
have benchmark products you always can

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.370 
have benchmark products you always can
analysis<00:04:40.800> their<00:04:41.900> duty<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.050> weak<00:04:43.200> points

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
analysis their duty and weak points

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.520 
analysis their duty and weak points
every<00:04:43.740> product<00:04:43.920> has<00:04:44.100> some<00:04:44.310> weak<00:04:44.490> points<00:04:44.520> and

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
every product has some weak points and

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.830 
every product has some weak points and
if<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.740> are<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.310> later<00:04:47.520> one<00:04:47.790> you<00:04:48.480> have<00:04:48.600> still

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
if you are the later one you have still

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.930 
if you are the later one you have still
the<00:04:48.870> opportunity<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.680> work<00:04:49.830> on<00:04:50.040> this<00:04:50.220> kind<00:04:50.820> of

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
the opportunity to work on this kind of

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.230 
the opportunity to work on this kind of
small<00:04:51.630> trouble<00:04:52.560> stones<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.880> have<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.060> try

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
small trouble stones and you have to try

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.500 
small trouble stones and you have to try
to<00:04:54.300> make<00:04:55.260> your<00:04:55.440> product<00:04:55.830> slightly<00:04:56.160> better<00:04:56.510> it

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
to make your product slightly better it

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.420 
to make your product slightly better it
will<00:04:57.630> happen<00:04:57.930> again<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.169> one<00:04:59.130> year<00:04:59.310> late

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
will happen again that one year late

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.700 
will happen again that one year late
another<00:04:59.700> company<00:05:00.150> will<00:05:00.780> take<00:05:00.930> our<00:05:01.169> product<00:05:01.590> as

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
another company will take our product as

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.610 
another company will take our product as
benchmark<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:03.000> working<00:05:03.300> on<00:05:03.500> it's<00:05:04.500> a

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
benchmark and is working on it's a

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.680 
benchmark and is working on it's a
neverending<00:05:04.860> story<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:05.820> for<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.090> lighted<00:05:06.450> frame

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
neverending story so for a lighted frame

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.170 
neverending story so for a lighted frame
I<00:05:06.900> would<00:05:07.740> say<00:05:08.010> Skulltula<00:05:08.580> will<00:05:08.730> be<00:05:08.850> the

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
I would say Skulltula will be the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.960 
I would say Skulltula will be the
current<00:05:09.419> benchmark<00:05:09.990> but<00:05:10.830> it's<00:05:11.430> still<00:05:11.730> a

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
current benchmark but it's still a

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.280 
current benchmark but it's still a
noticeable<00:05:12.780> get<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.830> an<00:05:13.980> unreal<00:05:14.460> error<00:05:14.730> frame

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
noticeable get to an unreal error frame

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.560 
noticeable get to an unreal error frame
therefore<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.410> racers<00:05:16.740> have<00:05:16.980> to<00:05:17.160> decide

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
therefore the racers have to decide

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.620 
therefore the racers have to decide
what's<00:05:18.570> important<00:05:19.080> for<00:05:19.169> them

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
what's important for them

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.690 
what's important for them
