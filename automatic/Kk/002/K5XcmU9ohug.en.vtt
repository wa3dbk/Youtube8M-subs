00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
this but if one rope with a knot one

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.880 
this but if one rope with a knot one
root<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.580> no<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.300> like<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.720> now<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.619> want

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
root with no not just like so now I want

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.410 
root with no not just like so now I want
you<00:00:19.980> guys<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> pay<00:00:20.369> attention<00:00:20.400> real<00:00:21.029> closely

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
little width like so and the knots

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.929 
little width like so and the knots
actually<00:00:27.720> transfer<00:00:28.230> from<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.800> hand<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
actually transfer from one hand to the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.830 
just like that okay let me show you guys
exactly<00:00:34.230> how<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.219> was<00:00:35.520> done<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:36.510> done

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
exactly how this was done it's done

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.220 
exactly how this was done it's done
using<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.940> one-handed<00:00:38.940> knot<00:00:39.149> technique<00:00:39.450> where

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
using a one-handed knot technique where

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.720 
using a one-handed knot technique where
you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.469> sit<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.860> tie<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> knot<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.520> one

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
you can sit here and tie a knot with one

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.660 
you can sit here and tie a knot with one
hand<00:00:42.829> most<00:00:43.829> people<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.309> are<00:00:44.370> gonna<00:00:44.520> stay

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
hand most people that are gonna stay

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250 
hand most people that are gonna stay
here<00:00:44.700> trying<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> tie<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> knot<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:45.960> hand

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
here trying to tie a knot with one hand

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.010 
here trying to tie a knot with one hand
or<00:00:47.010> gonna<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.820> sit<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.510> struggle<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
or gonna have to sit here and struggle a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
or gonna have to sit here and struggle a
little<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.730> where<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:50.969> need<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
little bit to get to where they need it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.290 
little bit to get to where they need it
to<00:00:51.360> go<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.370> mean<00:00:53.370> without<00:00:53.489> using<00:00:53.910> two<00:00:54.030> hands

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
to go I mean without using two hands

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.069 
to go I mean without using two hands
it's<00:00:54.660> difficult<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.289> mean<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> can't<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.800> done

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
it's difficult I mean it can't be done

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.720 
it's difficult I mean it can't be done
but<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.199> takes<00:00:58.379> time<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.949> mean<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.489> take

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
but it takes time I mean it's gonna take

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.830 
but it takes time I mean it's gonna take
you<00:01:00.350> roughly<00:01:01.430> 15<00:01:02.430> maybe<00:01:02.820> 20<00:01:02.910> seconds<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
you roughly 15 maybe 20 seconds to do it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
you roughly 15 maybe 20 seconds to do it
and<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.260> can't<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> can't<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:05.010> done<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and you can't it can't be done as you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
and you can't it can't be done as you
see<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> did<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.619> split<00:01:08.040> second

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
see I did it with just a split second

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
see I did it with just a split second
precision<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.360> I'll<00:01:09.450> show<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.689> exactly<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
precision and I'll show you exactly it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.080 
precision and I'll show you exactly it
show<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> guys<00:01:10.860> exactly<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:11.820> here

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
show you guys exactly what I did here

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.600 
show you guys exactly what I did here
okay<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> guys<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.740> something<00:01:14.130> about

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
okay now you guys get something about

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.789 
okay now you guys get something about
the<00:01:14.880> size<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> shoelace<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:16.500> he<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.710> get

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the size of a shoelace or he can get

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.280 
the size of a shoelace or he can get
something<00:01:17.100> bigger<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.580> depends<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.990> how<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
something bigger it depends but how this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
something bigger it depends but how this
is<00:01:19.350> done<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:20.130> you're<00:01:20.670> gonna<00:01:20.820> take<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
is done is you're gonna take it you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.910 
is done is you're gonna take it you
don't<00:01:21.570> want<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> rope<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.200> too<00:01:22.409> terribly

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
don't want the rope to be too terribly

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.530 
don't want the rope to be too terribly
long<00:01:23.009> otherwise<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> gonna

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
long otherwise when you do this gonna

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.469 
long otherwise when you do this gonna
create<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.650> slip<00:01:26.070> knot<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.640> mean<00:01:27.390> if

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
create up they slip knot I mean if

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.789 
create up they slip knot I mean if
that's<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.810> you're<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.560> fine

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that's what you're going for that's fine

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.260 
that's what you're going for that's fine
but<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.579> looks<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.850> better<00:01:30.090> for

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
but I think it looks more better for

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.480 
but I think it looks more better for
your<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> regular<00:01:31.200> knot<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
your time just a regular knot with it so

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
your time just a regular knot with it so
here<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.810> you're<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here we go so what you're going to do is

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.539 
here we go so what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> place<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.890> rope<00:01:35.340> in
