my<00:05:25.800> mind<00:05:26.009> went<00:05:26.130> there<00:05:26.340> right<00:05:26.520> away<00:05:26.639> and<00:05:26.970> it's

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
my mind went there right away and it's

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.400 
my mind went there right away and it's
just<00:05:27.240> like<00:05:27.330> everything<00:05:27.720> sort<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.169> kind<00:05:28.350> of

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
just like everything sort of kind of

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.550 
just like everything sort of kind of
calmed<00:05:28.710> down<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.780> kind<00:05:30.780> of<00:05:30.810> felt<00:05:31.050> okay<00:05:31.350> with

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
calmed down and I kind of felt okay with

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.820 
calmed down and I kind of felt okay with
what<00:05:31.710> I<00:05:31.740> would<00:05:31.830> happen

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.710 

it<00:05:35.610> just<00:05:35.790> kind<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.120> makes<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.390> realize<00:05:36.690> like

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
it just kind of makes you realize like

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.540 
it just kind of makes you realize like
there<00:05:37.080> isn't<00:05:37.200> any<00:05:37.440> reason<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.830> hold<00:05:38.010> back<00:05:38.100> and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
there isn't any reason to hold back and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.610 
there isn't any reason to hold back and
sometimes<00:05:39.540> you<00:05:39.630> don't<00:05:39.720> necessarily<00:05:40.350> want<00:05:40.530> to

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
sometimes you don't necessarily want to

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.500 
sometimes you don't necessarily want to
show<00:05:41.220> exactly<00:05:41.370> what<00:05:41.880> you're<00:05:42.000> feeling<00:05:42.030> in<00:05:42.480> that

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
show exactly what you're feeling in that

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.750 
show exactly what you're feeling in that
moment<00:05:42.810> but<00:05:43.260> ultimately<00:05:44.190> I<00:05:44.280> think<00:05:44.340> it's<00:05:44.670> the

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
moment but ultimately I think it's the

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.670 
moment but ultimately I think it's the
best<00:05:45.060> way<00:05:45.300> of<00:05:45.330> getting<00:05:45.870> those<00:05:46.110> feelings<00:05:46.440> out

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
best way of getting those feelings out

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:55.250 
best way of getting those feelings out
is<00:05:47.180> dancing
