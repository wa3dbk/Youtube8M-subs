00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
well first he said I want mommy but I

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.980 
well first he said I want mommy but I
was<00:02:05.890> there<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.400> stepped<00:02:06.820> up<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:07.840> he

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
was there so I stepped up and then he

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.949 
was there so I stepped up and then he
said<00:02:08.320> he<00:02:08.950> wanted<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.280> see<00:02:09.519> his<00:02:09.670> hands<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.929> I

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
said he wanted to see his hands so I

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.330 
said he wanted to see his hands so I
took<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.290> picture<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.650> them<00:02:11.860> because<00:02:12.070> he<00:02:12.130> really

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
took a picture of them because he really

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.979 
took a picture of them because he really
couldn't<00:02:12.519> look<00:02:12.700> down<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.120> see<00:02:13.269> them<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.540> I

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
couldn't look down and see them and I

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.380 
couldn't look down and see them and I
showed<00:02:14.230> them
