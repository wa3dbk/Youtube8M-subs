00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.500 

so<00:00:04.410> answer<00:00:04.650> you've<00:00:04.950> chosen<00:00:05.250> two<00:00:05.640> paintings<00:00:06.300> by

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.510 
so answer you've chosen two paintings by

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.540 
so answer you've chosen two paintings by
Vermeer<00:00:07.140> which<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.620> way<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.920> contrasting

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
Vermeer which in a way of contrasting

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.700 
Vermeer which in a way of contrasting
images<00:00:08.700> what<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:09.780> these<00:00:10.200> two<00:00:10.500> that

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
images what is it about these two that

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.990 
images what is it about these two that
made<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.370> choose<00:00:11.610> them

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
made you choose them

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000 
made you choose them
I<00:00:12.030> think<00:00:13.580> they<00:00:14.660> hang<00:00:15.660> together<00:00:16.260> like<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.950> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
I think they hang together like this and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.420 
I think they hang together like this and
it's<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:18.380> a<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.160> they<00:00:20.250> hang

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
it's really a one that they hang

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.300 
it's really a one that they hang
together<00:00:20.550> because<00:00:21.000> they<00:00:21.150> say<00:00:21.920> they<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.010> fine

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
together because they say they are fine

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.750 
together because they say they are fine
together<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.310> inter

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
together so this is the inter

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
together so this is the inter
introspection<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.840> want<00:00:28.050> introspection

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
introspection if you want introspection

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.490 
introspection if you want introspection
this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.259> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
this is I was going out in the in the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.990 
this is I was going out in the in the
firmament<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.490> nice<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.730> know

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
firmament because it's nice to know

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.750 
firmament because it's nice to know
curry<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.690> sitting<00:00:34.140> here<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.590> any<00:00:35.430> look<00:00:35.579> on

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
curry is sitting here and any look on

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.520 
curry is sitting here and any look on
the<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> globe<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:39.320> it's<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the on the globe so it's it's not a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
the on the globe so it's it's not a
contradiction<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.030> say

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
contradiction but but it's you can say

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.619 
contradiction but but it's you can say
it's<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.469> micro<00:00:47.129> cosmos<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.329> he's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it's the the micro cosmos and he's

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.650 
it's the the micro cosmos and he's
sawing<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.280> he<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.239> looking<00:00:51.420> out

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
sawing like this and he is looking out

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.349 
sawing like this and he is looking out
in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> world<00:00:52.230> he<00:00:52.559> he<00:00:53.219> thinks<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:53.820> theories

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
in the world he he thinks about theories

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.170 
in the world he he thinks about theories
about<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> cosmos<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.699> he's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
about the cosmos and and so he's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.700 
about the cosmos and and so he's
directed<00:00:57.570> by<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> microcosm<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.530> she's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
directed by the microcosm and she's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.369 
directed by the microcosm and she's
directly<00:00:59.129> pass<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> Michael<00:00:59.640> Kors<00:00:59.760> if<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> want

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
directly pass a Michael Kors if you want

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.240 
directly pass a Michael Kors if you want
but<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.760> did<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:03.210> choose<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.899> Vermeer<00:01:04.710> only<00:01:05.070> for

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
but I did not choose a Vermeer only for

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.150 
but I did not choose a Vermeer only for
the<00:01:05.370> content<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.660> chose<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.050> for<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> for

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
the content but I chose it for the for

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.490 
the content but I chose it for the for
the<00:01:08.340> way<00:01:08.610> he<00:01:09.060> painted<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.440> he<00:01:10.670> painted

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
the way he painted you know he painted

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.330 
the way he painted you know he painted
in<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.910> painting<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.510> composed<00:01:16.020> from<00:01:16.890> little

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
in the painting is composed from little

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.970 
in the painting is composed from little
atoms<00:01:17.760> it's<00:01:18.510> like<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.230> like<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.710> the

the a tone physic he has a kind of
technique<00:01:26.000> who<00:01:27.000> who<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.870> call<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.440> perhaps

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
technique who who can call it perhaps

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.030 
technique who who can call it perhaps
atomism<00:01:29.160> atomism<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.620> nature

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
atomism atomism because it's like nature

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.640 
atomism atomism because it's like nature
is<00:01:32.100> constructed<00:01:32.730> with<00:01:32.940> atoms<00:01:33.690> molecules<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
is constructed with atoms molecules and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.190 
is constructed with atoms molecules and
little<00:01:35.040> entities<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.790> paintings<00:01:36.630> opened<00:01:37.110> up

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
little entities and paintings opened up

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840 
little entities and paintings opened up
to<00:01:37.380> another<00:01:37.560> world<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.520> show

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
to another world because they show

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.690 
to another world because they show
something<00:01:39.240> behind<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:40.590> nature<00:01:41.160> behind<00:01:41.370> the

something behind the nature behind the

reality like this soil is been Mia he
shows<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.790> certain<00:01:45.390> construction<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.530> the

shows a certain construction of the

microbiological way and that it's clear

microbiological way and that it's clear
because<00:01:58.830> when<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.550> do<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> painting<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
because when you do a painting when you

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.920 
because when you do a painting when you
do<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.690> picture<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:02.220> interpret<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.030> world<00:02:03.210> or

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
do a picture you interpret the world or

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.450 
do a picture you interpret the world or
you<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.410> something<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:04.980> other<00:02:05.130> people

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you see something what other people

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.240 
you see something what other people
didn't<00:02:05.760> see<00:02:05.940> if<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.810> wouldn't<00:02:07.380> paint<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:07.980> I

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
didn't see if I I wouldn't paint if I

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.130 
didn't see if I I wouldn't paint if I
wouldn't<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.670> something<00:02:09.030> different<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
wouldn't see something different you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.970 
wouldn't see something different you
know<00:02:10.680> I<00:02:10.710> was<00:02:11.400> looking<00:02:11.610> forward

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
know I was looking forward

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.259 
know I was looking forward
for<00:02:13.550> later<00:02:13.790> run<00:02:14.150> front<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:15.560> know<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.489> he

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
for later run front you know that the he

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.330 
for later run front you know that the he
made<00:02:17.480> when<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.840> made<00:02:18.110> his<00:02:18.290> portraits<00:02:19.160> in<00:02:19.280> he

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
made when it made his portraits in he

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.670 
made when it made his portraits in he
was<00:02:19.489> really<00:02:20.000> old<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.510> his<00:02:21.290> eyes<00:02:21.760> like<00:02:22.760> holes
