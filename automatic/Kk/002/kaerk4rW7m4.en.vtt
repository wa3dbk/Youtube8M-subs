 Processing techniques make it possible 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760

 long-lasting 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.860

 to the oberbergischen on 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.370

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.300
 In principle, domestic rocks

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.590
 look whole 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.150
 so this garden was away from 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.340
 landscape gardener with granite plaster 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.130
 and basalt plates worked 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.090
 In addition, wood is a successful 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.400
 combination
