00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.320
 Yes. Hello. It's a blessing. 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:12.160
 This video will provide you with feedback when you need further clarification on the winning 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.700
 I made a video about him because he was. 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:22.680
 Before you start explaining 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:25.439
 Shooting will the US says it may be difficult for those who've Starter 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.599
 Now what would that tell figurine to sleep 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.870
 Uh, it's easy to tell . 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.620
 It's a little difficult to express in a dictionary . 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.199
 When the incident of a certain plane wave comes in, the normal grain of the plane 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.610
 The angle formed by the direction of the incident wave 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:47.640
 And the ship leaves the boundary to reach the 10,001 things up tanks and bounds 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.879
 It's the angle with the law on the interface. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.070
 It's difficult. Just simple. 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.070
 No, you can look at the top of the tank. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.820
 The video 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.910
 I'll proceed to the screen. 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.970
 In society 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.970
 Ah 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.140
 Bo geteupnida was properly excited matchwot experienced research resources, absolute freedom when naohne 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.820
 character 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.820
 It's about 200 million . 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.899
 Huh Come to ride comfortably 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.159
 Only the joint gets 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.100
 I'll look over it. 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.560
 When you look above, 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.640
 Now the angle of the car and tan 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.080
 Thanirai 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.240
 It's taken a little of each tea 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.690
 And 5 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.270
 Now, when I saw in the plain 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.270
 Eoheuk the John Wait a little longer, why, because the forest 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.380
 Can I fell on top Holds 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.920
 It's like this. 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.680
 You do not know what's going on when you say something. 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:39.000
 The gritty uh tteon said the second would explain who is now the front part of the train 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.830
 You see gloves. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.830
 Look at the mouse cursor . There's a slope on the front panel and car arms. 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:59.630
 So as you see the wave's doejyo is the slope of plywood 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:04.130
 However, now that I explain this merely about the slope, 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:09.230
 It's made for your own teatime shop. 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.850
 But this is the least I can do to induce a tee-time angle to shoot a shot. 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.850
 Did you get a sense of this one 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:25.560
 Considering the language you want to use Leafie-Ipssak is somehow my opponents train and tram 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:28.859
 Now you need to understand what the glove count is for. 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.340
 Not only that, but my 4th Penetration 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:36.510
 You have to consider the opponent's shot penetration . 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:41.189
 I mean look at the game now suffered four months that I am looking up under 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.099
 Looking down from above the situation and shooting down from top to bottom 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:49.519
 I need some experience to do it. 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.519
 In a nutshell, you need both knowledge and experience. 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:59.860
 Let me summarize what this video I want to explain. 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.450
 Despite the explanation of the figurative evil, I hope it will be 1.4 billion , 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.700
 It is a crunching angle 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.910
 But the body is being held there towards reducing its own tea-time d 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:15.730
 You can induce and fire. 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:18.299
 However, knowledge and experience are necessary enough to take the shot into consideration . 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.299
 That would be enough. 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:30.460
 Ah, therefore, this shot is a long shot, 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.050
 It's hard, but I'm a little used to Walton now. 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.300
 I took off my novice tee . 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:42.100
 But now I know something a little more. 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.960
 If you are going to go over to heavy water , 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.889
 I made it. 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.270
 5 There are video constraints on feedback, but I do not know about these 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.860
 I wonder if there are 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.460
 If you were to produce a dog video and this video was a great help to you 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.930
 It is. 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:02.800
 Ah 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:05.980
 Relaxation This limitation on the angle of incidence is that the description of knowledge 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:12.160
 I'll finish it. Thank you for watching. 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:13.249
 4 Let's look at the following in good shape 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.799
 4 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.799
 Thanks and blessings from the body. See you next time.
