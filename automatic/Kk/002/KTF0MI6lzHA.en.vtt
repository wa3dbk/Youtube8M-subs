00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
showing and we'll start with the base

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.510 
showing and we'll start with the base
here's<00:01:34.479> what<00:01:34.659> it<00:01:34.719> looks<00:01:34.869> like<00:01:35.079> and<00:01:35.520> basically

here's what it looks like and basically
you<00:01:36.850> can<00:01:36.969> turn<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.299> full<00:01:37.509> 360<00:01:37.929> degrees<00:01:38.229> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you can turn it a full 360 degrees and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.679 
you can turn it a full 360 degrees and
you<00:01:39.729> can't<00:01:39.909> really<00:01:40.029> tell<00:01:40.179> which<00:01:40.299> side<00:01:40.569> is<00:01:40.659> the

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
you can't really tell which side is the

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:41.910 
you can't really tell which side is the
front<00:01:40.779> or<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.109> back<00:01:41.139> because<00:01:41.469> it's<00:01:41.619> built<00:01:41.799> the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
front or the back because it's built the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.010 
front or the back because it's built the
same<00:01:42.100> way<00:01:42.249> all<00:01:42.399> around<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.909> as<00:01:43.719> you<00:01:43.810> can<00:01:43.899> see

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
same way all around and as you can see

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.760 
same way all around and as you can see
they<00:01:44.139> use<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.289> clicky

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
they use a clicky

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.339 
they use a clicky
turntable<00:01:45.340> which<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.639> a<00:01:45.670> good<00:01:45.880> thing<00:01:46.060> because

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.349 
turntable which is a good thing because

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.899 
turntable which is a good thing because
if<00:01:47.349> you<00:01:47.529> ever<00:01:47.770> play<00:01:48.009> with<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.219> old<00:01:48.340> one<00:01:48.520> these

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
if you ever play with the old one these

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.429 
if you ever play with the old one these
used<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.179> swing<00:01:49.420> around<00:01:49.509> like<00:01:49.749> crazy<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.289> this

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
used to swing around like crazy so this

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.230 
used to swing around like crazy so this
is<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> lot<00:01:50.770> better<00:01:50.920> much<00:01:51.579> more<00:01:51.789> fun<00:01:51.999> than<00:01:52.029> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
is a lot better much more fun than the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.459 
is a lot better much more fun than the
old<00:01:52.359> one<00:01:52.539> and<00:01:52.799> here's<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.859> view<00:01:54.039> of<00:01:54.249> the<00:01:54.490> side

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
old one and here's a view of the side

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.739 
old one and here's a view of the side
there's<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.590> back<00:01:57.179> here's<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.299> other<00:01:58.419> side

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
there's the back here's the other side

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.330 
there's the back here's the other side
and<00:01:59.109> this<00:01:59.590> crane<00:01:59.889> has<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.069> lot<00:02:00.219> of

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
and this crane has a lot of

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.769 
and this crane has a lot of
functionality<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.329> bring<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.630> all<00:02:01.749> the

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779 
functionality you can bring it all the

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.199 
functionality you can bring it all the
way<00:02:01.990> up<00:02:02.139> like<00:02:02.169> this<00:02:02.499> and<00:02:03.459> you<00:02:03.609> bring<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.880> as<00:02:03.999> far

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
way up like this and you bring it as far

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.529 
way up like this and you bring it as far
down<00:02:04.240> like<00:02:05.169> that<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.819> makes<00:02:06.999> the<00:02:07.149> scooping

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
down like that and it makes the scooping

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.150 
down like that and it makes the scooping
rocks<00:02:07.779> pretty<00:02:08.110> easy<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.679> then<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.979> just

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
rocks pretty easy and then you just

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.280 
rocks pretty easy and then you just
bring<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.879> this<00:02:10.000> way<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.390> then<00:02:10.509> empty<00:02:11.079> it<00:02:11.110> all

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
bring it this way and then empty it all

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.970 
bring it this way and then empty it all
out<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:12.189> can<00:02:12.340> turn<00:02:12.549> like<00:02:12.819> this

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
out and this can turn like this

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.970 
out and this can turn like this
next<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.150> put<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.420> our<00:02:15.660> minor<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.800> take

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
next we can put in our minor you take

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.860 
next we can put in our minor you take
off<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.280> roof<00:02:17.520> piece<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.480> take<00:02:18.660> off<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
off this roof piece and you take off the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.270 
off this roof piece and you take off the
windshield<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.500> way<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> little<00:02:20.040> easier

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
windshield this way it's a little easier

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.430 
windshield this way it's a little easier
I'm<00:02:21.209> gonna<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.480> slide<00:02:21.750> them<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.989> there

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.770 

pretty<00:02:25.440> easy<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:25.920> far

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
pretty easy so far

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
pretty easy so far
and<00:02:27.780> then<00:02:28.230> ideally<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.459> just<00:02:29.730> scoop<00:02:30.090> up

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
and then ideally you can just scoop up

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.840 
and then ideally you can just scoop up
these<00:02:30.360> two<00:02:30.569> rocks<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.520> they<00:02:32.520> do<00:02:32.640> fit

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
these two rocks here and they do fit

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.660 
these two rocks here and they do fit
dump<00:02:33.030> here<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.520> then<00:02:35.520> if

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
dump here just like that and then if

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.280 
dump here just like that and then if
you're<00:02:35.790> go<00:02:35.910> scooping<00:02:36.300> them<00:02:36.420> all<00:02:36.540> around<00:02:36.630> you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you're go scooping them all around you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.690 
you're go scooping them all around you
just<00:02:37.440> drop<00:02:37.650> them<00:02:37.800> off<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.280> swap<00:02:38.550> the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
just drop them off and you swap the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.370 
just drop them off and you swap the
bucket<00:02:39.060> for<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.630> drill<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.110> see<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.319> the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
bucket for the drill that you see on the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.590 
bucket for the drill that you see on the
trailer<00:02:40.620> there<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.730> let's<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:41.940> do<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.330> real

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
trailer there so let's just do that real

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.660 
trailer there so let's just do that real
quick<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:44.130> other<00:02:44.250> thing<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.430> don't<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.580> about

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
quick the other thing I don't like about

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.009 
quick the other thing I don't like about
this<00:02:44.940> drill<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.569> they<00:02:45.750> could<00:02:45.930> have

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
this drill is that they could have

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.270 
this drill is that they could have
designed<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.560> such<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.739> way<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.920> they<00:02:47.160> can

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
designed it in such a way that they can

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.770 
designed it in such a way that they can
put<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> cone<00:02:47.700> piece<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> front<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.600> way

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
put a cone piece in the front this way

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.870 
put a cone piece in the front this way
it<00:02:48.840> looks<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.050> little<00:02:49.110> sharper<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:50.550> one<00:02:50.730> looks

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
it looks a little sharper this one looks

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.460 
it looks a little sharper this one looks
like<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.180> hits<00:02:51.480> something<00:02:51.750> really<00:02:51.930> hard<00:02:52.140> and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
like it hits something really hard and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.650 
like it hits something really hard and
then<00:02:52.590> they're<00:02:52.980> stuck<00:02:53.160> with<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:54.330> then<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
then they're stuck with it and then you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.390 
then they're stuck with it and then you
drill<00:02:54.840> these<00:02:54.930> rocks<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.319> new<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.980> you'll

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
drill these rocks a new one and you'll

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.580 
drill these rocks a new one and you'll
find<00:02:56.730> yourself<00:02:56.850> four<00:02:57.600> golden<00:02:58.080> nuggets<00:02:58.380> in

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
find yourself four golden nuggets in

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.000 
find yourself four golden nuggets in
each<00:02:58.799> one<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.750> now<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.049> move<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
each one and now we can move on to the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.180 
each one and now we can move on to the
truck<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:05.720> here's<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.900> truck<00:03:07.140> after<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> while

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
truck and here's the truck after a while

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.039 
truck and here's the truck after a while
when<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.580> collect<00:03:08.819> enough<00:03:08.910> Lego<00:03:09.390> you'll<00:03:09.810> find

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
when you collect enough Lego you'll find

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.150 
when you collect enough Lego you'll find
that<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.200> lot<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.500> trailer<00:03:10.709> trucks<00:03:10.980> are

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
that a lot the trailer trucks are

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.550 
that a lot the trailer trucks are
designed<00:03:11.489> in<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.700> very<00:03:12.000> similar<00:03:12.360> fashion

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
designed in a very similar fashion

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.780 
designed in a very similar fashion
you'll<00:03:13.560> usually<00:03:13.769> see<00:03:13.950> these<00:03:14.220> type<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.549> parts

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
you'll usually see these type of parts

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.490 
you'll usually see these type of parts
in<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.940> front<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.360> usually<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.410> are

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
in the front there usually there are

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.020 
in the front there usually there are
just<00:03:16.680> some<00:03:16.890> very<00:03:16.920> minor<00:03:17.340> details<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.819> make

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
just some very minor details that make

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.580 
just some very minor details that make
it<00:03:18.060> different<00:03:18.630> from<00:03:18.690> all<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.959> others<00:03:19.170> besides

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
it different from all the others besides

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.349 
it different from all the others besides
the<00:03:19.709> color<00:03:19.890> anyway<00:03:20.850> here's<00:03:21.000> what<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.209> looks

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
the color anyway here's what it looks

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.180 
the color anyway here's what it looks
like<00:03:21.420> all<00:03:21.600> around<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.859> could<00:03:23.010> tell<00:03:23.100> you

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
like all around and I could tell you

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.830 
like all around and I could tell you
that<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.459> truck<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:23.970> little<00:03:24.120> bit<00:03:24.480> special

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
that this truck is a little bit special

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.090 
that this truck is a little bit special
than<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.049> others<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.709> reason<00:03:25.920> why<00:03:26.040> is

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
than the others and the reason why is

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.770 
than the others and the reason why is
because<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.700> fit<00:03:26.910> two<00:03:26.940> minifigures<00:03:27.510> up

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
because you can fit two minifigures up

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.750 
because you can fit two minifigures up
in<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.959> cabin<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:29.160> way<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.310> do<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.579> is

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
in the cabin and the way you do that is

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640 
in the cabin and the way you do that is
you<00:03:29.910> can<00:03:29.970> take<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:30.329> off<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.840> I'll<00:03:31.350> take<00:03:31.560> off

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
you can take this off and I'll take off

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.050 
you can take this off and I'll take off
the<00:03:31.739> windshield<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:32.579> can<00:03:32.730> see<00:03:33.030> a

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
the windshield to this we can see a

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.750 
the windshield to this we can see a
little<00:03:33.209> easier<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:35.250> way<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.400> do<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.670> is

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
little easier and the way you do it is

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.190 
little easier and the way you do it is
you<00:03:35.790> take<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.269> one<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.510> these<00:03:36.660> red<00:03:36.900> parts

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
gonna make him feel a little bit tense

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.110 
gonna make him feel a little bit tense
while<00:04:13.620> he's<00:04:13.769> driving<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.880> know<00:04:14.970> what<00:04:15.060> they

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
while he's driving so you know what they

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.659 
while he's driving so you know what they
want<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.329> do<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.590> but<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.950> should<00:04:17.160> work<00:04:17.310> and

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
want to do that but this should work and

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.940 
want to do that but this should work and
you<00:04:18.389> can<00:04:18.510> close<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.930> up<00:04:19.019> it's<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.859> little

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
you can close it up it's a little

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.700 
you can close it up it's a little
cramped<00:04:20.370> but<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.720> works<00:04:21.930> out<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.260> see<00:04:22.530> and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
cramped but it works out you see and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.020 
cramped but it works out you see and
that's<00:04:23.010> something<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.520> can't<00:04:23.700> really<00:04:23.820> do<00:04:23.909> it

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
that's something you can't really do it

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.640 
that's something you can't really do it
in<00:04:24.090> yellow<00:04:24.210> trucks<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.960> get<00:04:25.349> in<00:04:25.560> the

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
in yellow trucks that you get in the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.120 
in yellow trucks that you get in the
other<00:04:25.770> city<00:04:26.010> sets

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
other city sets

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.710 
other city sets
so<00:04:27.340> that's<00:04:27.820> what's<00:04:27.970> pretty<00:04:28.120> cool<00:04:28.270> about<00:04:28.480> it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
so that's what's pretty cool about it

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.480 
so that's what's pretty cool about it
now<00:04:29.380> we<00:04:29.440> can<00:04:29.590> take<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> look<00:04:29.950> at<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.130> trailer

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.550

here's the trailer and for most partner

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
is really not much to it because it's a

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.110 
is really not much to it because it's a
very<00:04:37.000> simple<00:04:37.480> part<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.870> whole<00:04:38.110> truck<00:04:38.530> and

very simple part of the whole truck and

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.340 
very simple part of the whole truck and
here's<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.240> view<00:04:40.360> at<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.480> bottom<00:04:40.750> this<00:04:41.290> is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
here's the view at the bottom this is

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.560 
here's the view at the bottom this is

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
pickaxe and the thing about the drill

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.620 
pickaxe and the thing about the drill
here<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:51.640> notice<00:04:51.760> that<00:04:51.910> they<00:04:52.150> have<00:04:52.480> this

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
here you notice that they have this

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.800 
here you notice that they have this
stuck<00:04:53.350> on<00:04:53.470> there<00:04:53.650> really<00:04:53.800> securely<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.910> when

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
stuck on there really securely so when

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.420 
stuck on there really securely so when
you<00:04:55.900> try<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.080> pick<00:04:56.230> this<00:04:56.320> off<00:04:56.560> if<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.190> pull<00:04:57.400> it

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
you try to pick this off if you pull it

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.070 
you try to pick this off if you pull it
upwards<00:04:57.850> you'll<00:04:58.240> end<00:04:58.450> up<00:04:58.540> taking<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.900> drill

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
upwards you'll end up taking the drill

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.860 
upwards you'll end up taking the drill
apart<00:04:59.350> which<00:04:59.740> is<00:04:59.770> not<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.100> good<00:05:00.880> thing<00:05:01.060> if<00:05:01.750> you

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
apart which is not a good thing if you

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.210 
apart which is not a good thing if you
try<00:05:02.050> pull<00:05:02.230> this<00:05:02.320> out<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.680> they'll<00:05:03.040> trigger

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
try pull this out and they'll trigger

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.270 
try pull this out and they'll trigger
that<00:05:03.370> apart<00:05:03.700> as<00:05:03.790> well<00:05:03.970> but<00:05:04.870> there<00:05:05.860> is<00:05:05.980> a<00:05:06.010> way<00:05:06.220> to

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
that apart as well but there is a way to

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.800 
that apart as well but there is a way to
take<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:06.640> off<00:05:06.820> without<00:05:06.970> taking<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.600> drill

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
take this off without taking the drill

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.970 
take this off without taking the drill
apart<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.380> way<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.530> do<00:05:08.650> it<00:05:08.770> is<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:08.950> just

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
apart and the way you do it is you just

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.520 
apart and the way you do it is you just
turn<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.210> side<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.960> it'll<00:05:11.320> come<00:05:11.470> off

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
turn it to the side and it'll come off

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.710 
turn it to the side and it'll come off
as<00:05:11.890> one<00:05:12.220> whole<00:05:12.430> piece<00:05:12.730> see<00:05:13.120> if<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.300> not<00:05:13.600> too

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
as one whole piece see if that not too

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.540 
as one whole piece see if that not too
hard<00:05:13.900> right<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.890> you<00:05:14.980> can<00:05:15.130> do<00:05:15.220> this<00:05:15.370> thing

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
hard right and you can do this thing

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.010 
hard right and you can do this thing
with<00:05:15.760> the<00:05:15.940> bucket<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.540> I<00:05:16.660> don't<00:05:16.810> think<00:05:16.930> these

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
with the bucket and I don't think these

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.140 
with the bucket and I don't think these
guys<00:05:17.170> off<00:05:17.350> break<00:05:17.590> again<00:05:18.100> no<00:05:18.850> they're<00:05:19.060> gonna

get a sticker for a license plate and
everything<00:05:29.500> pretty<00:05:30.400> plain<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:30.820> there<00:05:31.600> we<00:05:31.720> go

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
everything pretty plain and there we go

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.280 
everything pretty plain and there we go
and<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:33.580> have<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.790> excavator<00:05:34.330> sit<00:05:34.900> on<00:05:35.020> here

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
and you have the excavator sit on here

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.710 
and you have the excavator sit on here
right<00:05:35.740> here<00:05:36.130> in<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.460> middle<00:05:36.700> actually<00:05:37.390> just

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
right here in the middle actually just

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.090 
right here in the middle actually just
this<00:05:37.840> in<00:05:38.050> right<00:05:38.230> in<00:05:38.380> there<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.920> wheels

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
this in right in there and the wheels

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.070 
this in right in there and the wheels
will<00:05:39.220> just<00:05:39.370> hang<00:05:39.520> off<00:05:39.670> to<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:39.910> sides<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:40.450> you

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
will just hang off to the sides so you

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.350 
will just hang off to the sides so you
see<00:05:41.460> well<00:05:42.460> that<00:05:42.580> makes<00:05:42.790> it<00:05:42.910> pretty<00:05:43.060> wide

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
see well that makes it pretty wide

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.420 
see well that makes it pretty wide
there's<00:05:43.900> almost<00:05:44.050> about<00:05:44.350> 12<00:05:44.740> studs<00:05:44.980> wide<00:05:45.190> on

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
there's almost about 12 studs wide on

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.400 
there's almost about 12 studs wide on
the<00:05:45.760> road<00:05:46.120> and<00:05:46.780> we're<00:05:46.900> gonna<00:05:46.990> attach<00:05:47.110> that

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
the road and we're gonna attach that

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.040 
the road and we're gonna attach that
drill<00:05:47.620> here<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:49.330> you<00:05:49.420> just<00:05:49.450> have<00:05:49.690> this<00:05:49.780> rest

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
drill here and you just have this rest

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.100 
drill here and you just have this rest
on<00:05:50.170> the<00:05:50.350> front<00:05:50.560> there<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:51.780> now<00:05:52.780> we<00:05:52.840> can<00:05:53.020> move

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
on the front there and now we can move

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.880 
on the front there and now we can move
on<00:05:53.260> to<00:05:53.350> other<00:05:53.440> recommendations<00:05:55.860> overall<00:05:56.860> I

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
on to other recommendations overall I

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.500 
on to other recommendations overall I
say<00:05:57.190> it's<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.340> pretty<00:05:57.490> good<00:05:57.580> set<00:05:57.940> when<00:05:58.270> it<00:05:58.330> comes

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
say it's a pretty good set when it comes

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.760 
say it's a pretty good set when it comes
to<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.720> value<00:05:58.990> we're<00:05:59.140> looking<00:05:59.410> at<00:05:59.530> around

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
to the value we're looking at around

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.680 
to the value we're looking at around
thirteen<00:06:00.160> point<00:06:00.400> one<00:06:00.430> cents<00:06:00.820> per<00:06:01.090> piece<00:06:01.270> for

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
thirteen point one cents per piece for

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.030 
thirteen point one cents per piece for
the<00:06:01.780> price<00:06:01.930> per<00:06:02.080> piece<00:06:02.200> ratio<00:06:02.560> which<00:06:02.740> is<00:06:02.890> not

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
the price per piece ratio which is not

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.950 
the price per piece ratio which is not
that<00:06:03.220> great<00:06:03.400> but<00:06:03.700> we<00:06:04.450> are<00:06:04.570> getting<00:06:04.870> about

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
that great but we are getting about

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.780 
that great but we are getting about
forty<00:06:05.380> four<00:06:05.590> dollars<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:06.160> sixty<00:06:06.430> nine<00:06:06.460> cents

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
forty four dollars and sixty nine cents

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.560 
forty four dollars and sixty nine cents
for<00:06:06.910> the<00:06:07.030> parts

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
for the parts

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.510 
for the parts
so<00:06:07.960> overall<00:06:08.380> it's<00:06:08.650> actually<00:06:08.890> on<00:06:09.040> the<00:06:09.130> positive

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
so overall it's actually on the positive

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.250 
so overall it's actually on the positive
side<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:10.210> when<00:06:10.390> it<00:06:10.480> comes<00:06:10.600> to<00:06:10.750> play<00:06:10.930> value

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
side and when it comes to play value

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.570 
side and when it comes to play value
I<00:06:11.290> say<00:06:11.500> it's<00:06:11.590> pretty<00:06:11.710> good<00:06:11.890> too<00:06:12.040> because<00:06:12.220> we<00:06:12.460> do

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580
