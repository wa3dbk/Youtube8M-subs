00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.720
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.360
 new episode of old farm animal breeds my 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.760
 name is so natural in an earlier one 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.070
 I follow the donkey in the old hainer 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.199
 Today I want to treat a whole 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.179
 to imagine certain donkeys namely the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.699
 Austrian Hungarian albino help 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:46.069
 because he is for all the historical time 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.460
 After all, Baroque was also very popular 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:50.569
 could 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.569
 [Music] 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.740
 Gray is commonly called a typical color 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.950
 Not everybody knows about the donkey 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.930
 Donkeys are found gray relatively frequently 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.010
 For example, dark brown and 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.050
 black donkeys as well as mold 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.990
 more recently, they are also clever 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.120
 copies very popular no suggestion 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 he still likes that of the donkey 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.360
 had failed 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 but fascinated people in the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.580
 past so white again 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.290
 albino ass while man ass in the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.170
 general rather with negative 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.600
 characteristics like stupidity and stubbornness 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.430
 hildmann brought white in connection 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.990
 donkey used to be especially smart and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.729
 Smart your sky blue eyes 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 symbolized wisdom during that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.479
 Bright field as a sign of light and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.479
 purity was considered 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.640
 isolated white donkeys are the story 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.460
 already occupied for a long period 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.650
 one has tried especially for their breeding 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.960
 but in the late Baroque and Rococo 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.340
 white animals in the eighteenth 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.320
 century especially when 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.380
 Austrian and Hungarian nobility 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.450
 the descendants of this were very popular 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.120
 Therefore animals are called either today 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.170
 baroque donkey or austria hungarian 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.320
 albino donkey 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.660
 they are extremely threatened and will be 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.240
 currently not officially as a breed 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.570
 acknowledged but as advice of the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.850
 ordinary house is regarded 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.770
 Breeders and fans of the white donkey endeavored 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.870
 have been around for a while 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.940
 Recognition because after all, are the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.540
 white donkey yes one piece alive 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.760
 Cultural assets were especially numerous 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.440
 but never so that you persist 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.480
 throughout the tour story 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.200
 always from a few small herds 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.880
 depend to inbreeding had to avoid 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.340
 in the past again and again 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.340
 donkey of foreign origin can be crossed 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.890
 that the unusual coloring up 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.989
 therefore, it is almost demarcated today 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.030
 a miracle and raises the question 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.160
 how they are genetically produced 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.660
 coming 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.060
 This question is completely cleared up 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.489
 unfortunately not yet considered safe 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.940
 however, that it is a variant of the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.940
 alpinism is the white one 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.380
 Donkey with the so-called Berlin from the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.140
 compare horse breeding 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.510
 the re linie because they hear 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.300
 are not pure white but rather cream 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.280
 to pearl white and the eyes are not 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.150
 like a typical albino red 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.580
 but blue much better known as 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.500
 the baroque donkeys are today the albinos 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.530
 donkey of the small mediterranean island of Assi 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.260
 nara when exactly the first white ass 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.660
 This island is located in the dark 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.730
 But it is clear that today they are the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.300
 unofficial symbol empty there barely 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.400
 inhabited island are a disadvantage to 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.920
 all white asses opposite theirs 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.900
 Having colored fellows is theirs 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.389
 increased sensitivity to the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.050
 sunlight due to the barely 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.480
 pronounced pigmentation 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.870
 Are you prone to eye problems and 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.060
 sunburns diesel have come about 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.250
 luck because you have a rich with them 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.440
 trees with stock of grazing area to 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.380
 provided so that always 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.260
 sufficient shade is available 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.060
 At night, the white donkeys almost look 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.640
 a little mystical and you can 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.710
 understand why people used to do so 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.060
 a great symbolic power in this beautiful 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.060
 have laid animals
