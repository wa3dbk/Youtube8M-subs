00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.980
 alone every bank this is a bull and robe 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.330
 from nintendo we have lost a genius of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.580
 the videogames 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.879
 Mr. Satoru Iwata unfortunately 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.830
 he died he left on July 11, 2015 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.080
 I think it's time to pay tribute 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.910
 that he deserves so in this video they 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.220
 I will tell you everything that Mr. Iwata achieved 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.980
 since I was a novice programmer 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.329
 even when he was president of nintendo 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.669
 creating games that would form our 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.669
 childhood games that will fill us with 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:37.220
 joys and unforgettable experiences 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.220
 this is how we remember satoru iwata 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.100
 born on December 6, 1959 in 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.750
 sapporo japan satoru iwata showed 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.640
 interest in videogames since young 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.170
 doing small games with 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.719
 calculators in high school like 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.579
 hobby this hobby motivated him to 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.129
 study computer science in the 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.019
 Tokyo Institute of Technology 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.610
 while studying I was doing work as 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.550
 independent programmer for a 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.200
 company called cage pour and inc to 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.149
 graduate in college 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.920
 Jal did not hesitate to hire him and iwata 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.050
 started working as a programmer in 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.830
 diverse games the most outstanding 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.729
 they were smash brothers earthbound and kirby 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.679
 thanks to his great talent as 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.500
 programmer his great ability to take 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.600
 decisions and leadership iwata came to be 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.310
 president left and then it was 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.890
 hired by nintendo in the division 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.630
 corporate we know some of his 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.490
 achievements that led him to be promoted 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.979
 on several occasions 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.290
 with kirby and wadding I wanted to create a game 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.880
 simple short without complications that 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.189
 anyone could dominate without 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.960
 problem so iwata and masahiro 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.970
 sakurai began to shape a 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.549
 project which ended up being's kirby 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.820
 winland we all know how was the 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.250
 franchise in the round and walter the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.689
 programming director to save yourself 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.490
 I work the team of programmers 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.070
 decided to recycle the mother code 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.080
 to adapt it to erbol and the result of 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.810
 this was a code with too many bugs and 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.580
 clichÃ©s was here where iwata entered into 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 action and commented to you still stunned and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.899
 the creator of the series we can work 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.660
 the nerves with what we have and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.280
 finish it in two years or we can go back 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.980
 to start from scratch and have a better 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.860
 game in a year of course I 'm 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.530
 opted for the second option for smash 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.720
 brothers miley iwata already working for 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.850
 nintendo noticed that the game would not achieve 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.049
 launch on the scheduled date which 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.750
 It was the same as the nintendo 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.340
 gamecube the code in which they worked 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.620
 the programmers had too many 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.360
 mistakes so he gave you three 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.390
 Complete weeks of reviewing the code 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.500
 over and over and over again fixing all 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.459
 the problems together with the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.709
 programmers also helped pokemon 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.090
 first approach monesterio equal you 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.010
 I help to move all the programming 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.590
 of the game boy games to 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.799
 the nintendo 64 without some document of 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.870
 support or reference later in pokemon 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.090
 gold and silver still helps you 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.340
 compress the game or make the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.140
 game will occupy less memory and thanks to 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.569
 that there was room to program another 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.980
 region the kanto region since 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.470
 originally his 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.140
 appearance in the game all this did 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.190
 before being president of nintendo 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.739
 thanks to all your achievements and your 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.269
 skills already mentioned above 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.519
 and guanta was always under the eye of 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.769
 executives who knew that this 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.299
 man had a lot of potential 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.739
 in fact iwata realized this and 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.350
 I thought the executives were going to 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.600
 dismiss with the retirement of hiroshi 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.090
 Yamauchi Iwata assumed the presidency of 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.799
 the company in 2002 being the fourth 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.209
 president of the history of this and the 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.209
 first not to be a relative of 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.579
 previous president here was where iwata 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.079
 alarmed big since it was the first 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.150
 president in having experience 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.350
 working with videogames although not what 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.780
 create 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.190
 iwata along with nintendo followed 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.890
 revolutionizing the industry to 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.480
 develop the nintendo 10 a console 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.130
 with two screens which had very 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.560
 skeptical to people about whether they would sell 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.570
 ok since the concept was a bit 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.960
 confusing but it became the console 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.700
 best-selling laptop in all of history 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.800
 the story was repeated with the nintendo 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.510
 wii created a new concept 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.520
 revolutionary which managed to sell 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.170
 million and put nintendo back in 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.360
 the consoles competition together with 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.000
 sony and microsoft since with the nintendo 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.959
 64 and the game cube had not gone very 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.660
 all right 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.520
 but not everything was happiness and money with 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.440
 the nintendo tree 10 had problems 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.569
 since the sales at its launch 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.150
 they were well below the expected 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.280
 to amend this error and walt to 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.199
 cut their salaries 50 percent 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.889
 besides accepting the guilt for this 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.020
 stumbling block 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.990
 and this he did again in 2013 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.080
 Due to the low sales of the wii 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.660
 he was also host of iwata aces and 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.010
 the nintendo direct the first of a 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.690
 series of interviews I had with 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.370
 various developers to know 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.530
 everything that happens when developing a 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.240
 video game and the second is a series of 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.580
 videos where they reveal information about their 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.050
 future games all this to help 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.710
 the fans to find more information 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.630
 easy in 2014 Mr. Iwata announced 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.000
 that would not be present in the e3 of that 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.350
 year for health issues later it 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.270
 revealed that this is because it was 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.000
 operated to remove a tumor in the 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.950
 vesicle the tumor was removed with 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.500
 success was just a matter of waiting for 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.440
 the gallbladder will recover which 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.450
 unfortunately it did not happen iwata came back 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.030
 to star in the nintendo direct but 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.550
 you could tell he had lost a lot of weight 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.060
 iwata was not 100% and that's why 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.950
 decided to miss the e3 of 2015 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.840
 shortly after thanks to a statement that 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.640
 he issued an attempt was confirmed his 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.490
 death due to his problem in the 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.410
 vesicle his death caused the sadness of 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.130
 thousands of industry personalities 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.960
 of video games and fans including me 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.620
 many dedicated words prayed for 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.080
 the 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.870
 arts and I dedicate this video 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.629
 undoubtedly satoru iwata was a man who 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.520
 took the company to great things 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:01.830
 taking risks by innovating worrying 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.370
 by the fans and having one or the other 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.409
 stumble but everything can be lifted 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.659
 a talented but humble man a 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.639
 perfect example to follow and to 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.889
 end here one of your phrases more 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.919
 famous in my business card 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.810
 I am a president in my mind I am a 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.710
 video game developer but in my 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.789
 heart 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.990
 I am a gamer rest in peace Mr. Iwata 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.990
 and thank you very much for everything
