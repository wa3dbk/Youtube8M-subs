00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
maximum paper weight right so the other

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.339 
maximum paper weight right so the other
thing<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:27.269> course<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:28.019> know<00:00:28.140> this

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
thing is that of course you know this

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.130 
thing is that of course you know this
stuff<00:00:28.529> already<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.880> other<00:00:30.000> thing<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.269> they

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
stuff already so the other thing is they

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.470

allow<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.460> 100<00:00:32.910> GS<00:00:33.090> M<00:00:33.270> paper

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
allow you to use up to 100 GS M paper

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.959 
allow you to use up to 100 GS M paper
which<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.350> that's<00:00:34.890> again<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.610> British<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
which is that's again it's a British the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.970 
which is that's again it's a British the
CSM<00:00:36.510> grams<00:00:36.840> per<00:00:37.050> square<00:00:37.260> meter<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
CSM grams per square meter so the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.459 
CSM grams per square meter so the
American<00:00:38.340> equivalent<00:00:38.520> would<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.960> between<00:00:39.960> 26

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
American equivalent would be between 26

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.350 
American equivalent would be between 26
and<00:00:40.590> 27<00:00:40.920> pound<00:00:41.250> papers<00:00:41.579> would<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.790> twenty<00:00:42.180> six

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and 27 pound papers would be twenty six

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.670 
and 27 pound papers would be twenty six
point<00:00:42.540> four<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.230> twenty<00:00:43.500> six

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
point four but we don't make twenty six

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
point four but we don't make twenty six
point<00:00:43.920> four<00:00:44.129> pound<00:00:44.370> paper<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.180> don't<00:00:45.420> know

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
like get your plane write it up sand

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.090 
like get your plane write it up sand
that<00:02:40.150> nobody<00:02:40.660> knows<00:02:40.840> well<00:02:41.650> here's<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> deal

science<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.230> thing<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.500> incredible<00:03:43.890> it's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
science of this thing is incredible it's

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.470 
science of this thing is incredible it's
a<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.220> soft<00:03:44.400> way<00:03:44.550> into<00:03:44.730> science<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.239> know

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
a really soft way into science you know

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.610 
a really soft way into science you know
people<00:03:45.750> pick<00:03:45.900> up<00:03:45.989> planes<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.349> they<00:03:46.440> start

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
people pick up planes and they start

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.320 
people pick up planes and they start
making<00:03:46.830> adjustments<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:47.489> want<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.150> know<00:03:48.239> how

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
making adjustments so I want to know how

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.449 
making adjustments so I want to know how
far<00:03:48.540> my<00:03:48.690> plane<00:03:48.930> goes<00:03:49.140> we've<00:03:49.410> thrown<00:03:49.650> at<00:03:49.830> 240

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
far my plane goes we've thrown at 240

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.400 
far my plane goes we've thrown at 240
feet<00:03:50.580> in<00:03:50.700> practice<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.269> beyond<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.260> I'm

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
feet in practice and beyond and so I'm
