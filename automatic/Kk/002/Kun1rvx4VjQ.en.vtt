00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
in this in the neurological assessment

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.750 
in this in the neurological assessment
we<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.010> doing<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.340> sensory

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
we are going to be doing this sensory

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.200 
we are going to be doing this sensory
function<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.500> cranial<00:00:59.399> nerves<00:00:59.609> so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
function which is the cranial nerves so

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.189 
function which is the cranial nerves so
the<00:01:01.199> 12<00:01:01.530> cranial<00:01:01.829> nerves<00:01:02.510> I'll<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:03.899> in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the 12 cranial nerves I'll just go in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.010 
the 12 cranial nerves I'll just go in
order<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> first<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> olfactory<00:01:06.510> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
order so the first one the olfactory is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
order so the first one the olfactory is
going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> smell<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.490> we'll<00:01:08.670> be

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
going to be the smell so we'll be

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090 
going to be the smell so we'll be
holding<00:01:09.420> something<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.229> Justin's<00:01:10.830> nose

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
holding something up to Justin's nose

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.140 
holding something up to Justin's nose
and<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.970> he<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.299> identify<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.810> smell

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
and see me if he can identify the smell

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.929 
and see me if he can identify the smell
the<00:01:15.150> second<00:01:15.689> optic<00:01:16.159> cranial<00:01:17.159> nerve<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.520> sight

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the second optic cranial nerve is sight

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.420 
the second optic cranial nerve is sight
so<00:01:18.689> we'll<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.960> putting<00:01:19.710> something<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.280> front

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
so we'll be putting something in front

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.950 
so we'll be putting something in front
of<00:01:20.549> Justin<00:01:20.729> space<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.299> asking<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> can

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
of Justin space and asking if you can

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.140 
of Justin space and asking if you can
identify<00:01:22.140> such<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.950> poppy<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> popsicle

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
identify such as poppy the popsicle

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.999 
identify such as poppy the popsicle
stick<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.369> pen<00:01:27.380> for<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> third<00:01:28.740> cranial

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
eyeball lens and pupillary sphincter so

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.210 
eyeball lens and pupillary sphincter so
we'll<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.840> putting<00:01:34.140> our<00:01:34.380> finger<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.979> front

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
we'll be putting our finger up in front

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.719 
we'll be putting our finger up in front
all<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.579> finger<00:01:36.950> Justin's<00:01:37.950> face<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.460> seeing

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
all my finger Justin's face and seeing

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
all my finger Justin's face and seeing
if<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.150> follow<00:01:39.390> our<00:01:39.570> fingers<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.200> the

goes with moving the eye for the pfister

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.910 
goes with moving the eye for the pfister
geminal<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> then<00:01:51.240> those<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.500> muscles<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
mastication so we'll be seeing might

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.910 
mastication so we'll be seeing might
give<00:01:56.009> him<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.719> something<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.750> chew<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.710> see

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
give him a something to chew on so see

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.810 
give him a something to chew on so see
if<00:01:59.040> he<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> use<00:01:59.759> his<00:01:59.790> trigeminal<00:02:00.770> nerve<00:02:01.820> for

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
if he can use his trigeminal nerve for

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
if he can use his trigeminal nerve for
