gosh into a cliff area I'm going to use

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.640 
gosh into a cliff area I'm going to use
a<00:01:21.990> moon<00:01:22.259> stone

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
a moon stone

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.050 
a moon stone
I<00:01:23.450> think<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.720> get<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.799> fossil<00:01:26.610> like

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
I think this way get the the fossil like

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870 
I think this way get the the fossil like
the<00:01:27.330> Aerodactyl<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.350> other<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.880> always

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the Aerodactyl or the other one I always

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.100 
the Aerodactyl or the other one I always
just<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> Aerodactyl<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.020> I'll

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
just go with the Aerodactyl so I'll

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.499 
just go with the Aerodactyl so I'll
probably<00:01:31.259> annotate<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.220> time

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
probably annotate the a one this time

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.910 
probably annotate the a one this time
actually<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.630> married<00:01:33.930> actor<00:01:34.170> perhaps<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
actually not married actor perhaps of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.260 
actually not married actor perhaps of
all<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> owner<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.150> used

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
all the way that's the owner is now used

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.800 
all the way that's the owner is now used
together<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> dragon<00:01:37.259> rage<00:01:38.100> -<00:01:38.810> why

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
together because the dragon rage - why

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.050 
together because the dragon rage - why
not<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.189> advanced<00:01:41.939> level<00:01:42.210> 22<00:01:42.509> so

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
not and we have advanced level 22 so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.510 
not and we have advanced level 22 so
guess<00:01:45.060> that's<00:01:45.270> pretty<00:01:45.450> cool<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
guess that's pretty cool and this is the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.560 
guess that's pretty cool and this is the
guy<00:01:47.700> with<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.880> fossils

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
guy with the fossils

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.520 
guy with the fossils
so<00:01:49.170> let's<00:01:49.649> cool<00:01:50.840> I'm<00:01:51.840> guessing<00:01:52.200> water<00:01:52.380> gun

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
so let's cool I'm guessing water gun

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.940 
so let's cool I'm guessing water gun
all<00:01:55.130> right<00:01:55.310> baby<00:01:55.550> I<00:01:56.230> think<00:01:57.230> by<00:01:57.440> its<00:01:57.620> really

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
all right baby I think by its really

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.080 
all right baby I think by its really

useful on this is like a shadow or

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.040 
useful on this is like a shadow or
another<00:02:02.090> one<00:02:02.270> because<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:02.690> know<00:02:02.750> they're
