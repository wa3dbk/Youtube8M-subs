title<00:00:36.110> of<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.560> video<00:00:36.680> this<00:00:36.980> has<00:00:37.130> got

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
title of the video this has got

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.920 
title of the video this has got
something<00:00:37.520> to<00:00:37.700> do<00:00:37.910> with<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.150> weapon<00:00:38.480> setup

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
something to do with the weapon setup

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.080 
something to do with the weapon setup
and<00:00:39.440> it's<00:00:39.890> something<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:40.310> I<00:00:40.370> found<00:00:40.550> out<00:00:40.790> very

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
and it's something that I found out very

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.720

recently<00:00:41.360> about<00:00:41.900> hardline<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:42.950> I<00:00:43.160> think

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
recently about hardline that I think

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.400

compromise<00:03:20.410> that's<00:03:21.190> probably<00:03:21.580> going<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.850> make

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
compromise that's probably going to make

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.910 
compromise that's probably going to make
a<00:03:22.030> lot<00:03:22.330> of<00:03:22.450> people<00:03:22.720> quite<00:03:22.900> excited<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.680> I

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
a lot of people quite excited and I

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.760 
a lot of people quite excited and I
think<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.550> doesn't<00:03:25.060> break<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.360> game<00:03:25.810> they're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
think it doesn't break the game they're

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.010 
think it doesn't break the game they're
going<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.100> be<00:03:27.190> introducing<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.090> system<00:03:28.750> called

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
how we do this but they have told us

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
the other class now if we take the word

battlefield 4 we'd need to achieve a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
order to get it to move across to the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.260 
order to get it to move across to the
other<00:03:58.630> faction<00:03:59.320> now<00:03:59.980> as<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.340> say<00:04:00.580> I<00:04:00.610> can't<00:04:01.030> say

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
other faction now as I say I can't say

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.030 
other faction now as I say I can't say
for<00:04:01.300> certain<00:04:01.540> that's<00:04:02.200> how<00:04:02.380> this<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.680> going<00:04:02.920> to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
for certain that's how this is going to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.830 
for certain that's how this is going to
work<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.820> could<00:04:04.060> see<00:04:04.210> that<00:04:04.360> being<00:04:04.540> a

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
work but I could see that being a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.660 
work but I could see that being a
feasible<00:04:05.410> solution<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:06.100> would<00:04:06.220> need<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.490> get

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
feasible solution you would need to get

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.970 
feasible solution you would need to get
perhaps<00:04:07.030> maybe<00:04:07.480> 5,000<00:04:08.440> kills<00:04:08.650> with<00:04:08.890> the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
perhaps maybe 5,000 kills with the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.830 
perhaps maybe 5,000 kills with the
weapon<00:04:09.370> in<00:04:09.520> order<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.060> move<00:04:10.210> it<00:04:10.360> across<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
weapon in order to move it across to the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.990 
weapon in order to move it across to the
other<00:04:11.020> faction<00:04:11.620> now<00:04:12.070> five<00:04:12.340> thousand<00:04:12.820> kills

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
other faction now five thousand kills

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.850 
other faction now five thousand kills
might<00:04:13.270> sound<00:04:13.510> like<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.720> lot<00:04:14.050> but<00:04:14.470> trust<00:04:14.770> me

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
might sound like a lot but trust me

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.990 
might sound like a lot but trust me
there<00:04:15.190> are<00:04:15.310> probably<00:04:15.550> guys<00:04:15.760> out<00:04:15.970> there

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
there are probably guys out there

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.729 
there are probably guys out there
watching<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:16.510> video<00:04:16.750> right<00:04:17.020> now<00:04:17.080> that

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
watching this video right now that

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.530 
watching this video right now that
probably<00:04:18.010> got<00:04:18.160> more<00:04:18.340> than<00:04:18.489> 10,000<00:04:19.120> kills<00:04:19.330> with

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
probably got more than 10,000 kills with

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.990 
probably got more than 10,000 kills with
the<00:04:19.660> x-23<00:04:20.440> it's<00:04:20.950> not<00:04:21.250> particularly<00:04:21.790> difficult

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
the x-23 it's not particularly difficult

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.140 
the x-23 it's not particularly difficult
to<00:04:22.510> do<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.780> if<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.140> do<00:04:23.410> use<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.860> weapon

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
to do it if you do use that weapon

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.520 
to do it if you do use that weapon
exclusively<00:04:25.150> you've<00:04:25.630> spending<00:04:26.050> all<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.410> your

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
exclusively you've spending all of your

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.140 
exclusively you've spending all of your
hours<00:04:26.680> playing<00:04:27.160> with<00:04:27.430> that<00:04:27.550> weapon<00:04:27.790> you're

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
hours playing with that weapon you're

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.559 
hours playing with that weapon you're
going<00:04:28.360> to

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
going to

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.200 
going to
it<00:04:28.629> kills<00:04:28.929> very<00:04:29.259> very<00:04:29.619> quickly<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.490> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
it kills very very quickly and the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.579 
it kills very very quickly and the
reason<00:04:31.479> I<00:04:31.539> don't<00:04:31.599> think<00:04:31.779> this<00:04:32.080> breaks<00:04:32.409> the

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:32.589 
reason I don't think this breaks the

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:35.129 
reason I don't think this breaks the
game<00:04:32.889> is<00:04:33.429> because<00:04:33.909> you<00:04:34.300> are<00:04:34.539> going<00:04:34.809> to<00:04:34.929> have<00:04:35.020> to

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
game is because you are going to have to

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.439 
game is because you are going to have to
reach<00:04:35.319> a<00:04:35.559> certain<00:04:35.589> goal<00:04:36.159> in<00:04:36.219> order<00:04:36.969> to<00:04:37.119> unlock

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
reach a certain goal in order to unlock

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.149 
reach a certain goal in order to unlock
these<00:04:37.689> weapons<00:04:38.139> for<00:04:38.319> different<00:04:38.649> factions

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
these weapons for different factions

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.889 
these weapons for different factions
it's<00:04:39.580> not<00:04:39.759> just<00:04:39.939> gonna<00:04:40.089> be<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> simple<00:04:40.479> right

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:40.899 
it's not just gonna be a simple right

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:42.629 
it's not just gonna be a simple right
need<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.169> get<00:04:41.319> 20<00:04:41.589> kills<00:04:41.800> then<00:04:42.039> I<00:04:42.129> can<00:04:42.309> use<00:04:42.490> this

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
need to get 20 kills then I can use this

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.639 
need to get 20 kills then I can use this
with<00:04:42.849> the<00:04:42.879> robber<00:04:43.179> class<00:04:43.509> it's<00:04:44.169> probably

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:44.649 
with the robber class it's probably

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:46.799 
with the robber class it's probably
going<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:45.009> be<00:04:45.189> some<00:04:45.909> kind<00:04:46.119> of<00:04:46.270> extent<00:04:46.689> that

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:46.809 
going to be some kind of extent that

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.719 
going to be some kind of extent that
you're<00:04:46.899> gonna<00:04:46.990> have<00:04:47.199> to<00:04:47.349> go<00:04:47.559> to<00:04:47.619> in<00:04:48.159> order<00:04:48.490> to

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
you're gonna have to go to in order to

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.760 
you're gonna have to go to in order to
make<00:04:48.879> sure<00:04:48.909> your<00:04:49.240> favorite<00:04:49.749> weapon<00:04:50.139> you<00:04:50.589> can

make sure your favorite weapon you can
use<00:04:51.039> on<00:04:51.279> any<00:04:51.550> class<00:04:51.879> at<00:04:52.240> any<00:04:52.539> time<00:04:52.869> that<00:04:53.020> you

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
use on any class at any time that you

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.079 
use on any class at any time that you
wanted<00:04:53.529> to<00:04:53.770> it's<00:04:54.369> going<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.550> be<00:04:54.639> more<00:04:54.909> of<00:04:54.999> a

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:55.089 
wanted to it's going to be more of a

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:56.730 
wanted to it's going to be more of a
privilege<00:04:55.569> once<00:04:55.899> you've<00:04:56.080> got<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.259> that<00:04:56.409> point

privilege once you've got to that point

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.100 
privilege once you've got to that point
okay<00:04:57.039> finally<00:04:57.729> I<00:04:57.759> can<00:04:57.879> use<00:04:58.149> this<00:04:58.300> weapon<00:04:58.689> as<00:04:58.839> a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
okay finally I can use this weapon as a

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.679 
okay finally I can use this weapon as a
robber<00:04:59.499> or<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.919> cop<00:05:00.459> and<00:05:01.089> I<00:05:01.149> think<00:05:01.360> putting<00:05:01.539> the

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.689 
robber or a cop and I think putting the

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.689 
robber or a cop and I think putting the
hard<00:05:01.899> effort<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.469> time<00:05:02.680> into<00:05:03.129> it<00:05:03.159> you'll

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
hard effort and time into it you'll

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:04.769 
hard effort and time into it you'll
probably<00:05:03.759> get<00:05:04.029> a<00:05:04.089> good<00:05:04.300> feeling<00:05:04.689> of

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:04.779 
probably get a good feeling of

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.839 
probably get a good feeling of
satisfaction<00:05:04.959> knowing<00:05:05.709> that<00:05:06.279> you<00:05:06.399> deserve<00:05:06.819> to

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
satisfaction knowing that you deserve to

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.439 
satisfaction knowing that you deserve to
use<00:05:07.270> that<00:05:07.479> weapon<00:05:07.839> with<00:05:08.169> the<00:05:08.289> other<00:05:08.439> faction

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
use that weapon with the other faction

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.790 
use that weapon with the other faction
ultimately<00:05:10.449> I<00:05:10.719> think<00:05:11.080> it's<00:05:11.199> a<00:05:11.319> really<00:05:11.529> good

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
ultimately I think it's a really good

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.029 
ultimately I think it's a really good
idea<00:05:12.539> when<00:05:13.539> I<00:05:13.569> first<00:05:13.959> heard<00:05:14.169> about<00:05:14.319> it<00:05:14.499> which

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
idea when I first heard about it which

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.519 
idea when I first heard about it which
was<00:05:15.069> over<00:05:15.490> in<00:05:15.610> San<00:05:15.819> Francisco<00:05:16.419> I<00:05:16.629> thought<00:05:17.409> it

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
was over in San Francisco I thought it

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:18.869 
was over in San Francisco I thought it
was<00:05:17.649> going<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.830> be<00:05:17.949> a<00:05:17.979> little<00:05:18.309> bit<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.669> game

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
was going to be a little bit of a game

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.309 
was going to be a little bit of a game
breaker<00:05:19.180> because<00:05:19.449> at<00:05:19.659> that<00:05:19.749> point<00:05:19.990> we<00:05:20.199> knew

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
breaker because at that point we knew

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.350 
breaker because at that point we knew
the<00:05:20.439> m16<00:05:20.979> was<00:05:21.159> in<00:05:21.279> there<00:05:21.490> and<00:05:21.729> all<00:05:22.059> of<00:05:22.209> us<00:05:22.300> just

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
the m16 was in there and all of us just

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.359 
the m16 was in there and all of us just
sort<00:05:22.599> of<00:05:22.719> looked<00:05:22.869> at<00:05:23.019> each<00:05:23.080> other<00:05:23.289> and<00:05:23.559> went<00:05:23.740> we

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:24.369 
sort of looked at each other and went we

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:26.459 
sort of looked at each other and went we
can<00:05:24.519> all<00:05:24.610> unlock<00:05:24.909> the<00:05:25.029> m16a3<00:05:25.689> for<00:05:26.080> every

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
can all unlock the m16a3 for every

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.829 
can all unlock the m16a3 for every
different<00:05:26.679> class<00:05:27.189> and<00:05:27.550> every<00:05:28.179> faction<00:05:28.449> within

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:28.839 
different class and every faction within

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:30.779 
different class and every faction within
the<00:05:28.959> game<00:05:29.169> that's<00:05:29.709> not<00:05:29.860> going<00:05:30.249> to<00:05:30.309> be<00:05:30.429> the<00:05:30.580> case

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
the game that's not going to be the case

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.509 
the game that's not going to be the case
the<00:05:31.149> weapon<00:05:31.539> will<00:05:31.689> only<00:05:31.929> be<00:05:32.289> available<00:05:32.439> to<00:05:33.399> the

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:33.519 
the weapon will only be available to the

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.909 
the weapon will only be available to the
same<00:05:33.819> class<00:05:34.269> within<00:05:34.719> the<00:05:34.959> different<00:05:35.379> faction

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
same class within the different faction

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.790 
same class within the different faction
so<00:05:36.369> you've<00:05:36.490> got<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:36.759> operator<00:05:37.300> class<00:05:37.569> the<00:05:38.199> m16

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
so you've got the operator class the m16

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.249 
so you've got the operator class the m16
or<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.069> r0<00:05:39.639> 993<00:05:40.479> which<00:05:40.749> is<00:05:40.899> what<00:05:41.019> it's<00:05:41.139> going

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
or the r0 993 which is what it's going

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.679 
or the r0 993 which is what it's going
to<00:05:41.319> be<00:05:41.409> called<00:05:41.619> in<00:05:41.769> the<00:05:41.860> game<00:05:42.240> that<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.479> can

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 
to be called in the game that you can

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.420 
to be called in the game that you can
port<00:05:43.899> across<00:05:44.110> to<00:05:44.319> the<00:05:44.409> robbers<00:05:44.740> class<00:05:45.009> but<00:05:45.339> you

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
port across to the robbers class but you

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.449 
port across to the robbers class but you
can<00:05:45.579> only<00:05:45.789> use<00:05:45.999> it<00:05:46.209> as<00:05:46.509> the<00:05:47.379> operator<00:05:47.919> robber

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:48.459 
can only use it as the operator robber

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.309 
can only use it as the operator robber
you<00:05:48.789> can't<00:05:49.029> use<00:05:49.180> it<00:05:49.300> as<00:05:49.389> like<00:05:49.479> the<00:05:49.599> engineer<00:05:50.050> or

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 
you can't use it as like the engineer or

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.290 
you can't use it as like the engineer or
or<00:05:50.769> like<00:05:50.979> the<00:05:51.129> professional<00:05:51.699> class<00:05:51.879> you<00:05:52.089> can't

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
or like the professional class you can't

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.119 
or like the professional class you can't
you<00:05:52.569> can't<00:05:52.779> do<00:05:52.959> that<00:05:53.139> you<00:05:53.589> can<00:05:53.740> only<00:05:53.860> use<00:05:54.099> it

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
you can't do that you can only use it

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:55.949 
you can't do that you can only use it
within<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.579> same<00:05:54.819> class<00:05:55.119> but<00:05:55.149> within<00:05:55.689> that

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:55.959 
within the same class but within that

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:57.809 
within the same class but within that
different<00:05:56.379> faction<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.399> I<00:05:57.490> think<00:05:57.669> that's

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
different faction and I think that's

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.129 
different faction and I think that's
another<00:05:58.029> thing<00:05:58.240> that<00:05:58.300> they've<00:05:58.509> added<00:05:58.809> to<00:05:58.990> make

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
another thing that they've added to make

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:00.569 
another thing that they've added to make
sure<00:05:59.289> it<00:05:59.379> doesn't<00:05:59.589> break<00:05:59.860> the<00:05:59.919> game<00:06:00.249> so<00:06:00.459> you're

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:00.579 
sure it doesn't break the game so you're

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:02.219 
sure it doesn't break the game so you're
not<00:06:00.639> gonna<00:06:00.759> get<00:06:01.029> a<00:06:01.059> load<00:06:01.329> of<00:06:01.360> recons<00:06:01.899> running

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
not gonna get a load of recons running

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.379 
not gonna get a load of recons running
around<00:06:02.349> with<00:06:02.619> motion<00:06:02.949> balls<00:06:03.129> and<00:06:03.399> then<00:06:04.089> sort

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
around with motion balls and then sort

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.480 
around with motion balls and then sort
of<00:06:04.449> spraying<00:06:04.839> you<00:06:05.019> down<00:06:05.169> with<00:06:05.379> an<00:06:05.469> m16<00:06:05.800> I<00:06:06.189> don't

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
of spraying you down with an m16 I don't

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.879 
of spraying you down with an m16 I don't
think<00:06:06.669> that<00:06:06.789> would<00:06:06.909> be<00:06:07.029> very<00:06:07.209> fair<00:06:07.649> but<00:06:08.649> as<00:06:08.740> I

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
think that would be very fair but as I

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.679 
think that would be very fair but as I
say<00:06:09.069> I<00:06:09.099> think<00:06:09.309> this<00:06:09.550> is<00:06:09.729> probably<00:06:09.999> gonna<00:06:10.180> be<00:06:10.269> a

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:10.689 
say I think this is probably gonna be a

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.269 
say I think this is probably gonna be a
really<00:06:11.019> good<00:06:11.229> idea<00:06:11.379> something<00:06:11.829> that<00:06:11.949> doesn't

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279 
really good idea something that doesn't

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.589 
really good idea something that doesn't
break<00:06:12.430> the<00:06:12.459> game<00:06:12.759> but<00:06:12.969> allows<00:06:13.209> for<00:06:13.449> a<00:06:13.479> little

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
break the game but allows for a little

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.600 
break the game but allows for a little
bit<00:06:13.839> of<00:06:13.930> variety<00:06:14.439> in<00:06:14.469> there<00:06:14.860> within<00:06:15.430> the

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
bit of variety in there within the
