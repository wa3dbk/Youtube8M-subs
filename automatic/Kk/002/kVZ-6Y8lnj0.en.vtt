00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.640
 here I am as I just told you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.300
 I wanted you in the video I just shot 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.800
 try I wanted to spend two words 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.820
 regarding the trip it deals with the body 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.320
 here you can see let's say two of two 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.390
 step this we say to the step I use 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.789
 roughly from when claudio to around 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380
 three years 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.539
 this is the step that a museum gives 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.820
 cannes olivia one year 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.740
 I had bought it in the green version 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.969
 that you can see a sense of it also for 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.829
 my second child is bought in a 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.480
 I had another high chair 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.090
 I must say that I think it's a big one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.149
 trip handicap too much in the sense that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.760
 in the other side comfortable for a first 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.800
 weaning phase because you can 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.149
 see even if there is this sort of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 baby set 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.160
 there is no real support for the head 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.280
 so claudio who started it 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.960
 weaning around 5 and a half months 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.530
 when he ate he tended to get tired and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.470
 tired the crooked head was leaning 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.750
 he was not there I have to tell the truth for 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.270
 these solidarity that the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.189
 I didn't have room for the apartment 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.590
 high chair for which I have waited longer 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.500
 we have 9 10 months then started to stay there 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.140
 well let's say a year with lidia hop 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.140
 turned out to be mine , I used it from 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.150
 birth and I started putting it in the trip 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 it's too much for a cleaning problem 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.940
 I'll explain why we say in the high chair 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.820
 the straps are classic 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.920
 there are anxieties where lyria 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.340
 eat alone even if it's only a year 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.970
 you to this strong desire for autonomy 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.550
 so all the bits of food fell 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.610
 the theta mia is a very nice cover in 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.650
 But cotton obviously touched my 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.330
 ball too often practically every 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.520
 day started in mind of the ten 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.890
 dystrophin sky still hides 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.470
 instead the beauty of this high chair 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.820
 I think I 'd rather call chairs 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.730
 because in reality it is in effect 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.179
 a chair that you can use up to 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.060
 when the child grows and they know 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.950
 one rag is cleaned and me wood 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.560
 I also use wood oven rice as well 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.210
 disinfects in a moment and fruit 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.520
 I would like to point out that they are here behind 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.320
 also disturbances and sincerely provide a 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.560
 used for claudio insiste because yes 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.470
 they stuck out from the olive high chair here they were 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 here they are placed in front of the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.360
 child and then they close the sky cleansed 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.580
 I never used a point and I saw it 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.980
 more nobel than seven slightly different 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.870
 because this band is connected to 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.489
 these have done a great thing because 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.239
 this one is the one towards the model 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.209
 old and leather and if a little ruined e 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.100
 with food maybe putting instead 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.770
 structure of her new baby memo 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.270
 gearbox set and all broken a suit 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.830
 of plastic so think even more 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.320
 easy to clean instead this for 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.120
 to be cleaned must be disassembled 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.519
 so it is neither a comfortable but I for not 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.489
 spend other money or used anyway 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.170
 like this one here green 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.420
 here is the evolution obviously 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.580
 slowly the basics move here 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.670
 you can see them well according to the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.650
 child growth 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.780
 in two and a half years three years to say 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.670
 that this and will become a series there 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.750
 I note how comfortable it is for 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.430
 first the adults that is often that maybe 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.780
 so it is also a chair that is for 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.770
 use it you can eat 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.459
 quietly you too is very comfortable 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.760
 another handicap and the clutter then and 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.620
 anti rollover but I can assure you 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.290
 sure if the idea does not move then 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.120
 however, it ensures the system they have made 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.680
 their 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.280
 this pedestal I show it as 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.730
 here's how practically there is a here 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.430
 game in my opinion on a visual level that makes 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.459
 so that since he says he is like that 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.220
 and performs a little more than the 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.799
 backrest so the eye thinks that where 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.140
 finish backrest finish pedestal 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.750
 actually that's not how I assure you 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.150
 that I gave myself a lot to the ai 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.549
 feet not only had I gathered the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.070
 but every guests all of the same 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.070
 same claudio because running 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.430
 maybe or even just walking 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.010
 a table the protruding part protrudes from 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.510
 so so you have to be careful of a 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.160
 fractional feet there is nothing 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.710
 because in any case the founded part 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.730
 but how many times it belongs to me because in 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.860
 away of feet 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.990
 here is not important but I want to say 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.870
 if you buy it, watch out for your nails 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.940
 for the rest the straw advice e 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.150
 according to me if you have to buy a 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.800
 high chair for a home now when 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.300
 the child is one year then 13 14 months and 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.910
 buy the trip trap because you will use it 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.650
 really for a long time is a great one 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.980
 purchase you will not regret 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.980
 bye Bye
