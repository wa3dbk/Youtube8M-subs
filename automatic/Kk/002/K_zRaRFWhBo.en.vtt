00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello how are you good then in this video 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.200
 I'm going to give you some tips and tricks for 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.420
 that can make your eyes look for a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.980
 little bigger is necessary that they have 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.870
 small eyes to follow this 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 tutorial any I think we can 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 make our eyes look for more 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.149
 great and I think that's something that we 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.070
 The girls like our eyes 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:25.020
 see as the center of attention of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.630
 face for this tutorial I will use 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.489
 this wall that is the most sacks 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.590
 itself you can see already has very colorful 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.920
 very appropriate for all 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.750
 days however they do not have names to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 each shadow does not have a name then 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 Well, if you have this palette, I'll 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.460
 try to describe the colors a bit 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.980
 so you can recreate it and all the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 products are going to be in my blog I'm going 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.040
 to leave the link in the box 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.800
 information as well as all my networks 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.730
 social facebook instagram 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.739
 and then let's see the tutorial 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.390
 Well, let's start using a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.390
 first all over the eyelid 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.010
 now we take a vanilla shadow or 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.410
 champagne or even white if so 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.200
 you want and we will put the same in everything 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.380
 the eyelid we are going to pay attention to 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.580
 the eyelid mobile and in the written and I you 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.580
 I'm showing the lacrimal 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.549
 we're also going to put a little under the 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.710
 arch of the eyebrow this will make 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 our eyes begin to see with much 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.979
 more light and remember that light makes 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.979
 everything is bigger 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.520
 with a brown shadow and a small brush 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.159
 what you are going to do is mark the basin 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.100
 but slightly higher than you 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.640
 natural basin this is going to be that we believe 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.960
 a new shadow let's say and that your account 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.960
 look a little higher 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.600
 now with a lighter shade of coffee 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.180
 let's blur what we just 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 do but blur up towards 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.170
 the eyebrow we do not want to take away any of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.170
 white to our mobile eyelid 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.030
 let's create more depth with a 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.640
 shadow a darker one here you 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.090
 I highly recommend that you do not use shadow 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.940
 black 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.550
 Black is too strong for some 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.710
 small eyes to enlarge simply 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.690
 uses a coffee shade even more 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.340
 strong you have but I recommend you 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.340
 much you stay away from the black 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.530
 the angle that this shadow must take 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.360
 intense coffee is the same as if 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.400
 you would like to lengthen the line of your 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.330
 lower lashes like I am 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.330
 doing right now 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.049
 to enlarge the eye we are also going to 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.840
 delineate with shadow on lashes 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.969
 inferiors but try to reach the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.370
 half simply do not close them 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.370
 you get to lacrimal nothing else quite 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.160
 with a gel eyeliner I'm going to do the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.000
 delineated kitten but I'll try 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.910
 that the outer part is the thickest 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.360
 and in the rest it will be very close to the 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.360
 tabs 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.580
 this is going to be that my eye looks long 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.180
 at the end with a little more shape 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.180
 almond 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.530
 Bottom water line is very important 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.510
 never put black if you want 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.180
 enlarge your eyes I recommend a 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.670
 tone like this that is beige or a tone 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.950
 very similar to the tone of your skin 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.719
 I do not like so much to put white because 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.849
 I feel that it looks very doll 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.890
 that very artificial but could also 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.430
 work if you do not have this type 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.430
 of colors 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.269
 the eyelashes are going to play a very 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.400
 important to open the eye because then 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.739
 will seem more awake and more open 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.020
 so if you need it in china the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.680
 eyelashes and puts a lot but a lot of mask 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.680
 of tabs 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.120
 to open the eye even more here yes it is 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.410
 you need to put on mascara 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.410
 in the lower ones also 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.490
 and good if it is a very special education 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.170
 you can apply false eyelashes 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.150
 these are individual only they are not 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.920
 Individuals are in monotypes ie 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.530
 that three are coming and I'm going to put them 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.950
 nothing else on the outside of the eye 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.960
 to emphasize even more because this one 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.910
 as delineated from catai and that the eye still 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.800
 Look more almond and a little more 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.800
 elongated is also going to open 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.400
 and well, something like that would be an eye 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.680
 bigger in my eyes you know that 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.780
 they are not especially small but 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.300
 still I think it looks bigger and so 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.890
 more striking and I hope you follow the 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.890
 advice and that they serve you too 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.170
 and well, that was all for the video 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.640
 today I hope you follow the advice and 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.560
 that are good for you 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.030
 I remind you that I have a small draw 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.710
 right now in the channel I'll leave you the 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.360
 link to that video in the box 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.770
 information and see you in the next 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.770
 a kiss bye
