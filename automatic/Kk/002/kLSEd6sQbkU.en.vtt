back<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> packaging<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.119> came<00:01:18.330> in

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
back in the packaging that it came in

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.530 
back in the packaging that it came in
and<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.470> wear<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.189> every<00:01:20.580> day<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.759> rotate

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and I don't wear them every day I rotate

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.289 
and I don't wear them every day I rotate
the<00:01:21.810> units<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.830> makes<00:01:23.130> them<00:01:23.340> last<00:01:23.580> much

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the units which makes them last much

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.410
