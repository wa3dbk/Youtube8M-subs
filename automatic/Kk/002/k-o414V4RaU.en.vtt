to action do all my work in google

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.860 
to action do all my work in google
chrome<00:01:21.159> because<00:01:21.729> i<00:01:21.909> find<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.299> that<00:01:22.450> gives<00:01:22.750> a

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
chrome because i find that that gives a

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.090 
chrome because i find that that gives a
better<00:01:23.549> rendition<00:01:24.549> of<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:25.229> their<00:01:26.229> website<00:01:26.830> as

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
better rendition of the their website as

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.330 
better rendition of the their website as
it<00:01:27.250> would<00:01:27.370> look<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.760> mobile<00:01:28.030> babe<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:29.020> looks

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it would look on a mobile babe it looks

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.789 
it would look on a mobile babe it looks
more<00:01:30.340> accurate<00:01:31.090> under<00:01:31.869> google<00:01:32.229> chrome<00:01:32.500> than

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
more accurate under google chrome than

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.500 
more accurate under google chrome than
it<00:01:32.890> does<00:01:33.040> on<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.310> firefox<00:01:34.000> or<00:01:34.270> internet

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
it does on the firefox or internet

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.960 
it does on the firefox or internet
explorer<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:35.799> I<00:01:35.830> do<00:01:35.950> all<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.310> my<00:01:36.430> work<00:01:36.760> in

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.600 
explorer so I do all of my work in
Google<00:01:37.420> Chrome<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:39.130> look<00:01:39.280> at<00:01:39.369> it<00:01:39.400> in

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
Google Chrome if you look at it in

Google Chrome if you look at it in
Internet<00:01:39.940> Explorer<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.570> will<00:01:40.690> look<00:01:40.840> very<00:01:41.170> very

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
Internet Explorer it will look very very

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.200 
Internet Explorer it will look very very
slightly<00:01:41.799> different<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.430> particularly

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
slightly different in particularly

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.520 
slightly different in particularly
you'll<00:01:43.390> probably<00:01:43.630> find<00:01:43.930> that<00:01:44.080> if<00:01:44.229> you've<00:01:44.350> got

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
you'll probably find that if you've got

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.039 
you'll probably find that if you've got
a<00:01:44.560> top<00:01:44.890> bar<00:01:45.189> on<00:01:45.400> this<00:01:45.939> top<00:01:46.270> bar<00:01:46.510> doesn't<00:01:46.720> render

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
a top bar on this top bar doesn't render

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.670 
a top bar on this top bar doesn't render
properly<00:01:47.439> in<00:01:48.040> internet<00:01:48.580> explorer<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:50.140> you're

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
properly in internet explorer now you're

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.260 
properly in internet explorer now you're
not<00:01:50.770> really<00:01:51.070> bothered<00:01:51.310> whether<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.850> renders

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
not really bothered whether it renders

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.330 
not really bothered whether it renders
dropping<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.930> explore<00:01:53.260> or<00:01:53.590> not<00:01:53.830> what

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
dropping in and explore or not what

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.760 
dropping in and explore or not what
you're<00:01:54.490> bothered<00:01:55.090> about<00:01:55.180> is<00:01:55.600> how<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.200> final

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
you're bothered about is how the final

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.520 
you're bothered about is how the final
website<00:01:57.189> looks<00:01:57.430> on<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> mobile<00:01:57.909> telephone<00:01:58.530> and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
website looks on a mobile telephone and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.890 
website looks on a mobile telephone and
so<00:01:59.979> because<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:00.820> i<00:02:00.909> tend<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.360> use<00:02:01.479> chrome

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
so because of that i tend to use chrome

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.450 
so because of that i tend to use chrome
and<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.350> gives<00:02:02.560> me<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.710> very<00:02:03.040> very<00:02:03.250> good

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
and it gives me a very very good

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.070 
and it gives me a very very good
impression<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:04.360> what<00:02:04.509> is<00:02:04.659> called<00:02:04.869> it<00:02:04.990> look

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
impression of what is called it look

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.200 
impression of what is called it look
like<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:05.619> not<00:02:05.830> one<00:02:05.979> hundred<00:02:06.130> percent<00:02:06.310> but

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
like it's not one hundred percent but

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.499 
like it's not one hundred percent but
it's<00:02:07.390> as<00:02:07.540> close<00:02:07.990> as<00:02:08.259> 90<00:02:09.190> something<00:02:09.429> percent<00:02:09.610> 95

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
it's as close as 90 something percent 95

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.640 
it's as close as 90 something percent 95
97<00:02:11.080> 98<00:02:11.590> percent<00:02:12.160> accurate<00:02:13.079> so<00:02:14.079> that<00:02:14.320> like<00:02:14.500> is

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
97 98 percent accurate so that like is

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.479 
97 98 percent accurate so that like is
