all the impurities out of the gas and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.859 
all the impurities out of the gas and
then<00:00:24.710> we<00:00:24.920> stabilize<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:25.699> oil<00:00:26.029> in<00:00:26.480> order<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:26.779> be

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
then we stabilize the oil in order to be

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.109 
then we stabilize the oil in order to be

you know reliability is the key focus
for<00:00:36.830> what<00:00:37.160> we're<00:00:37.280> doing<00:00:37.310> here<00:00:37.670> we<00:00:37.910> have<00:00:38.030> ac1000

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
for what we're doing here we have ac1000

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.990 
for what we're doing here we have ac1000
it<00:00:39.080> runs<00:00:39.260> off<00:00:39.440> natural<00:00:39.950> gas<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.640> we<00:00:40.820> produce

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
it runs off natural gas that we produce

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.970 
it runs off natural gas that we produce
here<00:00:41.180> in<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.540> Eagle<00:00:41.840> fur<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:42.290> it<00:00:42.530> powers<00:00:42.800> our

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
here in the Eagle fur and it powers our

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.960 
here in the Eagle fur and it powers our
entire<00:00:43.310> facility

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
entire facility

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.270 
entire facility
the<00:00:44.180> c1000<00:00:45.050> they're<00:00:45.440> going<00:00:45.830> to<00:00:45.920> be<00:00:46.010> pulling

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
the c1000 they're going to be pulling

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.480 
the c1000 they're going to be pulling
about<00:00:46.700> 4<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.390> 600<00:00:47.750> kW<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.680> load<00:00:49.010> off<00:00:49.220> to<00:00:49.370> this

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
about 4 to 600 kW a load off to this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.210 
about 4 to 600 kW a load off to this
site<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:50.870> it's<00:00:51.110> just<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.440> real<00:00:51.620> perfect<00:00:52.040> fit

so<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> think<00:02:19.130> they're<00:02:19.430> pretty<00:02:19.640> confident<00:02:20.150> in

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
so I think they're pretty confident in

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.230 
so I think they're pretty confident in
the<00:02:20.450> reliability<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.560> love<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.340> been<00:02:22.640> no
