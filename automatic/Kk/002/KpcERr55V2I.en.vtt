00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.419
 with data attached to a new video the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.880
 touch the dawn 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.890
 if you leave a like in favorites there is a 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.170
 heap and good seems to be following the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.360
 theme of the second hand and xbox which already 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.180
 you know today it seems that the publication 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.169
 wire has basically said that it 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.849
 I bought zoom or from xbox one I had to 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.939
 install in your console 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.589
 and could only be installed once yes 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.149
 is the base in another console because you had 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.589
 have to pay a certain amount that 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.749
 was to be determined still not be 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.090
 I knew how much it was but basically 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:35.910
 because the original price of the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.690
 I'm playing so good with a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.010
 second hand because it would be nonexistent 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.929
 basically possible to pay a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.000
 amount very similar to what you would get 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.860
 the game 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.900
 original good it seems that this has 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 raised much controversy by all 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.530
 sides and the paramenos and it seems that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.950
 Microsoft understands neither herself 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.910
 really good 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.350
 there are a couple of pretty statements 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.619
 you miss the first bible on the part of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.210
 xbox technical support twitter on the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.310
 that basically said there will not be 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.540
 able to pay to activate any game 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.940
 borrowed that you will not have to pay for 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.770
 install any second-hand game or 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.840
 nothing like that I managed to make all this 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.600
 it was false rumors that all this was 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.619
 an invention or a misunderstanding of wire 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640
 and it seems that the vice president 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.610
 from microsoft 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.590
 phil harrison was also giving 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.100
 interviews affirming the opposite 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.660
 what did xbox technical support say 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.820
 basically clarifying that yes everything 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.750
 this then how good that would turn around 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.690
 to this that you activate your disk in your 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.330
 account and if you want to play in the other 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.310
 console so you have to pay so 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.460
 good 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.680
 they know that what is 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.649
 happening here nobody clarifies anything and 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.600
 let's hope they confirm something soon 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.939
 officially microsoft on the other hand 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.000
 because different employees are 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.409
 saying that soon they will clear up everything else 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.769
 saying yes you have to pay others 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.870
 that all this is a lie there is a lot 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.160
 lack of control of what would be 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.110
 this rumor we are going to say rumor or 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.030
 things that have happened to them or things that 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.670
 they did not have to say yet or things that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.200
 they were reserving for e3 or not what 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.600
 that we should know if all this at the end 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.310
 is nothing if all this finally 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.319
 He says it's a lie but everything looks like 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.510
 the sicily reason which in turn implies 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.940
 is a big shot is the vice president of 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.830
 Microsoft says something like that is going to be 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.700
 something like this is not a lack of specifying a 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.220
 little more about all this we will see to see 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.500
 how do they do how to clarify everything 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.690
 and hopefully it will be soon 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.489
 soon they will clarify it really well and 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.040
 That is a good representative that 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.170
 say and say it officially because this 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.069
 It really is a lack of control and nobody knows 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.519
 nothing 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.859
 everyone is scared and the for 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.180
 minus the second hand because the truth is 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.040
 that helps a lot to what is the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.450
 economy of video games not all 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.609
 world has enough money to 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.269
 buy all the games in the world and 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.269
 Really 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.930
 I would say that 90% of the people who 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.820
 they sell a game is to buy another 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.260
 game with which the good ones go 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.390
 benefiting a bit like this the industry 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.180
 of the video game they want to do something 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.569
 of the style of charging a percentage for 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.299
 let them go 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.010
 the developer and such does not seem to me in 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.269
 part well as long as they are not for the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.920
 own microsoft and be for the 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.469
 developers and the company so good 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.269
 what are we going to do for somebody 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:38.579
 will have to pay but if they start with 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.219
 abusive amounts and things that do not cool 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.989
 nothing then do not fuck enough everyone 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.389
 so well let's wait what 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.310
 says microsoft soon about this 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.590
 topic of the second hand and we will see to see 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.909
 if they clarify something if this continues towards 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.680
 go ahead and if you continue forward 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.939
 that clarify it a little more than it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.700
 make more effort to clarify it because 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.099
 really the presentation of the new 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.989
 xbox has left a little to be desired in 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.090
 certain aspects and this has been one of 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.609
 them so well nothing more kids 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.090
 this we can have the next video 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.090
 until next time
