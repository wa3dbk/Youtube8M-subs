00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
with the whole multiplayer XP bug what

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.949 
with the whole multiplayer XP bug what
William<00:04:18.560> pixie<00:04:18.980> did<00:04:19.190> was<00:04:19.660> take<00:04:20.660> that

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
William pixie did was take that

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.360 
William pixie did was take that
and<00:04:23.360> make<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.539> so<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.020> can't<00:04:25.350> reset<00:04:25.740> at

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
and make it so that you can't reset at

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.960 
and make it so that you can't reset at
7am<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.539> you<00:04:27.630> can<00:04:27.870> only<00:04:28.280> reset<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.400> time<00:04:29.639> at

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
7am so you can only reset the time at

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.589 
7am so you can only reset the time at
the<00:04:30.090> ends<00:04:30.509> between<00:04:31.039> 6pm<00:04:32.039> and<00:04:32.190> 6am<00:04:32.759> so<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:35.610> kind

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
the ends between 6pm and 6am so it kind
