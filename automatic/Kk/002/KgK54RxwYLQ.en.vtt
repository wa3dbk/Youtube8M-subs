00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
we create those increase max came back

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.969 
we create those increase max came back
after<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.390> sack<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:08.930> lately<00:01:09.170> second

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
winning them had with that so our ground

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.580

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.540 
close to making that switch over last
year<00:02:59.209> was<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> game<00:02:59.780> that<00:03:00.110> made<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.100> switch<00:03:01.340> it

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
year was a game that made the switch it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.190 
year was a game that made the switch it
could<00:03:02.150> be<00:03:02.240> that<00:03:02.360> same<00:03:02.570> way<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.840> year<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:02.990> don't

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
could be that same way this year I don't

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.990 
could be that same way this year I don't
know<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.770> he<00:03:03.920> gonna<00:03:04.070> put<00:03:04.520> your<00:03:04.640> finger<00:03:04.880> on<00:03:04.940> it

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
what that'll be well I think you just

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.530 
what that'll be well I think you just
have<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.610> mentality<00:03:07.880> coming<00:03:08.450> on

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
have to have that mentality coming on

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.630 
have to have that mentality coming on
over<00:03:08.570> we<00:03:08.840> can<00:03:08.959> practice<00:03:09.430> you're<00:03:10.430> not

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
over we can practice you're not

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.930 
over we can practice you're not
accepting<00:03:11.560> mediocrity<00:03:12.560> coming<00:03:13.430> out<00:03:13.550> knowing

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
accepting mediocrity coming out knowing

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.800 
accepting mediocrity coming out knowing
that<00:03:14.120> you're<00:03:14.390> 11<00:03:14.660> team<00:03:14.840> down<00:03:15.050> then

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that you're 11 team down then

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.770 
that you're 11 team down then
okay<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:16.680> i<00:03:16.890> think<00:03:17.400> it's<00:03:17.760> not<00:03:18.000> such<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> practice

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
okay so i think it's not such a practice

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.620 
okay so i think it's not such a practice
