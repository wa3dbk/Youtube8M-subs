roll and I purposely left the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.750 
roll and I purposely left the
syncopation<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:51.830> was<00:00:51.949> like<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.100> shorty<00:00:52.489> in<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.610> few

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
syncopation I was like a shorty in a few

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.910 
syncopation I was like a shorty in a few
seconds<00:00:53.089> well<00:00:53.600> let's<00:00:53.780> look<00:00:53.900> at<00:00:54.049> this<00:00:54.229> this

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
multiples of four we're going to want

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.259 
multiples of four we're going to want
instead<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.839> just<00:00:59.930> playing<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:04.790> making<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.210> a

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.820 
lot of great stuff together they got all
the<00:02:20.090> notes<00:02:20.300> down<00:02:20.570> but<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.440> sounds<00:02:21.680> kind

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the notes down but it just sounds kind

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.590 
the notes down but it just sounds kind
of<00:02:22.040> white<00:02:22.610> bread<00:02:22.790> they<00:02:23.000> don't<00:02:23.180> really<00:02:23.450> have

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
of white bread they don't really have

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.740 
of white bread they don't really have
too<00:02:23.840> much<00:02:24.020> in<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.320> way<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.880> any<00:02:25.880> syncopation

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
too much in the way of any syncopation

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.450 
too much in the way of any syncopation
and<00:02:26.990> it's<00:02:27.140> like<00:02:27.290> listen<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.710> a<00:02:27.740> school<00:02:28.130> drummer

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
and it's like listen to a school drummer

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.810 
and it's like listen to a school drummer
trying<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.240> play<00:02:29.420> Gene<00:02:29.690> Krupa<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:31.520> hear

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
trying to play Gene Krupa and you hear

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.130 
trying to play Gene Krupa and you hear
them<00:02:32.300> playing<00:02:32.540> sing<00:02:32.840> sing<00:02:33.080> sing<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:38.140> you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
them playing sing sing sing and so you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.310 
them playing sing sing sing and so you
don't<00:02:39.500> hear<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.800> same<00:02:40.600> accentuation<00:02:41.600> or<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
don't hear the same accentuation or the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.720 
don't hear the same accentuation or the
syncopation<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:43.220> going<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.430> show<00:02:43.490> you<00:02:43.520> how<00:02:43.670> to

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
syncopation I'm going to show you how to

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.060 
syncopation I'm going to show you how to
do<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:43.970> syncopation<00:02:44.570> now<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.410> if<00:02:45.710> you've<00:02:45.890> got

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
do that syncopation now so if you've got

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.920 
do that syncopation now so if you've got
that<00:02:46.190> forward<00:02:46.520> roll<00:02:46.700> down<00:02:46.940> let's<00:02:47.360> analyze<00:02:47.900> it

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
that forward roll down let's analyze it

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:56.140 
that forward roll down let's analyze it
here<00:02:48.350> we're<00:02:48.980> going<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.130> look<00:02:49.310> at<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:54.970> if<00:02:55.970> I've

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
here we're going to look at this if I've

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.730 
here we're going to look at this if I've
got<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.600> same<00:02:56.930> roll<00:02:57.200> we're<00:02:57.350> doing<00:02:57.530> with<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
got that same roll we're doing with the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.820 
got that same roll we're doing with the
action<00:02:58.040> notes<00:03:01.210> I'm<00:03:02.210> sorry<00:03:02.720> one<00:03:02.990> two<00:03:03.350> very

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830

gives me what I need as far as the
duration<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:24.330> for<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.570> syncopation<00:03:24.960> what

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
duration but for the syncopation what

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.390 
duration but for the syncopation what
I'm<00:03:25.350> going<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.560> do<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.800> I'm<00:03:25.890> going<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.100> cut<00:03:26.250> that

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
I'm going to do is I'm going to cut that

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.790 
I'm going to do is I'm going to cut that
in<00:03:26.580> half<00:03:26.630> half<00:03:27.630> speed<00:03:27.960> so<00:03:28.260> instead<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.530> playing

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
in half half speed so instead of playing

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.970 
in half half speed so instead of playing
a<00:03:28.950> forward<00:03:29.280> roll<00:03:30.380> I'm<00:03:31.380> gonna<00:03:31.560> slow<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:31.860> down

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
a forward roll I'm gonna slow it down

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.020 
a forward roll I'm gonna slow it down
like<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:35.160> half<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.520> speed<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.910> I'm

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
like this to half the speed and I'm

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.370 
like this to half the speed and I'm
gonna<00:03:36.180> make<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.480> backward<00:03:36.840> roll<00:03:37.020> instead<00:03:37.260> of

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
gonna make it a backward roll instead of

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:58.240 
gonna make it a backward roll instead of
a<00:03:37.470> forward<00:03:37.740> roll

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.190 

I<00:03:58.310> only<00:03:58.640> have<00:03:58.820> an<00:03:58.940> accent<00:03:59.480> just<00:03:59.780> those<00:03:59.960> notes

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
I only have an accent just those notes

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.690 
I only have an accent just those notes
of<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.380> backward<00:04:00.710> roll<00:04:00.890> at<00:04:01.010> half<00:04:01.190> speed<00:04:01.370> all

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
of the backward roll at half speed all

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.520 
of the backward roll at half speed all
this<00:04:02.300> time<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.510> get<00:04:02.660> my<00:04:02.750> syncopation<00:04:03.320> I'll<00:04:03.440> show

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
this time I get my syncopation I'll show

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.510 
this time I get my syncopation I'll show
you<00:04:03.620> how<00:04:03.710> that<00:04:03.830> works<00:04:08.290> action<00:04:09.290> no<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:09.800> here

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
you how that works action no so here

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:25.800 
you how that works action no so here
comes<00:04:10.730> my<00:04:10.880> sick<00:04:11.180> patient

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.020 

so<00:04:26.290> instead<00:04:26.530> of<00:04:26.590> playing<00:04:26.950> this<00:04:27.100> this<00:04:27.760> beer

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
so instead of playing this this beer

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:37.710 
so instead of playing this this beer
bong<00:04:28.240> sort<00:04:28.600> of

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:58.800 

it's<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:38.780> little<00:04:38.960> bit<00:04:39.080> more<00:04:40.030> jumpy

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.010 

so<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.290> gets<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.650> little<00:04:59.740> bit<00:04:59.920> more
