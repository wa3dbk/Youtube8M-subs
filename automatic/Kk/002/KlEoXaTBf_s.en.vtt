America they've dealt with all of these

that<00:04:43.750> we<00:04:43.960> would<00:04:43.990> be<00:04:44.289> dealing<00:04:44.740> with<00:04:44.770> exactly

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
that we would be dealing with exactly

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.590 
that we would be dealing with exactly
the<00:04:45.340> same<00:04:45.520> issues<00:04:45.760> if<00:04:45.910> we<00:04:46.030> tried<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.300> mimic

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
the same issues if we tried to mimic

00:04:46.600 --> 00:05:00.999 
the same issues if we tried to mimic
their<00:04:46.930> industry
