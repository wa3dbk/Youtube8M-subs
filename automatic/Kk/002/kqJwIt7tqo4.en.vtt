tracted<00:00:00.539> would<00:00:00.690> probably<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> better<00:00:01.319> word<00:00:01.589> and

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
tracted would probably a better word and

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.889 
tracted would probably a better word and
it<00:00:02.820> looks<00:00:02.970> like<00:00:03.030> he's<00:00:03.210> coming<00:00:03.480> in<00:00:03.570> he's<00:00:03.659> on

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
it looks like he's coming in he's on

short<00:00:04.110> final<00:00:04.200> now<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.879> would<00:00:06.029> be

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
short final now this is this would be

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.360 
short final now this is this would be
the<00:00:06.210> moment<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.509> truth<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.170> don't<00:00:08.130> expect

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
the moment of truth and I don't expect

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.390 
the moment of truth and I don't expect
you're<00:00:08.580> going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.790> see<00:00:09.559> anything<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:10.920> but<00:00:11.099> uh

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
you're going to see anything here but uh

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.120 
you're going to see anything here but uh
you<00:00:11.969> know<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.120> little<00:00:12.540> bit<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.809> scraping<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.620> as

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
you know a little bit of scraping but as

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.730 
you know a little bit of scraping but as
he's<00:00:14.580> coming<00:00:14.759> down<00:00:15.089> here<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.960> key<00:00:16.320> here<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
he's coming down here the key here is

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
he's coming down here the key here is
he's<00:00:17.100> got<00:00:17.279> his<00:00:17.400> flaps<00:00:17.730> deployed<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.449> make<00:00:18.600> sure

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
he's got his flaps deployed to make sure

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.179 
he's got his flaps deployed to make sure
the<00:00:18.900> airplane<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.560> too<00:00:19.650> slow<00:00:19.980> as

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the airplane is going too slow as

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.679 
the airplane is going too slow as
possible<00:00:20.250> that's<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.300> he's<00:00:21.420> got<00:00:21.539> to

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
possible that's the thing he's got to

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.529 
possible that's the thing he's got to
keep<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.990> mind<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.529> he<00:00:22.590> comes<00:00:23.400> down<00:00:23.490> here<00:00:24.060> he'll

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
keep in mind as he comes down here he'll

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.800 
keep in mind as he comes down here he'll
land<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:25.109> those<00:00:25.320> main<00:00:26.119> wheels<00:00:27.119> right<00:00:27.630> around

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
land on those main wheels right around

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.390 
land on those main wheels right around
that<00:00:27.960> time<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.380> should<00:00:28.619> see<00:00:28.800> how<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> kill<00:00:29.160> both

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that time we should see how to kill both

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
that time we should see how to kill both
engines<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.060> tell<00:00:30.330> us<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.840> know<00:00:30.900> we've

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
engines and tell us here I know we've

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.630 
engines and tell us here I know we've
done<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> couple<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.800> these<00:00:31.890> who<00:00:32.250> watch<00:00:32.430> these

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
done a couple of these who watch these

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.889 
done a couple of these who watch these
landings<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.270> seems<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.780> not

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
landings but it seems like it's not

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.870 
landings but it seems like it's not
usually<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.590> mean<00:00:35.070> you've<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.280> propellers<00:00:35.760> on

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
usually I mean you've got propellers on

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
usually I mean you've got propellers on
this<00:00:36.030> thing<00:00:36.210> how<00:00:36.390> much<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.719> complicated

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
this thing how much is that complicated

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.869 
this thing how much is that complicated
to<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.739> those<00:00:37.950> how<00:00:38.100> close<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> look<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.760> those

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to have those how close to look at those

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.670 
to have those how close to look at those
get<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.239> hitting<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> ground<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.469> knows

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
get to hitting the ground if that knows

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.049 
get to hitting the ground if that knows
and<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> said<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.910> just

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and there you go like you said they just

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.240 
and there you go like you said they just
stopped<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.570> isn't<00:00:42.690> yeah<00:00:42.989> yep<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:44.010> does

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
stopped because isn't yeah yep it does

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.590 
stopped because isn't yeah yep it does
appear<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.760> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.090> food<00:00:45.239> they're<00:00:45.360> going

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
appear to be kind of food they're going

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.049 
appear to be kind of food they're going
eyes<00:00:46.039> shut<00:00:47.039> down<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> engine<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
eyes shut down the engine it's like you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.819 
eyes shut down the engine it's like you
through<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.590> would<00:00:49.710> have

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
through and just like we would have

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.400 
through and just like we would have
predicted<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.489> that's<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.840> wise<00:00:52.020> moves

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
predicted and that's that's a wise moves

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350 
predicted and that's that's a wise moves
he<00:00:52.620> glided<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.879> don't<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> cause

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
he glided in you don't want to cause

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.950 
he glided in you don't want to cause
additional<00:00:54.690> damage<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.960> propellers

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
additional damage to the the propellers

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.599 
additional damage to the the propellers
the<00:00:58.170> engine<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> engine<00:00:58.680> mounts<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> wings

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the engine the engine mounts the wings

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.240 
the engine the engine mounts the wings
okay<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.239> he's<00:01:00.390> gonna<00:01:00.539> glide<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> down

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
okay so here he's gonna glide it down

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
really got to the main part of the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
really got to the main part of the
runway<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.159> pretty<00:01:26.250> well

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
runway so that was that was pretty well

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.390 
runway so that was that was pretty well
done<00:01:26.549> I'd<00:01:27.000> say<00:01:27.210> well<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.710> amazing<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.220> watch

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
done I'd say well it's amazing to watch

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.160 
done I'd say well it's amazing to watch
these<00:01:29.610> things<00:01:29.880> often<00:01:30.090> times<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.049> know

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
these things often times and you know
