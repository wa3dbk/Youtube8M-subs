00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 so welcome back to a wide of 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.770
 league of legends I'm back on the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.270
 pc is you today the new skin 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.269
 for satriani before and namely mountain 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.280
 cavalry will be released soon 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.089
 the live server is a skin that one 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.139
 if you get on the Russian 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.510
 server transfers like me 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.369
 have seen 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.990
 to the passive fund but has now 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.609
 not much changed when we women 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.150
 Now we'll get a red bow 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 around us 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.810
 but if we kill permafrosts now 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.699
 maybe you have already seen this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.529
 we do with one likes when the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.800
 my son attacks him on the opponent 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.989
 head 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.670
 that looks very cool and so that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.129
 families with peter forestry then trigger 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.950
 explode was naturally quite cool 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.329
 they actually made it cool 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.640
 on a hero this unfortunately come to him 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.160
 Not on it I realized so come 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.520
 only on cancer our batch of arctic 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.989
 Sea salt looks like this from Saxony 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.180
 forward and during the impact we do 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.670
 such a small explosion 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.489
 I think I'm cool. I show 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.870
 Now sometimes the flames of the back 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.609
 quite cool makes such an impact 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.420
 at the car tech and then comes one 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.820
 flames wall are quite cool, but the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.290
 minen com on the on the opponent 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.600
 Heroes are great, then of course you have them 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.350
 still smiling , which immediately ripped 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.900
 use it 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:24.970
 it looks very cool, I think 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:26.830
 our charcoal makes itself otherwise 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.509
 has been at the space yes real amount 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.450
 I think she is a super class 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.280
 I do not like it very much 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.920
 this explosion will fit super co2 too 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.140
 this big ship is empty for now 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.610

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.470
