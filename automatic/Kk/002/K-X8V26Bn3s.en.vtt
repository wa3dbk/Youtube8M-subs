00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.510
 sptv's mobile newsroom will showcase today's projects 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.600
 for a very important traffic corridor to the south 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.800
 paulo to the corridor the fall of luiz carlos berrini of so many people take 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.800
 the whole region is gone 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.380
 will even have an underpass planned to be built let 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 talk now with reporter ana brito live 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.340
 to vote these projects will be implemented soon as it is predicted 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.200
 nothing serious 3 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.330
 they are in fact we already have date for the implantation of a corridor of 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.640
 buses here at berrini that it should start to be deployed already in the year that 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.880
 it will be more necessary to adjust the rates that we would make than in this 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.720
 now we have here bus corridor on a bus to get naked 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.930
 formed a large line behind 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.890
 the others still do not exist a specific date and depends on bidding 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.160
 are valued inclusive today the moderate ptv roundtrip traveled here 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.350
 the berrini region happens to merchants as well 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 bus passengers are very anxious for the implementation of the corridor 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.190
 exclusive bus 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.190
 buses and cars that follow the same track 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.270
 the buses are forced to divert 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.680
 When traffic is loaded, car drivers and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.990
 collective transportation 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.679
 get stuck right away 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:35.680
 the congestion 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.180
 theodore scheremeta de deus 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.180
 living longer would actually be earlier service 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.290
 looking at the networks 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.370
 works for the implementation of 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.490
 everything was exclusive of a bus on the avenue engineer luís carlos berrini 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.659
 should start at the beginning of next year the track that is next to the flowerbed 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.490
 central 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.100
 will be reserved for public transport, berrini corridor will have 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249
 three kilometers long 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.499
 denying the corridor abd the avenue chucri zaidan and it is well that in me until the street 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.289
 funchal 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.099
 the other vehicles will have only 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.079
 three lanes for circulation 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.600
 after much disturbance 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.559
 Look, I think it's going to ruin some of this load drop. 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:21.229
 For those who walk by bus, we work in the streets. 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:25.319
 of printed of the republic a little né after being dominated container 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.319
 Equal but 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.080
 in traffic engineering and transportation, public fig. 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.639
 corridor is a good alternative I got a great deal, huh? 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.219
 The point here is that only the bm corridor will not quickly solve the problem. 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:39.779
 problem 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.499
 you have to bring the corridor of folia lama that loyal not jucelino inclusive 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:47.699
 interconnecting with Avenida Santo Amaro so that people coming from various 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.849
 regions of the city I can access this region of são paulo now I recommend 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.919
 the city hall that in the mirror is already able to implement the competitor already 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.239
 ex-runner in a month 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.769
 the bus corridor company is not so complicated will mess up a bit 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.630
 the traffic because of the more 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.040
 improve the conditions of public transport if you incorporate other suggestions 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.729
 How are you, the ones you just heard are worth it? 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:14.009
 now the other projects of the city hall provides the most complex exemption region 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.049
 that is in test of the extension of the avenue chucri zaidan that the 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.349
 continuation of berrini 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.970
 prolongation of Sufis still passing through the neighborhood expropriations Ana Brito 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.969
 but information about this project 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.239
 this project is undoubtedly Maria will not give much work because more than 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.970
 fear to prolong this life 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.660
 action of the other side medical home trade so even it is enough 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.990
 daring soon you will hear us prepare an animation for 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.899
 better understand what the estimated cost for this project means is 320 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:50.569
 million jean real adding there also a bridge and next part boer marques 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.209
 but the prefecture anticipated that it does not intend to make large expropriations 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.029
 to put these works in progress to expand this avenue 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.650
 I think they already hayden that ends up in the morumbi mall 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.860
 will be extended by three kilometers of 400 meters until the avenue joão days 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.289
 in santo amaro 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:18.289
 in the initial stretch the avenue will have four lanes on each side after April 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.729
 tunnel, the project also foresees the construction of 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.309
 a new bridge over the pine river in the burle marx park area and 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.570
 prolongation of the roberto marinho avenue 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.710
 until the highway of the immigrants that also will have a duration more part 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.710
 of the surface a project that comes 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.080
 an extraordinary social environment for the city because it will transfer almost 10 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.889
 thousand families living in slums 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.069
 for adequate housing units built 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.099
 urban overcoming resource that will also gather from the region 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.530
 this is all part of the large urban water-strewn operation and this tunnel is 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.780
 two storey 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.360
 precisely to avoid expropriating large areas and there will be semedo 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.180
 determinants of certain houses and buildings plus a name there will be 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.260
 need to make a demolition the most expensive work of 2 billion and 200 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.130
 million reais is the work to extend the table with a renault until 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.850
 the immigrants' highway because there will also be a 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.330
 linear sand park housing construction is little necklaces mariani 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.099
 the mobile writing process travels cities of the great são paulo the districts of the capital 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.129
 to show the news where it happens 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.189
