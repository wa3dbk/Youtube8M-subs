00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
should have happened is it will draw out

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.250 
should have happened is it will draw out
anything<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:10.000> was<00:05:10.120> in<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.480> spot<00:05:10.780> without

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
anything that was in the spot without

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.920 
anything that was in the spot without
kind<00:05:12.160> of<00:05:12.310> breaking<00:05:12.820> your<00:05:12.970> face<00:05:13.150> at<00:05:13.420> all<00:05:13.630> it's

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
kind of breaking your face at all it's

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.930 
kind of breaking your face at all it's
like<00:05:14.200> magic<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.950> don't<00:05:15.130> know<00:05:15.220> how<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.550> happens

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
like magic I don't know how it happens

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.480 
like magic I don't know how it happens
but<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.570> heat<00:05:16.780> just<00:05:16.990> brings<00:05:17.380> anything<00:05:18.040> out<00:05:18.250> of

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
but the heat just brings anything out of

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.040 
but the heat just brings anything out of
the<00:05:18.610> spot<00:05:18.880> that<00:05:19.060> there<00:05:19.180> is<00:05:19.330> to<00:05:19.480> bring<00:05:19.690> out<00:05:19.840> and

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
the spot that there is to bring out and

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.440 
the spot that there is to bring out and
the<00:05:20.590> spot<00:05:20.890> kind<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.280> just<00:05:21.460> tends<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:21.820> then<00:05:22.120> dry

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
the spot kind of just tends to then dry

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.060 
the spot kind of just tends to then dry
up<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:22.870> by<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.140> next<00:05:23.320> morning<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.950> will<00:05:24.010> be

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
up and by the next morning it will be

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.840 
up and by the next morning it will be
gone<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:24.730> don't<00:05:25.240> pick<00:05:25.600> spots<00:05:26.020> do<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.490> the

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
gone so don't pick spots do that and the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.910 
gone so don't pick spots do that and the
last<00:05:28.030> thing<00:05:28.300> I'd<00:05:28.450> say<00:05:28.780> I'm<00:05:29.290> probably<00:05:29.560> gonna

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
last thing I'd say I'm probably gonna

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.920 
last thing I'd say I'm probably gonna
think<00:05:30.220> of<00:05:30.340> some<00:05:30.550> more<00:05:30.580> tips<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.360> tricks<00:05:31.540> and

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
think of some more tips and tricks and

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.920 
think of some more tips and tricks and
stuff<00:05:32.170> which<00:05:32.890> really<00:05:33.160> annoy<00:05:33.880> me<00:05:34.120> but<00:05:34.330> I<00:05:34.540> will

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
stuff which really annoy me but I will

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.510 
stuff which really annoy me but I will
put<00:05:35.200> them<00:05:35.350> in<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.500> description<00:05:35.710> box<00:05:36.220> if<00:05:36.430> I

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
put them in the description box if I

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.400 
put them in the description box if I
think<00:05:36.580> of<00:05:36.760> any<00:05:36.910> more<00:05:37.150> but<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.780> last<00:05:37.960> thing<00:05:38.200> I

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
think of any more but the last thing I

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.310 
think of any more but the last thing I
will<00:05:38.590> say<00:05:38.620> is<00:05:39.100> your<00:05:39.610> skin<00:05:40.110> particularly<00:05:41.110> if

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
will say is your skin particularly if

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.560 
will say is your skin particularly if
you're<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.530> girl<00:05:41.800> will<00:05:42.400> change<00:05:42.850> through<00:05:43.450> the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
you're a girl will change through the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.020 
you're a girl will change through the
month<00:05:43.780> naturally<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:44.950> try<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.580> anticipate

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
month naturally so try to anticipate

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.900 
month naturally so try to anticipate
that<00:05:46.510> I<00:05:46.720> think<00:05:47.260> it's<00:05:47.590> on<00:05:47.950> the<00:05:48.040> fourth<00:05:48.310> week<00:05:48.610> of

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
that I think it's on the fourth week of

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.970 
that I think it's on the fourth week of
the<00:05:49.180> cycle<00:05:49.600> that<00:05:49.630> you<00:05:49.960> get<00:05:50.140> really<00:05:50.410> spotty<00:05:50.770> and

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
the cycle that you get really spotty and

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.730 
the cycle that you get really spotty and
oily<00:05:51.370> so<00:05:51.850> just<00:05:52.210> anticipate<00:05:52.870> that<00:05:53.050> don't<00:05:53.410> fall

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
oily so just anticipate that don't fall

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.310 
oily so just anticipate that don't fall
into<00:05:54.040> the<00:05:54.130> trap<00:05:54.430> of<00:05:54.640> thinking<00:05:54.750> that<00:05:55.750> certain

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
into the trap of thinking that certain

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.630 
into the trap of thinking that certain
products<00:05:56.620> are<00:05:56.770> working<00:05:57.100> for<00:05:57.340> you<00:05:57.460> when

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
products are working for you when

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.700 
products are working for you when
they're<00:05:57.790> not<00:05:58.000> try<00:05:58.600> and<00:05:58.660> give<00:05:58.960> a<00:05:59.170> product<00:05:59.410> a

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
they're not try and give a product a

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.980 
they're not try and give a product a
month<00:06:00.040> to<00:06:01.000> see<00:06:01.180> if<00:06:01.300> it's<00:06:01.450> really<00:06:01.600> making<00:06:01.840> a

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
month to see if it's really making a

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.140 
month to see if it's really making a
difference<00:06:02.020> because<00:06:02.740> around<00:06:03.550> the<00:06:03.700> kind<00:06:04.000> of

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
difference because around the kind of

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.180 
difference because around the kind of
second<00:06:04.600> and<00:06:04.720> third<00:06:04.810> week<00:06:05.260> of<00:06:05.440> your<00:06:05.590> cycle<00:06:06.010> your

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
second and third week of your cycle your

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.190 
second and third week of your cycle your
skin<00:06:06.460> naturally<00:06:07.000> gets<00:06:07.210> very<00:06:07.480> clear<00:06:07.900> and

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
skin naturally gets very clear and

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.250 
skin naturally gets very clear and
bright<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.370> lovely<00:06:09.700> so<00:06:10.420> if<00:06:10.720> you're<00:06:10.840> using<00:06:11.080> a

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
bright and lovely so if you're using a

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.930 
bright and lovely so if you're using a
product<00:06:11.530> around<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:11.980> time<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.610> you<00:06:12.700> think

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
product around that time and you think

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.370 
product around that time and you think
it's<00:06:13.060> making<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.390> huge<00:06:13.570> difference<00:06:13.840> it's

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
it's making a huge difference it's

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.320 
it's making a huge difference it's
actually<00:06:14.710> just<00:06:14.920> your<00:06:15.010> hormones<00:06:15.220> clearing<00:06:16.210> up

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
actually just your hormones clearing up

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.900 
actually just your hormones clearing up
your<00:06:16.480> skin<00:06:16.690> for<00:06:16.930> you<00:06:17.170> so<00:06:17.440> if<00:06:17.830> you<00:06:18.610> think<00:06:18.760> a

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
your skin for you so if you think a

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.700 
your skin for you so if you think a
product<00:06:19.210> is<00:06:19.360> doing<00:06:19.600> really<00:06:19.750> well<00:06:19.960> around<00:06:20.320> that

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
product is doing really well around that

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.710 
product is doing really well around that
kind<00:06:21.100> of<00:06:21.160> time<00:06:21.400> I'd<00:06:21.700> leave<00:06:22.000> it<00:06:22.030> another<00:06:22.420> week

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
kind of time I'd leave it another week

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.620 
kind of time I'd leave it another week
or<00:06:22.870> two<00:06:23.220> to<00:06:24.220> see<00:06:24.370> if<00:06:24.490> it's<00:06:24.640> still<00:06:24.850> making<00:06:25.120> a<00:06:25.450> big

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
or two to see if it's still making a big

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.810 
or two to see if it's still making a big
difference<00:06:25.780> then<00:06:26.500> so<00:06:26.920> I<00:06:26.950> hope<00:06:27.220> this<00:06:27.400> helped

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
difference then so I hope this helped
