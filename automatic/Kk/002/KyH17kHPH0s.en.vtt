opened up to check the frame I held the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.940 
opened up to check the frame I held the
frame<00:04:57.500> up<00:04:57.770> B<00:04:58.340> started<00:04:58.880> coming<00:04:59.150> to<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.919> so<00:05:00.919> I

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
frame up B started coming to it so I

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.629 
frame up B started coming to it so I
held<00:05:01.250> it<00:05:01.400> up<00:05:01.520> in<00:05:01.639> front<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.000> hive<00:05:02.180> here<00:05:02.540> and

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
held it up in front of the hive here and

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.700 
held it up in front of the hive here and
loaded<00:05:04.639> it<00:05:04.789> in<00:05:05.479> just<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.780> matter<00:05:06.050> of<00:05:06.169> seconds

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
loaded it in just a matter of seconds

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.550 
loaded it in just a matter of seconds
and<00:05:07.090> stuck<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.210> back<00:05:08.240> in<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.960> now<00:05:09.850> see<00:05:11.560> direct

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
and stuck it back in and now see direct

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.630 
and stuck it back in and now see direct
entrance<00:05:13.190> they<00:05:13.669> are<00:05:13.880> fanning

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
entrance they are fanning

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.470 
entrance they are fanning
so<00:05:17.530> they're<00:05:18.530> starting<00:05:19.100> to<00:05:19.160> drawl<00:05:19.640> over<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.360> the

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
so they're starting to drawl over to the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.580 
so they're starting to drawl over to the
hive<00:05:20.660> now<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:21.980> that's<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.700> good<00:05:22.850> thing<00:05:23.590> just

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
hive now so that's a good thing just

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.410 
hive now so that's a good thing just
hope<00:05:24.830> I<00:05:24.950> got<00:05:25.130> some<00:05:25.340> eggs<00:05:25.610> in<00:05:25.820> there<00:05:26.000> so<00:05:26.300> they

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
hope I got some eggs in there so they

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.660 
hope I got some eggs in there so they
can<00:05:26.570> make<00:05:26.720> it<00:05:26.840> clean<00:05:27.790> otherwise<00:05:28.790> I<00:05:30.520> guess<00:05:31.520> I'll

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
can make it clean otherwise I guess I'll

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:39.120 
can make it clean otherwise I guess I'll
have<00:05:31.760> to<00:05:31.790> buy<00:05:32.030> one

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.850 

I<00:05:39.160> also<00:05:39.430> opened<00:05:39.820> up<00:05:40.120> my<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.510> little<00:05:41.200> bit<00:05:41.560> because

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
I also opened up my a little bit because

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.470 
I also opened up my a little bit because
