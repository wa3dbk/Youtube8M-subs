 surprises and I make you between true 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.190
 these next few times full by eugenes has 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.320
 left line for the driving valence 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.240
 in addition to the world the sauce recipe 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.869
 from wire to hinds it will take 4 to 5 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.660
 spoons of sugar mayonnaise a little 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.509
 salt and chives as well as 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.080
 parsley part I have about 2 spoons to 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.899
 coffee on the plate a teaspoon 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.360
 already their targets and a teaspoon 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:28.420
 of four archers is also a 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.630
 teaspoon of chopped gherkins and 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.940
 a half lemon so the recipe is not 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.920
 simpler is to put everything 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.430
 together and mix so I'm going 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.030
 start with a little bit of salt for 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.590
 to raise the mayonnaise 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.530

 then recalls for the sugar that is 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.820
 a little french here 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.040

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.730
 tip of lemon mom 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.420

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.410
 finished with the four and you stay longer 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.410

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.030

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.940
 seasoning and for my part I can 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.430
