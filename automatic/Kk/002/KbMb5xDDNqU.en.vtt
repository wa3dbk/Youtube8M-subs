for him you'll remember some of his

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.369 
for him you'll remember some of his
moves<00:00:44.010> from<00:00:44.160> marvel<00:00:44.460> vs<00:00:44.730> capcom<00:00:44.760> 2<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.870> before

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.459 
one that I think really opens up some
new<00:00:49.350> possibilities<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:49.950> him<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.239> again

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.760 

he's<00:01:12.180> able<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> combo<00:01:12.810> into<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> web<00:01:13.229> ball<00:01:13.409> or

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
he's able to combo into the web ball or

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.240 
he's able to combo into the web ball or
a<00:01:14.210> web<00:01:15.210> swing<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> air<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.040> what's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
a web swing in the air but what's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.539 
a web swing in the air but what's
interesting<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.000> web<00:01:18.150> swing<00:01:19.369> you<00:01:20.369> see

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
interesting about the web swing you see

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.980 
interesting about the web swing you see
there<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> little<00:01:21.240> taste<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.840> can

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
there just a little taste you can

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
there just a little taste you can
actually<00:01:22.140> combo<00:01:22.710> again<00:01:22.830> after<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> web<00:01:23.580> swing

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
actually combo again after the web swing

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.429 
actually combo again after the web swing
so<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.240> combo<00:01:24.830> into<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.040> web<00:01:26.159> swing<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
so you can combo into the web swing and

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
so you can combo into the web swing and
out<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> web<00:01:28.829> swing<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.579> think

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
out of the web swing which I think

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
out of the web swing which I think
really<00:01:30.090> adds<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.570> lot<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> his<00:01:31.079> arsenal<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> as

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
really adds a lot to his arsenal and as

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.260 
really adds a lot to his arsenal and as
it<00:01:32.220> allows<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> keep<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> pressure

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it allows you to keep a lot of pressure

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.120 
it allows you to keep a lot of pressure
on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> ground<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.170> air<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.860> well<00:01:35.040> as

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
on the ground or in the air as well as

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
on the ground or in the air as well as
setting<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.430> some<00:01:35.579> interesting<00:01:35.729> resets<00:01:36.240> he

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
setting up some interesting resets he

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620 
setting up some interesting resets he
doesn't<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> dash<00:01:38.030> exactly<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.390> his<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
doesn't have a dash exactly that's his a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.560 
doesn't have a dash exactly that's his a
air<00:01:40.049> dash<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:41.250> what<00:01:41.700> he<00:01:41.759> does<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.210> or<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
air dash but what he does have or to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.030 
air dash but what he does have or to
meet<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> them<00:01:43.079> an<00:01:43.140> eight-way<00:01:43.439> air<00:01:43.590> dash<00:01:43.770> but

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
meet of them an eight-way air dash but

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.010 
meet of them an eight-way air dash but
he's<00:01:44.130> got<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.399> new<00:01:44.579> move<00:01:44.840> which<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
he's got this new move which is a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
he's got this new move which is a
directional<00:01:46.560> web<00:01:46.740> grab<00:01:46.979> which<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.670> shoot

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
directional web grab which you can shoot
