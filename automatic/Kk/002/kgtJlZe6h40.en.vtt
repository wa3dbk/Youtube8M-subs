the benchmark performance of the device

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.720 
the benchmark performance of the device
you<00:00:41.930> can<00:00:42.050> see<00:00:42.290> from<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.860> link<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:43.220> description

you can see from the link in description
below<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:44.840> seeing<00:00:45.740> its<00:00:45.980> benchmark<00:00:46.240> we<00:00:47.240> have

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
below but seeing its benchmark we have

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.540 
below but seeing its benchmark we have
been<00:00:47.710> quite<00:00:48.710> impressed<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.170> while<00:00:51.170> gaming

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
been quite impressed but while gaming

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.420 
been quite impressed but while gaming
it's<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:53.660> fit<00:00:53.990> I<00:00:54.260> mean<00:00:54.410> this<00:00:55.070> few<00:00:55.540> fear<00:00:56.540> stops

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
it's the fit I mean this few fear stops

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:51.110 
it's the fit I mean this few fear stops
you<00:00:58.430> will<00:00:58.580> see<00:00:59.540> it<00:00:59.600> yourself

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.000 

the<00:01:51.780> fish<00:01:52.050> dog<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.590> almost<00:01:53.430> negligible<00:01:54.410> but

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.950 

sometimes<00:01:59.090> it's<00:02:00.090> good<00:02:00.300> annoying<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:02.960> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
sometimes it's good annoying and this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.029 
sometimes it's good annoying and this
frequent<00:02:04.470> these<00:02:04.980> drops<00:02:05.370> sometimes

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:23.580 

so<00:02:11.039> now<00:02:11.520> let's<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:16.940> difficult

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.949 

we<00:02:24.099> are<00:02:24.370> running<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.849> trigger<00:02:25.180> 2<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
we are running the trigger 2 on the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.210 
we are running the trigger 2 on the
highest<00:02:26.410> setting<00:02:31.379> in<00:02:32.379> this<00:02:32.560> game<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.860> can<00:02:33.129> you

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
highest setting in this game you can you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.740 
highest setting in this game you can you
see<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.550> yourself<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.629> lagging<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.170> bit<00:02:35.580> so

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
see it yourself it's lagging a bit so

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.020 
see it yourself it's lagging a bit so
gaming<00:02:37.750> performance<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.470> device<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
gaming performance of the device in the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:03:34.190 
gaming performance of the device in the
trigger<00:02:40.239> 2<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.959> quite<00:02:41.230> poor

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.119 

so<00:03:34.830> as<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.129> saw<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.550> game<00:03:36.000> lag<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.959> bit<00:03:37.129> but

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
so as you saw the game lag a bit but

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.150 
so as you saw the game lag a bit but
it's<00:03:38.819> playable<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:40.410> now<00:03:40.530> let's<00:03:40.709> switch<00:03:40.890> onto

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
it's playable so now let's switch onto

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.130 
it's playable so now let's switch onto

the gaming performance on the assocn 45
is<00:04:07.739> good<00:04:07.910> but<00:04:08.910> sometimes<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:10.500> may<00:04:10.680> lose<00:04:10.860> your
