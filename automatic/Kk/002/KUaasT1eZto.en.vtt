00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.660
 will be all the boys those fifa et al 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.210
 gaming today introduces new video in a row 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.550
 13 teams the teams and in this video I will make you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.820
 see a new episode of skud 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 builder and hide in fact I will make you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 see a couple of teams that were me 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.080
 been requested in past episodes e 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.449
 then I immediately start the program 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.949
 closed and was ted maybe in a more video 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.150
 next I will explain to you the usefulness of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.590
 this site 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.410
 but let's start immediately with the first team 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.440
 which is a series of 30 thousand credits and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300
 where with the goalkeeper we have marchetti that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.579
 will open mine is one of the most goalkeepers 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.770
 get paid for the last team on fifa 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.710
 and then we have a goblin defense 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.050
 shrimp and as armero abbot fullbacks 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.440
 which are excellent full-backs a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.770
 midfield we have guarino and nocerino 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.860
 and then as coca we have micro and zarate 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.350
 and as an attack we have the Saharawi e 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 muriel who are a great match 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.500
 in short, and above all, even drugs that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 you can use as for beats punishment 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.420
 the cost on the 30 thousand critics will be 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.159
 discussed variations from xbox and ps3 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.590
 in my opinion for what it's worth is 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.540
 a great team then I leave immediately 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.439
 that other team that is a Brazilian 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.430
 from at least 50 thousand goalkeeper credits 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.759
 we have helton 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.740
 the only regret that in Brazil is not there 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.680
 there are so many goalkeepers that you can choose 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:36.119
 but the only three alternatives are elton 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.409
 diego alves and júlio césar the others 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.810
 let's say I'm a fan page let's say 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.030
 oh well then in defense we have luis of the e 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.159
 santana especially lewitz chebanca 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.360
 very much but also santana and ideas not 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.070
 I'm outdone 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.159
 then we have ramires and paolini and the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.799
 ramires midfield with 88 speed 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.979
 will definitely take any raul ball 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.500
 wine and rafinha with 88 speed transits 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.689
 it's also a great dribble and then how 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.930
 co that we have carlos eduardo that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.790
 you will see in speed statistics 83 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.310
 but for 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.590
 it's much faster and then there's a claim 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.710
 really that looks like a land torpedo 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.990
 air and then we have in attack elite one 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.360
 love and above all editor that is 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.810
 highly paid both from the last film and in 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.960
 this therefore costs 50 thousand credits 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.520
 excellent team then we leave immediately with 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.400
 the other team but 300 Spanish 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.870
 350 thousand credits where as a goalkeeper 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.470
 we have valdes 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.140
 in defense we have epic ramos like 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.959
 ramos I recommend a puyol alternative 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.950
 though a bit though a bit slow though 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.260
 in short, it takes us where we say that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.300
 let's go and choose the players where we are 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.540
 they bring the credits in short 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.140
 then we have the like fullbacks alba and juan 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.620
 as a midfield we have cazorla 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.450
 than five-star of foot of foot 4 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.560
 skill stars that do great 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.450
 midfielder then we have fabregas 90 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.550
 passing is also a good shot from 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.950
 distance and can also recover 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.440
 some balls and then we have silva a 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.340
 great dribbling passages including shooting 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.970
 left and then as a trident we have 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.890
 pedro torres and navas pedro above all 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.400
 also very strong for what it's worth 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.310
 in short, it is worth only 2,000 2,500 credits and 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.160
 at five foot stars and even four 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.989
 skill stars and then we torres uno 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.040
 of my favorite forwards 13 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.380
 and jesús navas with 92 speed then 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.600
 so let's get right to the last one 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.370
 team that is a bundesliga of 200,000 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.180
 we have credits where we have air 87 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.750
 in defense we have 79 boateng and santana 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.269
 then as fullbacks we have alaba blades one 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.220
 good defense palermi to me but above all 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.269
 also a wonderful midfield with 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.410
 woods and shawn heins tiger woods con 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.880
 the only regret perhaps could be 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.120
 sweinsteiger with a speed of 62 but vi 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.919
 I assure you that 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.889
 it's fabulous when you approve doesn't count 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.340
 so much his speed but on defense and shooting 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.490
 really phenomenal and then as an attack 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.740
 we have royce with 90 of speed 84 of 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.490
 I really shoot the player a lot 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.380
 wet and then as pure attackers 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.150
 we have lewandowski and ex line 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.130
 especially s line is very strong 75 90 of 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.199
 speed at 70 of shooting but also a good one 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.110
 physical ds hold balls also enough 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.590
 high so you can make a few goals of 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.440
 in short, therefore, that's all 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.690
 guys showed a couple of teams 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.060
