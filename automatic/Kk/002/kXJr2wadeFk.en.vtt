00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
think it could be awesome i think could

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.260 
think it could be awesome i think could
be<00:03:25.620> keep<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.980> career<00:03:26.280> most<00:03:26.430> fresh<00:03:26.790> because

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
be keep the career most fresh because

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.760 
be keep the career most fresh because
there's<00:03:27.570> always<00:03:27.750> new<00:03:28.080> players<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.650> were
