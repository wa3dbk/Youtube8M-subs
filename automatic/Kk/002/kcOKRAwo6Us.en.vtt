whole<00:00:24.250> lightness<00:00:24.700> comes<00:00:25.030> from<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:25.330> eggs<00:00:25.510> it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
whole lightness comes from the eggs it

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.260 
whole lightness comes from the eggs it
is<00:00:26.170> also<00:00:26.710> delicious<00:00:27.039> because<00:00:27.699> it<00:00:27.850> has<00:00:27.970> butter

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
is also delicious because it has butter

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.570 
is also delicious because it has butter
and<00:00:28.539> I<00:00:28.900> like<00:00:29.140> using<00:00:29.380> beurre<00:00:29.830> noisette<00:00:30.100> which

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
and I like using beurre noisette which

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.720 
and I like using beurre noisette which
is<00:00:30.730> really<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.270> way<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.110> make<00:00:32.410> butter<00:00:33.070> more<00:00:33.430> rich

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
is really a way to make butter more rich

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.259 
is really a way to make butter more rich
and<00:00:33.969> get<00:00:34.239> rid<00:00:34.420> of<00:00:34.449> the<00:00:34.659> milk<00:00:34.870> solids<00:00:35.170> in<00:00:35.530> it

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
and get rid of the milk solids in it

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.419 
and get rid of the milk solids in it
you're<00:00:37.269> making<00:00:37.569> clarified<00:00:38.109> butter<00:00:38.429> but

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
you're making clarified butter but

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.189 
you're making clarified butter but
bringing<00:00:39.699> it<00:00:39.819> to<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.030> point<00:00:40.329> where<00:00:40.690> it<00:00:40.899> turns

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
bringing it to the point where it turns

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.299 
bringing it to the point where it turns
nutty<00:00:41.710> Brown<00:00:42.069> was<00:00:42.399> that<00:00:42.609> as<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.789> hazelnut<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:45.190> we

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
nutty Brown was that as a hazelnut so we

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.180 
nutty Brown was that as a hazelnut so we
start<00:00:45.609> melting<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.120> butter<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.920> never<00:00:47.920> leave

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
start melting the butter and never leave

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.169 
start melting the butter and never leave
when<00:00:48.460> you're<00:00:48.579> doing<00:00:48.819> beurre<00:00:48.940> noisette

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
when you're doing beurre noisette

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.969 
when you're doing beurre noisette
because<00:00:49.749> the<00:00:49.899> minute<00:00:50.199> you<00:00:50.229> hear<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:50.710> stop

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
because the minute you hear it stop

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.529 
because the minute you hear it stop
bubbling<00:00:51.519> that's<00:00:51.699> when<00:00:51.909> all<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.059> water<00:00:52.389> is

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
bubbling that's when all the water is

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.169 
bubbling that's when all the water is
evaporated<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.499> starts<00:00:53.889> turning<00:00:54.100> brown<00:00:54.489> you

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
evaporated it starts turning brown you

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.360 
evaporated it starts turning brown you
think<00:00:55.359> it's<00:00:55.479> never<00:00:55.659> going<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:55.929> get<00:00:56.079> there<00:00:56.379> but

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
think it's never going to get there but

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.610 
think it's never going to get there but
once<00:00:57.879> it<00:00:58.089> goes<00:00:58.269> it<00:00:58.510> goes<00:00:58.659> so<00:00:58.929> fast<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.559> we

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
once it goes it goes so fast and we

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.379 
once it goes it goes so fast and we
don't<00:00:59.799> want<00:00:59.949> burned<00:01:00.429> butter<00:01:00.729> we<00:01:00.909> want<00:01:01.030> brown

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:01.389 
don't want burned butter we want brown

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.590 
don't want burned butter we want brown
butter<00:01:01.719> I<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:03.579> someone<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.210> back<00:01:04.390> burner

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
butter I have someone the back burner

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.940 
butter I have someone the back burner
here<00:01:05.019> that's<00:01:05.260> just<00:01:05.350> at<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.829> right

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
here that's just at the right

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.279 
here that's just at the right
temperature<00:01:06.579> or<00:01:07.509> rather<00:01:07.659> just<00:01:07.960> at<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:08.170> right

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
temperature or rather just at the right

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.420 
temperature or rather just at the right
color<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:11.320> straining<00:01:11.829> it<00:01:11.920> now<00:01:12.039> if<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.219> did

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
color and I'm straining it now if I did

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.370 
color and I'm straining it now if I did
not<00:01:12.520> have<00:01:12.759> this<00:01:12.939> fine<00:01:13.240> strainer<00:01:13.659> I<00:01:13.960> would<00:01:14.140> use

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
not have this fine strainer I would use

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.929 
not have this fine strainer I would use
cheesecloth<00:01:14.770> because<00:01:15.340> otherwise<00:01:15.610> these

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
cheesecloth because otherwise these

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.849 
cheesecloth because otherwise these
little<00:01:16.180> dark<00:01:16.390> particles<00:01:16.719> will<00:01:17.409> come<00:01:17.619> right

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
little dark particles will come right

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.700 
little dark particles will come right
through<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.810> way<00:01:20.049> they're<00:01:20.259> left<00:01:20.469> in<00:01:20.590> the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
through but this way they're left in the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.950 
through but this way they're left in the
strainer<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:22.060> couldn't<00:01:22.299> use<00:01:22.420> them<00:01:22.659> for

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
strainer and you couldn't use them for

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.209 
strainer and you couldn't use them for
bread<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.380> can<00:01:23.530> use<00:01:23.590> them<00:01:23.859> for<00:01:24.009> mashed

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
bread you can use them for mashed

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.099 
bread you can use them for mashed
potatoes<00:01:24.729> they're<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> great<00:01:25.270> addition<00:01:25.450> but

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
potatoes they're a great addition but

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.959 
potatoes they're a great addition but
not<00:01:26.289> for<00:01:26.469> the<00:01:26.560> gin<00:01:26.740> was<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:30.340> mixture<00:01:30.939> should

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
not for the gin was this mixture should

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.910 
not for the gin was this mixture should
be<00:01:31.179> kept<00:01:31.479> warm<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.469> when<00:01:32.590> you're<00:01:32.710> ready

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
be kept warm so that when you're ready

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.889 
be kept warm so that when you're ready
to<00:01:33.100> add<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.579> batter<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.270> incorporates

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
to add the batter to it incorporates

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.929 
to add the batter to it incorporates
more<00:01:35.109> easily<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:35.979> can<00:01:36.159> just<00:01:36.340> set<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.520> here

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
more easily so you can just set it here

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.999 
more easily so you can just set it here
at<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.119> hot<00:01:37.299> burner<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:37.990> will<00:01:38.079> it<00:01:38.679> will<00:01:38.799> stay

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
at a hot burner and it will it will stay

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.090 
at a hot burner and it will it will stay
for<00:01:39.219> warm<00:01:39.429> enough<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.630> next<00:01:40.960> step<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.950> heat

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
for warm enough the next step is to heat

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.550 
for warm enough the next step is to heat

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
temperature control if you have the eggs

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.520 
temperature control if you have the eggs
warm<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:49.570> adding<00:01:49.810> sugar<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.380> eggs

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.069 
warm and I'm adding sugar to the eggs
too<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:50.950> protect<00:01:51.369> them<00:01:51.579> when<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.539> eggs<00:01:52.689> are

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
too to protect them when the eggs are

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.230 
too to protect them when the eggs are
actually<00:01:53.710> feeling<00:01:53.950> almost<00:01:54.340> hot<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.119> touch

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
actually feeling almost hot to the touch

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.149 
actually feeling almost hot to the touch
they<00:01:55.749> will<00:01:55.899> beat<00:01:56.079> up<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.590> such<00:01:56.859> a<00:01:56.890> higher

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
they will beat up to such a higher

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.330 
they will beat up to such a higher
volume<00:01:57.429> you'd<00:01:58.179> be<00:01:58.359> amazed<00:01:58.719> so<00:01:59.619> I<00:01:59.649> put<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.100> bowl

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
volume you'd be amazed so I put the bowl

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.679 
volume you'd be amazed so I put the bowl
over<00:02:00.729> simmering<00:02:01.359> water<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:03.270> every<00:02:04.270> once<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.600> a

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
while so that I don't make scrambled

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.469 
while so that I don't make scrambled
eggs<00:02:06.520> which<00:02:06.819> would<00:02:06.999> probably<00:02:07.359> be<00:02:07.450> very

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
eggs which would probably be very

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.660 
eggs which would probably be very
delicious<00:02:08.080> because<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.830> show

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670

don't throw them out if that happens to

finger in the mixture to make sure that
it's<00:02:23.410> gonna<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.740> warm<00:02:23.980> enough<00:02:27.600> I'm<00:02:28.600> now<00:02:28.990> at<00:02:29.170> the

it's gonna be warm enough I'm now at the
perfect<00:02:29.530> temperature<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.370> start<00:02:30.610> beating<00:02:31.020> and

perfect temperature to start beating and
here's<00:02:34.000> where<00:02:34.240> I<00:02:34.270> want<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.570> use<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.840> whisk

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
here's where I want to use the whisk

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.200 
here's where I want to use the whisk
beater<00:02:35.350> because<00:02:36.340> we're<00:02:36.520> getting<00:02:36.730> as<00:02:36.850> much<00:02:37.000> air

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
beater because we're getting as much air

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.210 
beater because we're getting as much air
as<00:02:37.300> we<00:02:37.600> can<00:02:37.840> into<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.320> mixture<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:41.740> gradually

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
as we can into this mixture so gradually

as we can into this mixture so gradually
I'm<00:02:42.310> working<00:02:42.640> at<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:42.850> mixer<00:02:43.300> up<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
I'm working at this mixer up to the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.250 
I'm working at this mixer up to the
highest<00:02:44.650> speed<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.480> while<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:46.870> beating

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
highest speed and while this is beating

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.530 
highest speed and while this is beating
I'm<00:02:47.980> going<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.460> start<00:02:48.700> preparing<00:02:48.820> my<00:02:49.270> flour

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
I'm going to start preparing my flour

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.790 
I'm going to start preparing my flour
and<00:02:49.660> cornstarch<00:02:50.020> mixture<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:56.350> needs<00:02:56.620> to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
and cornstarch mixture this needs to

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.890 
and cornstarch mixture this needs to
beat<00:02:56.980> for<00:02:57.310> about<00:02:57.490> five<00:02:57.790> minutes<00:02:58.060> during<00:02:58.660> which

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
beat for about five minutes during which

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.900 
beat for about five minutes during which
time<00:02:59.140> it'll<00:02:59.320> be<00:02:59.380> so<00:02:59.620> light<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.070> airy<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
time it'll be so light and airy that it

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.480 
time it'll be so light and airy that it
will<00:03:01.000> turn<00:03:01.180> practically<00:03:01.750> white<00:03:02.070> now<00:03:03.070> I'm<00:03:03.280> guys

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
will turn practically white now I'm guys

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.000 
will turn practically white now I'm guys
it's<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.360> cornstarch<00:03:04.960> and<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.830> cake

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
it's if the cornstarch and the cake

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.980 
it's if the cornstarch and the cake
flour<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.700> that's<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.270> secret<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.810> making

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
flour and that's the secret to making

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.690 
flour and that's the secret to making
the<00:03:08.230> lightest<00:03:08.680> possible<00:03:08.920> Jen<00:03:09.400> was<00:03:09.610> a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
the lightest possible Jen was a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.100 
the lightest possible Jen was a
combination<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.790> cake<00:03:13.120> flour<00:03:13.300> which<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:13.810> soft

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
combination of cake flour which is soft

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.070 
combination of cake flour which is soft
and<00:03:14.500> cornstarch<00:03:15.190> which<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.150> even<00:03:16.420> softer<00:03:16.690> and

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
and cornstarch which is even softer and

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.059 
and cornstarch which is even softer and
has<00:03:17.200> much<00:03:17.470> less<00:03:17.709> protein

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.130 

and<00:03:22.610> it's<00:03:22.730> going<00:03:22.879> to<00:03:22.939> be<00:03:23.060> sifted<00:03:23.510> together<00:03:23.870> to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
and it's going to be sifted together to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.559 
and it's going to be sifted together to
make<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.439> really<00:03:24.769> light<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.370> then<00:03:26.030> sit<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.510> the

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
make it really light and then sit to the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.390 
make it really light and then sit to the
second<00:03:27.049> time<00:03:27.260> when<00:03:27.680> I'm<00:03:27.799> adding<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.159> to<00:03:28.280> the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
second time when I'm adding it to the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.929 
second time when I'm adding it to the
mixture<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.299> sits<00:03:29.829> like<00:03:30.829> down<00:03:31.280> on<00:03:31.670> top

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
mixture so that it sits like down on top

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.649 
mixture so that it sits like down on top
of<00:03:32.150> those<00:03:32.329> eggs<00:03:32.780> until<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.530> incorporate<00:03:34.189> it

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
of those eggs until I incorporate it

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.420 
of those eggs until I incorporate it
now<00:03:35.659> I've<00:03:35.840> sifted<00:03:36.079> all<00:03:36.409> the<00:03:36.590> flowers<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.189> last

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
now I've sifted all the flowers the last

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.949 
now I've sifted all the flowers the last
little<00:03:37.640> bit<00:03:37.849> that's<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.269> sifter<00:03:38.659> I<00:03:38.689> can

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
little bit that's in the sifter I can

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.729 
little bit that's in the sifter I can
tap<00:03:39.200> through<00:03:41.049> because<00:03:42.049> I'll<00:03:42.170> be<00:03:42.290> using<00:03:42.319> it

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
tap through because I'll be using it

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:43.449 
tap through because I'll be using it
again

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
again

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.220 
again
so<00:03:43.640> all<00:03:43.849> this<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.239> flower<00:03:44.480> will<00:03:44.780> ultimately

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
so all this the flower will ultimately

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.970 
so all this the flower will ultimately
get<00:03:45.470> into<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.859> cake<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:47.599> now<00:03:48.349> I'm<00:03:48.530> going<00:03:48.859> over

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
get into the cake and now I'm going over

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.280 
get into the cake and now I'm going over
to<00:03:49.159> prepare<00:03:49.639> the<00:03:49.819> pan<00:03:50.060> because<00:03:50.810> once<00:03:51.079> the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
to prepare the pan because once the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.410 
to prepare the pan because once the
batter<00:03:51.500> is<00:03:51.709> mixed<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.219> has<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.489> go<00:03:52.579> right<00:03:52.819> in<00:03:53.030> or

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
batter is mixed it has to go right in or

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.129 
batter is mixed it has to go right in or
it<00:03:53.510> starts<00:03:53.750> deflating<00:03:55.659> grease<00:03:56.659> the<00:03:56.900> pan<00:03:57.109> with

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
it starts deflating grease the pan with

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.440 
it starts deflating grease the pan with
a<00:03:57.379> little<00:03:57.560> bit<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.680> shortening<00:03:58.099> to<00:03:59.030> keep<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.329> in

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450

place<00:04:02.530> set<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.650> parchment<00:04:04.250> in<00:04:04.639> and<00:04:05.090> spray<00:04:05.900> it

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
place set the parchment in and spray it

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.030 
place set the parchment in and spray it
or<00:04:07.180> flour<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.450> with<00:04:08.629> grease<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.139> flour<00:04:09.439> and

or flour it with grease and flour and

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.399 
or flour it with grease and flour and
only<00:04:10.790> use<00:04:10.909> it<00:04:10.939> spray<00:04:11.389> if<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.659> contains<00:04:12.019> flour

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
only use it spray if it contains flour

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.899 
only use it spray if it contains flour
because<00:04:12.919> that's<00:04:13.129> what<00:04:13.310> gives<00:04:13.459> you<00:04:13.579> a<00:04:13.609> really

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
because that's what gives you a really

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.099 
because that's what gives you a really
nice<00:04:14.090> edge<00:04:14.419> on<00:04:14.659> this<00:04:14.810> Jen<00:04:14.989> was<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:16.900> always<00:04:17.900> rub

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
nice edge on this Jen was I always rub

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.940 
nice edge on this Jen was I always rub
off<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.500> top

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.700 

okay<00:04:22.520> I'm<00:04:22.730> now<00:04:22.940> ready<00:04:23.240> check<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.080> batter

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.189 

and<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.669> can<00:04:30.850> see<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.330> pale<00:04:31.600> yellow<00:04:31.990> it's

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
and you can see it so pale yellow it's

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.340 
and you can see it so pale yellow it's
almost<00:04:32.470> white<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:36.430> can<00:04:36.639> see<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.940> consistency

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
almost white you can see the consistency

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.200 
almost white you can see the consistency
it's<00:04:38.350> not<00:04:38.650> quite<00:04:38.949> at<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.310> peak<00:04:39.550> but<00:04:39.580> it's<00:04:39.910> full

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
it's not quite at a peak but it's full

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.779 
it's not quite at a peak but it's full
of<00:04:40.419> air<00:04:40.570> bubbles<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:41.199> drops<00:04:41.889> thickly<00:04:42.340> from

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
of air bubbles and drops thickly from

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.770 
of air bubbles and drops thickly from
the<00:04:42.940> beater<00:04:44.729> now<00:04:45.729> is<00:04:45.940> not<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.120> time<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.479> walk

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
the beater now is not the time to walk

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.120 
the beater now is not the time to walk
away<00:04:46.990> from<00:04:47.289> it<00:04:48.630> but<00:04:49.630> always<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.350> deflates<00:04:50.770> when

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
away from it but always it deflates when

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.340 
away from it but always it deflates when
you're<00:04:51.250> incorporating<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:51.970> flour<00:04:52.270> into<00:04:52.750> the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
you're incorporating the flour into the

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.680 
you're incorporating the flour into the
egg<00:04:53.560> mixture<00:04:53.729> so<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:55.210> prevent<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.660> from

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
egg mixture so to prevent it from

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.279 
egg mixture so to prevent it from
deflating<00:04:56.380> as<00:04:56.680> much<00:04:57.130> as<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.400> might<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:58.139> take<00:04:59.139> my

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
deflating as much as it might I take my

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.219 
deflating as much as it might I take my
warm<00:04:59.560> butter<00:05:01.289> and<00:05:02.289> I<00:05:02.410> sacrifice<00:05:03.660> but<00:05:04.660> a<00:05:04.690> scant

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
warm butter and I sacrifice but a scant

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.110 
warm butter and I sacrifice but a scant
cup<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:06.160> mixture<00:05:06.520> I'm<00:05:06.699> going<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.940> whisk

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
cup of this mixture I'm going to whisk

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.909 
cup of this mixture I'm going to whisk
it<00:05:07.330> into<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.660> butter<00:05:07.840> because<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.349> putting

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
it into the butter because the putting

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.770 
it into the butter because the putting
the<00:05:08.979> butter<00:05:09.160> in<00:05:09.340> separately<00:05:09.759> it<00:05:10.270> might<00:05:10.509> mix

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
the butter in separately it might mix

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.719 
the butter in separately it might mix
with<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.080> flour<00:05:11.349> and<00:05:11.680> form<00:05:11.979> little<00:05:12.280> pellets

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
with the flour and form little pellets

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.490 
with the flour and form little pellets
sometimes<00:05:13.389> you<00:05:13.479> find<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.840> at<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.080> bottom<00:05:14.229> of

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
sometimes you find it at the bottom of

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.980 
sometimes you find it at the bottom of
it<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.650> perfectly<00:05:15.130> mixed<00:05:15.340> Jen<00:05:16.030> was<00:05:16.240> I've<00:05:16.690> just

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
it and perfectly mixed Jen was I've just

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.629 
it and perfectly mixed Jen was I've just
swirled<00:05:17.229> in<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.470> little<00:05:17.680> vanilla<00:05:17.949> and<00:05:18.430> when

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
swirled in a little vanilla and when

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.939 
swirled in a little vanilla and when
this<00:05:18.759> is<00:05:18.910> hot<00:05:19.210> it's<00:05:19.660> much<00:05:19.900> easier<00:05:20.349> to<00:05:20.680> get<00:05:20.800> the

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
this is hot it's much easier to get the

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.390 
this is hot it's much easier to get the
batter<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.340> incorporate<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.840> I'm<00:05:22.900> taking

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
batter to incorporate so I'm taking

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:31.830 
batter to incorporate so I'm taking
scant<00:05:24.400> cup<00:05:24.699> just<00:05:25.570> by<00:05:25.750> eye<00:05:30.300> now<00:05:31.300> you'll<00:05:31.479> see<00:05:31.690> how

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
scant cup just by eye now you'll see how

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.710 
scant cup just by eye now you'll see how
this<00:05:32.020> batter<00:05:32.349> is<00:05:32.590> going<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.860> deflate

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
this batter is going to deflate

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.670 
this batter is going to deflate
significantly<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.960> don't<00:05:35.409> care<00:05:35.590> about

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
significantly I don't care about

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.710 
significantly I don't care about
deflating<00:05:36.340> this<00:05:36.580> part<00:05:36.880> it's<00:05:37.060> small<00:05:37.419> amount<00:05:37.659> to

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
deflating this part it's small amount to

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.080 
deflating this part it's small amount to
sacrifice<00:05:38.320> to<00:05:38.500> keep<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.800> rest<00:05:39.010> of<00:05:39.220> it<00:05:39.340> with

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
sacrifice to keep the rest of it with

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.189 
sacrifice to keep the rest of it with
maximum<00:05:40.630> volume<00:05:41.159> and<00:05:42.690> now<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:43.720> can<00:05:43.960> start

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
maximum volume and now I can start

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.930 
maximum volume and now I can start
adding<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.590> flour<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:45.039> cornstarch<00:05:45.310> mixture

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
adding the flour and cornstarch mixture

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.820 
adding the flour and cornstarch mixture
and<00:05:46.240> in<00:05:46.479> order<00:05:46.750> for<00:05:46.780> it<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:47.020> incorporate<00:05:47.590> well

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
and in order for it to incorporate well

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.159 
and in order for it to incorporate well
I'm<00:05:48.070> sifting<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.849> a<00:05:48.909> second<00:05:49.360> time<00:05:51.960> half<00:05:52.960> at<00:05:53.110> a

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
I'm sifting it a second time half at a

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.810 
I'm sifting it a second time half at a
time<00:05:54.539> I'm<00:05:55.539> sifting<00:05:55.780> it<00:05:55.960> right<00:05:56.229> on<00:05:56.470> top<00:05:56.770> of<00:05:57.490> the

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
time I'm sifting it right on top of the

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.320 
time I'm sifting it right on top of the
batter<00:05:59.550> and<00:06:00.550> then<00:06:00.669> I<00:06:00.729> want<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.000> start<00:06:01.180> mixing

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
batter and then I want to start mixing

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.240 
batter and then I want to start mixing
it<00:06:01.659> in<00:06:01.810> but<00:06:02.199> I'm<00:06:02.440> not<00:06:02.710> going<00:06:02.919> to<00:06:02.979> use<00:06:03.070> the

it in but I'm not going to use the

the<00:06:06.009> best<00:06:06.190> way<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.550> mix<00:06:06.820> two<00:06:07.300> together<00:06:07.750> two

the best way to mix two together two
different<00:06:08.440> mixtures<00:06:09.039> of<00:06:09.070> two<00:06:09.250> different

when I add this batter to the other
batter<00:07:23.210> look<00:07:23.720> at<00:07:23.840> the<00:07:23.930> difference<00:07:24.260> in<00:07:24.380> the
