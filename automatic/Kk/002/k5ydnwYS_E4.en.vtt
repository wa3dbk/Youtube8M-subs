00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the Ember caves just go over there I

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
the Ember caves just go over there I
waited<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:46.829> probably<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:48.090> 10<00:00:48.390> minutes<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
waited about probably about 10 minutes I

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.119 
waited about probably about 10 minutes I
think<00:00:48.809> before<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.260> spawned<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
think before it's spawned in what I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.470 
think before it's spawned in what I
think<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> happen<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> think<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> waits

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
think has to happen is I think it waits

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
think has to happen is I think it waits
until<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> number<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.710> players<00:00:52.920> in
