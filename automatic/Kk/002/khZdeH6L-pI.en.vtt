especially<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.630> locked<00:01:15.930> up<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.259> clay

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
especially when it's locked up in clay

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.280 
especially when it's locked up in clay
because<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.090> floods<00:01:18.360> again<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:18.990> it's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
because if it floods again and it's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.540 
because if it floods again and it's
locked<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.800> clay<00:01:19.979> there's<00:01:20.220> less<00:01:20.520> chance

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
locked up in clay there's less chance

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.710 
locked up in clay there's less chance
that<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.149> going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> come<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.659> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that it's going to come out of that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
that it's going to come out of that
pocket<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.100> bare<00:01:23.310> bedrock<00:01:23.790> with

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
pocket if it's just bare bedrock with

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.980 
pocket if it's just bare bedrock with
some<00:01:24.149> gravel<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
some gravel on it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
some gravel on it
odds<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> next<00:01:25.950> flood<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.399> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
odds are the next flood is going to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
odds are the next flood is going to
carry<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.789> piece<00:01:27.030> away<00:01:27.289> so<00:01:28.289> when<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.979> got

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
carry that piece away so when you got

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
locked when you got clay in there

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
locked when you got clay in there
