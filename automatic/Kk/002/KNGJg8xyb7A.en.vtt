thousand ways tutorial in this video
I'll<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.220> showing<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.789> guys<00:00:17.970> how<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.330> create<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
I'll be showing you guys how to create a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.010 
I'll be showing you guys how to create a
cube<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.680> Illustrator<00:00:20.420> using<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.630> 3d

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
cube here in Illustrator using the 3d

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.980 
cube here in Illustrator using the 3d
effect<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.680> extrude<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.490> bevel<00:00:23.600> now<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
effect of extrude and bevel now this is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.830 
effect of extrude and bevel now this is
very<00:00:25.230> easy<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.859> do<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.789> only<00:00:27.060> downfall<00:00:27.330> with

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
very easy to do the only downfall with

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.689 
very easy to do the only downfall with
this<00:00:28.019> technique<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> fact<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.519> can

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
this technique is the fact that you can

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.930 
this technique is the fact that you can
only<00:00:29.880> apply<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.689> color<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.890> cube<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
only apply one color to your cube the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.060 
only apply one color to your cube the
reason<00:00:33.329> why<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.140> technically<00:00:34.710> it's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
reason why that is is technically it's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670 
reason why that is is technically it's
only<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.670> shape<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.380> path

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
only one shape as you can see my path

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.670 
only one shape as you can see my path
here<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.370> only<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.910> square<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
here it's only one square here the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.130 
here it's only one square here the
reason<00:00:41.040> why<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.989> an

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
reason why that is is because it's an

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.010 
reason why that is is because it's an
illusion<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:44.460> give<00:00:44.700> off<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.300> feeling<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.960> if

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
illusion we give off the feeling as if

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.250 
illusion we give off the feeling as if
it's<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.800> 3d<00:00:47.250> object<00:00:47.489> when<00:00:48.420> technically<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it's a 3d object when technically is a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.369 
it's a 3d object when technically is a
2d<00:00:49.739> square<00:00:50.180> now<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.420> those<00:00:51.570> who<00:00:51.750> already<00:00:51.809> know

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
2d square now for those who already know

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.680 
2d square now for those who already know
how<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> apply<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.160> effect<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.360> really

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
how to apply this effect you really

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.200 
how to apply this effect you really
