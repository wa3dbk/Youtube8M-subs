dr. steffanson the studies seem to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
dr. steffanson the studies seem to
suggest<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.199> starting<00:00:28.710> smoking<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.369> your

suggest that starting smoking or your

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.820 
suggest that starting smoking or your
addiction<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.179> smoking<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.689> driven<00:00:31.320> very<00:00:31.710> much

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
addiction to smoking is driven very much

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.040 
addiction to smoking is driven very much
by<00:00:32.009> your<00:00:32.369> genetic<00:00:32.850> makeup<00:00:33.059> how<00:00:33.420> surprised<00:00:33.840> are

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
by your genetic makeup how surprised are

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.520 
by your genetic makeup how surprised are
you<00:00:34.260> by<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> findings<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.520> report

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
you by the findings of this report

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.709 
you by the findings of this report
actually<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> smoke<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.239> cannot

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
actually if you if you smoke you cannot

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.770 
actually if you if you smoke you cannot
blame<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.649> your<00:00:40.950> genes<00:00:41.250> because<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
blame that on your genes because the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
blame that on your genes because the
genetic<00:00:43.260> predisposition<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.309> becoming

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
genetic predisposition to becoming

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
genetic predisposition to becoming
hooked<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.510> cigarettes<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> same<00:00:49.710> as

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
hooked on cigarettes is not the same as

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.130 
hooked on cigarettes is not the same as
genetic<00:00:50.430> predisposition<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> beginning<00:00:51.870> to

genetic predisposition to beginning to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.130 
genetic predisposition to beginning to
smoke<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.190> actually<00:00:53.699> there's<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.449> variant

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
smoke and actually there's this variant

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
smoke and actually there's this variant
in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> sequence<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> genome<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.730> we

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
in the sequence of the genome that we

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.599 
in the sequence of the genome that we
discovered<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:58.260> makes<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> lot<00:00:59.340> more

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
discovered it makes you a lot more

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.389 
discovered it makes you a lot more
likely<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.300> smell<00:01:00.660> smoke<00:01:01.050> many<00:01:01.680> secrets<00:01:02.250> if

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
likely to smell smoke many secrets if

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.149 
likely to smell smoke many secrets if
you<00:01:02.550> smoke<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.140> has<00:01:04.290> no<00:01:04.500> impact<00:01:04.949> on

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you smoke at all but it has no impact on

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.969 
you smoke at all but it has no impact on
whether<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.700> start<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> smoke<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
whether you start to smoke or not so the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.280 
whether you start to smoke or not so the
smoking<00:01:08.490> initiation<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.630> your

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
smoking initiation is your

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.830 
smoking initiation is your
responsibility<00:01:13.520> yeah<00:01:14.520> whatever<00:01:15.509> happened<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
responsibility yeah whatever happened to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.660 
responsibility yeah whatever happened to
nicotine<00:01:16.200> addiction<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.830> because<00:01:17.100> we've

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
nicotine addiction then because we've

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
nicotine addiction then because we've
been<00:01:17.820> told<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.180> along<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> tobacco<00:01:18.900> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
been told all along that tobacco is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.719 
been told all along that tobacco is
highly<00:01:19.500> addictive<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> problem

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
highly addictive and that's the problem

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.649 
highly addictive and that's the problem
yeah<00:01:22.280> addiction<00:01:23.280> Howard<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.939> did<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> become

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
yeah addiction Howard if did you become

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.090 
yeah addiction Howard if did you become
is<00:01:25.490> influenced<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:26.580> genetics<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
is influenced by genetics so so if you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
is influenced by genetics so so if you
begin<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.670> smoke<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> mutation

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
begin to smoke and you have the mutation

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.319 
begin to smoke and you have the mutation
or<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> sequence<00:01:32.159> Valiente<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.210> is

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
or the sequence Valiente that it is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.690 
or the sequence Valiente that it is
covered<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.720> will<00:01:34.049> smoke<00:01:34.290> more<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
covered you will smoke more and if you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
covered you will smoke more and if you
have<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.150> variant<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.290> more

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
have this variant it's going to be more

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.090 
have this variant it's going to be more
difficult<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> stop<00:01:39.030> smoking<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
difficult for you to stop smoking and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
difficult for you to stop smoking and
and<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.460> very<00:01:41.759> interesting<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and what is very interesting about this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530 
and what is very interesting about this
also<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.880> about<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.329> in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
also is that if you think about this in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.230 
also is that if you think about this in
the<00:01:45.570> context<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.409> smoking<00:01:47.399> related<00:01:47.430> diseases

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the context of smoking related diseases

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.050 
the context of smoking related diseases
like<00:01:48.630> lung<00:01:48.930> cancer<00:01:49.500> an<00:01:50.189> overwhelming

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
like lung cancer an overwhelming

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120 
like lung cancer an overwhelming
majority<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.659> those<00:01:51.990> who<00:01:52.200> develop<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.799> lung

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
majority of those who develop like lung

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.510 
majority of those who develop like lung
cancer<00:01:53.670> are<00:01:54.079> long-term<00:01:55.079> smokers<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> looks

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
cancer are long-term smokers so it looks

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.459 
cancer are long-term smokers so it looks
like<00:01:56.610> lung<00:01:57.030> cancer<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.689> purely<00:01:58.170> environmental

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
like lung cancer is purely environmental

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.940 
like lung cancer is purely environmental
disease<00:01:59.219> however<00:02:00.149> our<00:02:00.689> study<00:02:01.110> shows<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
can become addicted so there is not you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.850 
can become addicted so there is not you
you're<00:02:50.600> not<00:02:50.780> going<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.050> get<00:02:51.170> an<00:02:51.350> absolution

you're not going to get an absolution

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.760 
you're not going to get an absolution
from<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.000> danger<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.540> tobacco<00:02:53.930> even<00:02:54.500> if<00:02:54.650> you

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
from the danger of tobacco even if you

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.040 
from the danger of tobacco even if you
have<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.400> genetic<00:02:55.970> background<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.630> makes<00:02:56.840> you

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
have a genetic background that makes you

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.260 
have a genetic background that makes you
less<00:02:57.230> likely<00:02:57.290> than<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.130> next<00:02:58.370> my<00:02:58.550> icing

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
less likely than the next my icing

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.720 
less likely than the next my icing
addicted<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.380> suppose<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.100> big<00:03:01.250> question<00:03:01.610> is

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
addicted I suppose the big question is

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.699 
addicted I suppose the big question is
can<00:03:02.209> this<00:03:02.360> research<00:03:02.720> be<00:03:02.959> used<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.350> help<00:03:03.530> people

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
can this research be used to help people

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.400 
can this research be used to help people
kick<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.220> habit<00:03:05.500> yeah<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:07.600> think<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.230> is

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
kick the habit yeah I think that it is

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.199 
kick the habit yeah I think that it is
theoretically<00:03:09.890> possible<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:10.760> it's<00:03:11.150> not

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
theoretically possible but it's not

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.720 
theoretically possible but it's not
going<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.630> happen<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.830> year<00:03:12.890> or<00:03:13.340> next<00:03:13.489> year

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
going to happen this year or next year

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.850 
going to happen this year or next year
it's<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.570> long-term<00:03:15.140> project<00:03:15.500> to

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
it's going to be a long-term project to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.699 
it's going to be a long-term project to
help<00:03:16.070> people<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.640> or<00:03:17.120> will<00:03:17.510> come<00:03:17.780> addiction

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
help people to or will come addiction

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.550 
help people to or will come addiction
like<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.250> but<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.209> think<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:20.780> think<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.140> first

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
like this but I think I think that first

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.930 
like this but I think I think that first
and<00:03:21.830> foremost<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:23.440> responsibility<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.620> yours

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
and foremost the responsibility is yours

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.509 
and foremost the responsibility is yours
unassisted<00:03:25.989> just<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.830> know<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.280> stay<00:03:28.489> away

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
unassisted just you know to stay away

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.420 
unassisted just you know to stay away
from<00:03:28.820> tobacco<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.840> one<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.950> concerns

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
from tobacco and I I one of the concerns

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.360 
from tobacco and I I one of the concerns
that<00:03:31.910> we<00:03:32.780> have<00:03:33.080> always<00:03:33.530> when<00:03:33.739> we<00:03:33.890> publish

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
that we have always when we publish

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.789 
that we have always when we publish
research<00:03:34.549> like<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.299> is<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:36.290> people<00:03:36.500> will

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
research like this is that people will

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.180 
research like this is that people will
use<00:03:37.130> them<00:03:37.820> as<00:03:37.970> an<00:03:38.090> excuse<00:03:38.540> for<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:39.470> behavior

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
use them as an excuse for a behavior

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.280 
use them as an excuse for a behavior
that<00:03:40.459> is<00:03:40.640> not<00:03:40.670> appropriate<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.600> in<00:03:41.750> my<00:03:41.959> mind

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
that is not appropriate and in my mind

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.289 
that is not appropriate and in my mind
smoking<00:03:42.950> cigarettes<00:03:43.430> is<00:03:43.610> not<00:03:43.640> an<00:03:43.970> appropriate
