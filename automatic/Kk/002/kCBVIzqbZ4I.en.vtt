board<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:50.590> foots<00:00:50.950> to<00:00:51.130> our<00:00:51.220> position<00:00:51.790> is<00:00:52.270> always

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
board my foots to our position is always

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.720 
board my foots to our position is always
one<00:00:54.850> arm<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.750> have<00:00:59.530> a<00:00:59.560> really<00:00:59.860> wide<00:01:00.340> stance

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
one arm and I have a really wide stance

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.590 
one arm and I have a really wide stance
because<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.780> like<00:01:01.990> to<00:01:02.350> keep<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.430> balance<00:01:03.610> and

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
because I like to keep the balance and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.620 
because I like to keep the balance and
keep<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.320> good<00:01:05.470> balance<00:01:05.530> on<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.070> board

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.929 

I<00:01:09.670> set<00:01:10.670> up<00:01:10.789> my<00:01:10.820> foot<00:01:11.270> straps<00:01:12.159> like<00:01:13.159> this<00:01:13.460> that

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
I set up my foot straps like this that

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.950 
I set up my foot straps like this that
they<00:01:16.939> are<00:01:17.030> really<00:01:17.299> narrow<00:01:17.899> here<00:01:18.610> really<00:01:19.610> tight

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
they are really narrow here really tight

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.039 
they are really narrow here really tight
but<00:01:20.960> I<00:01:21.200> still<00:01:21.740> have<00:01:22.210> been<00:01:23.210> pretty<00:01:23.450> loose<00:01:23.719> here

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
but I still have been pretty loose here

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.700 
but I still have been pretty loose here
so<00:01:24.289> case<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.429> have<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.640> wipeout<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.539> can<00:01:27.320> go

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
so case I have a wipeout I can go

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.950 
so case I have a wipeout I can go
quickly<00:01:28.130> out<00:01:28.399> of<00:01:28.429> the<00:01:28.700> foot<00:01:28.939> strap<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.780> have

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
quickly out of the foot strap but I have

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.649 
quickly out of the foot strap but I have
enough<00:01:30.319> grip<00:01:30.679> in<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.009> turns<00:01:31.360> that's<00:01:32.360> really

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
enough grip in the turns that's really

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.760 
enough grip in the turns that's really
important<00:01:33.110> for<00:01:33.140> me<00:01:34.450> my<00:01:35.450> fin<00:01:35.750> setting<00:01:36.319> is<00:01:36.500> made

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
important for me my fin setting is made

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.639 
important for me my fin setting is made
like<00:01:37.069> this<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:39.039> put<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.310> back<00:01:41.240> fence<00:01:41.590> more<00:01:42.590> or

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
like this I put the back fence more or

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.910 
like this I put the back fence more or
less<00:01:42.679> in<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.009> middle<00:01:43.429> and<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:45.140> front<00:01:45.500> fence

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
less in the middle and the front fence

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.740 
less in the middle and the front fence
really<00:01:46.729> far<00:01:47.000> back<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:49.640> distance<00:01:50.240> between<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
really far back the distance between the

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.039 
really far back the distance between the
fins<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.640> like<00:01:52.640> two<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.390> half<00:01:53.770> fingers

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
fins is like two and a half fingers

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.529 
fins is like two and a half fingers
that's<00:01:57.049> how<00:01:57.349> I<00:01:57.819> tested<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.939> board<00:01:59.179> and<00:01:59.420> it

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
that's how I tested the board and it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.919 
that's how I tested the board and it
works<00:01:59.780> really<00:01:59.990> good<00:02:00.259> for<00:02:00.500> me<00:02:00.679> if<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.610> want<00:02:01.819> to<00:02:01.929> go

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
works really good for me if I want to go

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:11.110 
works really good for me if I want to go
radical<00:02:06.759> basically<00:02:08.049> it's<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.789> quartos<00:02:10.789> liked

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
radical basically it's the quartos liked

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.440 
radical basically it's the quartos liked
Windsor<00:02:11.660> but<00:02:12.500> with<00:02:13.010> more<00:02:13.280> control<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:13.910> that's

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
Windsor but with more control and that's

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.840 
Windsor but with more control and that's
really<00:02:14.660> important<00:02:15.200> for<00:02:15.230> Red<00:02:15.560> Riding<00:02:15.859> because

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
really important for Red Riding because

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.330 
really important for Red Riding because
you<00:02:17.690> don't<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.350> shouldn't<00:02:18.680> think<00:02:18.859> about<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
you don't you shouldn't think about the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.670 
you don't you shouldn't think about the
board<00:02:19.609> you<00:02:19.819> should<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:20.299> about<00:02:21.290> yourself

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
board you should think about yourself

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.539 
board you should think about yourself
and<00:02:22.130> what<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.459> doing<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.910> waves<00:02:23.209> and

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
and what you doing in the waves and

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.210 
and what you doing in the waves and
that's<00:02:25.549> why<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.850> need<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.209> board<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:27.220> enough

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
that's why you need a board with enough

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.910 
that's why you need a board with enough
grip<00:02:28.639> enough<00:02:29.239> speed<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.810> Greek<00:02:30.200> control<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
grip enough speed and Greek control and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.229 
grip enough speed and Greek control and
this<00:02:31.760> board<00:02:32.090> combines<00:02:32.600> all<00:02:32.810> these<00:02:32.989> factors

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
this board combines all these factors

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.570 
this board combines all these factors
and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.030 
and
I<00:02:36.670> used<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.600> board<00:02:37.930> for<00:02:38.350> every<00:02:38.740> kind<00:02:38.890> of

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
I used this board for every kind of

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.140 
I used this board for every kind of
conditions<00:02:39.550> even<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:41.080> grave<00:02:41.350> surfing
