00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.990
 hello good we are here the sport is 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.390
 life and today we will continue to learn 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.949
 jump on the rope good if in fact if 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.869
 you still do not know how to jump rope 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.029
 I recommend that you go to my previous video 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.789
 of how to jump rope in three steps 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.730
 and then you can watch this video and follow 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.500
 learning more little things we will start with 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.910
 a coordination exercise what 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.670
 we will have to do is take the rope 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.320
 on one side and on the other open and jump 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.390
 apprentice and it can only be that it costs you 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.190
 a little but then eventually what 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.970
 you will have to do faster for 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:48.320
 do what 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:51.590
 2 12 if we jump side by side if 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.240
 we take one side to the other and we jump and 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.240
 we are adding quantity 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.640
 well this is the first exercise worth 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.980
 well once done this exercise 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.840
 Let's jump rope is easy if 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.840
 you already have the basic jump that is this 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.240
 It will cost us a lot to do other types of 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.560
 saints since it is the same basis for 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 all for example to one leg 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.830
 you can do it as well as from behind 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.490
 it does not matter 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.490
 here 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.530
 we can alternate legs like this 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.720
 we can go too 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.720
 we can also go forward back 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.200
 the base is the jump the wrist spin 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.050
 combined with the jump if you have this is 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.150
 the best coordination you can have 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.150
 we can also jump start 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.890
 we also do is keeping it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.890
 raising the knees 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.140
 a little bit more complicated 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.270
 well let's go with an exercise still a 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.030
 little bit more complicated than passing two 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.610
 times the strings this requires a 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.220
 good wrist speed apart from 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.820
 that the jump will have to be a tad more 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.470
 up or not so short but a 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.470
 little bit higher we go there 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.659
 well this has been all for today the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.260
 next video a little bit more and better 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:25.250
 ok but remember sports is life 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.250
 bye
