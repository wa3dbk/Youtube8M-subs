any sweetened yogurt and the reason why

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.430 
any sweetened yogurt and the reason why
is<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.780> sugar<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
is because it can have more sugar in it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.840
