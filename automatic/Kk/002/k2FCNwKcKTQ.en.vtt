00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
so I've pursues his general with my

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.930 
so I've pursues his general with my
dragoons<00:03:04.130> yet<00:03:05.130> dragoons<00:03:05.490> I'd<00:03:05.670> never<00:03:05.880> use

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
dragoons yet dragoons I'd never use

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.050 
dragoons yet dragoons I'd never use
dragoons<00:03:06.450> very<00:03:06.690> often<00:03:06.990> because<00:03:07.700> if<00:03:08.700> you'd

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
dragoons very often because if you'd

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.790 
dragoons very often because if you'd
think<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.630> they<00:03:09.750> wouldn't<00:03:10.050> need<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.320> form<00:03:10.620> up

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
think that they wouldn't need to form up

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.920 
think that they wouldn't need to form up
but<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.760> line<00:03:12.030> infantry<00:03:12.360> they<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.780> to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
but like line infantry they have to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.870 
but like line infantry they have to
actually<00:03:13.170> have<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> formation<00:03:14.100> before<00:03:14.550> they

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
actually have a formation before they

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.610 
actually have a formation before they
fire<00:03:15.150> which<00:03:15.630> sort<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:16.050> limits<00:03:16.440> their

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
fire which sort of like limits their

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.710 
fire which sort of like limits their
effectiveness<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.550> honest<00:03:17.790> they<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.600> to

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
effectiveness to be honest they have to

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.830 
effectiveness to be honest they have to
form<00:03:19.020> up<00:03:19.200> before<00:03:19.590> they<00:03:19.710> fire<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.010> mean<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:21.600> know

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
form up before they fire I mean you know
