batting of the two sides so what I have
initial<00:00:42.780> thoughts<00:00:43.489> initial<00:00:44.489> thoughts<00:00:44.730> would

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
initial thoughts initial thoughts would

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.760 
initial thoughts initial thoughts would
be<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.239> India<00:00:45.629> definitely<00:00:46.320> has<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
be that India definitely has the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.430 
be that India definitely has the
stronger<00:00:47.250> batting<00:00:47.610> lineup<00:00:47.760> even<00:00:48.210> though

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
stronger batting lineup even though

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.580 
stronger batting lineup even though
England<00:00:49.440> are<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.420> weak<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:52.170> would<00:00:52.320> say

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
England are not as weak as you would say

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.970 
England are not as weak as you would say
but<00:00:53.370> compared<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> India<00:00:54.809> I'd<00:00:55.170> say<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.860> know

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
but compared to India I'd say you know

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
but compared to India I'd say you know
they're<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> bit<00:00:56.640> weaker<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.539> sense<00:00:57.809> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
they're a bit weaker in the sense that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.930 
they're a bit weaker in the sense that
India<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.559> definitely<00:00:59.340> Sheik<00:00:59.609> heard<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
India have definitely Sheik heard the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.270 
India have definitely Sheik heard the
one<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> mean<00:01:00.329> he's<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.620> blown<00:01:01.620> everyone<00:01:02.039> away

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
one I mean he's just blown everyone away

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.640 
one I mean he's just blown everyone away
with<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.609> performance<00:01:02.989> 330<00:01:03.989> runs<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.409> four

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
with this performance 330 runs in four

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
with this performance 330 runs in four
matches<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.159> mean<00:01:05.339> he's<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:06.119> way<00:01:06.540> above

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
matches I mean he's just like way above

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.100 
matches I mean he's just like way above
the<00:01:06.960> rest<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.610> he's<00:01:09.119> got<00:01:09.330> he's<00:01:09.900> never

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the rest so and he's got he's never

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.510 
the rest so and he's got he's never
failed<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.530> even<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:10.979> match

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
failed in even one match

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.870 
failed in even one match
so<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.570> he<00:01:13.439> definitely<00:01:14.040> provides<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.460> plus<00:01:14.670> for

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so I he definitely provides a plus for

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.390 
so I he definitely provides a plus for
India<00:01:15.180> backing<00:01:16.140> him<00:01:16.290> there's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> Rohit<00:01:17.040> Sharma

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400

games<00:02:24.170> didn't<00:02:24.920> really<00:02:25.100> get<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.310> chance<00:02:25.370> to

perform in the tournament because of the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.020 
perform in the tournament because of the
Shikata<00:02:29.300> ones<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.680> guess<00:02:31.280> it's<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.670> final

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
Shikata ones but I guess it's a final

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.580 
Shikata ones but I guess it's a final
and<00:02:32.270> let's<00:02:32.600> see<00:02:32.750> what<00:02:32.900> he<00:02:32.990> does<00:02:33.110> if<00:02:33.320> he<00:02:33.350> gets

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
and let's see what he does if he gets

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.770
