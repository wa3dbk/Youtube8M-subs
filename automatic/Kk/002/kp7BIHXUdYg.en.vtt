ship it back to them which they did in

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
ship it back to them which they did in
two<00:01:16.439> days<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.220> took<00:01:17.490> them<00:01:17.640> about<00:01:17.670> week<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that they couldn't just get it shipped

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.510 
that they couldn't just get it shipped
out<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.689> little<00:01:24.930> bit<00:01:25.110> quicker<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:26.340> didn't

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
out a little bit quicker and I didn't

use<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> multimeter<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.510> know<00:03:33.660> how<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> you

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
use a multimeter you know how to you

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.690 
use a multimeter you know how to you
know<00:03:34.320> trial<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.100> error<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:35.370> different<00:03:35.640> things

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
know trial and error on different things

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.430 
know trial and error on different things
in<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.150> see<00:03:36.390> what's<00:03:36.570> going<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:36.870> then<00:03:37.260> yeah

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
in and see what's going on then yeah

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.810 
in and see what's going on then yeah
then<00:03:37.650> maybe<00:03:37.799> this<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.100> still<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> good<00:03:38.489> deal<00:03:38.670> for

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
then maybe this is still a good deal for

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.400 
then maybe this is still a good deal for
you<00:03:38.910> because<00:03:39.180> again<00:03:39.299> it's<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:40.019> hell<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.290> lot

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
you because again it's a hell of a lot

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.600 
you because again it's a hell of a lot
cheaper<00:03:40.440> than<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.860> lot<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.070> other<00:03:41.190> printers<00:03:41.519> on

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
cheaper than a lot of other printers on

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.850 
cheaper than a lot of other printers on
the<00:03:41.670> market<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.090> does<00:03:42.239> have<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.480> big<00:03:42.860> print

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
the market it does have a big print

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.500 
the market it does have a big print
basically<00:03:44.400> dimension<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.150> where<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.360> can

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
basically dimension of where you can

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.750 
basically dimension of where you can
print<00:03:45.690> stuff<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.470> if<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.799> our<00:03:46.980> end<00:03:47.190> user<00:03:47.489> if

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
print stuff but if you our end user if

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.340 
print stuff but if you our end user if
you<00:03:47.880> are<00:03:48.030> not<00:03:48.209> tech<00:03:48.450> savvy<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.079> do<00:03:49.200> not

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
you are not tech savvy if you do not

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.810 
you are not tech savvy if you do not
like<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.799> tinker<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.310> things<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.670> want

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820
