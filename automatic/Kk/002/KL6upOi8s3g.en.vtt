the reasons why I picked this game to
post<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:18.689> that<00:00:18.930> there's<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> move<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.740> game

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
post was that there's a move in the game

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.099 
post was that there's a move in the game
that<00:00:20.630> kind<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> runs<00:00:21.900> counter<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.470> automatic

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
that kind of runs counter to automatic

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.779 
that kind of runs counter to automatic
assumed<00:00:25.109> move<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.949> we're<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> go

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
assumed move so we're going to go

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.830 
assumed move so we're going to go
through<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.359> think<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.599> really

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840

a<00:00:56.369> bit<00:00:56.729> early<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.239> generally<00:00:58.080> i<00:00:58.110> don't<00:00:58.470> do<00:00:58.650> that

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
a bit early to generally i don't do that

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.960 
a bit early to generally i don't do that
very<00:00:59.010> often<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.549> depends<00:00:59.879> on<00:00:59.939> the<00:01:00.000> situation

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
very often it depends on the situation

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.009 
very often it depends on the situation
one<00:01:02.970> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.119> reasons<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.390> i<00:01:03.510> don't<00:01:03.720> like<00:01:03.839> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
one of the reasons that i don't like to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.719 
one of the reasons that i don't like to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
have it kicked around too much because

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.399 
have it kicked around too much because
in<00:01:08.250> i'm<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.700> wasting<00:01:08.939> time<00:01:09.180> saving<00:01:09.960> my<00:01:10.109> clean

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.160 
in i'm just wasting time saving my clean
while<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> other<00:01:11.420> person<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.539> developing

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
while the other person is developing

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.469 
while the other person is developing
their<00:01:13.320> pieces<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.030> it's<00:01:15.030> something<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.450> i

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
their pieces so it's something that i

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.319 
their pieces so it's something that i
don't<00:01:16.130> do<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> time<00:01:17.789> trying<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.149> get

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
don't do all the time trying to get

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.109 
don't do all the time trying to get
quick<00:01:18.539> clean<00:01:19.259> checkmates<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:19.890> anything<00:01:20.189> but

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
quick clean checkmates or anything but

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300 
quick clean checkmates or anything but
in<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.359> game<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.770> figured<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.859> was<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> pretty

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
in this game I figured it was a pretty

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.789 
in this game I figured it was a pretty
good<00:01:23.399> move<00:01:23.929> just<00:01:24.929> because<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.499> the<00:01:25.530> way<00:01:25.679> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
good move just because of the way the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.260 
good move just because of the way the
pieces<00:01:26.159> were<00:01:26.280> laid<00:01:26.429> out<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.789> really<00:01:27.030> wanted

pieces were laid out and I really wanted

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.139 
pieces were laid out and I really wanted
to<00:01:27.359> get<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.630> Bishop<00:01:28.249> back<00:01:29.249> for<00:01:29.640> taking<00:01:30.030> my

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.569 
absolutely nowhere to go can't move
anywhere<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:56.450> square<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:56.780> taken<00:04:00.579> this

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
anywhere so this square is taken this

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.940

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
by his other pieces so the only move

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.150 
by his other pieces so the only move
that<00:04:06.709> white<00:04:06.859> has<00:04:07.069> now<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.959> capture<00:04:09.170> with

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.449 
the Queen and Queen takes Queen so it
was<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.230> good<00:04:15.380> attack<00:04:15.680> my<00:04:15.829> opponent<00:04:16.220> actually

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
was a good attack my opponent actually

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.819 
was a good attack my opponent actually
resigned<00:04:16.760> right<00:04:17.000> here<00:04:17.320> he<00:04:18.320> thought<00:04:18.560> he<00:04:18.709> was<00:04:18.739> a

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
resigned right here he thought he was a

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.030 
resigned right here he thought he was a
book<00:04:19.039> to<00:04:19.160> lose<00:04:19.340> his<00:04:19.489> Queen

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
book to lose his Queen

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.640 
book to lose his Queen
and<00:04:21.160> figured<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.330> was<00:04:22.900> at<00:04:23.140> for<00:04:23.380> him<00:04:23.470> so

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
and figured that that was at for him so

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.530 
and figured that that was at for him so
he<00:04:23.680> resigned<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.220> game<00:04:24.250> but<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.030> really<00:04:25.390> like

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
he resigned the game but I really like

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.800 
he resigned the game but I really like
the<00:04:25.750> you<00:04:26.110> know<00:04:26.880> just<00:04:27.880> going<00:04:28.180> over<00:04:28.510> how

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
the you know just going over how

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.460 
the you know just going over how
sometimes<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.650> automatic<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:32.020> know<00:04:32.140> moves

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
sometimes the automatic you know moves

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.910 
sometimes the automatic you know moves
or<00:04:32.860> automatic<00:04:33.580> strategies<00:04:34.740> aren't<00:04:35.740> always

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
or automatic strategies aren't always

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.330 
or automatic strategies aren't always
the<00:04:36.370> ones<00:04:36.880> that<00:04:37.150> can<00:04:37.810> be<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.050> most<00:04:38.230> useful<00:04:38.590> or

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
the ones that can be the most useful or

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.540 
the ones that can be the most useful or
most<00:04:39.670> deadly<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:41.290> where<00:04:41.740> some<00:04:42.070> people<00:04:42.100> might

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
most deadly so where some people might

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.320 
most deadly so where some people might
say<00:04:42.850> take<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.750> clean<00:04:43.960> back<00:04:44.230> or<00:04:44.710> even<00:04:45.490> move<00:04:46.180> the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
say take the clean back or even move the

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.790 
say take the clean back or even move the
Queen<00:04:46.570> into<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.900> different<00:04:47.290> attacking

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
Queen into a different attacking

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.290 
Queen into a different attacking
position<00:04:48.220> if<00:04:48.340> they<00:04:48.370> still<00:04:48.730> want<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:49.000> use<00:04:49.150> her

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
position if they still want to use her

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.330 
position if they still want to use her
out<00:04:49.480> there<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:50.320> know<00:04:50.410> like<00:04:50.650> put<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.890> check<00:04:51.190> with

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340
