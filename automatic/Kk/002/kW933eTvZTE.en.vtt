00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.769
 laser printer is common 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.399
 printing devices 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:12.799
 Yes you can meet in every office and often 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:13.639
 houses 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.419
 the first laser printers were 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.019
 constructed early seventies 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.800
 xerox company 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.090
 80s of sale appeared serial 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.300
 models for individual 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.189
 of use 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.489
 they had a high price but little 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:27.899
 performance 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.679
 true as them for other types of technology 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.009
 price price fell quality and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.730
 productivity grew 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 Now laser printers produced 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.380
 many manufacturers are not working 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.830
 horse and everyday print 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.620
 let's see what their working principle 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.000
 the most important part of pinter is the foundation 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.650
 oval he is a cylinder with 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.300
 coated material capable 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.270
 change your lighting dependencies 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.420
 electrical resistance 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.230
 such material is called photo 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.100
 semiconductor or photo organic 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.620
 it charges negative 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.140
 carriers 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.870
 charging is made from special 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.460
 charging roller 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.950
 for what is charging empty 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.660
 after charging process occurs 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.510
 negatively illuminated 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390
 charged surface on the bench 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.830
 laser beam 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.140
 night laser moves little by little 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.730
 deflectable and movable mirrors 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.440
 focused by a lens illuminated by subject 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.240
 herds that need 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.660
 tournament guests to print 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.790
 under the influence of the laser these areas 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.320
 becomes this conductive 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.280
 and the charge in these areas is transferred 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.200
 on a metal base a little 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440
 that is, in the Azov, as it were painted on 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.730
 surface photo score 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.190
 electrostatic image of the future 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.630
 printouts 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.140
 being tested 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.080
 it is also given a negative charge and 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.680
 it is fed to a magnetic ball 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.980
 but the coach it caused is located magnets 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.900
 which also attracts charged then no 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.160
 while rotating the shaft before it through 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.730
 narrow gap is attracted to 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.820
 failure in the places where he took was lit 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.610
 and has no negative 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.790
 charge 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.899
 thus electrostatic 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.229
 the image becomes reality 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.779
 Immediately photo shaft continuing rascheniya with 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.209
 put on him toni romo 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.439
 in contact with paper 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.119
 under the paper is another one this time 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.479
 positively charged roller 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.509
 he is called the rabbit carry 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.359
 he gives the paper a positive charge 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.829
 so after touching 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.929
 sport shaft image 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.709
 composed of negative 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.269
 charged tournament change is transferred and 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.249
 held onto paper 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.329
 image already formed 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.049
 but it is unstable the tournament just lies 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.189
 on paper to held 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.279
 electrostatics 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.069
 for fixing it, measures are baked in the stove 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.869
 Qatar is a fast process whereby 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.719
 extends through the last two videos 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.929
 heating and presses 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:57.529
 at a temperature of about two hundred 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.469
 degrees celsius tons of grain copes 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.349
 then freezes quickly and 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.209
 fixed on paper 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.709
 that is why if right after the printout 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 touch 300 km will be warm even hot 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.309
 for color printing with a similar benefit 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.339
 technology with the difference that for 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.619
 printing one sheet is required 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:18.229
 repeat or four times 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.399
 enduring order passes one of 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.009
 flowers from the moment 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.559
 mixed which form 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.359
 full color image 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.430
 laser printers popular for 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.199
 many of its advantages 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.489
 they are able to print in high resolution 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.529
 high speed 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.399
 as well as more economical than 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.919
 inkjet printers
