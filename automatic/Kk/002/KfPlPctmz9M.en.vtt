00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
here which is good for a composite as

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.600 
here which is good for a composite as
well<00:02:50.390> as<00:02:50.600> vga<00:02:51.320> in<00:02:51.650> which<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.160> plugged<00:02:52.459> in

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
well as vga in which I have plugged in

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.830 
well as vga in which I have plugged in
right<00:02:52.640> now<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.180> then<00:02:53.360> there's<00:02:53.570> pretty<00:02:53.780> much

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
right now and then there's pretty much

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.360 
right now and then there's pretty much
nothing<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.560> other<00:02:54.709> side<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.220> come

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
nothing on the other side can you come

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.500 
nothing on the other side can you come
around<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:55.880> quick<00:02:56.060> look<00:02:56.120> at<00:02:56.390> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
around and have a quick look at the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.540 
around and have a quick look at the
front<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.020> unit<00:02:57.050> here<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.680> realize<00:02:58.370> it

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
front of the unit here I realize it

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.740 
front of the unit here I realize it
might<00:02:58.670> be<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.880> little<00:02:59.000> bit<00:02:59.180> bright<00:02:59.420> but<00:02:59.600> there

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
might be a little bit bright but there

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.090 
might be a little bit bright but there
you<00:02:59.840> go<00:02:59.900> you've<00:03:00.110> got<00:03:00.140> like<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> white<00:03:00.739> finish

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
you go you've got like a white finish

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.760 
you go you've got like a white finish
and<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.970> fed<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.480> little<00:03:02.840> bit<00:03:02.989> loud<00:03:03.260> the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
and the fed is a little bit loud the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.440 
and the fed is a little bit loud the
exhaust<00:03:04.100> comes<00:03:04.430> out<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.730> front<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.180> it's<00:03:05.330> a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
exhaust comes out the front and it's a

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.240 
exhaust comes out the front and it's a
touch<00:03:05.780> loud<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.380> it's<00:03:06.530> not<00:03:06.680> going<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.890> be<00:03:07.040> too

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
touch loud but it's not going to be too

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.410 
touch loud but it's not going to be too
obnoxious<00:03:07.430> if<00:03:07.970> you're<00:03:08.120> giving<00:03:08.360> a
