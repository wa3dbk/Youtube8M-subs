00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.080
 Hello, it's me 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.330
 this is a tutorial to place a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.759
 pure weave on the back with a knot 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.650
 Kangaroo and with a baby for 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.350
 help my daughter since she has two months and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.180
 medium 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 good 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.140
 back as always the first thing 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.970
 we locate the midpoint of the scarf 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.890
 go to mark 12 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.950
 for a label for a drawing 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.510
 depending on the block model 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.510
 having located the midpoint 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.970
 to make her the lady 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.970
 and that's it 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.030
 they want me 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.110
 What we do is sit the baby with the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.110
 back towards the middle point of the ass 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.950
 sit-ups 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.050
 and I like it here already and getting ready 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.600
 the bag is to put the fabric 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.760
 between the legs to do well the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 seat 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.420
 already 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.110
 that pick up everything that is not the scarf 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.110
 but that the part of outside of those subjects 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.940
 to request the agreement and when the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.280
 we have 60 days we are going to spend 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.720
 back and or before that she prefers 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.790
 move it back over the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 head to help me stay high 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.790
 because when we turn this way we have to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.770
 be able to see the charity 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.770
 as to spend the hours 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.030
 for land enfold you 'll catch on 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.659
 the sides 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.659
 as above the right arm 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.920
 and on the other hand another graphic 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 turning it in 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.119
 already 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.120
 this for here 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.100
 lowering the height you want here the 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.100
 we have the lame in the ass 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.420
 and I bring another brace here 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.150
 always remember that when we are 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.590
 placing in return of more water if 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.209
 it is to the back while with one hand 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.060
 we can stand to see with each other 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.030
 we hold the baby 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.250
 in agreement 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.650
 I bring the straps to alante by 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.440
 over my shoulders I make sure that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.410
 the bag 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.240
 It is well made 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.570
 is already taking one knee to the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.570
 other 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.180
 and now it starts to adjust the 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.740
 baby carrier to this part lina is our 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.630
 zone 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.170
 in a way especially for the culito 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.849
 and with the other one begins to make the adjustment 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.050
 I start on the side that I have more 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.580
 close to my neck that is the one 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.580
 corresponds to your head 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.590
 start making the adjustment by folding 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:29.710
 try to pick up a little and throw another 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.710
 little bit and throw another little bit when pulling 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.500
 step back over your skin 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.820
 here 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.820
 below lack 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.000
 and now the same 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.000
 with the other 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.099
 I start here 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.080
 if you drink with your neck you do not know anything 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.080
 what child 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.550
 above the tea below 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.580
 and so we do not have charged and safe 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.880
 then with the scarf here 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.850
 We could just as tie it here or according to 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.550
 the amount of fabric that opens us can 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.389
 as we have it here without my life 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.449
 turn around 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.080
 and go back 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.080
 in this case 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.470
 a little extra support 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.120
 and we already have a baby asleep
