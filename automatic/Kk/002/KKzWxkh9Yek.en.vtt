00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
from GNA I guess you can say at the end

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.159 
from GNA I guess you can say at the end
of<00:07:18.320> that<00:07:18.440> into<00:07:19.160> that<00:07:19.280> match<00:07:19.490> and<00:07:19.880> it<00:07:20.780> was<00:07:20.930> so

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:21.169 
of that into that match and it was so

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:22.719 
of that into that match and it was so
long<00:07:21.410> from<00:07:21.740> the<00:07:21.890> east<00:07:22.010> and<00:07:22.220> eights<00:07:22.370> and<00:07:22.550> so

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:22.729 
long from the east and eights and so

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:24.400 
long from the east and eights and so
long<00:07:22.940> from<00:07:23.090> TNA<00:07:23.570> and<00:07:23.810> then<00:07:23.900> it<00:07:24.020> took<00:07:24.140> him<00:07:24.260> two

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
long from TNA and then it took him two

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.690

off<00:07:24.470> to<00:07:24.500> the<00:07:24.680> bottom<00:07:24.919> for<00:07:25.010> glory<00:07:25.220> to<00:07:25.340> come<00:07:25.460> back

off to the bottom for glory to come back

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.000 
off to the bottom for glory to come back
so<00:07:26.060> i<00:07:26.510> guess<00:07:27.020> that's<00:07:27.229> hyping<00:07:27.560> up<00:07:27.650> their<00:07:27.830> big

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.010 
so i guess that's hyping up their big

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.860 
so i guess that's hyping up their big
match<00:07:29.320> as<00:07:30.320> far<00:07:31.039> as<00:07:31.220> i<00:07:31.340> know<00:07:31.400> i<00:07:31.520> haven't<00:07:32.060> seen

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870
