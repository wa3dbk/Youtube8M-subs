00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
around in jor-el it's gonna be a major

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.310 
around in jor-el it's gonna be a major
player<00:02:56.940> now<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.510> saw<00:02:57.780> someone<00:02:58.050> write<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.260> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
into the negative zone himself and

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.810 
into the negative zone himself and
that's<00:03:01.470> how<00:03:01.680> he<00:03:01.800> comes<00:03:02.010> back<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.580> don't<00:03:02.670> know

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
that's how he comes back I don't know

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.640 
that's how he comes back I don't know
but<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.540> don't<00:03:03.720> think<00:03:03.840> that's<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.110> hologram<00:03:04.380> by

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
but I don't think that's a hologram by

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.260 
but I don't think that's a hologram by
the<00:03:04.709> way<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:04.950> he's<00:03:05.040> talking<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.790> think

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
the way and he's talking to I think

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.370 
the way and he's talking to I think
unless<00:03:06.570> they<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.050> most<00:03:07.170> amazing

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
unless they have the most amazing

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.140 
unless they have the most amazing
technology<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:08.459> he'll<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:08.850> be<00:03:09.000> too

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
technology but he'll just be too

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.750 
technology but he'll just be too

much that I've just I've like let go of
my<00:03:28.560> preconceptions<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.510> so

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
my preconceptions because it's just so

Superman that I just love so much and I

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.080 
Superman that I just love so much and I
think<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.709> it's<00:03:47.040> even<00:03:47.310> further<00:03:47.489> evidenced

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
think that it's even further evidenced

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.819 
think that it's even further evidenced
by<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.269> fact<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.660> they're<00:03:49.170> really<00:03:49.200> replaced

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
by the fact that they're really replaced

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.170 
by the fact that they're really replaced
from<00:03:49.980> Jonathan<00:03:50.459> Kent<00:03:50.640> with<00:03:50.730> jor-el<00:03:51.030> jor-el

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
from Jonathan Kent with jor-el jor-el

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.449 
from Jonathan Kent with jor-el jor-el
clearly<00:03:52.079> is<00:03:52.200> gonna<00:03:52.380> be<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.560> major<00:03:52.739> influence<00:03:53.040> on

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
clearly is gonna be a major influence on

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.630 
clearly is gonna be a major influence on
his<00:03:53.910> son's<00:03:54.510> life<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.739> their<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.130> guess<00:03:56.459> they're

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
his son's life and their I guess they're

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.430 
his son's life and their I guess they're
gonna<00:03:56.730> kill<00:03:57.030> poor<00:03:57.480> Jonathan<00:03:57.989> Kent

call this not the no keep trailer but

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.840 
call this not the no keep trailer but
the<00:04:44.510> jor-el<00:04:44.840> trailer<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.400> feel<00:04:46.669> bad<00:04:46.820> for

down below
have<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.240> seen<00:04:50.480> too<00:04:50.630> much<00:04:50.870> I<00:04:51.440> have<00:04:51.890> you<00:04:52.010> know

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
have you seen too much I have you know

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.830 
have you seen too much I have you know
and<00:04:52.640> there's<00:04:52.820> luck<00:04:53.000> obviously<00:04:53.480> a<00:04:53.510> lot<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.690> cool

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
and there's luck obviously a lot of cool

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.390 
and there's luck obviously a lot of cool
action<00:04:54.050> here<00:04:54.380> I<00:04:54.410> think<00:04:54.680> sometimes<00:04:54.980> Superman

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
action here I think sometimes Superman

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.740 
action here I think sometimes Superman
when<00:04:55.520> he<00:04:55.610> flies<00:04:55.850> off<00:04:56.060> this<00:04:56.210> looks<00:04:56.480> so<00:04:56.600> great

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
when he flies off this looks so great

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.630 
when he flies off this looks so great
but<00:04:56.990> I<00:04:57.050> think<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.500> Faora<00:04:57.980> or<00:04:58.250> whatever<00:04:58.520> her

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
but I think that Faora or whatever her

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.460 
but I think that Faora or whatever her
name<00:04:58.669> is<00:04:58.850> when<00:04:59.480> she<00:04:59.660> takes<00:04:59.840> off<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.200> that<00:05:00.320> one

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
name is when she takes off and that one

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.510 
name is when she takes off and that one
shot<00:05:00.680> in<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.800> trailer<00:05:01.070> that<00:05:01.100> looks<00:05:01.370> pretty

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
shot in the trailer that looks pretty

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.190 
shot in the trailer that looks pretty
cool<00:05:01.730> I<00:05:02.060> think<00:05:02.330> it's<00:05:02.480> gonna<00:05:02.660> be<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:02.870> little<00:05:03.020> hit

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
cool I think it's gonna be a little hit

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.180 
cool I think it's gonna be a little hit
or<00:05:03.230> miss<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:03.650> trying<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:03.919> bring<00:05:04.070> these

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
or miss and trying to bring these

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.100 
or miss and trying to bring these
characters<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.760> life<00:05:04.790> this<00:05:05.330> is<00:05:05.510> it's<00:05:05.870> hard

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
characters to life this is it's hard

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.980 
characters to life this is it's hard
it's<00:05:06.350> hard<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.620> make<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.770> man<00:05:07.010> fly<00:05:07.520> you<00:05:08.150> know<00:05:08.270> and

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
it's hard to make a man fly you know and

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.690 
it's hard to make a man fly you know and
in<00:05:09.290> special<00:05:09.710> effects<00:05:09.980> for<00:05:10.100> some<00:05:10.160> reason<00:05:10.550> it's

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
in special effects for some reason it's

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.950 
in special effects for some reason it's
really<00:05:10.760> hard<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.360> do<00:05:11.450> which<00:05:11.600> is<00:05:11.720> why<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:11.870> think

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
really hard to do which is why I think

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.540 
really hard to do which is why I think
you<00:05:12.110> which<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:12.830> why<00:05:12.950> I<00:05:12.980> think<00:05:13.100> you<00:05:13.250> don't<00:05:13.400> see

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
you which is why I think you don't see

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.909
