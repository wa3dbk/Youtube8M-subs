00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.260
 small mistake fix that the keyboard 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.909
 sometimes it takes a little 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.170
 in leaving not the truth is that this tweet 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.150
 is still in beta is not 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.040
 finished all but good is that 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.930
 is not completely free and already what 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.310
 does it does it quite well it's not the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.329
 small bug that sometimes the keyboard 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.590
 it takes a little while to appear 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.390
 good more little things we can do 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.129
 we can see how you can take the bubble and 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.989
 put it where we want so that 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.730
 do not bother us or we will also be able to 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.590
 take the bubble and drag it up 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.450
 down here until this X for 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.650
 eliminate conversations and that 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.030
 little bubbles do not appear in the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.739
 springboard agreement when we have 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.930
 already finished the conversation what 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.340
 we drag down here and the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.780
 promos and you agree in addition this 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.090
 tweet is configurable let's go the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.489
 adjustments let's go down to the tweet in 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.870
 question that is called mi6 box here 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.090
 we have a bar according to this 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.639
 bar we will be able to adjust the interval 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.329
 of soda to see when they send us 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.430
 messages 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.049
 also note what down here tells us 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.090
 that if we put an interval too much 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.200
 high let's spend more battery of 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.879
 agreement because he is working this 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.139
 application in the background I os 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.579
 I recommend that you do not leave as such 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.560
 it comes by default but good 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.120
 in the end if it takes a long time to get the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.829
 notifications or messages that go 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.359
 sending you know that with this 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.410
