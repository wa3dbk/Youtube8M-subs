but underneath that you have this
outlast<00:01:26.909> technology<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.530> does<00:01:28.740> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
outlast technology and what it does is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
outlast technology and what it does is
it<00:01:29.040> helps<00:01:29.130> regulate<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.090> heat<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.720> your

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it helps regulate the heat that your

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
it helps regulate the heat that your
body<00:01:31.079> creates<00:01:31.590> during<00:01:31.920> training<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.579> games

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
body creates during training and games

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.410 
body creates during training and games
so<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:34.049> body<00:01:34.229> creates<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.189> heat<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:36.000> stores

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so your body creates the heat it stores

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
so your body creates the heat it stores
it<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> cools<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.590> releases<00:01:38.040> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
it and when it cools down it releases it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.039 
it and when it cools down it releases it
as<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> temperature<00:01:39.780> management

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
as well so it's a temperature management

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.280 
as well so it's a temperature management

you<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.640> see<00:02:19.850> here<00:02:20.300> your<00:02:20.780> hand<00:02:21.050> slides<00:02:21.350> into

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
you can see here your hand slides into

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680 
you can see here your hand slides into
an<00:02:21.800> envelope<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.310> latex<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.000> your<00:02:23.120> fingers<00:02:23.480> do

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
an envelope of latex so your fingers do

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.200 
an envelope of latex so your fingers do
and<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.740> stitched<00:02:25.100> up<00:02:25.370> into<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.700> back<00:02:25.880> hand

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
and it's stitched up into the back hand

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.670 
and it's stitched up into the back hand
so<00:02:26.330> there's<00:02:26.450> no<00:02:26.630> extra<00:02:26.960> material<00:02:27.350> on<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.470> side

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
so there's no extra material on the side

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.530 
so there's no extra material on the side
so<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.100> basically<00:02:28.340> pulls<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.790> latex<00:02:29.210> up

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
stitches into the back hand that is what

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.080 
stitches into the back hand that is what

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
gives the cells that roll finger design

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.880 
gives the cells that roll finger design
that<00:02:35.330> roll<00:02:35.480> palm<00:02:35.750> design<00:02:36.200> okay

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
that roll palm design okay

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.490 
that roll palm design okay
takes<00:02:37.160> away<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.430> lot<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.090> excess<00:02:38.570> material
