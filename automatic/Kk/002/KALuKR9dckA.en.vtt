your guitar in my case i connect in a
different<00:00:22.710> way<00:00:22.860> but<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:24.330> really<00:00:24.570> simple

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
different way but it's really simple

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.170 
different way but it's really simple
first<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.070> many<00:00:26.340> people<00:00:26.670> ask<00:00:26.850> me<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.150> i

first of all many people ask me what i

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.420 
first of all many people ask me what i
have<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:28.020> blue<00:00:28.260> box<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:29.220> this

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
have here this little blue box on this

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.189 
have here this little blue box on this
case<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> mbox<00:00:30.660> two<00:00:30.960> from

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
case this is the mbox two from

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.650 
case this is the mbox two from
digidesign<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.129> this<00:00:32.609> is<00:00:32.789> an<00:00:33.000> inaudible

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
digidesign and this is an inaudible

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.040 
digidesign and this is an inaudible
interface<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.210> it's<00:00:36.210> an<00:00:36.390> assertive<00:00:36.929> other

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
interface it's a it's an assertive other

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
interface it's a it's an assertive other
interface<00:00:37.589> it<00:00:37.800> connects<00:00:38.069> to<00:00:38.159> my<00:00:38.249> computer<00:00:38.729> via

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
interface it connects to my computer via

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.889 
interface it connects to my computer via
in<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> case<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.460> mbox<00:00:41.789> 2<00:00:42.059> via<00:00:42.300> USB

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
in this case like it's an mbox 2 via USB

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.369 
in this case like it's an mbox 2 via USB
and<00:00:43.760> just<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.909> know<00:00:44.999> this<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.359> wes<00:00:45.629> be<00:00:45.870> 1.1

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and just so you know this is wes be 1.1

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.279 
and just so you know this is wes be 1.1
it's<00:00:47.069> really<00:00:47.460> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.909> all<00:00:48.089> not<00:00:48.659> so<00:00:48.839> fast<00:00:49.019> but

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it's really kind of all not so fast but

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.379 
it's really kind of all not so fast but
i<00:00:49.319> never<00:00:49.530> had<00:00:49.799> any<00:00:49.949> problem<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.699> right<00:00:50.879> next

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:51.389 
i never had any problem all right next

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:54.919 
i never had any problem all right next
there's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:52.069> an<00:00:53.069> external<00:00:53.609> hard<00:00:53.850> drive<00:00:54.149> you're

work with the pro tools or logic you

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.219 
work with the pro tools or logic you
need<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:04.880> it's<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.030> very<00:01:06.330> large<00:01:06.690> all<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
need them it's not very large all the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.100 
need them it's not very large all the
drive<00:01:07.470> depends<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.950> oil<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.730> York<00:01:09.300> on<00:01:09.480> all<00:01:09.930> your

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
drive depends on oil on York on all your

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.520 
drive depends on oil on York on all your
workflows<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:11.100> workflows<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
workflows your workflows but this is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.240 
workflows your workflows but this is
just<00:01:13.560> 1<00:01:14.070> 160<00:01:14.880> gigabyte<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.080> lacy<00:01:16.410> back

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
just 1 160 gigabyte it's a lacy back

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.010 
just 1 160 gigabyte it's a lacy back
then<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.760> were<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.210> expensive<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
then they were really expensive it's a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.950 
then they were really expensive it's a
firewire<00:01:19.410> 400<00:01:20.010> and<00:01:20.190> i<00:01:20.820> use<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.120> connect<00:01:21.480> also

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
firewire 400 and i use it connect also

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740 
firewire 400 and i use it connect also
to<00:01:22.050> my<00:01:22.200> mac<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.010> my<00:01:23.370> main<00:01:23.580> audio<00:01:24.000> interface<00:01:24.510> is

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
to my mac so my main audio interface is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.310 
to my mac so my main audio interface is
this<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:26.570> from<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.630> i<00:01:27.960> connect<00:01:28.260> my

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
this one and from here i connect my

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
this one and from here i connect my
guitar<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:28.980> are<00:01:29.100> several<00:01:29.340> inputs<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.910> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
guitar there are several inputs in the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
back from microphones to the instrument

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.780 
back from microphones to the instrument
to<00:01:32.730> eject<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.660> guitar<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.190> have<00:01:35.190> your

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790

for my ex condenser mics and add phone

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.360 
for my ex condenser mics and add phone
and<00:01:42.330> master<00:01:42.750> volume<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.710> easy<00:01:43.830> not

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
and master volume really easy not

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.180 
and master volume really easy not
nothing<00:01:44.760> special<00:01:45.390> about<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.440> from<00:01:47.040> this

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
nothing special about it then from this

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.990 
nothing special about it then from this
it<00:01:47.460> goes<00:01:47.640> two<00:01:48.000> checks<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:50.000> left

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it goes two checks one to the left

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.940 
it goes two checks one to the left
tunnel<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.230> other<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.770> right

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
tunnel and the other to the right

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.420 
tunnel and the other to the right
channel<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.580> these<00:01:54.510> two<00:01:54.750> monitors<00:01:55.440> are<00:01:55.890> be

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
channel and these two monitors are be

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.070 
channel and these two monitors are be
amped<00:01:56.790> which<00:01:57.210> means<00:01:57.510> they<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.840> their<00:01:58.050> own

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
amped which means they have their own

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.780 
amped which means they have their own
amplifiers<00:01:58.710> inside<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.370> you<00:01:59.400> don't<00:01:59.670> need<00:01:59.729> to
