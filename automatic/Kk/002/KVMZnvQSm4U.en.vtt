00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 good afternoon today with you again i'm 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.139
 This day I still came to the store and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.059
 I bought two more minifigures that I 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.609
 wanted to buy 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.189
 Originally I bought one figure according to yours 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.890
 requests because I know that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.529
 for some unknown reason she 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.029
 It is very popular and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 the second minifigure is 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 the man I took 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 the guys I took for my 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.550
 collections because I also wanted 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.309
 purchase this minifigure 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:48.570
 let's start then first with that little man 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:50.579
 which I wanted to buy here but the usual 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 bag I already in the previous release to you 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:59.059
 showed let's see what is here 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.000
 got it next so to speak 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:07.560
 girl figurine 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 but it's from the tube 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 You have already seen, that is, the figure that I 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.500
 acquired this time this woman under 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.830
 number 14 here is a doggy and a cellular 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.170
 phone let's consider it 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.220
 in more detail by the way is also enough 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:35.970
 rare figure because here here 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:41.159
 such a mini dog is roughly speaking 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:48.659
 because of her i took this little man in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:54.899
 in general, we collect our figure in general 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:59.159
 that and all here is such a girl woman in 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:03.960
 one hand she has a doggie 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:08.060
 long here look cell bad 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.060
 of course you can see a cell phone 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.750
 Well, in general, this is the number one figure 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.200
 olya 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:26.379
 Paris Hilton Britney Spears second figurine 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.250
 in many ratings after gold 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.099
 little man 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.500
 it takes almost second place 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.390
 although honestly I can not say 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.799
 why but you can see children like it right away 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.799
 tell you what to find it in the collection 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.019
 very very simple today bye 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:48.130
 went through the whole box in search of this one 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.799
 figurines I stumbled upon as many as three pieces 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.410
 same but one immediately selected 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.400
 so you have very big chances 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.410
 find her in the collection in the same store 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.019
 children's world but by the way here with 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.510
 other figures there like 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:09.510
 jellyfish and so on 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:13.060
 The author is worse already can be seen that and rummaged and 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.400
 chose the right man so when 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:22.620
 let's go over the construction of the sponge you probably already 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.620
 everyone guessed who it is this of course 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.829
 and pm ballist 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:36.780
 let's collect it such a little man 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:39.940
 but here so and of course here are the guns 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.410
 probably most likely from this 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.410
 guns all fuss 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.440
 such a figure number 2 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.310
 in general, that's the golden man for me 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.090
 as usual could not be found 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.910
 Again Perry whisking Davie boxes you 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:11.000
 someone may be lucky let's 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:13.970
 let's take a closer look at figure one 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.890
 and paintball figure number two by the way 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:24.860
 in his helmet, this helmet is here 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:29.080
 motionless on on of course removed but 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.080
 up ost like a panda 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.110
 In general, here is a mini review thanks for 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.110
 Attention
