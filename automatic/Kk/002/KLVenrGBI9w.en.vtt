knows of a school not far from here in

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.820 
knows of a school not far from here in
which<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> eighth<00:00:20.820> grade<00:00:21.199> every<00:00:22.199> single

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
which in the eighth grade every single

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
which in the eighth grade every single
child<00:00:23.519> has<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> cell<00:00:24.180> phone<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.539> eighth<00:00:24.720> grade

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
child has a cell phone the eighth grade

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.160 
child has a cell phone the eighth grade
now<00:00:25.859> maybe<00:00:26.310> eighth<00:00:26.519> graders<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.240> being<00:00:27.990> left

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
now maybe eighth graders are being left

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.380 
now maybe eighth graders are being left
back<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.680> maybe<00:00:28.859> they're<00:00:29.099> 16<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.640> 17<00:00:30.060> years<00:00:30.090> old

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
back so maybe they're 16 or 17 years old

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.170 
back so maybe they're 16 or 17 years old
I<00:00:30.660> don't<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.529> eighth<00:00:32.160> graders<00:00:32.700> every

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
I don't think so eighth graders every

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.760 
I don't think so eighth graders every
single<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.750> has<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> cell<00:00:34.290> phone<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.649> then<00:00:34.739> I

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
single one has a cell phone and then I

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950 
single one has a cell phone and then I
read<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.370> lot<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.940> different<00:00:36.420> articles<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
read a lot of different articles and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
read a lot of different articles and
different<00:00:37.230> opinions<00:00:37.800> about<00:00:37.980> how<00:00:38.579> even

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
different opinions about how even

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.910 
different opinions about how even
children<00:00:39.360> should<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.840> cell<00:00:40.290> phones<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.770> this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
children should have cell phones is this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
children should have cell phones is this
makes<00:00:41.160> sense<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.809> somehow<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.200> think

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
makes sense to somehow I think

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.190 
makes sense to somehow I think
something's<00:00:44.010> wrong<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:45.020> certainly<00:00:46.020> there

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
something's wrong here certainly there

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.770 
something's wrong here certainly there
is<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.500> opinion<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.340> there's<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.750> such<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
is an opinion that there's a such a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.080 
is an opinion that there's a such a
