00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
was talking of my friend who's 97 I met

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.220 
was talking of my friend who's 97 I met
talking<00:00:08.880> two<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> half<00:00:09.630> years<00:00:09.840> ago<00:00:09.900> when<00:00:10.170> I

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
talking two and a half years ago when I

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.230 
talking two and a half years ago when I
was<00:00:10.380> cycling<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.769> work<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.880> saw<00:00:12.090> him

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
was cycling to work and I saw him

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.570 
was cycling to work and I saw him
sitting<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.660> bench<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.650> thought<00:00:13.860> he

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
sitting on a bench and I thought he

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.730 
sitting on a bench and I thought he
would<00:00:14.790> probably<00:00:15.120> enjoy<00:00:15.240> cycling<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.320> he

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
would probably enjoy cycling and he

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
would probably enjoy cycling and he
probably<00:00:16.949> did<00:00:17.279> when<00:00:17.640> he<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> young<00:00:18.090> man<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
probably did when he was a young man and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.310 
probably did when he was a young man and
so<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.470> day<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:20.100> hired<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.029> rickshaw<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.380
