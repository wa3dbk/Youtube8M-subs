00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.930
 Hello fighters 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.180
 again after a couple of months with you queen &amp; 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.820
 rice sorry for such a long stagnation on 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.109
 the channel itself is my vacation move and tuba 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.660
 comes to the end 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.090
 literally on the eve started 2 now 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.579
 already open beta hardline and and i think 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.620
 we will have something to discuss in general and a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.899
 yesterday was a whole day hacked into beta and already 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.500
 Now I can say with confidence that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.140
 the game will turn out good briefly about the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.809
 be and now there are three modes available 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.149
 robbery hijacking and classic capture 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.500
 also three cards already known to us 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.110
 business center 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
 he's high voltage and new 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 sandstorm and bank robbery 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.399
 list all available equipment 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.580
 very long so just say that her 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.760
 many many trunks many pomegranates many 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 gadgets many weights and camouflage for 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.490
 weapons in general , a lot of it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.119
 It turned out really volume and for a week 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.040
 try all will not be easy sorry 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.280
 only progress would not be saved 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 the technical side is also not to be released 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.689
 pump up there are minor bugs and rare 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.700
 drawdowns fps but in general 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.240
 performance and gameplay on 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.150
 height 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 if you play the fourth battle then 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.920
 Hardline will also go without any problems 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
 as for my first impressions 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.770
 The brightest ones of course are associated with 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.430
 new modes and maps hijacking 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.070
 it's not that guys if someone does not know 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.380
 The essence of the regime is as follows on the map 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.189
 there are several cars behind them 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.320
 is hunting 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.170
 while you are in one of them and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.149
 move the team points are awarded if 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.130
 your team has more captured 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.780
 ticket machines are spent more slowly 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.960
 so loses the team which 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.149
 tickets left 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.489
 grip on wheels and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.239
 similar to how much these same wheels don't 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.950
 in that sense 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.450
 change the whole essence of capture from positional 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.120
 combat rare dynamics on 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.359
 certain points literally the whole map 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.599
 turns into a seething pot 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:32.280
 the concentration of action here is very high 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.040
 actually this is all said very mode 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.459
 dynamic and interesting and still cheerful 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.739
 if playing with friends is honest the most 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.889
 fun multiplayer game in which 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.769
 I recently played now about 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:49.440
 robbery in the 1st century we already played this 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.900
 downtown map mode and basically everything 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.060
 it was already clear then 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.180
 reworked assault and very 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.129
 qualitatively altered pancake as far as 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.260
 he is cool to play on the new map 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.000
 to storm this very bank 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.220
 interesting map 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.290
 contact layered with a huge 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.180
 the number of passes because of what you need 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.430
 constantly thinking where to go and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.199
 what position do their criminals take 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.750
 by the way can create additional 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.910
 passages in undermining the walls and ceiling in 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.449
 certain places it takes time 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.239
 so the cops can get in the way of course 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.109
 dynamics is not exactly flat torso of 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.440
 battlefield 3 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.060
 but something like the map is very dynamic 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.730
 and infantry and play here really 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.519
 interesting in general robbery mode on 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.919
 this map and I liked the most 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.799
 the main thing is that it is seriously different from 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.569
 of what we saw on the downtown map i 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.659
 not saying that what we saw on the map 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.329
 downtown is bad no just as a matter of fact mode 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.579
 the same but played in a completely different way 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.909
 on two different maps in my opinion it is 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.889
 awesome god forbid on all other cards 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:04:01.409
 developers will not be able to surprise us 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:04.739
 less well and a few words about the standard for 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.720
 battlefield mode now grab it 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.870
 available only on one map sand 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.909
 storm and you know despite the fact that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.760
 hardline no heavy equipment to play 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.590
 capture is also interesting 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.260
 mostly due to the fact that 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.570
 the map is well balanced all points 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.880
 arranged symmetrically in this pickups and 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.430
 equipment is also scattered evenly 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.900
 The card itself is quite large and you can 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.780
 it was expected a huge amount 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.550
 campers on the mountains and roofs but strong 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.830
 problems with this i didn't feel 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.440
 possible due to the fact that the map 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.490
 many shelters in general capture here 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.190
 played no worse than theft 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.220
 modes so far everything is now about the little things 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.289
 so I really liked the attention 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.660
 developers to these very little things 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.180
 apparently they added the possibility 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.940
 listening to music in the car itself already 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.850
 not too lazy to do so well 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.690
 switching tracks tired of rap click 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.110
 g and listen to rock again it would seem 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.419
 small change 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.789
 locking doors on the bank card 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.400
 bullshit jean they did 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.370
 and this feature also significantly affects the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.419
 gameplay there by the way, you can also tune 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.250
 include another small but interesting 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.010
 feature with light melee weapon 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.680
 you can quickly beat and literally 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.900
 plug opponents rub in the forehead if you 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.690
 take heavy melee weapons 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.699
 for example an ax or sledgehammer do this 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.900
 you won't be able to 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:38.419
 literally knock out doors too cool yes 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:43.520
 by the way moronic animation counterattack 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:46.130
 of the four there is no and thank god and here 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.770
 during the game of such trifles and pops up 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.599
 quite a lot to take at least animation 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.389
 when your character shows medium 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.599
 finger to the enemy or yelling obscenity 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.889
 loud too cool to eat more 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.949
 important game moment 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:04.069
 small changes in the menu interface 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.900
 well, everything is actually like us all 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.569
 know little things are important 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.419
 any smallest smallest in 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:15.439
 globally a jamb can spoil 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.189
 It seems everything is on the contrary a lot of 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.430
 fun 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:22.520
 interesting or just smart solutions 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.919
 thank you wetherall games in general i 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.009
 I sincerely believe that it is possible and 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.889
 hardline and a great future of course he is not 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.289
 will replace the standard battlefield despite 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:36.139
 on the same engine and overall concept 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:39.259
 Still, these games are different 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:42.680
 Well, too different hardline drive and 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:46.180
 cheerful and battlefield 4 more serious 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.319
 and scale well and most importantly 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.270
 hotline developers really 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:53.509
 try to do something new 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.029
 interesting and high quality if not yet 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:59.659
 played sure try but have that 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:02.839
 it is well and on it so far everything 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:05.509
 Here is such a short informative and I 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:08.150
 I hope an interesting video for you 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.339
 what looked if you liked it 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.500
 be sure to like and 

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:14.270
 write your comments on hardline 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.949
 it will be interesting to read 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.949
 see you bye
