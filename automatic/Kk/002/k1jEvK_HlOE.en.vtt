00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.450
 hello to all guys welcome back here on 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.430
 set here with you velox screenshot we are 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.500
 come back today with a new video the first one 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.770
 impossible business world record bar 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.689
 of black ops your dick you finally are 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.759
 now there was his plan to recap 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.470
 I can manage light and the French succeed 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.239
 they can suck the French then the 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.290
 British the Americans who crave split up 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.440
 and then all the others 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.300
 and then also the Croats because they are accountants 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.359
 from the croats then we will explain 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.129
 also to the municipality because a bastard aims 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.719
 the proof but it must be purchased also go 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.460
 forgotten also writing messages from 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.379
 spot I say I don't take it for the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.320
 autosport marble from ato piece in the piece 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.539
 of shit then returning to a business 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.969
 impossible that it has already cost so much 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.120
 so much effort especially because the map 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.679
 and whirlwinds as the wizards of of 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.749
 treyarch have decided to put the 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.969
 turret only on turbine the pay goes out of 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.680
 less absolute then we say that it has 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.280
 difficulty was in finding the map 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.960
 more than anything else then that is owing to it 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.790
 do we had to find the map then 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.260
 horner you can't imagine how long 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.400
 to find the map since what 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.490
 maps you ca n't choose the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.040
 transsexual to find turbines ge is 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.350
 you just found them thematic yes 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.970
 call it shit the people here find that 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.040
 left adobe and goes to fan ass center 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.440
 really the frustrating part of it 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.870
 can tell you come and we do 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.580
 think of the series as possibly impossible 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.790
 we found I found the genius 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.500
 certainly the brilliant idea for you see it 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.440
 these dear boys with shields 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.820
 sandals etf thanks euro past 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.850
 but in their channel they are really 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.410
 competent good good really do 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.390
 the team game understood what 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.980
 we had to do because before explaining 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.810
 one thing that every time we have to 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.310
 beat 15 years to then understand the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.660
 people I have to do anyway not 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.980
 faced really good they have me 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.950
 covered with these shields because in 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.690
 practice offer coverage that to 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.890
 end at the end of the video we will make you 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.890
 see in the third person 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.709
 practically offers me a cover that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 it allows me to survive on peers 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.599
 snipers lurking behind them 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.310
 in the sand under the sand 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.110
 as mentioned a word a sniper in 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.099
 able to penetrate this barrier of 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.530
 shields that frates weak after a second 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.959
 of attempts there is a point must 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.640
 perfect in the feet that I remember but 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.080
 no one got there alone I had to 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.610
 get there but I'll shoot everyone here dead 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.590
 however they will be the explanation of the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.150
 technique in a few simple words 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.069
 then they put him here with the shield 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.269
 shoots and practically there is a bug 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.160
 which allows me to use the 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.780
 turret passing their bodies and 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.489
 of the courgette they wanted to do the role 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.560
 of the types of shields and boys if there 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.209
 reflects one understands why because he 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.040
 is behind them looks like they are well 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:03.269
 put to 90 and he from the boys and on his 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.190
 site that wanted to do it anyway is 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.900
 the organization goes well brother rhodri e 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.239
 I was behind that I covered that I didn't 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.670
 let nobody pass anyone nobody 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.319
 that did not have the pass then there is 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.420
 a shit that has a channel too 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.950
 really very good past guys between 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.510
 the other makes a series of knife and between 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.510
 put it in the ass because it's much stronger 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.859
 because he starts with such non-methods 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.600
 warehousing two guys anyway and 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.239
 guys over at this description 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.420
 these few crap we wanted to make you 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.900
 ask yourself a question that is very important to us 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.130
 let's say crows just as we wanted 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.389
 encourage one particular evening but 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.950
 we don't know which one then 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.290
 we propose all other items from which 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.730
 therefore you want to encourage the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.190
 first is the time shit guys then 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.859
 that heading where all the crap 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.810
 which you can imagine come true 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.370
 then the second is okay it's not really one 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.590
 serve and we will bring high scores 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.440
 so over 100 for sure we also have 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.989
 of the 340 or rather concert with rehearsals from 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.639
 part and then another series you can 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.410
 not find you guys directly 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.099
 series immediately because until the other evening 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.150
 And then the real videos are not without 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.930
 presents the video of the cars of 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.930
 new town 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.940
 not of fans the short series is not that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.620
 it's you take a shower 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.840
 here you are flying him to want to describe 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.680
 yes and I swear the physx moment the fig 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.960
 boxing is true ready in hd in hd and 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.580
 so then they get scared about what i am 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.190
 children who follow each other perhaps and see 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.610
 these monsters so Lucian love 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.530
 snakes in detail however 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.570
 guys here you defined yourself to nothing there 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.590
 pecks at the next video in between 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.590
