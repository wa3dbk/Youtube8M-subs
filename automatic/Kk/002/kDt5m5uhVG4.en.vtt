Finnick<00:03:22.270> is<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:23.200> uses<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.800> same

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
Finnick is that it uses the same

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.240 
Finnick is that it uses the same
rendering<00:03:24.430> asian<00:03:24.700> engine<00:03:25.540> as<00:03:26.070> firefox<00:03:27.070> on

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
rendering asian engine as firefox on

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.860 
rendering asian engine as firefox on
your<00:03:27.340> desktop<00:03:27.610> so<00:03:28.239> it's<00:03:28.390> supposed<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.690> be<00:03:28.810> able

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
your desktop so it's supposed to be able

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.820 
your desktop so it's supposed to be able
to<00:03:29.020> run<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.170> exact<00:03:29.560> same<00:03:29.800> add-ons<00:03:31.020> we've<00:03:32.020> we

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
to run the exact same add-ons we've we

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.170 
to run the exact same add-ons we've we
sync<00:03:33.190> up<00:03:33.310> there<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.700> see<00:03:33.880> that's<00:03:34.090> an

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
sync up there that you see that's an

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.550 
sync up there that you see that's an
add-on<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:34.630> I've<00:03:34.750> already<00:03:34.930> added<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.530> that

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
add-on that I've already added so that

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.790 
add-on that I've already added so that
works<00:03:36.120> let's<00:03:37.120> try<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.420> add<00:03:37.630> one<00:03:37.900> here<00:03:38.470> both<00:03:38.770> the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
works let's try to add one here both the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.040 
works let's try to add one here both the
search<00:03:39.100> for<00:03:39.310> bookmarks<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.270> see<00:03:40.780> if<00:03:40.900> it

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
search for bookmarks and and see if it

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.630 
search for bookmarks and and see if it
can<00:03:41.230> find<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.890> because<00:03:42.190> there<00:03:42.340> are<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.489> whole

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
can find that because there are a whole

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.580 
can find that because there are a whole
lot<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.820> bookmark<00:03:43.239> add-on<00:03:43.570> might<00:03:44.200> not<00:03:44.380> work

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
lot of bookmark add-on might not work

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.160 
lot of bookmark add-on might not work
again<00:03:45.100> this<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:45.850> pre<00:03:46.090> alpha<00:03:46.270> this<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.690> very

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
again this is pre alpha this is very

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.050 
again this is pre alpha this is very
bleeding<00:03:47.709> edge<00:03:47.860> kind<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.459> stuff<00:03:48.670> but<00:03:48.940> that's

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
bleeding edge kind of stuff but that's

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.470 
bleeding edge kind of stuff but that's
what<00:03:49.270> we<00:03:49.330> like<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.510> bring<00:03:49.690> you

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
what we like to bring you

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.890 
what we like to bring you
so<00:03:51.140> bookmark<00:03:52.000> we'll<00:03:53.000> see<00:03:53.300> it<00:03:53.540> might<00:03:53.659> have<00:03:53.870> a

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
so bookmark we'll see it might have a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.699 
so bookmark we'll see it might have a
connection<00:03:54.230> problem<00:03:56.230> hmm<00:03:57.230> searching

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
connection problem hmm searching

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.589 
connection problem hmm searching
couldn't<00:03:58.370> retrieve<00:03:58.640> add-ons<00:03:59.000> all<00:03:59.239> right<00:03:59.360> fine

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
couldn't retrieve add-ons all right fine

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.479 
couldn't retrieve add-ons all right fine
but<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.560> does<00:04:00.680> work<00:04:00.860> that's<00:04:01.099> how<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.220> got<00:04:01.400> the

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
but it does work that's how I got the

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.720 
but it does work that's how I got the
weave<00:04:01.610> sync<00:04:01.879> so<00:04:03.220> hopefully<00:04:04.220> I<00:04:04.250> can<00:04:04.400> get<00:04:04.610> that

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
weave sync so hopefully I can get that

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.449 
weave sync so hopefully I can get that
to<00:04:04.909> sync<00:04:05.150> up<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.599> basically<00:04:06.290> have<00:04:06.530> my<00:04:06.769> desktop

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
to sync up and basically have my desktop

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.350 
to sync up and basically have my desktop
here<00:04:07.670> on<00:04:08.090> my<00:04:08.330> phone<00:04:08.540> how<00:04:09.379> cool<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.769> that

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
here on my phone how cool is that

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.580 
here on my phone how cool is that
scrolling<00:04:11.360> actually<00:04:11.720> works<00:04:11.870> pretty<00:04:11.989> well<00:04:12.200> and

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
scrolling actually works pretty well and

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.650 
scrolling actually works pretty well and
again<00:04:13.010> we<00:04:13.190> expect<00:04:13.549> that<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.940> get<00:04:14.269> much

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
again we expect that to get much

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.439 
again we expect that to get much
smoother<00:04:15.140> over<00:04:15.440> time<00:04:15.650> do<00:04:16.070> not<00:04:16.340> take<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.150> as<00:04:17.389> a

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
smoother over time do not take this as a

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.390 
smoother over time do not take this as a
representation<00:04:18.019> of<00:04:18.680> what<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:18.979> browser<00:04:19.220> will

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
representation of what the browser will

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.909 
representation of what the browser will
ultimately<00:04:20.030> look<00:04:20.299> like<00:04:20.510> right<00:04:20.769> we<00:04:21.769> would

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
ultimately look like right we would

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.650 
ultimately look like right we would
assume<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.550> get<00:04:22.699> multi-touch<00:04:23.120> at<00:04:23.300> some<00:04:23.449> point

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
assume to get multi-touch at some point

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.290 
assume to get multi-touch at some point
to<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:24.770> landscape<00:04:25.370> does<00:04:25.639> work<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:26.030> can<00:04:26.120> flip

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
to it landscape does work you can flip

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
to it landscape does work you can flip
it<00:04:26.330> over<00:04:26.539> and<00:04:26.660> look<00:04:26.810> how<00:04:26.930> quickly<00:04:27.199> that

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
it over and look how quickly that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.740 
it over and look how quickly that
switched<00:04:28.160> I<00:04:28.460> mean<00:04:28.639> that<00:04:28.789> was<00:04:29.000> just<00:04:29.510> no

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
switched I mean that was just no

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.980 
switched I mean that was just no
hesitation<00:04:30.410> at<00:04:30.500> all<00:04:31.210> there<00:04:32.210> that's<00:04:32.600> about<00:04:32.750> as

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
hesitation at all there that's about as

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.870 
hesitation at all there that's about as
close<00:04:33.139> as<00:04:33.289> we<00:04:33.410> can<00:04:33.500> zoom<00:04:33.740> in<00:04:33.949> that's<00:04:34.699> pretty

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
close as we can zoom in that's pretty

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.029 
close as we can zoom in that's pretty
readable<00:04:35.270> hopefully<00:04:36.020> we<00:04:36.199> can<00:04:36.350> get<00:04:36.620> proper

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
readable hopefully we can get proper

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.240 
readable hopefully we can get proper
zoom<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.520> really<00:04:38.419> get<00:04:38.570> in<00:04:38.690> on<00:04:38.840> things<00:04:39.250> let's

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
zoom and really get in on things let's

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.960 
zoom and really get in on things let's
go<00:04:40.460> do<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:41.270> acid<00:04:41.840> three<00:04:42.110> test<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.979> is<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.610> test

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
go do the acid three test this is a test

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.790 
go do the acid three test this is a test
if<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.210> don't<00:04:44.479> know<00:04:44.660> about<00:04:44.900> browsing<00:04:45.530> this<00:04:45.680> is

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
if you don't know about browsing this is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.850 
if you don't know about browsing this is
a<00:04:45.830> test<00:04:46.130> that<00:04:46.750> checks<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:48.020> see<00:04:48.169> how<00:04:48.320> well<00:04:48.590> a

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
a test that checks to see how well a

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.310 
a test that checks to see how well a
page<00:04:49.100> our<00:04:49.520> browser<00:04:50.060> actually<00:04:50.419> renders<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:50.990> page

right<00:04:51.590> how<00:04:51.830> accurately<00:04:52.370> if<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:53.000> does<00:04:53.150> all<00:04:53.300> the

right how accurately if it does all the

right how accurately if it does all the
things<00:04:53.630> that's<00:04:53.780> supposed<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.710> oh<00:04:55.430> look<00:04:55.849> at

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
things that's supposed to and oh look at

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.810 
things that's supposed to and oh look at
that<00:04:56.440> accidents<00:04:57.440> work<00:04:57.860> that's<00:04:58.130> not<00:04:58.310> right<00:04:58.520> and

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
that accidents work that's not right and

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.219 
that accidents work that's not right and
the<00:04:59.180> trackball<00:04:59.510> didn't<00:04:59.780> work<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.110> that's

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
the trackball didn't work so that's

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.300 
the trackball didn't work so that's
something<00:05:00.500> that<00:05:00.620> doesn't<00:05:00.979> work<00:05:01.099> in<00:05:01.250> the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
something that doesn't work in the

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.930 
something that doesn't work in the
browser<00:05:01.520> again<00:05:02.030> pre<00:05:02.870> pre<00:05:03.139> alpha<00:05:03.320> so<00:05:04.099> nobody

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
browser again pre pre alpha so nobody

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.560 
browser again pre pre alpha so nobody
freaked<00:05:05.210> out<00:05:05.710> acid<00:05:06.710> test<00:05:06.919> dot<00:05:07.099> org<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.880> let's

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
freaked out acid test dot org and let's

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.110 
freaked out acid test dot org and let's
go<00:05:08.840> take<00:05:09.200> a<00:05:09.260> look<00:05:09.530> this<00:05:10.340> is<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.580> acid<00:05:10.760> free

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120
