00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.470
 before the assistance of the different 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.960
 sectors we set out the space for 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.990
 this first meeting of the conference 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.209

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.070
 or for peace 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:23.380
 and we are arranging all the arrangements 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.080
 of logistics equipment and 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 protocols for what 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.340
 all are properly seated and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.990
 this 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.000
 better located 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.989
 this call to the different 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.920
 sectors 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:52.250
 religious business 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.370
 institutional politicians personalities 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.300
 sectors and social movements 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.300
 artistic and intellectual 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.290
 We have done it with the best good 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.880
 Will 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.870
 first of all because I think 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.340
 deeply in the dialogue 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.020
 as a way to the solution 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.020
 and treatment of conflicts 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.390
 in the world that we are living 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.000
 political conflicts can not be 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.390
 solve with weapons or by the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.390
 violence 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.860
 always have to look for the way 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.960
 our life is this 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:41.160
 is an assumed adopted constitution 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.160
 respected today throughout the country 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.570
 they say it 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.460
 not only the surveys tell us the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.240
 trust that there is 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.740
 in the political life of the country 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.750
 it says the participation in 19 processes 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.750
 elections in the last 15 years 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.610
 recently in December we broke 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.070
 record of participation in an event of 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.440
 municipal character that always in 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.890
 our country and in other countries of 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.530
 our neighborhood have levels 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.160
 minimum political participation 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.360
 electoral 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.880
 so here is our peace guide the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.100
 Constitution our peace charter 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.330
 to solve conflicts 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.870
 different differences 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.019
 of any kind 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.569
 that's why we call and summon 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.770
 this national peace conference to all 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.390
 the Venezuelans 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.950
 without conditions I have not put 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.800
 condition to none of you for 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 summon them my agenda 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.890
 neither conditioning, I have not 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.960
 called for us to build a 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.960
 peace agenda among all 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.270
 it is possible it was already possible 15 years ago 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.270
 we build a peace agenda 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.780
 what is the constitution 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.780
 it is possible now clear that if possible 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.600
 because the essence of the Venezuelan being a 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.600
 pure good essence 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.170
 I call the maximum tolerance 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.939
 today we are going to say games here 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.239
 samaranch welcome 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.590
 yes, everyone who speaks always has to 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.870
 look for a point d 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:48.920
 Maximum respect height can always be 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.550
 said our partner willian lara 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.250
 quoting bolÃ­var with mode everything can be 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.410
 he liked to repeat at meetings 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.890
 forever 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.850
 how everything can be 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.010
 let's say what we have 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.010
 let's tell our truths 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.580
 let's do an example exercise here of 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.859
 tolerance 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:20.579
 without shutting up what we have to say 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.449
 on the contrary tolerance based on the 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.449
 divergence 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.699
 of ideas of project models 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.310
 so this is a call a 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.639
 call to build an agenda 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.639
 of peace
