as you can see with the part I actually

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.359 
as you can see with the part I actually

already used some concealer and put it
in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> park<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> part<00:01:18.689> looks<00:01:18.900> more

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110

excuse my phone and because this is the
natural<00:01:23.790> wavy<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.509> why<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.930> kind<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
natural wavy that's why it's kind of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.090 
natural wavy that's why it's kind of
already<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.560> some<00:01:26.070> kind<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:27.439> movement<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.890> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
main reason and grabbing this piece was

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.069 
main reason and grabbing this piece was
because<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.280> only<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.210> hundred<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> fifty

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
because it was only a hundred and fifty

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.130 
because it was only a hundred and fifty
dollars<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:56.600> basically<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.719> virgin
