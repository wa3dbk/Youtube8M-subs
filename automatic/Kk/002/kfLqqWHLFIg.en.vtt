 we do so many rounds without repetitions 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.930
 Of course you need a wonderful one 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.780
 partner the corresponding body tension 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.640
 The partner sets can be 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.019
 for you, you have something 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.310
 bit the leg here and goes 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.810
 with your arm here a bit 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 your partner can do this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 So let in here a bit 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.979
 Let it go a bit 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.610
 with the other one under the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.950
 other poor and always attacks 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.180
 if you have the partners this needs 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.650
 relax a bit, of course 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.509
 body tension so you're fine here 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.509
 then can keep the squat 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.799
 what were the partners such short 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.330
 after that comes 12 push ups you can 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.270
 of course, make prior push-ups 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.850
 or any variations of it 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.650
 one-armed handstand which supported and 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.650
 great in the end 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.979
 I'll show you the same again 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.720
 I do not have a mountain like me now 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.459
 already mentioned at the beginning of the series 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.370
 the hotel has this room here for us 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.810
 provided because we 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.730
 luckily in such a cellar hole 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.430
 are stationed behind the kitchen and it 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.590
 a little bit small room 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.910
 that 's why i will be here with the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.630
 rod or so with the lamp 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.250
 and yes, that was almost the workout of 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.019
 1515 six courts with your partner or 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.360

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.850
 for twelve push ups or prix push ups 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.660
 and 9 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:49.580
 then as a start made ten minutes in the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.070
 rap and you do 15 shortly before ten 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.540

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.579

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.780

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.680
 a squeezed feet together 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.760
 build up tension and back up 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.709

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.760
 conception 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.099

 the lamp was so heavy that me 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.580
 Only five pieces will create 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.660
 that was the number one workout for the 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:31.560
 Advents the beginners make almost 15 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:33.410
