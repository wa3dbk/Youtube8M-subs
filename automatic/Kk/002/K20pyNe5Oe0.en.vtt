00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
called and asked me about insulation and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.359 
called and asked me about insulation and
he<00:00:15.360> was<00:00:15.509> talking<00:00:15.870> about<00:00:15.900> his<00:00:16.139> attic<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.770> he

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
he was talking about his attic and he

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.920 
he was talking about his attic and he
asked<00:00:17.760> me<00:00:17.910> what<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.359> difference<00:00:18.840> between

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
asked me what is the difference between

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.150 
asked me what is the difference between
closed<00:00:19.890> cell<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.939> open<00:00:21.449> cell<00:00:21.810> insulation<00:00:22.800> can

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
closed cell and open cell insulation can

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.700 
closed cell and open cell insulation can
you<00:00:23.220> answer<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.350> said<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:25.619> for

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
you answer that and you said it's for

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.339 
you answer that and you said it's for
the<00:00:25.830> Attic<00:00:26.160> mm-hmm<00:00:26.730> okay<00:00:27.000> well<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.660> open

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the Attic mm-hmm okay well actually open

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.929 
the Attic mm-hmm okay well actually open
cell<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.710> closed<00:00:28.859> cell<00:00:29.099> doesn't<00:00:29.640> make<00:00:29.849> any

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
cell and closed cell doesn't make any

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.220 
cell and closed cell doesn't make any
difference<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.359> an<00:00:30.480> attic<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:30.929> any<00:00:31.050> other

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
difference it's an attic or any other

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.110 
difference it's an attic or any other
place<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> use<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.669> difference

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
place that you use it the difference

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.420 
place that you use it the difference
between<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.690> two<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.260> both<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.860> two-part

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
between the two it's both a two-part

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.400 
between the two it's both a two-part
urethane<00:00:35.610> foam<00:00:36.090> that's<00:00:36.360> actually<00:00:36.780> they're

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
urethane foam that's actually they're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.979 
urethane foam that's actually they're
actually<00:00:37.770> manufacturing<00:00:38.370> foam<00:00:38.840> at<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
actually manufacturing foam at the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.450 
actually manufacturing foam at the
jobsite<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.770> actually<00:00:41.040> being<00:00:41.190> produced

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
jobsite it's actually being produced

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400 
jobsite it's actually being produced
right<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.780> actually<00:00:42.870> two<00:00:43.140> parts

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
right there so it's actually two parts

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
right there so it's actually two parts
that<00:00:43.530> are<00:00:43.649> made<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.430> difference<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that are made the difference is in the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.850 
that are made the difference is in the
industry<00:00:45.809> standards<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.530> call<00:00:46.680> two

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
industry standards is what they call two

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.889 
industry standards is what they call two
pound<00:00:47.129> foam<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.480> pounds<00:00:48.750> per<00:00:48.870> cubic

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
pound foam which is two pounds per cubic

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.319 
pound foam which is two pounds per cubic
foot<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.520> call<00:00:50.670> closed<00:00:50.910> cell<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
foot is what we call closed cell the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.180 
foot is what we call closed cell the
other<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.020> half<00:00:52.350> pound<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> lot

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
other is a half pound so it's a lot

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.450 
other is a half pound so it's a lot
lighter<00:00:53.399> weight<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.510> open<00:00:54.870> cell<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.500> stay

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
lighter weight so open cell is stay

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.920 
lighter weight so open cell is stay
spongy<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.210> could<00:00:57.329> almost<00:00:57.449> use<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
spongy you could almost use it like a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.709 
spongy you could almost use it like a
pillow<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.410> very<00:00:58.680> springy<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
pillow it's very springy and so the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.240 
pillow it's very springy and so the
thing<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.230> biggest<00:01:01.530> difference<00:01:01.829> between<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
thing the biggest difference between the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
thing the biggest difference between the
two<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.520> them<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.910> gets<00:01:03.180> very<00:01:03.420> rigid<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
two of them is one gets very rigid and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.420 
two of them is one gets very rigid and
hard<00:01:04.080> everybody<00:01:04.350> knows<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:04.769> great<00:01:05.129> stuff

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
hard everybody knows about great stuff

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.679 
hard everybody knows about great stuff
and<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.700> type<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> thing<00:01:06.060> that's<00:01:06.150> kind<00:01:06.630> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and that type of thing that's kind of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.390 
and that type of thing that's kind of
what<00:01:06.869> closed<00:01:07.170> cell<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> version<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
what closed cell is a version of that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.670 
what closed cell is a version of that
and<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.600> open<00:01:09.810> cells<00:01:10.049> say<00:01:10.229> something<00:01:10.590> that's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and the open cells say something that's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
and the open cells say something that's
very<00:01:10.860> spongy<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.790> that's<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> biggest

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
very spongy and that's the biggest

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.960 
very spongy and that's the biggest
difference<00:01:12.900> between<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.260> two<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.729> what

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
difference between the two so in what

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.740 
difference between the two so in what
application<00:01:15.750> would<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.170> use<00:01:16.470> either<00:01:17.220> one

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
application would you use either one

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.469 
application would you use either one
well<00:01:19.369> open<00:01:20.369> cell<00:01:20.580> either<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.270> works

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
well open cell either one of them works

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
well open cell either one of them works
very<00:01:21.720> well<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:21.960> filling<00:01:22.920> voids<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
very well for filling voids that you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.980 
very well for filling voids that you
can't<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.270> other<00:01:24.450> ends<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
can't get into with other ends of it and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.160 
can't get into with other ends of it and
the<00:01:25.170> idea<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.729> insulation<00:01:27.570> isn't

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the idea is most your insulation isn't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
the idea is most your insulation isn't
so<00:01:28.259> much<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> r-value<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.280> resistance<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so much of the r-value the resistance to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
so much of the r-value the resistance to
heat<00:01:30.000> loss<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.240> heat<00:01:30.540> gain<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.220> air

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
heat loss and heat gain as it is the air

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.590 
heat loss and heat gain as it is the air
infiltration<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:33.090> comes<00:01:33.299> through<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
infiltration that comes through the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.609 
infiltration that comes through the
house<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.439> we're<00:01:34.530> trying

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
house so that's really what we're trying

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.800 
house so that's really what we're trying
to<00:01:34.770> stop<00:01:35.119> closed-cell<00:01:36.119> does<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> lot<00:01:36.600> better

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to stop closed-cell does a lot better

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.109 
to stop closed-cell does a lot better
job<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.439> because<00:01:37.710> any<00:01:37.979> application<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
job of it because any application of it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.859 
job of it because any application of it
and<00:01:39.299> anything<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:41.540> stop<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> air

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and anything on it will stop the air

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
and anything on it will stop the air
movement<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.130> need<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.610> up

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
movement and you actually need to get up

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
movement and you actually need to get up
to<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> half<00:01:45.240> inches<00:01:45.570> minimum<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.380> an

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
to two and a half inches minimum on an

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.429 
to two and a half inches minimum on an
open<00:01:46.979> cell<00:01:47.250> before<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> stop<00:01:48.659> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
open cell before it's going to stop so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139 
open cell before it's going to stop so
yeah<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> open<00:01:50.610> cells<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.939> bunch

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
yeah think of is it open cells a bunch

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.859 
yeah think of is it open cells a bunch
of<00:01:51.210> open<00:01:51.979> open<00:01:52.979> particles<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
of open open particles and so it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.810 
of open open particles and so it
actually<00:01:55.079> let<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.500> take<00:01:55.619> some<00:01:55.829> moisture<00:01:56.219> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
actually let it take some moisture so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550 
actually let it take some moisture so
one<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> things<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.780> manufacturers

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
one of the things that manufacturers

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.249 
one of the things that manufacturers
actually<00:01:58.920> say<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.990> will

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
actually say is that is it will

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.819 
actually say is that is it will
distribute<00:02:01.820> moisture<00:02:02.820> through<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.420> evenly

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
distribute moisture through it evenly

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.899 
distribute moisture through it evenly
and<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.250> should<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> building

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and it should be up to the building

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.190 
and it should be up to the building
architect<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> make<00:02:06.570> sure<00:02:06.750> well<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.049> most

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
architect to make sure well in most

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.449 
architect to make sure well in most
cases<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.829> we're<00:02:07.950> talking<00:02:08.220> about<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
cases what we're talking about is

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.339 
cases what we're talking about is
retrofitting<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> we've<00:02:09.959> already<00:02:10.110> got

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
retrofitting and we've already got

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.089 
retrofitting and we've already got
problems

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
problems

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.550 
problems
so<00:02:11.520> why<00:02:11.730> rely<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.090> open<00:02:12.330> cell<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so why rely on open cell and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.809 
so why rely on open cell and
trying<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.890> divert<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.310> way<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> water<00:02:14.700> is

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
trying to divert the way the water is

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.240 
trying to divert the way the water is
closed-cell<00:02:15.510> goes<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.989> you're<00:02:16.680> sealing<00:02:16.980> it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
closed-cell goes in you're sealing it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.070 
closed-cell goes in you're sealing it
off<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:18.060> making<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> rigid<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.780> actually

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
off it's making a rigid and actually

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.510 
off it's making a rigid and actually
literally<00:02:19.349> makes<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.620> house<00:02:19.800> stronger<00:02:20.370> if

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
literally makes the house stronger if

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520 
literally makes the house stronger if
you're<00:02:20.700> open<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.060> into<00:02:21.239> an<00:02:21.330> open<00:02:21.720> cavity<00:02:22.140> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
you're open going into an open cavity it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.570 
you're open going into an open cavity it
makes<00:02:22.709> whatever<00:02:22.860> structures<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.459> there

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
makes whatever structures in there

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.290 
makes whatever structures in there
stronger<00:02:23.910> too

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
stronger too

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.630 
stronger too
so<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.860> crawlspace<00:02:26.400> or<00:02:27.000> attic<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:27.660> a

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
so in a crawlspace or attic on a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.009 
so in a crawlspace or attic on a
existing<00:02:29.640> home<00:02:29.880> that's<00:02:30.390> an<00:02:30.540> older<00:02:30.840> home

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
existing home that's an older home

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.979 
existing home that's an older home
you're<00:02:31.800> saying<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.880> would<00:02:33.180> recommend<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
you're saying you would recommend a

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.140 
you're saying you would recommend a
closed<00:02:34.470> cell<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.370> would<00:02:35.489> definitely<00:02:35.610> go<00:02:35.910> close

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
closed cell it would definitely go close

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.000 
closed cell it would definitely go close
so<00:02:36.330> we<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.630> we<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.349> lot<00:02:37.500> better<00:02:37.590> job<00:02:37.830> at

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
so we can we can do a lot better job at

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.800 
so we can we can do a lot better job at
do<00:02:38.099> an<00:02:38.220> air<00:02:38.370> sealing<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.120> go<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.390> lesser

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
do an air sealing we can go to a lesser

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.559 
do an air sealing we can go to a lesser
r-value<00:02:40.500> unless<00:02:40.830> you're<00:02:40.980> inches<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
r-value unless you're inches that is the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.580 
r-value unless you're inches that is the
other<00:02:42.690> difference<00:02:42.870> between<00:02:43.200> open<00:02:43.440> sound

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
other difference between open sound

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.550 
other difference between open sound
closed<00:02:43.890> cell<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:45.239> our<00:02:45.390> value<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.200> almost

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
closed cell is that our value is almost

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.309 
closed cell is that our value is almost
half<00:02:47.430> an<00:02:47.790> open<00:02:48.180> cell<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.930> closed<00:02:49.140> cell

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
half an open cell that is in closed cell

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.110 
half an open cell that is in closed cell
you<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.709> need<00:02:49.890> almost<00:02:50.100> twice<00:02:50.459> as<00:02:50.670> thick<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
you so you need almost twice as thick a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.059 
you so you need almost twice as thick a
product<00:02:51.569> as<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.410> with<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> closed<00:02:52.830> cell

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
product as you do with the closed cell

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.130 
product as you do with the closed cell
so<00:02:53.760> again<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.090> makes<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.330> stronger<00:02:54.600> does<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
so again it makes it stronger does a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.280 
so again it makes it stronger does a
better<00:02:55.319> job<00:02:55.440> air<00:02:55.739> sealing<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.930> seals<00:02:58.140> all

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
better job air sealing and it seals all

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.570 
better job air sealing and it seals all
the<00:02:58.319> LD<00:02:58.950> air<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.160> that's<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.430> most

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
the LD air that that's the most

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.339 
the LD air that that's the most
important<00:02:59.970> thing<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.750> cost<00:03:00.989> about<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
important thing is the cost about the

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.759 
important thing is the cost about the
same<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.660> place<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.349> will<00:03:04.440> be<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.650> you're

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
same to in place it will be if you're

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.199 
same to in place it will be if you're
trying<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:04.980> achieve<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.640> same<00:03:05.670> amount<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.060> our

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
trying to achieve the same amount of our

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.960 
trying to achieve the same amount of our
value<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.530> because<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.640> does<00:03:08.760> take<00:03:08.940> more

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
value now so because it does take more

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.089 
value now so because it does take more
product<00:03:09.450> alright<00:03:10.380> well<00:03:10.590> thank<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.920> for
