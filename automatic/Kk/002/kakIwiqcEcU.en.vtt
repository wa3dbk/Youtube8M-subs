I<00:00:00.290> mean<00:00:01.290> there's<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.829> there's<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.669> false

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
I mean there's this there's a false

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.260 
I mean there's this there's a false

assumption about science operating here

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.770 
assumption about science operating here
science<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.140> not<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.560> principle<00:00:08.660> committed<00:00:09.660> to

science is not in principle committed to

the brain and death that would be part
of<00:00:37.079> our<00:00:37.260> growing<00:00:37.500> scientific<00:00:37.829> understanding

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of our growing scientific understanding

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.080 
of our growing scientific understanding
of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> world<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.840> could<00:00:40.050> discover<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.620> now

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
of the world if we could discover it now

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.430 
of the world if we could discover it now
and<00:00:42.090> there's<00:00:42.300> their<00:00:42.600> way<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.079> could<00:00:43.350> in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and there's their way as we could in

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
and there's their way as we could in
fact<00:00:43.469> discover<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> were<00:00:44.640> true<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
fact discover that if it were true the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.240 
fact discover that if it were true the
problem<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.739> there<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:47.039> good<00:00:47.070> reasons

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
problem is there are very good reasons

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
problem is there are very good reasons
to<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.090> true<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.379> this

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
to think it's not true and we know this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.250 
to think it's not true and we know this
from<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.520> 150<00:00:51.239> years<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> neurology<00:00:52.050> where

the names of tools I mean there's the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.070 
the names of tools I mean there's the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
asked to consider is that you damage one

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.940 
asked to consider is that you damage one
part<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> brain<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.540> mind<00:01:30.950> something

part of the brain and the mind something

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.069 
part of the brain and the mind something
about<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.310> mind<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.729> subjectivity<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.840> lost

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
about the mind and subjectivity is lost

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.530 
about the mind and subjectivity is lost
you<00:01:34.619> damage<00:01:34.950> another<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.000> yet<00:01:36.210> more<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you damage another and and yet more is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.420 
you damage another and and yet more is
lost<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.079> yet<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.619> damage<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.220> whole

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
lost and yet if you damage the whole

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.690 
lost and yet if you damage the whole
thing<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.970> death<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.590> can<00:01:40.590> rise<00:01:40.890> off<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.460> brain

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
thing at death we can rise off the brain

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.569 
thing at death we can rise off the brain
with<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.450> our<00:01:42.600> faculties<00:01:43.200> intact

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
with all our faculties intact

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:54.100 
with all our faculties intact
recognizing<00:01:44.579> grandma<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.210> speaking<00:01:45.600> English

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.020 

and<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:55.380> much<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:55.920> important<00:01:56.550> point<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and I think much more important point is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.750 
and I think much more important point is
if<00:01:57.330> everything<00:01:57.870> you're<00:01:58.170> saying<00:01:58.440> about<00:01:58.860> your

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
if everything you're saying about your

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.670 
if everything you're saying about your
religious<00:02:00.240> orientation<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.080> true<00:02:01.380> because
