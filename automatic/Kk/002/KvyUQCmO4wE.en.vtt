improving<00:00:49.760> at<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.940> game<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.410> yeah<00:00:52.410> it's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
improving at this game but yeah it's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.420 
improving at this game but yeah it's
taken<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> while<00:00:53.719> here<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.430> splitting

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
taken a while here we go just splitting

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.939 
taken a while here we go just splitting
up<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> suvs<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.210> getting<00:00:58.199> ready<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
up all the suvs and getting ready for a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.209 
up all the suvs and getting ready for a
build<00:00:59.219> order<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.670> pair<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.510> game<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
build order a pair this game really is

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.539 
build order a pair this game really is
not<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.390> off<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.799> been<00:01:04.979> walling<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.369> in

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
not to all off I have been walling up in

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.730 
not to all off I have been walling up in
this<00:01:05.640> map<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> lately<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.590> that's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
this map of it lately and I think that's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 
this map of it lately and I think that's
a<00:01:07.830> real<00:01:07.979> mistake<00:01:08.280> because<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.479> wall<00:01:09.689> next

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
a real mistake because the the wall next

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
a real mistake because the the wall next
to<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:11.340> natural<00:01:11.700> expansion<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.479> quite<00:01:12.659> wide

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to your natural expansion is quite wide

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.679 
to your natural expansion is quite wide
and<00:01:13.110> far<00:01:13.229> away<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.710> base<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and far away from your base and the the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
and far away from your base and the the
second<00:01:16.020> choke<00:01:16.170> point<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
second choke point the more in the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
second choke point the more in the
innermost<00:01:17.729> choke<00:01:18.060> point<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.420> actually<00:01:18.750> so

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
innermost choke point is actually so

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
innermost choke point is actually so
small<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.250> easily<00:01:20.400> defend<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
small you can easily defend it with a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
small you can easily defend it with a
couple<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> Marines<00:01:22.189> so<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.400> really

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
couple of Marines so it's not really

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.160 
couple of Marines so it's not really
worth<00:01:23.820> walling<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.450> one-on-one<00:01:24.630> game

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
worth walling in on a one-on-one game

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.359 
worth walling in on a one-on-one game
when<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.500> don't<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.799> where<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.040> opponent

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
when you don't know where your opponent

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.789 
when you don't know where your opponent
is<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.759> they're<00:01:26.880> doing<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:28.710> going

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
is and what they're doing so not going

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.520 
is and what they're doing so not going
to<00:01:28.860> wall<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.990> remember<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> Protoss

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
to wall in remember it's a Protoss

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.749 
to wall in remember it's a Protoss
player<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.479> not<00:01:33.479> too<00:01:34.110> worried<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:35.189> he<00:01:35.400> goes

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
player so not too worried if he goes

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
player so not too worried if he goes

the<00:02:00.570> barracks<00:02:00.810> first<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.439> happens

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the barracks first so this all happens

scouting<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> bit<00:02:09.119> late<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.390> game<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.780> just

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
scouting a bit late this game is just

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.990 
scouting a bit late this game is just
because<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.380> really<00:02:10.649> wanted<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.819> get

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
because I really wanted to just get

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.040 
because I really wanted to just get
everything<00:02:12.330> rolling<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.690> quick<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:12.989> possible

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
everything rolling as quick as possible

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.479 
everything rolling as quick as possible
and<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.530> wasn't<00:02:13.770> really<00:02:13.920> too<00:02:14.040> worried<00:02:14.280> about<00:02:14.340> a

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
and it wasn't really too worried about a

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.940 
and it wasn't really too worried about a
rush<00:02:14.700> because<00:02:15.230> again<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> choke<00:02:16.590> point<00:02:16.620> on

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
rush because again the choke point on

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.830 
rush because again the choke point on
this<00:02:17.099> map<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.430> actually<00:02:17.849> quite<00:02:17.970> small<00:02:18.360> next<00:02:18.750> to

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this map is actually quite small next to

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.870 
this map is actually quite small next to
base<00:02:19.050> there<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.410> right<00:02:19.440> there<00:02:19.610> as<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.790> can

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
base there it is right there as you can

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.550 
base there it is right there as you can
see<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.150> small<00:02:21.360> enough<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.569> fit<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:22.019> like<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
see it's small enough to fit in like a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.040 
see it's small enough to fit in like a
supply<00:02:22.890> depot<00:02:22.920> us<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.340> again<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.180> probe<00:02:24.810> has

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
supply depot us on again so probe has

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.800 
supply depot us on again so probe has
already<00:02:25.680> arrived<00:02:26.300> one<00:02:27.300> thing<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.630> do

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
already arrived one thing I like to do

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.559 
already arrived one thing I like to do
is<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.500> order<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.950> avoid<00:02:29.940> me<00:02:30.269> being

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
is just in order to avoid me being

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.030 
is just in order to avoid me being
distracted<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.019> make<00:02:31.140> mistakes<00:02:31.500> just<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.860> send

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
distracted to make mistakes just to send

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.870 
distracted to make mistakes just to send
one<00:02:32.280> sob<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.150> chase<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.480> around<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.810> base<00:02:33.959> and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
one sob to chase it around the base and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.250 
one sob to chase it around the base and
that's<00:02:35.880> probably<00:02:36.180> not<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.450> best<00:02:36.540> way<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.080> do

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
that's probably not the best way to do

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.470 
that's probably not the best way to do
it<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.489> mean<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.060> wait<00:02:39.299> until

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
it this I mean you can just wait until

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.390 
it this I mean you can just wait until
the<00:02:39.660> probe<00:02:39.900> starts<00:02:40.380> or<00:02:40.500> ice<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.739> then<00:02:41.040> defend

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
the probe starts or ice you then defend

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.210 
the probe starts or ice you then defend
but<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.299> just<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.500> know<00:02:43.530> select<00:02:44.010> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
but I just like to you know select a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.680 
but I just like to you know select a
Mississippi<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:44.700> order<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.150> attack<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> probe

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
Mississippi in order to attack the probe

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.570 
Mississippi in order to attack the probe
that<00:02:45.810> way<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:46.830> forget<00:02:46.980> about<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.340> I

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
that way I can just forget about it I

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.520 
that way I can just forget about it I
can<00:02:47.910> make<00:02:48.690> sure<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.080> don't<00:02:49.260> make<00:02:49.350> any

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
can make sure that I don't make any

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.539 
can make sure that I don't make any
mistakes<00:02:49.799> anywhere<00:02:50.040> else<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.250> make<00:02:50.400> sure<00:02:50.430> I

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
mistakes anywhere else and make sure I

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.100 
mistakes anywhere else and make sure I
get<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> factory<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.180> at<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.630> right<00:02:51.750> time<00:02:51.989> and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
get the factory up at the right time and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.820 
get the factory up at the right time and
everything<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.989> making<00:02:55.560> sure<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
everything so just making sure the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.170 
everything so just making sure the
probes<00:02:56.040> out<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.310> way<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.670> I've<00:02:57.060> got

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
probes out of the way and that I've got

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.610 
probes out of the way and that I've got
enough<00:02:57.360> minerals<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.989> there's<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> factory

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
enough minerals and there's the factory

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.309 
enough minerals and there's the factory
going<00:02:58.799> up<00:02:58.950> first<00:02:59.540> very<00:03:00.540> very<00:03:00.750> standard<00:03:01.170> stuff

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
going up first very very standard stuff

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.050 
going up first very very standard stuff
I<00:03:01.470> always<00:03:01.680> do<00:03:01.799> this<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.220> terran<00:03:02.640> vs<00:03:02.880> protoss

from<00:03:30.930> my<00:03:31.049> factory<00:03:31.440> is<00:03:31.530> what<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.709> was<00:03:31.859> going<00:03:31.980> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
from my factory is what I was going to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.580 
from my factory is what I was going to
say<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.940> nothing<00:03:33.750> really<00:03:33.959> too<00:03:34.170> much<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.470> worry

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590

about at this point still haven't found

some more Marines now and once the
Marines<00:03:44.519> are<00:03:44.639> out<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.910> lot<00:03:45.030> easier<00:03:45.060> just

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
Marines are out it's a lot easier just

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.789 
Marines are out it's a lot easier just
got<00:03:45.959> two<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.139> them<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.410> box<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.769> that

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
got two of them just a box in that

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.410 
got two of them just a box in that
program<00:03:47.130> take<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.459> out<00:03:47.579> as<00:03:48.060> soon<00:03:48.120> as<00:03:48.329> that's

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
program take it out as soon as that's

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.330 
program take it out as soon as that's
done<00:03:48.569> just<00:03:48.900> moving<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.350> choke<00:03:49.530> point<00:03:49.560> found

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
done just moving the choke point found

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.180 
done just moving the choke point found
my<00:03:50.549> opponent's<00:03:51.030> base<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.480> looks<00:03:52.019> like<00:03:52.230> he<00:03:53.010> has

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
my opponent's base and looks like he has

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.890 
my opponent's base and looks like he has
only<00:03:53.400> built<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.910> one

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
only built the one

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.710 
only built the one
gateway<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:55.860> he<00:03:56.220> could<00:03:56.430> be<00:03:56.610> putting<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.569> some

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
gateway so he could be putting in some

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.860 
gateway so he could be putting in some
kind<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:57.959> expansion<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:59.750> haven't<00:04:00.750> even

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
kind of expansion there haven't even

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.199 
kind of expansion there haven't even
noticed<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.530> really<00:04:02.099> fast<00:04:02.310> expansion<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.939> don't

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
noticed a really fast expansion I don't

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.160 
noticed a really fast expansion I don't
really<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.510> seeing<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.810> from<00:04:03.989> POTUS

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
really like seeing that from POTUS

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.140 
really like seeing that from POTUS
players<00:04:04.470> immediately<00:04:05.189> I<00:04:05.280> changed<00:04:06.000> my

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
players immediately I changed my

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.789 
players immediately I changed my
original<00:04:06.510> plan<00:04:06.689> originally<00:04:07.439> I<00:04:07.470> was<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.650> too

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
original plan originally I was going too

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.679 
original plan originally I was going too
fast<00:04:07.860> expand<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.459> well<00:04:08.610> but<00:04:08.790> instead<00:04:09.569> i'm

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
fast expand as well but instead i'm

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.789 
fast expand as well but instead i'm
going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:10.049> go<00:04:10.170> for<00:04:10.500> another<00:04:11.220> factory<00:04:11.909> and

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
going to go for another factory and

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.869 
going to go for another factory and
really<00:04:13.799> uncomfortable<00:04:14.430> at<00:04:14.549> this<00:04:14.670> point

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
really uncomfortable at this point

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.580 
really uncomfortable at this point
because<00:04:15.030> I've<00:04:15.599> built<00:04:15.780> my<00:04:15.870> second<00:04:16.259> factory<00:04:16.560> a

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
because I've built my second factory a

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.800 
because I've built my second factory a
bit<00:04:16.799> late<00:04:17.009> because<00:04:17.940> I've<00:04:18.150> scouted<00:04:18.419> him<00:04:18.630> lay

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
bit late because I've scouted him lay

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.860 
bit late because I've scouted him lay
attempts<00:04:19.229> this<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:20.150> really<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.329> bit<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.780> a

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
attempts this is really a bit of a

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.900 
attempts this is really a bit of a
gamble<00:04:22.229> by<00:04:22.380> me<00:04:22.560> if<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:23.430> doesn't<00:04:23.759> pay<00:04:23.880> off

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
gamble by me if this doesn't pay off

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.540 
gamble by me if this doesn't pay off
then<00:04:24.300> I'll<00:04:24.419> really<00:04:24.900> be<00:04:24.960> behind<00:04:25.520> potentially<00:04:26.520> I

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
then I'll really be behind potentially I

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.980 
then I'll really be behind potentially I
won't<00:04:26.729> be<00:04:26.820> able<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.030> actually<00:04:27.180> take<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:27.690> do<00:04:27.750> any

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
won't be able to actually take I do any

there but I am going to attempt it what
I've<00:04:33.360> got<00:04:33.389> here<00:04:33.539> is<00:04:33.750> one<00:04:34.500> tank<00:04:34.770> going<00:04:35.039> research

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
I've got here is one tank going research

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.129 
I've got here is one tank going research
mines<00:04:36.000> next<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.510> just<00:04:36.630> build<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.870> lot<00:04:37.020> of

Marines and one tank and then follow

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.800 
Marines and one tank and then follow
with<00:04:40.050> vultures<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.340> bring<00:04:41.850> in<00:04:41.940> some<00:04:42.090> SUVs<00:04:42.210> my

with vultures and bring in some SUVs my
plane<00:04:43.100> another<00:04:44.100> thing<00:04:44.310> which<00:04:44.430> makes<00:04:44.460> this

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
plane another thing which makes this

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.520 
plane another thing which makes this
difficult<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.270> that<00:04:45.300> as<00:04:45.539> crossmap<00:04:46.080> I've<00:04:46.380> got

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
difficult is that as crossmap I've got

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.990 
difficult is that as crossmap I've got
actually<00:04:46.770> go<00:04:46.919> through<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.280> entire<00:04:47.370> diagonal

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
actually go through the entire diagonal

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.490 
actually go through the entire diagonal
to<00:04:48.090> get<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.300> basin<00:04:48.599> by<00:04:48.690> time<00:04:48.870> by<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.349> time

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
to get to this basin by time by the time

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.990 
to get to this basin by time by the time
I<00:04:49.590> get<00:04:49.710> there<00:04:49.770> he<00:04:50.039> may<00:04:50.190> well<00:04:50.370> have<00:04:50.580> quite<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.849> lot

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
I get there he may well have quite a lot

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.520 
I get there he may well have quite a lot
of<00:04:51.120> goons<00:04:51.389> ready<00:04:52.139> to<00:04:52.260> stop<00:04:52.500> me<00:04:52.650> so<00:04:54.110> this<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.289> not

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
of goons ready to stop me so this is not

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.779 
of goons ready to stop me so this is not

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
really advisable it done during this is

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.990 
really advisable it done during this is
the<00:04:56.849> best<00:04:57.090> way<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.740> play<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:59.070> terran<00:04:59.460> vs<00:04:59.699> protoss

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
the best way to play a terran vs protoss

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.750 
the best way to play a terran vs protoss
game<00:05:00.300> if<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.260> if<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.889> order<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.250> events<00:05:02.340> have

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
game if you if the order of events have

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.170 
game if you if the order of events have
unfolded<00:05:03.060> as<00:05:03.599> you've<00:05:03.810> seen<00:05:04.400> probably<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.789> more

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
unfolded as you've seen probably a more

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.700 
unfolded as you've seen probably a more
safer<00:05:06.449> way<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.690> gold<00:05:06.930> would<00:05:07.260> have<00:05:07.349> been<00:05:07.470> for<00:05:07.650> me

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
safer way to gold would have been for me

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.650 
safer way to gold would have been for me
to<00:05:07.800> just<00:05:08.010> expand<00:05:08.639> as<00:05:08.789> soon<00:05:09.000> as<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.240> saw<00:05:09.419> his

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
to just expand as soon as I saw his

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.510 
to just expand as soon as I saw his
expansion<00:05:10.050> because<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.979> cross<00:05:11.159> may<00:05:11.370> happen

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
expansion because the cross may happen

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.830 
expansion because the cross may happen
because<00:05:11.760> I<00:05:11.940> didn't<00:05:12.120> have<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.300> second<00:05:12.630> factory

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
because I didn't have the second factory

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.719 
because I didn't have the second factory
up<00:05:12.930> in<00:05:13.050> time<00:05:13.199> but<00:05:13.380> i'm<00:05:14.130> really<00:05:14.340> going<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.639> go

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
up in time but i'm really going to go

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.159 
up in time but i'm really going to go
all<00:05:14.909> in<00:05:15.060> here<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.419> try<00:05:15.659> to<00:05:15.750> do<00:05:15.840> as<00:05:15.930> much<00:05:15.990> damage

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
all in here and try to do as much damage

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.129 
all in here and try to do as much damage
as<00:05:16.500> i<00:05:16.620> can<00:05:17.120> best<00:05:18.120> case<00:05:18.300> scenario<00:05:18.690> is<00:05:18.810> i'll<00:05:18.990> take

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
as i can best case scenario is i'll take

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.890 
as i can best case scenario is i'll take
them<00:05:19.229> straight<00:05:19.500> up<00:05:20.389> are<00:05:21.389> probably<00:05:21.720> more

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
them straight up are probably more

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.110 
them straight up are probably more
likely<00:05:22.169> scenario<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:23.099> i<00:05:23.639> will<00:05:23.789> do<00:05:23.909> some

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
likely scenario is that i will do some

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.430 
likely scenario is that i will do some
damage<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.449> actually<00:05:24.780> kill<00:05:24.960> some<00:05:25.110> units<00:05:25.349> to

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
damage and actually kill some units to

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.469 
damage and actually kill some units to
kill<00:05:25.620> some<00:05:25.770> probes<00:05:26.070> and<00:05:26.460> just<00:05:26.970> even<00:05:27.120> things

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
kill some probes and just even things

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.469 
kill some probes and just even things
i've<00:05:27.599> bitten<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:27.990> i<00:05:28.199> won't<00:05:28.590> be<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:28.800> far<00:05:28.979> behind

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
i've bitten and i won't be so far behind

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.029 
i've bitten and i won't be so far behind
as<00:05:30.479> soon<00:05:30.750> as<00:05:30.840> this<00:05:30.960> rush<00:05:31.320> goes<00:05:31.500> out<00:05:31.680> i'm<00:05:31.860> going

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
as soon as this rush goes out i'm going

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.649 
as soon as this rush goes out i'm going
to<00:05:32.099> need<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.280> get<00:05:32.789> an<00:05:32.849> expansion<00:05:33.300> of<00:05:33.360> my<00:05:33.479> own

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
to need to get an expansion of my own

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.860 
to need to get an expansion of my own
just<00:05:34.409> in<00:05:34.530> case<00:05:34.650> it<00:05:34.830> does<00:05:34.979> fail<00:05:35.190> so<00:05:35.870> just

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
just in case it does fail so just

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.700 
just in case it does fail so just
planning<00:05:37.710> for<00:05:37.860> that<00:05:39.139> as<00:05:40.139> you've<00:05:40.380> seen<00:05:40.409> I've

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
planning for that as you've seen I've

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.439 
planning for that as you've seen I've
actually<00:05:40.860> picked<00:05:41.340> up<00:05:41.460> a<00:05:41.520> group<00:05:41.639> of<00:05:41.820> SUVs<00:05:42.300> to

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
actually picked up a group of SUVs to

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.360 
actually picked up a group of SUVs to
take<00:05:42.630> out<00:05:42.750> not<00:05:42.990> too<00:05:43.139> many<00:05:43.349> it's<00:05:44.039> just<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.340> I

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
take out not too many it's just that I

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.339 
take out not too many it's just that I
want<00:05:44.550> s<00:05:44.699> CBS<00:05:45.030> to<00:05:45.270> absorb<00:05:45.810> damage<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.260> we've

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
want s CBS to absorb damage that we've

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.310 
want s CBS to absorb damage that we've
got<00:05:46.470> 68<00:05:46.800> points<00:05:47.039> that's<00:05:47.400> plenty<00:05:47.610> and

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
got 68 points that's plenty and

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.649 
got 68 points that's plenty and
potentially<00:05:49.320> build<00:05:49.560> a<00:05:50.010> bunker<00:05:50.789> or<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.270> supply

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
potentially build a bunker or a supply

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.300 
potentially build a bunker or a supply
pits<00:05:51.900> ablative<00:05:52.440> on<00:05:52.560> a<00:05:52.590> stroke<00:05:52.919> point<00:05:53.130> just<00:05:53.250> to

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
pits ablative on a stroke point just to

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.740 
pits ablative on a stroke point just to
prevent<00:05:53.550> reinforcements<00:05:54.330> coming<00:05:54.510> in<00:05:54.659> and

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
prevent reinforcements coming in and

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.779 
prevent reinforcements coming in and
helping<00:05:54.810> them<00:05:55.020> out<00:05:55.139> and<00:05:55.520> we'll<00:05:56.520> see<00:05:56.550> how<00:05:56.699> that

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
helping them out and we'll see how that

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.930 
helping them out and we'll see how that
goes<00:05:57.020> I<00:05:58.020> like<00:05:58.710> to<00:05:58.919> just<00:05:59.280> make<00:05:59.490> sure<00:05:59.639> the<00:05:59.789> more

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
goes I like to just make sure the more

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.969 
goes I like to just make sure the more
the<00:06:00.060> vulture<00:06:00.599> doesn't<00:06:00.870> go<00:06:01.440> too<00:06:01.500> far<00:06:01.830> ahead

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
the vulture doesn't go too far ahead

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.100 
the vulture doesn't go too far ahead
because<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.699> Dragons<00:06:03.630> will<00:06:03.779> target<00:06:03.930> it

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
because the Dragons will target it

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.140 
because the Dragons will target it
straight<00:06:04.289> away<00:06:04.320> and<00:06:04.710> here's<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.820> attack<00:06:06.000> now

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
straight away and here's the attack now

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.119 
straight away and here's the attack now
so<00:06:06.360> coming<00:06:06.599> in

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
so coming in

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:08.769 
so coming in
and<00:06:07.249> make<00:06:07.580> sure<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:07.789> SUV<00:06:08.149> is<00:06:08.209> going<00:06:08.449> and<00:06:08.569> first

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
and make sure the SUV is going and first

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.199 
and make sure the SUV is going and first
absorbing<00:06:09.589> some<00:06:09.739> damage<00:06:10.009> and<00:06:10.189> this<00:06:10.909> get

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:11.209 
absorbing some damage and this get

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:12.519 
absorbing some damage and this get
allows<00:06:11.509> my<00:06:11.689> groups<00:06:11.899> to<00:06:12.020> get<00:06:12.110> into<00:06:12.229> position

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
allows my groups to get into position

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:13.570 
allows my groups to get into position
I've<00:06:12.649> actually<00:06:12.770> got<00:06:13.009> one<00:06:13.189> less<00:06:13.339> if<00:06:13.459> we're

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
I've actually got one less if we're

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.149 
I've actually got one less if we're
putting<00:06:13.819> on<00:06:13.909> a<00:06:13.939> bunker<00:06:14.239> and<00:06:14.419> the<00:06:15.349> vulture

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
putting on a bunker and the vulture

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.979 
putting on a bunker and the vulture
following<00:06:16.459> up<00:06:16.550> from<00:06:16.580> behind<00:06:16.789> and<00:06:17.119> putting<00:06:17.929> on

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:17.989 
following up from behind and putting on

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:19.419 
following up from behind and putting on
some<00:06:18.139> more<00:06:18.289> memory<00:06:18.469> or<00:06:18.619> more<00:06:18.800> months<00:06:19.039> now<00:06:19.189> I

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:19.429 
some more memory or more months now I

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:21.820 
some more memory or more months now I
actually<00:06:19.909> rallied<00:06:20.419> my<00:06:20.599> two<00:06:20.659> factories<00:06:21.379> I've

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
actually rallied my two factories I've

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.079 
actually rallied my two factories I've
got<00:06:22.039> the<00:06:22.129> market<00:06:22.399> on<00:06:22.489> four<00:06:22.699> and<00:06:22.729> five<00:06:22.909> and<00:06:22.939> i

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.089 
got the market on four and five and i

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:26.229 
got the market on four and five and i
rallied<00:06:23.389> them<00:06:23.539> to<00:06:24.110> his<00:06:25.009> space<00:06:25.279> just<00:06:25.610> to<00:06:25.849> save

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:26.239 
rallied them to his space just to save

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:27.759 
rallied them to his space just to save
myself<00:06:26.269> some<00:06:26.809> time<00:06:27.080> and<00:06:27.259> make<00:06:27.379> sure<00:06:27.409> that<00:06:27.559> they

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:27.769 
myself some time and make sure that they

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:29.919 
myself some time and make sure that they
reinforcements<00:06:28.669> arrive<00:06:28.849> straight<00:06:29.149> away<00:06:29.360> it's

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:29.929 
reinforcements arrive straight away it's

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:31.389 
reinforcements arrive straight away it's
something<00:06:30.559> you<00:06:30.709> don't<00:06:30.949> have<00:06:31.039> to<00:06:31.159> get<00:06:31.309> to

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:31.399 
something you don't have to get to

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:33.579 
something you don't have to get to
change<00:06:31.639> later<00:06:31.849> if<00:06:32.029> it<00:06:32.149> fails<00:06:32.360> but<00:06:32.589> single
