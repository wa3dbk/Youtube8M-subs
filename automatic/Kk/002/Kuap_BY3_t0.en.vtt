00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
fortunately although last night was

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.839 
fortunately although last night was
bitterly<00:02:15.900> cold<00:02:19.069> which<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.219> not<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.519> reason

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
bitterly cold which is not the reason

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.860 
bitterly cold which is not the reason
why<00:02:20.879> this<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.359> not<00:02:21.629> tidy<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.189> mess<00:02:23.870> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
why this is not tidy and and a mess that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.379 
why this is not tidy and and a mess that
the<00:02:25.049> reason<00:02:25.319> for<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.879> just

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
the reason for that is is that I'm just

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:34.309 
the reason for that is is that I'm just
untidy<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.650> mess<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.269> will<00:02:32.719> we<00:02:33.719> will<00:02:33.870> we
