know what resolution but I'm think its

know what resolution but I'm think its
nine<00:02:56.549> sixty<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.239> think<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.989> qHD<00:02:58.920> I'm<00:02:59.340> they

usually<00:02:59.849> do<00:03:00.569> that<00:03:00.599> what<00:03:01.110> their<00:03:01.230> devices<00:03:01.530> we

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
usually do that what their devices we

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.100 
usually do that what their devices we
use<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:02.069> qHD<00:03:02.760> let<00:03:03.269> CT<00:03:03.569> but<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.810> never<00:03:03.930> know<00:03:04.049> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
use a qHD let CT but you never know it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.860 
use a qHD let CT but you never know it
may<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.290> HD<00:03:04.799> display<00:03:05.130> as<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.790> say<00:03:05.970> he<00:03:06.630> actually

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
may be HD display as I say he actually

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.589 
may be HD display as I say he actually
doesn't<00:03:07.200> HD<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:08.250> maybe<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.790> 720p<00:03:09.380> display<00:03:11.599> this

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
doesn't HD so maybe a 720p display this

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.870 
doesn't HD so maybe a 720p display this
use<00:03:12.870> LTE<00:03:13.110> which<00:03:13.739> also<00:03:13.920> comes<00:03:14.130> with<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.370> sim<00:03:14.849> card

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
use LTE which also comes with a sim card

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.330 
use LTE which also comes with a sim card
through<00:03:15.600> sprint<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.590> Furcal<00:03:16.890> hours<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.190> gets

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
through sprint to Furcal hours it gets

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.949 
through sprint to Furcal hours it gets
its<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:18.140> 4G<00:03:19.140> connection<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.370> that's<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.609> plus<00:03:20.959> it

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
its a 4G connection so that's a plus it

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.170 
its a 4G connection so that's a plus it
doesn't<00:03:22.200> say<00:03:22.290> NFC<00:03:22.859> but<00:03:23.489> I'm<00:03:23.579> thinking<00:03:23.910> has

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
doesn't say NFC but I'm thinking has

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.960 
doesn't say NFC but I'm thinking has
NLCS<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.840> has<00:03:25.049> those<00:03:25.290> tags<00:03:25.650> acha<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:26.790> here

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
NLCS it has those tags acha just here

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.690 
NLCS it has those tags acha just here
usually<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.600> for<00:03:27.780> NFC<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:28.650> most<00:03:29.190> likely<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
usually it's for NFC so most likely it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.150 
usually it's for NFC so most likely it
has<00:03:29.790> NFC<00:03:30.120> for<00:03:30.450> uh<00:03:30.480> wireless<00:03:31.230> transfer<00:03:31.560> that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
has NFC for uh wireless transfer that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.289 
has NFC for uh wireless transfer that
would<00:03:32.250> be<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> plus<00:03:32.609> if<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.910> does<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:35.299> so

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
would be a plus if it does have that so

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.809 
would be a plus if it does have that so
the<00:03:36.690> phone<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.560> blue<00:03:37.859> dirt<00:03:38.220> tip<00:03:38.850> color<00:03:40.819> so

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
the phone is in a blue dirt tip color so

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.449 
the phone is in a blue dirt tip color so
that's<00:03:42.000> nice<00:03:42.530> also<00:03:43.530> has<00:03:43.620> its<00:03:43.769> like<00:03:43.859> aluminum

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
that's nice also has its like aluminum

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.930 
that's nice also has its like aluminum
side<00:03:44.970> housing<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.560> that's<00:03:46.739> good<00:03:46.980> dedicated

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
side housing so that's good dedicated

side<00:04:17.820> like<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.450> said<00:04:18.510> it's<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.780> 2070<00:04:19.769> milliamp

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489

side like I said it's a 2070 milliamp
hour<00:04:20.609> battery<00:04:20.729> so<00:04:21.599> that's<00:04:21.780> nice<00:04:21.959> still<00:04:22.409> taking

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
hour battery so that's nice still taking

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.960 
hour battery so that's nice still taking
long<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:22.890> load<00:04:23.130> unwise<00:04:23.669> to

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
long to load unwise to

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.300 
long to load unwise to
so<00:04:24.090> long<00:04:24.300> let's<00:04:24.900> give<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.080> time<00:04:25.320> since<00:04:26.100> its

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
so long let's give it time since its

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.620 
so long let's give it time since its
first<00:04:26.430> time<00:04:26.760> actually<00:04:27.540> being<00:04:28.470> operated<00:04:29.570> by<00:04:30.570> is
