2nd gen I pop pop if I already fucked it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.990 
2nd gen I pop pop if I already fucked it
up<00:00:19.410> fuck<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.880> this<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.689> 2nd<00:00:22.140> gen<00:00:22.500> zoom<00:00:23.000> so

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
up fuck this this is the 2nd gen zoom so

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
up fuck this this is the 2nd gen zoom so
of<00:00:24.119> course<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:25.050> wouldn't<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.320> fair<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.859> compare

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
of course it wouldn't be fair to compare

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.849 
of course it wouldn't be fair to compare
it<00:00:26.599> against<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.230> which<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.680> its

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
it against this one which is like its

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.400 
it against this one which is like its
6th<00:00:29.250> gen<00:00:29.699> or<00:00:29.820> something<00:00:30.119> whatever<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:31.199> ought

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
6th gen or something whatever so ought

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.620 
6th gen or something whatever so ought
to<00:00:31.650> compare<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:33.120> 2nd<00:00:33.660> gen<00:00:33.960> ipod<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:35.630> you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to compare it to the 2nd gen ipod as you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.690 
to compare it to the 2nd gen ipod as you
can<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:38.040> very<00:00:38.340> clunky<00:00:38.850> and
