00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.630
 1 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.480
 industry voice the hypermarket speech of a 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.610
 code want to run away from the coves of this 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.450
 world take shelter from these tons 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.369
 of lies 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.680
 far from wanting to change everything 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.439
 men their future they do not want 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.720
 share fixing the sky I'm looking for 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.030
 responses close his wounds before 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.969
 that she's gnawing at me finally leaving here without 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.570
 no regrets make my bags live 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.850
 it was curled 7 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 rest that hate to anchor shoulders and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.720
 can do in love friendship 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.030
 far from the storm that announce their 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.760
 anger of false testimony that leads you 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.739
 in hell far away from the wars of the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.350
 blood deaths verses that 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.449
 feed our babies that bitter taste we 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.570
 guard deep inside and all these fears 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.550
 which is not necessary to the three years that I 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.550
 play and wear 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.770
 god advance 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:22.200
 that I leave month 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.140
 I move on he would do it again 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.850
 I choke people a little more each day the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.350
 sadness takes over feet and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.920
 bound fists without any margin of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.259
 maneuver 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.649
 and each of them weighs on the back of mahler 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.329
 my fear of not being up to 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.130
 montrabe I drool there is nothing to wear 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.829
 I need a space to block me 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.649
 under the sun no luggage just leave 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.130
 wing pull she represents who me 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.899
 hold 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.600
 but I'm so scared that she refuses 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.119
 to flee too much dref that I ranked 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.729
 no action out of the question he dictates 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.470
 my life if we are the children of 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.830
 their locks it's up to us to 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.569
 put an end to terror then some 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.520
 weapons for a better world 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.880
 take the servers where I work 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.310
 everything I find 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:17.690
 Let's go 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:17.690

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.890
 I advance 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.750
 the unique games on time that me 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.560
 stay alive and hide my 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.819
 weaknesses i walk without turning around 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.430
 the bases on which I have 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.890
 blocked away from the breeze that caresses my 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.750
 face away from my west man island and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.420
 its beaches above the clouds 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.739
 I took off the past face the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.379
 future is revealed 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.849
 it's the wind at the end of the world 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.340
 After all, I only dream of 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.470
 change all this time spent here at 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.510
 meditating taught me how to cash but 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.000
 never to avoid leached 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.920
 I bend no time for luggage 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.409
 regret I want to turn the page but 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.420

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:08.500
 media travel starts not a single 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.840
