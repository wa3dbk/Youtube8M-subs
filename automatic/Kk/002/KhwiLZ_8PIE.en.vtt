00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:03.699
 cold and this one thinks it is smart and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.699

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.420

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.270

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.900
 no I used to camp too 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.520
 very occasionally when i come to te 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.750

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.460
 not where the fuck should i go holy shit 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 it's really awkward if you like this one 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.960
 while you no longer have played you 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.090
 holy shit also have those kids too 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.190
 almost smell behind me to it there 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.840
 almost there but it really is already one 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.030
 time since I did this and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.710
 you notice that you really notice it 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.140
 stop those weapons that we get too 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.890
 those are also super chill we get one 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 arbi gee then kibo i have for that and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.100
 then just a narrow one that is 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.100
 very divine 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.340
 etcetera and it surprises me that 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.340
 er touch something 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.380
 though i don't know whoa whoa wash now 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.420
 fat that sprinkle here so 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.880
 I became very much the story to 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.290
 go launcher but it's hard to handle 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.820
 just call again after a while 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.740
 or duty to do if it's such a while 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.830
 if you have not done so 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.690
 are used as it were 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.590
 because yes that is actually because of it 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.540
 just not done in a while 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:31.030
 he just stands still the way there 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.470
 and yes whatever yourself how all those me 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.210
 shot at as many bullets as I shook 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.770
 his head and he shot it in mine 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.450
 leg I believe it will mean 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.600
 maybe there really is a reason for or 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.600
 so 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.970
 oh oh oh what the one came up 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.740
 it chimp there so what the hell 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.120
 oh wow that's really something like that again 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.630
 you don't play a call or duty for a while 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.370
 that that just immediately had a cunt and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.800
 I have to say I notice it now 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:06.310
 know that it is really difficult and just 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.450
 how long does the widget pair of guys this 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.430
 is really not cool really not just all that 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.320
 jumps you put them like that 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.680
 hotel yes you now have your minecraft and 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.680
 geod 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.260
 We should come in Gmail Pro 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.100
 point that people improvise a junk shot 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.590
 point 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.480
 wow and yes i know i spoke now too 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.000
 but harder why me that he 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.090
 maybe just want a moment 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.690
 used to be used to summer or summer 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.690
 he do arno 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.330
 where does it go that I can hear it all over 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.190
 time though 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.350
 and they come from two sides holy 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.910
 shit boy i just shoot all 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.470
 but I just really use 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.730
 nothing or I just get hot Marcus 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.880
 on two different people that is 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.709
 not really great and now I'm behind this one 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.250
 duuuus 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.030
 oh wow that 's an easy look 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.290
 there is over there over over there 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.060
 and the biggest difference that I do 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.310
 now I notice no more fixed call or duty 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.420
 upload is that i am not playing for kd 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.910
 i just play for fun 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.310
 and that is another piece after you what he 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.130
 was already dead or something 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.870
 or was that not a lot harder now this was 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:27.430
 a piece anyway 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.430
 just that here some pushing 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.460
 I think I was always so chaotic 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.280
 it is real 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.630
 moron just gothic but I stand here 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.880
 still safe behind my 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.060
 cardboard thingy 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.380
 oh if i just have a big combo here 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.260
 get it 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.260
 oh what guys don't get along 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.540
 oh oh wow wow yes this is not real 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.370
 easy to do or so with his expert 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.169
 I think I always find this difficult 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.220
 control and especially if you do so 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.870
 haven't done for a while 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.870
 camp duty then it is all noticeable 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.210
 that the thing tricky to drive so sniper 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.770
 and now I hope not that second time 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.639
 a lot of kills more market because we stand 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.190

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.830
 currently so I have to take the kills 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.419

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.419
