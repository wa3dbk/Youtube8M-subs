00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
years from the previous retro that that

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.899 
years from the previous retro that that
you<00:02:18.450> could<00:02:18.599> have<00:02:18.720> bought<00:02:18.930> back<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.310> xi

you could have bought back then so xi

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.490 
you could have bought back then so xi
came<00:02:21.299> out<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.629> countdown<00:02:21.870> pack<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.409> then

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
came out in the countdown pack and then

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.160 
came out in the countdown pack and then
they<00:02:22.590> came<00:02:22.739> out<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:23.670> couple<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.299> years<00:02:24.510> later<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
they came out a couple of years later I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.809 
they came out a couple of years later I
think<00:02:25.349> fiber<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.980> can't<00:02:26.220> remember<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.549> exact

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
think fiber I can't remember the exact

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.759 
think fiber I can't remember the exact
years<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.269> was<00:02:27.540> out<00:02:27.569> my<00:02:27.750> head<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.439> you<00:02:28.590> guys

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
years I was out my head but you guys

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.410 
years I was out my head but you guys
know<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.549> came<00:02:29.730> out<00:02:29.849> like<00:02:30.180> five

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
know like this one came out like five

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.289 
know like this one came out like five
years<00:02:30.450> after<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.079> one<00:02:31.290> did<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.650> then<00:02:32.299> this

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
years after this one did and then this

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.940 
years after this one did and then this
year<00:02:33.540> two<00:02:34.079> years<00:02:34.290> after<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.650> one<00:02:34.799> we're

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
year two years after this one we're

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.649 
year two years after this one we're
getting<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.220> low<00:02:35.340> top<00:02:35.519> version<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.120> then

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
getting a low top version and then

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.720 
getting a low top version and then
probably<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.349> in<00:02:37.530> another<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:38.400> five<00:02:38.700> years

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
probably like in another like five years

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
probably like in another like five years
we're<00:02:39.060> gonna<00:02:39.150> get<00:02:39.329> this<00:02:39.450> one<00:02:39.599> again<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.079> it's

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
we're gonna get this one again it's it's

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.110 
we're gonna get this one again it's it's
just<00:02:40.409> a<00:02:40.560> constant<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.400> one<00:02:41.609> that's<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
just a constant it's one that's going to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.539 
just a constant it's one that's going to
always<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:43.019> retro<00:02:43.739> because<00:02:44.099> it's<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> classic

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
always be retro because it's a classic

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.819 
always be retro because it's a classic
colorway<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.359> they<00:02:45.900> could<00:02:46.079> always<00:02:46.319> retro

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
colorway and they could always retro

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.819 
colorway and they could always retro
this<00:02:47.010> shoe<00:02:47.629> 300,000<00:02:48.629> pairs<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.139> sell<00:02:49.680> them

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
this shoe 300,000 pairs and sell them

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.890 
this shoe 300,000 pairs and sell them
out<00:02:49.920> because<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.489> shoe<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.720> people

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
out because this shoe is one that people

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.740 
out because this shoe is one that people
want<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:53.099> my<00:02:53.340> point<00:02:53.549> being<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.909> is<00:02:54.180> it

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
want to have but my point being is is it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.390 
want to have but my point being is is it
worth<00:02:54.870> doubling<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.799> because<00:02:56.129> if<00:02:56.310> you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
worth doubling up on because if you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.460 
worth doubling up on because if you
double<00:02:56.670> up<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.120> then<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.599> have<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.200> and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
double up on it then you have one and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.699 
double up on it then you have one and
and<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.129> guess<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.579> we've<00:02:59.760> seen<00:03:00.000> some<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.389> these

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
and I guess as we've seen some of these

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.890 
and I guess as we've seen some of these
retros<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.950> are<00:03:02.040> becoming<00:03:02.450> older<00:03:03.450> they

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
retros that are becoming older they

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.000 
retros that are becoming older they
yellow<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:04.799> there's<00:03:05.430> clear<00:03:05.879> soles<00:03:06.150> they<00:03:07.010> they

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
yellow if there's clear soles they they

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.520 
yellow if there's clear soles they they
just<00:03:08.040> don't<00:03:08.430> age<00:03:08.849> very<00:03:09.239> well<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.569> glue<00:03:09.810> might

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
just don't age very well the glue might

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.369 
just don't age very well the glue might
come<00:03:10.769> undone<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:12.209> just<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.870> maintenance<00:03:13.170> of

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
come undone it's just the maintenance of

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.229 
come undone it's just the maintenance of
keeping<00:03:13.680> an<00:03:13.829> old<00:03:14.040> shoe<00:03:14.400> that's<00:03:14.639> ten<00:03:14.849> years<00:03:15.030> old

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
keeping an old shoe that's ten years old

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.990 
keeping an old shoe that's ten years old
is<00:03:15.530> it's<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.709> it's<00:03:16.949> more<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.280> liability<00:03:17.459> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
is it's like it's more of a liability to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.330 
is it's like it's more of a liability to
rock<00:03:18.180> those<00:03:18.359> ones<00:03:18.660> then<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.349> buy<00:03:19.530> one<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.040> is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
rock those ones then to buy one that is

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.569 
rock those ones then to buy one that is
just<00:03:20.910> released<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:22.500> know<00:03:22.530> new<00:03:22.859> this<00:03:23.069> year<00:03:23.340> so

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
just released you know new this year so

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.920 
just released you know new this year so
I<00:03:23.790> think<00:03:24.000> that's<00:03:24.239> part<00:03:24.449> of<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.540> reason<00:03:24.780> why

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
I think that's part of the reason why

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.500 
I think that's part of the reason why
people<00:03:25.829> aren't<00:03:25.980> probably<00:03:26.340> not<00:03:26.489> as<00:03:26.819> inclined

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
people aren't probably not as inclined

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.789 
people aren't probably not as inclined
to<00:03:27.690> buy<00:03:27.840> double<00:03:28.199> ups<00:03:28.349> if<00:03:28.500> some<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.739> the

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
to buy double ups if some of the

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.920 
to buy double ups if some of the
sneakers<00:03:29.159> out<00:03:29.250> there<00:03:29.430> also<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.909> rising<00:03:30.239> costs

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
sneakers out there also the rising costs

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.140 
sneakers out there also the rising costs
of<00:03:31.049> shoes<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.859> don't<00:03:32.489> remember<00:03:32.790> what<00:03:33.030> these

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
of shoes I don't remember what these

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170 
of shoes I don't remember what these
ones<00:03:33.359> were<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:33.720> obviously<00:03:34.579> like<00:03:35.579> I<00:03:35.609> can<00:03:35.940> check

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
ones were but obviously like I can check

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.339 
ones were but obviously like I can check
I<00:03:36.480> can't<00:03:36.780> remember

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
I can't remember

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.830 
I can't remember
yeah<00:03:37.650> 185<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.519> then<00:03:38.909> and<00:03:39.209> then<00:03:39.329> now<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.540> know

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
yeah 185 and then and then now you know

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.710 
yeah 185 and then and then now you know
the<00:03:40.199> standard<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.680> 190<00:03:41.220> for<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.430> retro<00:03:41.819> so<00:03:42.090> the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
the standard is 190 for a retro so the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
the standard is 190 for a retro so the
rising<00:03:43.079> costs<00:03:43.470> are<00:03:43.560> definitely<00:03:43.859> a<00:03:43.919> factor<00:03:44.099> as

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
rising costs are definitely a factor as

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.789 
rising costs are definitely a factor as
well<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:45.269> being<00:03:45.629> able<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.900> afford<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.440> double<00:03:46.709> up

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
well of being able to afford a double up

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.979 
well of being able to afford a double up
of<00:03:46.889> some<00:03:47.280> sneakers<00:03:47.639> but<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.629> want<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> know<00:03:48.930> you
