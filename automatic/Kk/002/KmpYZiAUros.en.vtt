one<00:01:57.899> has<00:01:58.020> claimed<00:01:58.409> responsibility<00:01:58.610> but

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
one has claimed responsibility but

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.800 
one has claimed responsibility but
that's<00:01:59.790> why<00:01:59.909> they're<00:02:00.060> saying<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.540> test

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
that's why they're saying it's a test

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.149 
that's why they're saying it's a test
run<00:02:01.020> potentially<00:02:01.649> right<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.100> were

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
run potentially right that they were

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.950 
run potentially right that they were
just<00:02:02.340> trying<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> test<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.180> systems<00:02:03.570> see<00:02:03.840> what

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just trying to test the systems see what

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.690 
just trying to test the systems see what
they<00:02:04.079> could<00:02:04.140> accomplish<00:02:04.290> no<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.549> fair

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
they could accomplish no that's a fair

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.249 
they could accomplish no that's a fair
point<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.479> can't<00:02:06.810> rule<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.079> out

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
point I think so you can't rule that out

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.499 
point I think so you can't rule that out
now<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> FBI<00:02:08.039> has<00:02:08.280> been<00:02:08.489> investigating<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
now the FBI has been investigating the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.639 
now the FBI has been investigating the
incident<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.140> look<00:02:10.379> at<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
incident if you look at the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.589 
incident if you look at the
sophistication<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.489> attack<00:02:11.819> it

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
sophistication of the attack it

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.730 
sophistication of the attack it
certainly<00:02:12.930> could<00:02:13.260> sajjad

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
certainly could sajjad

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.580 
certainly could sajjad
it's<00:02:14.010> an<00:02:14.130> insider<00:02:14.700> attack<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.990> had<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.410> know

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it's an insider attack you had to know

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.340 
it's an insider attack you had to know
where<00:02:17.100> these<00:02:17.550> concealed<00:02:18.350> fiber-optic

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
where these concealed fiber-optic

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.750 
where these concealed fiber-optic
stations<00:02:19.710> were<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.430> make<00:02:20.580> those

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
stations were that to make those

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.510 
stations were that to make those
strategic<00:02:20.910> cuts<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:22.410> had<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.920> attackers

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
strategic cuts you had the attackers

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.340 
strategic cuts you had the attackers
clearly<00:02:23.820> had<00:02:23.970> sophisticated<00:02:24.480> knowledge<00:02:25.050> of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
clearly had sophisticated knowledge of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.040 
clearly had sophisticated knowledge of
where<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.950> shoot<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.820> know<00:02:26.970> how<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.210> disable

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
where to shoot to know how to disable

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.230 
where to shoot to know how to disable
the<00:02:28.440> cooling<00:02:28.800> systems<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.060> very

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the cooling systems so it is a very

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.600 
the cooling systems so it is a very
sophisticated<00:02:30.810> attack<00:02:31.590> by<00:02:31.800> any<00:02:31.950> account<00:02:32.280> but

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
sophisticated attack by any account but

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.060 
sophisticated attack by any account but
I<00:02:32.820> would<00:02:33.330> stress<00:02:33.570> right<00:02:33.840> now<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.020> FBI<00:02:34.470> does

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
I would stress right now the FBI does

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.280 
I would stress right now the FBI does
not<00:02:35.310> currently<00:02:35.910> categorize<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:37.050> as<00:02:37.110> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
not currently categorize this as a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.020 
not currently categorize this as a
terrorist<00:02:37.650> attack<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.220> think<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.850> at<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
terrorist attack and I think we at the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.310 
terrorist attack and I think we at the
Chertoff<00:02:39.270> group<00:02:39.330> agree<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.990> it's<00:02:40.110> too

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
Chertoff group agree that it's too

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.610 
Chertoff group agree that it's too
premature<00:02:41.210> still<00:02:42.210> we<00:02:42.450> don't<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:42.780> who<00:02:43.110> did

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
premature still we don't know who did

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.260 
premature still we don't know who did
this<00:02:43.650> right<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.400> here<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:44.640> are<00:02:44.790> coming<00:02:45.060> up<00:02:45.150> on

this right and here we are coming up on

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.360 
this right and here we are coming up on
a<00:02:45.330> year<00:02:45.420> since<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.990> event<00:02:46.410> interesting<00:02:47.250> to

a year since the event interesting to

a year since the event interesting to
note<00:02:47.520> one<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.850> reasons<00:02:48.180> why<00:02:48.330> there<00:02:48.660> wasn't

note one of the reasons why there wasn't

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.660 
note one of the reasons why there wasn't

a whole lot of press around this is

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.600 
a whole lot of press around this is
there<00:02:50.910> was<00:02:51.120> no<00:02:51.330> blackout<00:02:51.870> PG&amp;E<00:02:52.710> was<00:02:53.040> able<00:02:53.370> to

there was no blackout PG&amp;E was able to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.090 
there was no blackout PG&amp;E was able to
work<00:02:54.360> around<00:02:54.540> these<00:02:55.080> transformers<00:02:55.770> going

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
work around these transformers going

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.000 
work around these transformers going
down<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.640> your<00:02:57.330> experience<00:02:57.930> how<00:02:58.260> prepared<00:02:58.710> is

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
otherwise to deal with an attack like

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.320 
otherwise to deal with an attack like
this<00:03:04.050> if<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.470> happens<00:03:04.770> again<00:03:05.150> well<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.270> a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
this if it happens again well it's a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.240 
this if it happens again well it's a
great<00:03:06.450> question<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.900> look<00:03:07.050> at<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.250> math

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
great question if you look at the math

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.180 
great question if you look at the math
here<00:03:08.610> basically<00:03:08.940> us<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.230> electric<00:03:11.040> power

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
here basically us the electric power

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.740 
here basically us the electric power
research<00:03:11.430> institute<00:03:11.700> has<00:03:12.210> shown<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.420> over

if<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.120> think<00:03:21.390> about<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.690> that's<00:03:21.810> about<00:03:21.990> 250

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
if you think about that that's about 250

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.590 
if you think about that that's about 250
attacks<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:23.040> year<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.970> grand<00:03:24.210> scheme<00:03:24.540> of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
attacks a year and the grand scheme of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.200 
attacks a year and the grand scheme of
all<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.140> US<00:03:25.620> transformers<00:03:26.370> that's<00:03:26.910> less<00:03:27.180> than

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
all the US transformers that's less than

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.030 
all the US transformers that's less than
0.4<00:03:28.080> percent<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.590> not<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.740> high

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
0.4 percent so it's not a high

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.710 
0.4 percent so it's not a high
percentage<00:03:29.250> but<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.210> industry<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.660> very

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
percentage but the industry is very

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.990 
percentage but the industry is very
focused<00:03:31.140> on<00:03:31.560> making<00:03:31.740> sure<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.250> even<00:03:32.820> if<00:03:32.910> they

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
focused on making sure that even if they

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.550 
focused on making sure that even if they
are<00:03:33.180> attacked<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.930> saw<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.320> case<00:03:34.530> of

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
are attacked like you saw in the case of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.890 
are attacked like you saw in the case of
the<00:03:34.800> Metcalf<00:03:35.280> substation<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.600> they're<00:03:36.780> able

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
the Metcalf substation that they're able

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.240 
the Metcalf substation that they're able
to<00:03:37.080> be<00:03:37.200> resilient<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:37.980> they<00:03:38.070> can

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
to be resilient and that they can

forward on on this issue and resiliency
what<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.160> scary<00:03:59.460> and<00:03:59.610> I'm<00:03:59.670> sure<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> lot<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.420> us

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
what is scary and I'm sure a lot of us

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.150 
what is scary and I'm sure a lot of us
think<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.020> you<00:04:01.440> know<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.740> massive

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
think of this you know the massive

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.950 
think of this you know the massive
blackouts<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.820> have<00:04:03.060> seen<00:04:03.330> in<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.510> past<00:04:03.660> for

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
blackouts we have seen in the past for

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.860 
blackouts we have seen in the past for
example<00:04:04.260> in<00:04:04.350> 2003<00:04:05.070> massive<00:04:05.640> blackout<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.390> the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
example in 2003 massive blackout and the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.930 
example in 2003 massive blackout and the
East<00:04:07.050> Coast<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.740> was<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.550> was<00:04:08.670> caused

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
East Coast and that was that was caused

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.510 
East Coast and that was that was caused
in<00:04:09.120> part<00:04:09.330> by<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:10.080> tree<00:04:10.440> branch<00:04:10.680> chata<00:04:11.160> wasn't

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
in part by a tree branch chata wasn't

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.130 
in part by a tree branch chata wasn't
even<00:04:11.730> anything<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.270> was<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.420> serious<00:04:12.690> attack

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
even anything that was a serious attack

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.810 
even anything that was a serious attack
so<00:04:13.350> we're<00:04:13.470> talking<00:04:13.860> right<00:04:14.310> now<00:04:14.490> about<00:04:14.520> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
so we're talking right now about the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.880 
so we're talking right now about the
ways<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.450> some<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.200> these<00:04:16.290> companies<00:04:16.530> can

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
ways that some of these companies can

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.500 
ways that some of these companies can
prepare<00:04:17.220> if<00:04:17.400> they're<00:04:17.790> attacked<00:04:17.910> but<00:04:18.390> what

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
prepare if they're attacked but what

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.150 
prepare if they're attacked but what
about<00:04:18.690> prevention<00:04:19.080> Chad<00:04:19.530> where<00:04:19.709> are<00:04:19.890> we<00:04:20.040> on

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
about prevention Chad where are we on

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.490 
about prevention Chad where are we on
that<00:04:20.630> it's<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.690> great<00:04:21.900> question<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.470> think

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
that it's a great question and I think

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.290 
that it's a great question and I think
we've<00:04:22.710> all<00:04:22.830> experienced<00:04:23.490> at<00:04:23.669> different<00:04:24.090> times

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
we've all experienced at different times

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.000 
we've all experienced at different times
we're<00:04:24.750> in<00:04:24.930> different<00:04:25.560> parts<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.860> country

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
we're in different parts of the country

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.230 
we're in different parts of the country

tornados and I lived in New York when
the<00:04:30.150> brownout<00:04:30.569> happened<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.289> just

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
the brownout happened that you just

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.230 
the brownout happened that you just
described<00:04:31.889> it<00:04:32.069> was<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.430> was<00:04:32.580> quite<00:04:32.849> disturbing

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
described it was it was quite disturbing

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.180 
described it was it was quite disturbing
it<00:04:33.360> was<00:04:33.449> you<00:04:34.050> have<00:04:34.229> these<00:04:34.349> moments<00:04:34.530> where<00:04:34.919> a

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
it was you have these moments where a

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.610 
it was you have these moments where a
single<00:04:35.550> tree<00:04:35.819> can<00:04:36.060> hit<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.210> substation<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.169> if

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
single tree can hit a substation and if

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.080 
single tree can hit a substation and if
that's<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.889> critical<00:04:38.160> choke<00:04:38.490> point<00:04:38.789> there<00:04:38.940> can

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
that's a critical choke point there can

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.779 
that's a critical choke point there can
be<00:04:39.120> cascading<00:04:39.780> effect<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.349> what<00:04:41.069> both

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
be cascading effect so what both

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.279 
be cascading effect so what both
industry<00:04:42.509> and<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.840> government<00:04:42.870> have<00:04:43.199> been

industry and the government have been

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.650 
industry and the government have been

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
working on our modeling out essentially

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.930 
working on our modeling out essentially
those<00:04:45.840> types<00:04:46.169> of<00:04:46.380> cascading<00:04:47.190> scenarios<00:04:47.699> where

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
those types of cascading scenarios where

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.580 
those types of cascading scenarios where
they<00:04:48.090> can<00:04:48.210> identify<00:04:48.419> those<00:04:48.780> choke<00:04:49.080> points<00:04:49.470> an

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
they can identify those choke points an

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.040 
they can identify those choke points an
industry<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.520> government<00:04:50.550> have<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.330> harden

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
industry and government have to harden

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.920 
industry and government have to harden
those<00:04:52.710> particular<00:04:53.370> choke<00:04:54.270> points<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:54.750> that's

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
those particular choke points so that's

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.930 
those particular choke points so that's
a<00:04:55.199> critical<00:04:56.009> part<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.220> this<00:04:56.340> another<00:04:56.580> part<00:04:56.849> of

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
a critical part of this another part of

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.540 
a critical part of this another part of
it<00:04:57.030> is<00:04:57.120> risk-based<00:04:58.190> resiliency<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.400> if<00:04:59.460> we

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
it is risk-based resiliency so if we

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.820 
it is risk-based resiliency so if we
look<00:04:59.580> at<00:04:59.909> the<00:05:00.419> supply<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.810> transformers<00:05:01.680> for

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
look at the supply of transformers for

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.499 
look at the supply of transformers for
example<00:05:02.159> the<00:05:02.490> industry's<00:05:02.940> leaned<00:05:03.180> forward

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
example the industry's leaned forward

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.450 
example the industry's leaned forward
with<00:05:03.630> a<00:05:03.659> program<00:05:03.870> called<00:05:04.199> the<00:05:04.860> supplemental

transformer equipment program or step

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.870 
transformer equipment program or step
and<00:05:07.830> that's<00:05:07.949> where<00:05:08.190> they're<00:05:08.310> working<00:05:08.550> to

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
and that's where they're working to

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.390 
and that's where they're working to
create<00:05:09.110> shared<00:05:10.110> inventory<00:05:10.830> across<00:05:11.190> the
