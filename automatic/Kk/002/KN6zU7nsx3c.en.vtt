00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.199 
brands but with a sleek one is really
good<00:02:21.470> because<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.800> catered<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.340> for<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.790> darker

it's a good dupe for Mac if you compare

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.180 
it's a good dupe for Mac if you compare
Mac<00:03:19.760> products<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.630> sleep<00:03:21.079> products<00:03:21.530> you

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.470 
and what else can i say about this yeah
it<00:03:38.750> doesn't<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.680> stays<00:03:40.670> throughout<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.299> whole

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
it doesn't it stays throughout the whole

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.270

day<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.750> could<00:03:42.049> put<00:03:42.230> nine<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.650> morning<00:03:43.040> and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
day I could put nine in the morning and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.449 
day I could put nine in the morning and
when<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.430> come<00:03:43.670> home<00:03:44.019> it's<00:03:45.019> still<00:03:45.410> there<00:03:45.709> the

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
when I come home it's still there the

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.569 
when I come home it's still there the
only<00:03:46.970> downside<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:47.780> because<00:03:48.470> it's<00:03:48.709> thicker

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
only downside is because it's thicker

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.319 
only downside is because it's thicker
when<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.150> have<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.170> remove<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.329> foundation

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
when I have to remove the foundation

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.479 
when I have to remove the foundation
before<00:03:53.690> i<00:03:53.840> go<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.049> sleep<00:03:54.230> or<00:03:55.010> for<00:03:55.340> whatever

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
before i go to sleep or for whatever

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.539 
before i go to sleep or for whatever
reason<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.810> takes<00:03:57.230> longer<00:03:57.799> because<00:03:58.130> it's

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
reason it takes longer because it's

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.539 
reason it takes longer because it's
thicker<00:03:59.180> so<00:03:59.840> I've<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.079> use<00:04:00.200> extra<00:04:00.560> one<00:04:01.190> or<00:04:01.370> two

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
thicker so I've to use extra one or two

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.789 
thicker so I've to use extra one or two
make<00:04:01.880> up<00:04:01.910> pipes<00:04:02.329> but<00:04:03.019> other<00:04:03.200> than<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.440> this

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799
