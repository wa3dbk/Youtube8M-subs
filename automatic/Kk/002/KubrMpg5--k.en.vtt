00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.900
 very good kids I am cardinal page 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.840
 today I bring a new trick to duplicate 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.930
 infinite objects are worth as we are going to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.940
 to do is very simple voucher and these people 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.860
 going in and out of here 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.129
 well I want to show the new houses 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.710
 for first of all those mine that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.030
 I'm going to make a house like this high because 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.970
 another server or petra where I am the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.450
 another house or I hope you have died 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.930
 That 's the best one, the galley is worth 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.320
 if the new one in the game is going to 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.410
 carlitos 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.410
 what is a party inside they can not leave 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.129
 and for my taste the best slopes 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.490
 which is under water 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.970
 good 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.270
 what material can be made can be 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.579
 do with the materials as cables 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.729
 It is worth using with an ax you can not use 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.729
 a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.870
 with these eggs you will also be able to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.670
 example with this by this type of 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.810
 diamond not some egg is not worth either 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.630
 objects that can be placed as you see 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.520
 with what objects can you do well with 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.130
 these are valid with those who have kraft that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.130
 talk for example this joins 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.130
 connect bomdero with others connect 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.619
 for example we do not do anything worth what 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.859
 happens that if we bend it when putting the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.509
 second 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.340
 place one but with these that false 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.709
 now you teach it, we not only place it 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.630
 what is the trick moves us away we cut it 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.979
 ok we go away and we put where 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.509
 go to look like it's always the first 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.730
 You have a hole left 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.830
 right if this is going to look like it's not 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.890
 appears here it is worth doing 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.460
 just when it was approaching place it worth 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.460
 Bah 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.080
 good just when you take it you have it 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:32.280
 to place as a vegetable and now what 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:36.000
 It's worth it for this is not worth 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.350
 and then what is that worth what we 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.420
 We place a value, we cut it and it just has not 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.620
 it's a bit difficult to catch the trick 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.620
 ok but 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.190
 because this sounds like nothing 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.750
 Well, neither fruit tree forest but it 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.970
 I'll catch it fast I get more confirmed and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.720
 get it ready when the six what 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.720
 place yes yes 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.069
 well there are times that we do not want 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.200
 leave now 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.239
 at the time of departure I spoke with her 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.430
 I have that and I did not have another magician 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.280
 food so you can see that I did not have 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.290
 no other here that we can do with 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.240
 this good we go 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.030
 the krafft eo is worth it and we turn it into 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.420
 wood vale 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.270
 then we cut it again and so everything 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.060
 I have for example 88 wooden 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:36.310
 founders this is what we come back to 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.020
 cut and nothing to catch it we place it worth 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.849
 I already tell you until you see them here 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:46.420
 is 8 we are going to do these days and it 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.480
 you can place a value as you can see and 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.400
 you can find but if we do 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.980
 now with these you are going to see that he does not have 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.730
 no sense because you can not 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.510
 place the ballet 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.510
 one moment, please 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.150
 Let's see 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.640
 you see but varying I have here it happens to me 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.470
 this you can not use at all because 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.540
 the moment you use the buttons 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.850
 two so many in the ovens I tested it 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.260
 before disappears it's worth it since I recommend 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.070
 that only you for example for this 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.200
 type for gold for metal is worth everything 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.290
 whatever is spoken is worth for example 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:32.820
 these affordable waiting 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.249
 these exible objects are worth the carbon 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.499
 neither 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.909
 or the ones that you know about my house and what 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:41.039
 you were talking about this for example is 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.179
 class speak through the oven is worth that 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.549
 it does not work 

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:47.849
 it has to be always through the 

00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:50.459
 work table leaves you from the square 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.879
 The value of the position is worth it because when 

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:56.789
 you go for example look at it with gold 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:59.230
 the 10th block of the iron block 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.050
 Diamond 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.300
 diamond to the train piaf is also 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.250
 can but can not be placed by 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.940
 now I will find out how I am not 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.740
 keep investigating and what else could we 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.990
 do 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.800
 I will not continue investigating to continue testing 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.830
 I'm sure it could be better , I do not know 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.569
 happens the most today we go and nothing I hope 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.580
 that there are servers and as always 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.580
 likes to subscribe goodbye
