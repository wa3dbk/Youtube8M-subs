00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
topic by the most part so the best way

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.810 
topic by the most part so the best way
in<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.719> opinion<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.800> experience<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.640> get<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
in my opinion in my experience to get a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850 
in my opinion in my experience to get a
1<00:00:42.059> plus<00:00:42.300> 1<00:00:42.629> invite<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.590> one

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
1 plus 1 invite because I have a one

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.479 
1 plus 1 invite because I have a one
plus<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.129> invite<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> Google<00:00:47.309> Plus

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
plus one invite is you go to Google Plus

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.900 
plus one invite is you go to Google Plus
now<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> reason<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.110> say<00:00:49.140> Google+<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.340> because

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
now the reason I say Google+ is because

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.170 
now the reason I say Google+ is because
there's<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> lot<00:00:51.360> more<00:00:51.629> people<00:00:52.559> who<00:00:53.340> post<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
there's a lot more people who post to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.619 
there's a lot more people who post to
google+<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:56.160> giving<00:00:56.850> away<00:00:56.910> invites<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
google+ that are giving away invites and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
google+ that are giving away invites and
it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> lot<00:00:57.989> harder<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.530> use<00:00:58.680> other<00:00:59.039> sources

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it's a lot harder to use other sources

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.549 
it's a lot harder to use other sources
such<00:00:59.789> as<00:00:59.850> Reddit<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.420> Twitter<00:01:00.780> because<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
such as Reddit and Twitter because you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.969 
such as Reddit and Twitter because you
just<00:01:01.829> can't<00:01:01.920> tell<00:01:02.480> all<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.799> best

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
just can't tell all right so the best

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.600 
just can't tell all right so the best
way<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.760> type<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> 1<00:01:06.420> plus<00:01:06.689> invite

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
way to do this is type in 1 plus invite

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.230 
way to do this is type in 1 plus invite
into<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> search<00:01:08.820> bar<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> once<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
into the search bar so once this is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.600 
into the search bar so once this is
searched<00:01:12.540> you're<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> press

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
searched you're going to want to press

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.570 
searched you're going to want to press
most<00:01:14.610> recent<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> way<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> best

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
most recent so that way we have the best

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.480 
most recent so that way we have the best
optimize<00:01:18.090> chance<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.650> what<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.220> sing
