00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
problem with my lgp um doing an update

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.330 
problem with my lgp um doing an update
one<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.320> drivers<00:00:28.769> didn't<00:00:29.010> install

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
one of the drivers didn't install

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.209 
one of the drivers didn't install
correctly<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.240> caused<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.929> brick<00:00:31.230> it

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
correctly and it caused it to brick it

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.080 
correctly and it caused it to brick it
uh<00:00:32.660> we<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.690> continue<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> blink<00:00:34.590> blue<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
uh we just continue to blink blue and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.450 
uh we just continue to blink blue and
they'll<00:00:36.329> continue<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.809> circle<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.190> looked

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
they'll continue the circle so I looked

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
they'll continue the circle so I looked
online<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> people<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
online and a lot of people say that it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.810 
online and a lot of people say that it
was<00:00:40.500> called<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> blue<00:00:41.100> light<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> death<00:00:41.430> or

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
was called the blue light of death or

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.049 
was called the blue light of death or
the<00:00:41.910> blue<00:00:42.059> ring<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> death<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.190> I<00:00:44.190> thought

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the blue ring of death and I thought

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.360 
the blue ring of death and I thought
that<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.539> there<00:00:46.469> were<00:00:46.530> other<00:00:46.680> methods<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that was it there were other methods to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.410 
that was it there were other methods to
fix<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.170> that<00:00:49.170> didn't<00:00:49.440> work<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.649> me<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.420> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
fix this that didn't work for me and I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.029 
fix this that didn't work for me and I
realized<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> wasn't<00:00:52.469> necessarily<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
realized that it wasn't necessarily a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.250 
realized that it wasn't necessarily a
hardware<00:00:53.520> issue<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.899> figured<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.230> was

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
hardware issue so I just figured it was

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.060 
hardware issue so I just figured it was
a<00:00:55.350> update<00:00:55.710> issue

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
a update issue

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.639 
a update issue
so<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:57.300> order<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> fix<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> problem<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
so in order to fix this problem the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.889 
so in order to fix this problem the
first<00:00:58.800> thing<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.430> uninstall

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
first thing you have to do is uninstall

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.260 
first thing you have to do is uninstall

and<00:01:43.460> it'll<00:01:44.460> blink<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> usually<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.509> about

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and it'll blink like I usually do about

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.969 
and it'll blink like I usually do about
three<00:01:46.290> seconds

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
three seconds

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.249 
three seconds
well<00:01:47.520> three<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.820> five<00:01:48.000> seconds<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.659> then

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
well three to five seconds and then

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.260 
well three to five seconds and then
after<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.710> it'll<00:01:50.250> stay<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> solid<00:01:50.880> blue<00:01:51.030> which

after that it'll stay a solid blue which

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.440 
after that it'll stay a solid blue which
