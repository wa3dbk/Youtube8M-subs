00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
right things so starting off here I'm

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.450 
right things so starting off here I'm
using<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.920> end<00:00:20.310> field<00:00:21.170> with<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> red<00:00:23.010> dot<00:00:23.189> sight

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
using the end field with a red dot sight

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300 
using the end field with a red dot sight
and<00:00:23.990> when<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.080> comes<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> red<00:00:25.680> dot<00:00:25.859> sights<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and when it comes to a red dot sights it

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.970 
and when it comes to a red dot sights it
depends<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> weapon<00:00:27.500> for<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.560> most<00:00:28.740> part

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
depends on the weapon for the most part

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.450 
depends on the weapon for the most part
I<00:00:29.240> prefer<00:00:30.240> either<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.349> plain<00:00:31.619> red<00:00:31.980> dot<00:00:32.160> sight

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I prefer either the plain red dot sight

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.020 
I prefer either the plain red dot sight
or<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.750> you'll<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.190> using<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
or as you'll see that I'm using here I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.290

prefer<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> X<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.940> think<00:00:39.120> it's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
prefer the X the the like I think it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
prefer the X the the like I think it's
called<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> cross<00:00:39.989> X<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> dot<00:00:40.890> in

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
called like the cross X with a dot in

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.530 
called like the cross X with a dot in
the<00:00:41.190> middle<00:00:41.399> something<00:00:41.969> something<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the middle something something like that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.770 
the middle something something like that
but<00:00:42.690> that's<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.070> called<00:00:44.309> I

but that's that's what it's called I

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.850

tend<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> prefer<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.230> because<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> gives<00:00:46.739> me

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
tend to prefer that because it gives me

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.889 
tend to prefer that because it gives me
a<00:00:46.980> wider<00:00:47.870> place<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.079> aim<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:50.010> an<00:00:50.309> enemy<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.510> at
