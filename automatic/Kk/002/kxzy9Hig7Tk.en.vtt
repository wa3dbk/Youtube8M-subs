00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 a life and welcome to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.600
 another skin spotlight and that 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.280
 first look at battle cast here 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.900
 a very nice synchronous dance like 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 always with me the comparison between the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.759
 new skin on the left side and the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.359
 classic head on the right patrick scott 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:25.920
 may is a skin of around 700 700 euro 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.119
 cost the exact number knows can 1350 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.230
 do not want anything wrong schottin 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.849
 description will be there again 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.079
 We are definitely coming now 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.579
 first directly a cannon as a tongue 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 Of course, here it is at least the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.360
 but were generally off by the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.579
 Movement itself does not change 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.460
 also the tail shake, so to speak 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.129
 Gates is at the same look at both of you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 all those cannons on your hands here 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.399
 a double cannon up here in the blue 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.289
 card and right has a plasma know 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 whatever the dance hammer has already seen 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.309
 he is completely the same as me 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.010
 the feeling of comparison backwards over 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.460
 with the locks cannons and also that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.630
 Laughter is completely the same that means we are 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.330
 can be punctuality about it 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.870
 first go outtakes he shoots 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.930
 almost a cannon 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.650
 and here he shoots acid now 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.240
 ability a green project what 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.510
 Of course, the enemy also infected 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.580
 the classic head shoots a green one 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.830
 Project her just a little less 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.740
 sleek now the ability starts 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:38.170
 the glow we have and the outotec are 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.490
 now almost red rockets instead of here 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.160
 green sparkle meant that is the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.810
 projectile wants to change the autoclubs 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.890
 that means change he should me 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.390
 maybe not kill 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.500
 now can now once the mud soil 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.120
 it's like he's a black one 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.190
 Oil case lays with a red fire department 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.310
 In the front here everything is completely green 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.120
 in the multi we see because they are the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.580
 then he analyzes the area of ​​his head 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.330
 really explodes as if it were 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.800
 hit the grenade verdi or something like that 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.170
 means we are here many skills 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.040
 So by the animations can group 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.440
 as he works to one turns around and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.200
 display tail is pulled up 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.900
 here in this hook has how cool is 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.670
 that is because day is gone then you come too 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.510
 the deaths are animations because we are 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.510
 by 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.670
 the passive comes from the euro he stood 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.459
 explodes out lives that equal the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.530
 6350 should cost that was a battle 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.790
 cast look again successful 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.230
 we are a next time 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.830
 bit of hippie and I hope it has 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.220
 you like it 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.220
 It's good
