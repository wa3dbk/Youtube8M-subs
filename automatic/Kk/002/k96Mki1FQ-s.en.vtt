partial<00:01:33.240> refresh<00:01:33.720> mode<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> device<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.740> it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
partial refresh mode on the device so it

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.640 
partial refresh mode on the device so it
makes<00:01:35.040> scrolling<00:01:35.579> smoother<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.110> yeah<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> mean

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
makes scrolling smoother so yeah I mean

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
makes scrolling smoother so yeah I mean
the<00:01:37.829> whole<00:01:38.009> layout<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> book<00:01:39.210> store<00:01:39.509> works

the whole layout of the book store works

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.539 
the whole layout of the book store works
tremendously<00:01:40.500> better<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.040> device<00:01:41.340> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
tremendously better on this device I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.600 
tremendously better on this device I
don't<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:42.030> why<00:01:42.240> exactly<00:01:42.619> but<00:01:43.619> definitely<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
don't know why exactly but definitely a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.940 
don't know why exactly but definitely a
major<00:01:45.000> improvement<00:01:45.390> over<00:01:45.720> how<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> worked<00:01:46.740> on

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
major improvement over how it worked on

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
major improvement over how it worked on
the<00:01:47.159> onyx<00:01:47.549> t68<00:01:48.030> where<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> was<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.659> black

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the onyx t68 where it was all black

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
the onyx t68 where it was all black
background<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.439> hard<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> read<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
background and hard to read here and it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.520 
background and hard to read here and it
just<00:01:50.939> kind<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.390> crashed<00:01:51.630> those<00:01:51.869> crashes<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> lot

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
just kind of crashed those crashes a lot

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.319 
just kind of crashed those crashes a lot
but<00:01:52.890> we're<00:01:53.520> gonna<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:53.820> whatever<00:01:53.970> reason<00:01:54.270> on

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
but we're gonna for whatever reason on

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.580 
but we're gonna for whatever reason on
this<00:01:54.420> device<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:54.869> worked<00:01:55.320> quite

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
this device it actually worked quite

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.649 
this device it actually worked quite
well<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:56.310> far<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.670> Kindle<00:01:56.969> Store<00:01:57.149> goes<00:01:57.390> and

well as far as the Kindle Store goes and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.120 
well as far as the Kindle Store goes and
I'll<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:57.960> ahead<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.229> load<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.380> an<00:01:58.619> e-book<00:01:58.890> here

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
I'll go ahead and load up an e-book here

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
I'll go ahead and load up an e-book here
and<00:01:59.250> show<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> how<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> works<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.869> well<00:02:01.079> go

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
and show you how that works as well go

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.929 
and show you how that works as well go
ahead<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.649> let<00:02:01.770> load<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> Spree<00:02:02.549> title

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
ahead and let load up the Spree title

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.420 
ahead and let load up the Spree title
that's<00:02:03.509> public<00:02:03.810> domain<00:02:04.020> title<00:02:04.380> okay<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.070> once

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that's public domain title okay so once

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.580 
that's public domain title okay so once
the<00:02:05.490> page<00:02:05.729> loads<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> same<00:02:07.380> deal

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the page loads here it's the same deal

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.800 
the page loads here it's the same deal
with<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> t68<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> Kindle<00:02:09.270> app<00:02:09.420> isn't

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
with the t68 so the Kindle app isn't

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.200 
with the t68 so the Kindle app isn't
hard-coded<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.920> page<00:02:11.340> buttons<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:11.970> when

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
hard-coded for page buttons so when

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.670 
hard-coded for page buttons so when
you<00:02:12.300> use<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> page<00:02:12.810> buttons<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.380> device

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you use the page buttons on the device

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.030 
you use the page buttons on the device
the<00:02:14.930> pages<00:02:15.930> don't<00:02:16.110> turn<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.650> that's<00:02:16.800> kind<00:02:17.010> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the pages don't turn so that's kind of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280 
the pages don't turn so that's kind of
something<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.240> got<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.420> expect<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:19.080> most

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
something you got to expect with most

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.590 
something you got to expect with most
the<00:02:19.440> reading<00:02:19.920> apps<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.430> just<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
the reading apps on here just like the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.780 
the reading apps on here just like the
pre-installed<00:02:22.560> app<00:02:22.710> basically<00:02:23.040> reading<00:02:23.610> apps

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
pre-installed app basically reading apps

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.190 
pre-installed app basically reading apps
in<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.360> browser<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.810> stuff<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.080> can

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
in like the browser and stuff you can

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.770 
in like the browser and stuff you can
use<00:02:25.260> these<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.650> scroll<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.300> know<00:02:27.420> if<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
use these to scroll but you know if the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.630 
use these to scroll but you know if the
you<00:02:28.260> reading<00:02:28.560> apps<00:02:28.710> these<00:02:28.950> third-party<00:02:29.160> apps

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you reading apps these third-party apps

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.070 
you reading apps these third-party apps
you<00:02:29.820> usually<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.300> have<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.600> use<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
you usually just have to use the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.770 
you usually just have to use the
touchscreen<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.100> like<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.370> would<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.880> tablet

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
touchscreen just like you would a tablet

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.990 
touchscreen just like you would a tablet
you<00:02:33.990> just<00:02:34.590> tap<00:02:34.740> on<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> screen<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.520> pages

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you just tap on the screen and pages

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.670 
you just tap on the screen and pages
four<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.540> as<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.750> see<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.080> does<00:02:37.260> sort<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.560> an

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
four so as you see it does sort of an

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.850 
four so as you see it does sort of an
effect<00:02:38.600> it's<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.660> little<00:02:39.900> bit<00:02:40.020> smoother<00:02:40.560> than

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
effect it's a little bit smoother than

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.310 
effect it's a little bit smoother than
it<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> t68<00:02:41.940> for<00:02:42.120> whatever<00:02:42.270> reason<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
it is on the t68 for whatever reason the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.010 
it is on the t68 for whatever reason the
font<00:02:43.590> tends<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.130> state<00:02:44.370> darker<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.570> doesn't

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
font tends to state darker it doesn't

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.730 
font tends to state darker it doesn't
seem<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.350> get<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:46.800> rough<00:02:47.760> around<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.180> edges

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
seem to get as rough around the edges

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.930 
seem to get as rough around the edges
when<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.800> do<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> page<00:02:50.190> fording<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.760> this

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
when you do the page fording like this

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.490 
when you do the page fording like this
and<00:02:51.090> when<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.300> does<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.810> device<00:02:52.110> has<00:02:52.350> this

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and when it does this device has this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.650 
and when it does this device has this
page<00:02:52.800> or<00:02:53.190> refresh<00:02:53.610> right<00:02:53.880> there<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.300> anytime

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
page or refresh right there so anytime

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.930 
page or refresh right there so anytime
you<00:02:54.750> hit<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.080> it'll<00:02:55.890> actually<00:02:56.040> refresh<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
you hit that it'll actually refresh the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.060 
you hit that it'll actually refresh the
screen<00:02:57.210> and<00:02:57.570> kind<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.650> get<00:02:58.740> rid<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.920> any

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
screen and kind of get rid of any

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.880 
screen and kind of get rid of any
ghosting<00:02:59.520> or<00:02:59.760> after<00:03:00.030> images<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.350> mean<00:03:01.740> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
ghosting or after images so I mean the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.200

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.580 
like going to the library view and it's
just<00:04:35.600> a<00:04:35.690> little<00:04:35.810> bit<00:04:35.960> easier<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.350> then<00:04:36.440> like

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
just a little bit easier and then like

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.440 
just a little bit easier and then like
once<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:36.860> scroll<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.820> will<00:04:38.060> go<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.330> the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
once you scroll it will go to the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.030 
once you scroll it will go to the
partial<00:04:38.780> Refresh<00:04:39.170> mode<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:39.680> stays<00:04:39.890> nice

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
partial Refresh mode so it stays nice

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.160 
partial Refresh mode so it stays nice
and<00:04:40.280> smooth<00:04:40.640> but<00:04:40.910> obviously<00:04:41.570> on<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.780> carousel

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
and smooth but obviously on the carousel

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.190 
and smooth but obviously on the carousel
it<00:04:42.350> doesn't<00:04:42.650> invoke<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.850> partial<00:04:44.300> refresh<00:04:44.990> so

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
it doesn't invoke the partial refresh so

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.420 
it doesn't invoke the partial refresh so
it's<00:04:45.320> just<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.530> little<00:04:45.650> bit<00:04:45.830> rougher<00:04:46.130> as<00:04:46.190> far<00:04:46.340> as

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
it's just a little bit rougher as far as

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.570 
it's just a little bit rougher as far as
that<00:04:46.550> goes

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.220
