a actually very very high-end desk lamp
I<00:00:21.960> mean<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.260> exactly<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:23.010> market<00:00:24.000> which

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
I mean it's not exactly a market which

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.089 
I mean it's not exactly a market which
is<00:00:24.150> thriving<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> moment<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.740> terms

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
is thriving at the moment but in terms

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.620 
is thriving at the moment but in terms
of<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.490> stuff<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.910> available<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.480> is

touch nonetheless this thing is great in
terms<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> maneuverability<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.890> can

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
terms of maneuverability you can

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.430 
terms of maneuverability you can
actually<00:00:47.190> rotate<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:48.000> through<00:00:48.140> 360<00:00:49.140> degrees

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
actually rotate it through 360 degrees
and<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.129> also<00:00:50.250> rotate<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.879> down<00:00:51.239> left

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and you can also rotate it up down left

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
and you can also rotate it up down left
right<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.250> make<00:00:53.340> sure<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
right and you know you can make sure you

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.979 
right and you know you can make sure you
get<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> exact<00:00:54.329> angle<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.960> lighting

actually a USB port on the side which is
a<00:00:59.640> really<00:01:00.390> clever<00:01:00.719> introduction<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.500> can't

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
a really clever introduction I can't

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.020 
a really clever introduction I can't
understand<00:01:02.160> why<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.489> manufacturers

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
understand why more manufacturers

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.090 
understand why more manufacturers
haven't<00:01:03.359> done<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.710> as<00:01:04.710> something<00:01:04.920> else

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
haven't done this as something else

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.469 
haven't done this as something else
which<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.369> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.610> unique<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> way<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
which is kind of unique is the way that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.910 
which is kind of unique is the way that
this<00:01:06.689> light<00:01:06.960> actually<00:01:07.110> folds<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.860> itself

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
this light actually folds in on itself

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.140 
this light actually folds in on itself
creating<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:09.299> sort<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.720> room<00:01:10.020> feature<00:01:11.000> now<00:01:12.000> what

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
creating a sort of room feature now what

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
creating a sort of room feature now what
this<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.630> kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.250> relaxing<00:01:14.250> sort

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
this is is kind of like a relaxing sort

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.010 
this is is kind of like a relaxing sort
of<00:01:14.880> mode<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:15.659> put<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> on

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
of mode that you can actually put it on

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020 
of mode that you can actually put it on
where<00:01:16.259> either<00:01:16.439> dims<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> light<00:01:17.189> let's<00:01:17.790> less

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
where either dims the light let's less

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.820 
where either dims the light let's less
through<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.600> looks<00:01:18.960> pretty<00:01:19.200> nice<00:01:19.470> so

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
through and just looks pretty nice so

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.020 
through and just looks pretty nice so
the<00:01:19.920> main<00:01:20.070> differentiator<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.790> this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the main differentiator for this

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
the main differentiator for this
particular<00:01:21.299> desk<00:01:21.720> lamp<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> ability<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
particular desk lamp is the ability to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
particular desk lamp is the ability to
adjust<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.430> only<00:01:23.460> brightness<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.330> also

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
adjust not only brightness but also

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
adjust not only brightness but also
color<00:01:24.869> temperature<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.220> thing<00:01:26.369> has<00:01:26.490> two

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
color temperature so this thing has two

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.609 
color temperature so this thing has two
different<00:01:27.180> colors<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.600> LEDs<00:01:27.930> built<00:01:28.200> into<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
different colors of LEDs built into it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.830 
different colors of LEDs built into it
which<00:01:28.799> allows<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.630> adjust<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
which allows you to actually adjust the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.170 
which allows you to actually adjust the
sort<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> warmth<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> light<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.880> reading

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
sort of warmth of the light so reading

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.550 
sort of warmth of the light so reading
light<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.509> example<00:01:33.540> will<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.259> broad

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
light for example will be like broad

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
light for example will be like broad
daylight<00:01:34.829> will<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.250> harsh<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.850> it'll

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
daylight will be harsh and it'll

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.670 
daylight will be harsh and it'll
actually<00:01:36.540> bring<00:01:37.049> out<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> color<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.590> your

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
actually bring out the color of your

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920 
actually bring out the color of your
text<00:01:38.040> make<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.640> much<00:01:38.790> sharper<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.450> easier<00:01:39.810> to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
text make it much sharper and easier to

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.200 
text make it much sharper and easier to
read<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.070> example<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.490> sleep<00:01:41.729> light<00:01:42.000> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
read where for example a sleep light is
