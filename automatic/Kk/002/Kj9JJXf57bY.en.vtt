00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
device and like an output doubles up as

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
device and like an output doubles up as
protection<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.099> bluetooth<00:00:32.969> keyboard<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
protection as well bluetooth keyboard so

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.740 
protection as well bluetooth keyboard so
that's<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> windows<00:00:34.710> 8<00:00:35.070> UI<00:00:35.940> right<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that's the windows 8 UI right there the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.360 
that's the windows 8 UI right there the
tiled<00:00:36.930> interface<00:00:37.050> let's<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
tiled interface let's go into the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
64gb so it's pretty lightweight the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.910 
64gb so it's pretty lightweight the
tablet<00:01:06.430> alone<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.890> it's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.140 

promising<00:01:11.920> about<00:01:12.130> 10<00:01:12.280> hours<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.700> battery<00:01:12.790> life

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
promising about 10 hours of battery life

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.020 
promising about 10 hours of battery life
and<00:01:13.540> it's<00:01:14.380> got<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.590> 720p<00:01:15.160> plan<00:01:15.550> earlier<00:01:15.820> the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
and it's got a 720p plan earlier the

and it's got a 720p plan earlier the
8-inch<00:01:16.330> screen<00:01:16.570> so<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.680> keyboard<00:01:18.100> also<00:01:18.220> is

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
8-inch screen so the keyboard also is

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.370 
8-inch screen so the keyboard also is
pretty<00:01:18.670> nice<00:01:18.850> actually<00:01:18.880> laxity<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:20.230> let's

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
pretty nice actually laxity so let's

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.290 
pretty nice actually laxity so let's
quickly<00:01:20.470> go<00:01:20.800> ahead<00:01:20.980> and<00:01:21.130> open<00:01:21.340> up<00:01:21.400> notepad

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
quickly go ahead and open up notepad

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:31.010 
quickly go ahead and open up notepad

pretty good so let's quickly try to get
an<00:01:41.579> ad<00:01:41.759> then

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.920 

so<00:01:47.640> yeah<00:01:47.760> so<00:01:47.940> that's<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.330> keyboard<00:01:48.780> right

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930

so yeah so that's the keyboard right
there<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.410> keyboard<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:50.010> it's<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
there the keyboard actually it's a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.260 
there the keyboard actually it's a
standard<00:01:51.330> Windows<00:01:52.110> 8<00:01:52.530> tablet<00:01:52.980> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.910> first

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.120 

mix<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:57.200> exacting<00:01:57.649> successor<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.039> the

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
mix to exacting successor to the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.149 
mix to exacting successor to the
original<00:01:58.219> mix<00:01:58.789> so

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
original mix so

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.279 
original mix so
you<00:02:00.609> have<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:02.229> it<00:02:02.259> looks<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:03.899> card<00:02:04.899> slot

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
you have what it looks like card slot

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.620 
you have what it looks like card slot
right<00:02:05.530> there<00:02:05.799> over<00:02:06.369> here<00:02:06.579> as<00:02:06.999> it<00:02:07.179> has<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.329> volume

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
right there over here as it has a volume

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.190 
right there over here as it has a volume
rocker<00:02:08.110> here<00:02:08.379> so<00:02:09.420> that's<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.539> work<00:02:10.929> that's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
rocker here so that's the work that's

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.580 
rocker here so that's the work that's
what<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.769> right

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.930 

and<00:02:14.709> on<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.069> top<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> camp

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
and on the top you have the camp

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.960 
and on the top you have the camp
amymarie<00:02:16.360> attack

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.220 

nothing<00:02:19.600> on<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.750> bottom

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
nothing on the bottom

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.110 
nothing on the bottom
let's<00:02:21.830> quickly<00:02:21.980> see<00:02:22.310> if<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.489> can<00:02:22.640> get<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:23.000> out
