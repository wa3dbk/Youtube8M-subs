00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.240
 we will reign for the podium first 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.890
 What I'm going to do is provide what sounds 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 as a bad thing but there is a way 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 super simple weakness steal that we 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.250
 fit well with the way we are separated 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.070
 in which is filled with the legs like this and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.949
 they will not look 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.340
 I tell you, we take a little thread in 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.270
 tricks is in more or less take then 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:30.680
 as what love each one with arms 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:34.010
 catch lame like that and now the super tales 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.270
 simple first thing is to put the chicken in 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.480
 this position 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.470
 as if I was there 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.470
 now you take the thread at both ends 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:52.309
 we make a yarn crossing like this and with the 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.650
 fingers we hold in this way between 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.300
 the thumb and the index have the 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.350
 ends and then we have like a tie 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.680
 Well, we put this loop 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:08.750
 around the stumps of the legs 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:13.190
 so it is crossed and we already apply a little 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.100
 It is important not to drop the wine 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.220
 Once we have this, I'm going to go through 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.340
 where are the thighs is here passes 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.080
 by the thighs and then without releasing the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.580
 thread we make 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.370
 turn around 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.200
 and so again without letting go and I from 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.850
 we can make another crossing 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.810
 we went through here 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:43.480
 and we press a little now turn another 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.940
 time to how was a two and three and 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.300
 we take 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.470
 and we crossed it in front another crossing of 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.290
 unjust threads down here in front and 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.720
 we squeeze a little bit to see how the 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:04.150
 breasts like they gave up 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.570
 well and now back we hold the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.570
 wings 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.090
 just from being in this space is where 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.200
 let's finish making a cross 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.200
 thread to see 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.690
 here we squeeze pretty well 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.750
 a world 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.910
 call of the dock 1 2 and 3 and now it's 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.400
 fixed 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.450
 with a knife we cut the thread that we 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.940
 this is out and the result is that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.650
 the chicken we have to do to vÃ­ctor and 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.000
 is not going to move from here when 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.760
 we are going to be left with a way 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.100
 perfect just like the two sides 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.400
 breasts up the walls in his 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.250
 site and we do not have to use my needle 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.790
 to forget neither to sew on the one hand nor to sew 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.340
 On the other hand, there is no claw 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.950
 remember one thing that I chose before and 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.140
 is that area a little inside if you 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.670
 you are going to put a limbo inside or a 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.960
 orange an onion 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.240
 those who are butter of triumph 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.270
 that you have to put it before because now 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.610
 already of possibility to do it but of this 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.180
 way more chicken 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.180
 perfect
