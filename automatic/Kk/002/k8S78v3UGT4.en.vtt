who play for Korean they are okay
they're<00:00:20.850> members<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:22.189> Korean<00:00:23.189> eSports<00:00:23.640> team

they're members of a Korean eSports team
we<00:00:24.060> don't<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.269> which<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
we don't know which one that is and I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.980 
we don't know which one that is and I
don't<00:00:25.439> know<00:00:25.590> who<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:25.949> are<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.130> um<00:00:27.090> supposedly

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
don't know who they are so um supposedly

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
don't know who they are so um supposedly
though<00:00:28.320> they<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.099> probably<00:00:29.400> pretty<00:00:29.880> good

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
though they are probably pretty good

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.290 
though they are probably pretty good
because<00:00:30.390> at<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.560> point<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.920> time<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:33.090> not

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
because at this point in time I have not

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.270 
because at this point in time I have not
yet<00:00:33.510> had<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:34.079> picture<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> box<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
yet had my picture on the box of a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
yet had my picture on the box of a
product<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.329> they<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.410> they

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
product so if they can do it then they

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.830 
product so if they can do it then they
must<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.370> better<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.730> video<00:00:38.969> games<00:00:39.239> than<00:00:39.570> me

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
must be better at video games than me

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
must be better at video games than me
which<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.010> saying<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:42.059> sure

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
which is not saying much but I'm sure

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
which is not saying much but I'm sure
they're<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.420> good<00:00:42.719> okay<00:00:42.989> anyway<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.290> it's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
they're really good okay anyway so it's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.250 
they're really good okay anyway so it's
optimized<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.489> RTS<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.270> earth<00:00:45.719> does<00:00:46.050> that

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
optimized for RTS one earth does that

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
optimized for RTS one earth does that
even<00:00:46.440> mean<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.160> has<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> couple<00:00:47.610> features<00:00:47.910> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
even mean it has a couple features that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
even mean it has a couple features that
you<00:00:48.480> might<00:00:48.629> find<00:00:48.840> relevant<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.440> first<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.860> all

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you might find relevant so first of all

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.680 
you might find relevant so first of all
let's<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> way<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.660> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
let's get this out of the way this is a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.830 
let's get this out of the way this is a
TN<00:00:52.140> monitor<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.670> speed<00:00:54.180> optimized

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
TN monitor so this is a speed optimized

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.830 
TN monitor so this is a speed optimized
rather<00:00:55.620> than<00:00:55.980> color<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:58.879> accuracy<00:00:59.879> optimized

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
rather than color and accuracy optimized

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.930 
rather than color and accuracy optimized
monitor<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.829> shouldn't<00:01:02.070> say<00:01:02.160> accuracy

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
monitor that shouldn't say accuracy

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
monitor that shouldn't say accuracy
because<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.420> mean<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> pixels<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> pixel<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
because I mean a pixels a pixel you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
because I mean a pixels a pixel you
don't<00:01:04.860> exactly<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.299> monitor

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
don't exactly it's not like one monitor

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
don't exactly it's not like one monitor
is<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.020> blurrier<00:01:07.860> than<00:01:07.920> another<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.150> by

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
is like blurrier than another one but by

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.179 
is like blurrier than another one but by
accuracy<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> mean<00:01:10.350> mostly<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> color

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
accuracy I mean mostly the color

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.570

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
accuracy the vibrance TN panels are
usually<00:01:14.700> plenty<00:01:15.210> bright<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> tend<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
usually plenty bright but you tend to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.609 
usually plenty bright but you tend to
have<00:01:16.950> less<00:01:17.549> contrast<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:18.990> whites<00:01:19.290> are

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
have less contrast so your whites are

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.870 
have less contrast so your whites are
darker<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.700> blacks<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.420> lighter<00:01:22.880> however

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
darker your blacks are lighter however

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.330 
darker your blacks are lighter however
what<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.920> because

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
what you get for all of that because

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.920 
what you get for all of that because
you're<00:01:26.490> doing<00:01:26.700> very<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.000> processing<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you're doing very little processing to

you're doing very little processing to
the<00:01:28.049> image<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.250> using<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.790> faster

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
less accurate panel is you get the quick

2 milliseconds grade of gray which means

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.770 
2 milliseconds grade of gray which means

notice<00:01:59.549> less<00:02:00.390> input<00:02:00.899> lag<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.520> less<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
notice less input lag and less of a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.429 
notice less input lag and less of a
overall<00:02:04.380> delay<00:02:04.950> between<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:06.439> screen

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
overall delay between the screen

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.460 
overall delay between the screen
refreshing<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.660> being<00:02:09.929> as<00:02:10.080> refreshed

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
refreshing and it not being as refreshed

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.210 
refreshing and it not being as refreshed
as<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.830> is

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
as it is

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.120 
as it is
so<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.570> say<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> sixty

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
so that is to say that it is a sixty

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.580 
so that is to say that it is a sixty
Hertz<00:02:14.250> panel<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.390> between<00:02:15.600> one<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.470> those

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
Hertz panel and in between one of those

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.230 
Hertz panel and in between one of those
flashes<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.250> second<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.790> next<00:02:18.030> one

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
flashes in a second and the next one

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.530 
flashes in a second and the next one
you're<00:02:18.570> gonna<00:02:18.720> see<00:02:19.020> less<00:02:19.500> less<00:02:20.430> blurriness<00:02:21.270> as

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
you're gonna see less less blurriness as

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.620 
you're gonna see less less blurriness as
well<00:02:22.440> as<00:02:22.710> less<00:02:23.550> lag<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:26.060> here<00:02:27.060> we<00:02:27.150> go<00:02:27.360> just

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
well as less lag so here we go just

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.770 
well as less lag so here we go just
gonna<00:02:27.840> take<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.290> off<00:02:29.180> what<00:02:30.180> else<00:02:30.330> makes<00:02:30.600> it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
gonna take this off what else makes it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.410 
gonna take this off what else makes it
RTS<00:02:31.320> optimized<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.100> might<00:02:32.250> ask<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.210> would

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
RTS optimized you might ask and I would

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.360 
RTS optimized you might ask and I would
tell<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.410> what's<00:02:34.740> kind<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.100> cool<00:02:35.310> about

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
tell you that what's kind of cool about

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.860 
tell you that what's kind of cool about
it<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.060> one<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.450> reasons<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it and this is one of the reasons that

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.200 
it and this is one of the reasons that
Intel<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.590> actually<00:02:38.040> using<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:38.580> particular

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
Intel is actually using this particular

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.440 
Intel is actually using this particular
display<00:02:39.690> for<00:02:40.620> tournaments<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.460> that<00:02:42.240> it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
display for tournaments is that it

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.660 
display for tournaments is that it
includes<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.170> mode<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.440> allows<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.430> your

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
includes a mode that allows you to your

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.840 
includes a mode that allows you to your
real<00:02:44.820> ah<00:02:45.080> bah<00:02:46.080> blah<00:02:46.260> blah<00:02:46.470> black<00:02:47.280> equalizer

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
real ah bah blah blah black equalizer

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.550 
real ah bah blah blah black equalizer
for<00:02:48.150> optimum<00:02:48.540> visibility<00:02:49.020> oh<00:02:49.050> that's<00:02:49.350> that's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
for optimum visibility oh that's that's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.170 
for optimum visibility oh that's that's
actually<00:02:49.800> interesting<00:02:50.130> okay<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> cool

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
actually interesting okay this is a cool

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.550 
actually interesting okay this is a cool
feature<00:02:51.360> out<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.750> everything<00:02:51.990> I'd<00:02:52.260> say<00:02:52.410> this

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
feature out of everything I'd say this

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.410 
feature out of everything I'd say this
is<00:02:52.620> probably<00:02:53.100> one<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.400> biggest<00:02:53.700> ones<00:02:53.880> so

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
is probably one of the biggest ones so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.940 
is probably one of the biggest ones so
what<00:02:54.780> they've<00:02:54.930> done<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.230> they've<00:02:55.380> optimized

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
what they've done is they've optimized

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.070 
what they've done is they've optimized
the<00:02:56.430> output<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.120> display<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.930> while

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
the output of the display so while

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.540 
the output of the display so while
you're<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.380> gonna<00:02:58.500> get<00:02:58.740> necessarily<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
you're not gonna get necessarily the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.280 
you're not gonna get necessarily the
best<00:02:59.730> color<00:02:59.970> or<00:03:00.300> whatever<00:03:00.630> else<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.990> gonna<00:03:01.140> be

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
best color or whatever else is gonna be

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
best color or whatever else is gonna be
fast<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.980> you're<00:03:02.370> going<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.730> be<00:03:02.850> able<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
fast and you're going to be able to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.090 
fast and you're going to be able to
clearly<00:03:03.480> see<00:03:03.810> details<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.530> dark<00:03:04.650> so

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
clearly see details in the dark so

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.800 
clearly see details in the dark so
they've<00:03:05.280> tweaked<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> little<00:03:05.940> bit<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:06.780> that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
they've tweaked it a little bit so that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.930 
they've tweaked it a little bit so that
when<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.440> have<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.610> know<00:03:08.700> let's<00:03:08.850> say

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
when you have like a you know let's say

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.370 
when you have like a you know let's say
you're<00:03:09.060> playing<00:03:09.180> an<00:03:09.390> RTS<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:09.959> have<00:03:10.110> sort

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
you're playing an RTS and you have sort

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.800 
you're playing an RTS and you have sort
of<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.560> fog<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.070> war<00:03:11.100> or<00:03:11.580> whatever<00:03:11.880> type<00:03:12.150> less

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
of a fog of war or whatever type less

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.449 
of a fog of war or whatever type less
visibility<00:03:13.260> area<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.980> map<00:03:14.160> you'll<00:03:14.370> be

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
visibility area of the map you'll be

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.890 
visibility area of the map you'll be
able<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.880> see<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.360> units

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
able to see the units

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.630 
able to see the units
what<00:03:16.320> kind<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.650> units<00:03:16.950> they<00:03:17.100> are<00:03:17.130> as<00:03:17.340> opposed

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
what kind of units they are as opposed

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.920 
what kind of units they are as opposed
to<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:17.880> seeing<00:03:18.120> sort<00:03:18.300> of<00:03:18.450> black<00:03:18.660> shapes

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
to just seeing sort of black shapes

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.540 
to just seeing sort of black shapes
moving<00:03:19.140> on<00:03:19.380> top<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.739> black<00:03:19.920> background<00:03:20.160> and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
moving on top of a black background and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.590 
moving on top of a black background and
then<00:03:20.730> all<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:21.000> sudden<00:03:21.030> they're<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.450> your

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
then all of a sudden they're in your

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.690 
then all of a sudden they're in your
base<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.019> you're<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.560> trouble<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.550> that's

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
base and you're in trouble so that's

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.979 
base and you're in trouble so that's
kind<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:23.940> neat<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.239> then<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.630> guy<00:03:24.810> right

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
kind of neat and then this guy right

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.600 
kind of neat and then this guy right
here<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.560> why<00:03:25.650> Intel<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.280> and

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
here so this is why Intel is and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.800 
here so this is why Intel is and
actually<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.090> lot<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.269> tournaments<00:03:27.510> are

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
actually a lot of tournaments are

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.680 
actually a lot of tournaments are
starting<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.170> use<00:03:28.320> these<00:03:28.470> BenQ<00:03:28.890> monitors

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
starting to use these BenQ monitors

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.940 
starting to use these BenQ monitors
right<00:03:30.690> here<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.110> can<00:03:31.320> switch<00:03:31.739> between

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
right here so you can switch between

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.860 
right here so you can switch between
display<00:03:32.459> modes<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.150> virtualize<00:03:33.810> a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
display modes so you can virtualize a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.340 
display modes so you can virtualize a
17-inch<00:03:34.560> 19-inch<00:03:35.130> 19-inch<00:03:35.760> y<00:03:35.970> 21<00:03:36.360> Y<00:03:36.600> 22<00:03:37.170> wide

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
17-inch 19-inch 19-inch y 21 Y 22 wide

the bar in terms of the overall

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.550 
the bar in terms of the overall
usability<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.910> their<00:04:48.150> monitors<00:04:48.539> because<00:04:49.199> even

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
usability of their monitors because even

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.050 
usability of their monitors because even

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
on their lower end monitors and you can

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.430 
on their lower end monitors and you can
tell<00:04:51.270> what<00:04:51.479> it's<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.720> lower<00:04:51.870> end<00:04:52.110> monitor

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
tell what it's a lower end monitor

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.029 
tell what it's a lower end monitor
because<00:04:52.770> it'll<00:04:52.979> tend<00:04:53.159> to<00:04:53.400> sort<00:04:53.849> of<00:04:54.000> not<00:04:54.360> be<00:04:54.630> as

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
because it'll tend to sort of not be as

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.290 
because it'll tend to sort of not be as
robustly<00:04:56.039> built<00:04:56.400> as<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.909> higher<00:04:57.090> end

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
robustly built as the higher end

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.149 
robustly built as the higher end
monitors<00:04:57.659> and<00:04:57.900> I'm<00:04:58.169> not<00:04:58.349> knocking<00:04:58.710> them<00:04:59.039> I'm

monitors and I'm not knocking them I'm

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.830 
monitors and I'm not knocking them I'm
just<00:04:59.190> saying<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.789> know<00:04:59.819> you<00:05:00.090> get<00:05:00.659> what<00:05:00.750> you

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
just saying you know you get what you

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.050 
just saying you know you get what you
pay<00:05:00.960> for<00:05:00.990> even<00:05:01.680> on<00:05:01.979> a<00:05:02.190> lot<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.550> their<00:05:02.669> lower<00:05:02.819> end

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
pay for even on a lot of their lower end

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.460 
pay for even on a lot of their lower end
monitors<00:05:03.419> their<00:05:03.599> still<00:05:03.840> including<00:05:04.289> things

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
monitors their still including things

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.930 
monitors their still including things
like<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.680> height<00:05:04.919> adjustable<00:05:05.370> stand<00:05:05.580> and

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
like a height adjustable stand and

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.779 
like a height adjustable stand and
proper<00:05:06.750> ergonomic<00:05:07.440> adjustments<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.550> think

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
proper ergonomic adjustments and I think

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.629 
proper ergonomic adjustments and I think
that<00:05:08.909> is<00:05:09.060> critical<00:05:09.270> because<00:05:10.370> everybody<00:05:11.370> needs

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
that is critical because everybody needs

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.370 
that is critical because everybody needs

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
being able to adjust it is instrumental

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.890 
being able to adjust it is instrumental
in<00:05:20.639> that<00:05:20.819> so<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.000> would<00:05:21.270> rather<00:05:21.509> have<00:05:21.840> a

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
in that so I would rather have a

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.420 
in that so I would rather have a
slightly<00:05:22.349> less<00:05:23.190> built<00:05:23.909> up<00:05:24.800> stand<00:05:25.800> that

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
slightly less built up stand that

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.129 
slightly less built up stand that
actually<00:05:26.820> has<00:05:27.000> all<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.300> adjustments<00:05:27.810> versus

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
actually has all the adjustments versus

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.540 
actually has all the adjustments versus
having<00:05:28.289> one<00:05:28.560> that<00:05:28.740> looks<00:05:28.979> really<00:05:29.190> great<00:05:29.430> and

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
having one that looks really great and

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.040 
having one that looks really great and
is<00:05:29.789> like<00:05:29.969> made<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.270> metal<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:30.599> it's<00:05:30.930> like

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
is like made of metal and it's like

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.020 
is like made of metal and it's like
beautiful<00:05:31.380> and<00:05:31.830> like<00:05:31.979> brushed<00:05:32.250> finish<00:05:32.580> but

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
beautiful and like brushed finish but

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.029 
beautiful and like brushed finish but
actually<00:05:33.419> like<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.690> can't<00:05:33.900> move<00:05:34.349> anything<00:05:34.830> so

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
actually like you can't move anything so

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.499 
actually like you can't move anything so
there<00:05:35.190> you<00:05:35.280> go<00:05:35.400> there's<00:05:35.610> my<00:05:35.669> two<00:05:35.820> cents<00:05:36.240> about

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
there you go there's my two cents about

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.779 
there you go there's my two cents about
that<00:05:36.690> I<00:05:36.930> include<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.740> VGA<00:05:38.070> cable<00:05:38.550> would<00:05:38.639> have

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
that I include the VGA cable would have

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.040 
that I include the VGA cable would have
liked<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.389> see<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.719> DVI<00:05:40.050> cable<00:05:40.169> included<00:05:41.039> but

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
liked to see a DVI cable included but

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.270 
liked to see a DVI cable included but
yeah<00:05:43.050> it's<00:05:43.469> neither<00:05:43.590> here<00:05:43.889> nor<00:05:43.919> there<00:05:44.070> I

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
yeah it's neither here nor there I

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.490 
yeah it's neither here nor there I
suppose<00:05:44.550> on<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.150> bottom<00:05:45.509> we've<00:05:45.630> got<00:05:45.659> VGA<00:05:46.169> DVI

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
suppose on the bottom we've got VGA DVI

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.950 
suppose on the bottom we've got VGA DVI
and<00:05:46.740> HDMI<00:05:47.219> in<00:05:47.880> as<00:05:48.090> well<00:05:48.270> as<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.389> headphone<00:05:48.780> out

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
and HDMI in as well as a headphone out

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.260 
and HDMI in as well as a headphone out
port<00:05:49.259> so<00:05:49.409> if<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:49.590> are<00:05:49.710> using<00:05:49.889> HDMI<00:05:50.400> then<00:05:51.060> you

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
port so if you are using HDMI then you

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.879 
port so if you are using HDMI then you
can<00:05:51.539> listen<00:05:51.900> to<00:05:52.199> your<00:05:52.349> audio<00:05:52.650> and<00:05:52.830> your

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
can listen to your audio and your

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.339 
can listen to your audio and your
headphones<00:05:53.280> there<00:05:53.580> we've<00:05:54.030> also<00:05:54.210> got<00:05:54.599> an<00:05:54.900> AC

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
headphones there we've also got an AC

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.370 
headphones there we've also got an AC
power<00:05:55.979> adapter<00:05:56.370> plug<00:05:57.180> spot<00:05:57.780> as<00:05:57.990> well<00:05:58.229> as<00:05:58.349> a

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
power adapter plug spot as well as a

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.860 
power adapter plug spot as well as a
Kensington<00:05:58.949> lock<00:05:59.099> up<00:05:59.699> here<00:06:00.150> last<00:06:00.569> but<00:06:00.750> not

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
Kensington lock up here last but not

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.890 
Kensington lock up here last but not
least<00:06:01.110> this<00:06:01.349> is<00:06:01.500> a<00:06:01.530> visa<00:06:02.099> compatible<00:06:03.060> LCD<00:06:03.750> so

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
least this is a visa compatible LCD so

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.209 
least this is a visa compatible LCD so
if<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.050> wanted<00:06:04.229> to<00:06:04.349> put<00:06:04.500> it<00:06:04.590> on<00:06:04.680> something

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
if you wanted to put it on something

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:06.920 
if you wanted to put it on something
then<00:06:05.669> you<00:06:05.909> could<00:06:06.150> do<00:06:06.330> that<00:06:06.479> you<00:06:06.659> could<00:06:06.810> just

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
then you could do that you could just

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.180 
then you could do that you could just
take<00:06:07.080> it<00:06:07.229> right<00:06:07.380> off<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.740> stand<00:06:07.949> that<00:06:08.039> it

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
take it right off the stand that it

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.559 
take it right off the stand that it
comes<00:06:08.370> with<00:06:08.550> and<00:06:08.729> put<00:06:08.789> it<00:06:08.909> on<00:06:09.030> something<00:06:09.330> else

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
comes with and put it on something else

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.080 
comes with and put it on something else
so<00:06:10.229> I<00:06:10.259> think<00:06:10.530> that<00:06:11.009> pretty<00:06:11.310> much<00:06:11.400> covers<00:06:11.759> it

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
so I think that pretty much covers it

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.670 
so I think that pretty much covers it
for<00:06:12.120> me<00:06:12.360> at<00:06:12.509> this<00:06:12.630> point<00:06:12.870> in<00:06:13.050> time<00:06:13.229> thank<00:06:13.590> you
