00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.420
 hi Guys 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.370
 Today I have a telescope for you 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.929
 Camera lens with clear cover for that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.300
 Samsung Galaxy S2 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.230
 I ordered this at Amazon here 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.800
 for 7 euro 50 is just a clear 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.650
 Cover with the back to sit on for the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.990
 lens 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.719
 further includes two cleaning cloths 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.020
 and a tape to attach the lens 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:45.510
 and I say deep down, it looks relatively 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:51.840
 well processed if not very dusty 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:57.480
 it was now i take my samsung galaxy 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:02.309
 s2 first press it into the measuring chamber 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 in to now you can on the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.110
 back see this adapter where you can 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 now the objective can be on it 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.470
 I'm doing this now is just here 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.470
 one of his relation push 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:30.710
 Goes a little hard the first time that 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.710
 she despite the beautiful 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.100
 so 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:47.060
 Now you see the final product they pretty 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.350
 blatant in my opinion but me 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.280
 really wanted to have it and have it 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.550
 ordered me so I start again the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.550
 camera 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.509
 so 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.810
 very bad to see 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:33.250
 reflect this with yourself 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:37.780
 definitely reflects here 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.580
 a slightly black border around the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:47.430
 display because it is synonymous with the photo 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.430
 The focus is relative 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.450
 I have to say good 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.010
 However, it depends on the original photo because 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.170
 it can stomach the samsung galaxy s2 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.740
 not believe, however, if you want something you 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.740
 shoot a picture 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.340
 Of course you have the lightning 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.440
 turn off 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.440
 otherwise it will come back to reflections 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:24.959
 The short has to be briefly the light 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:27.500
 Now I will like the picture 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.500
 demonstrate 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:43.209
 So I saw that shot now 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:46.050
 the black border of this page what 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.940
 you have to say that for 7 euro 50 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:57.040
 this lens is very high processed 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:00.430
 It's a little gag and falls 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.330
 Of course, continue and have a lot of fun 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.330
 and bye
