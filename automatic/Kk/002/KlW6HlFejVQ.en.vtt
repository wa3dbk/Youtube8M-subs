that's the case here most of the people
here<00:02:58.209> wants<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:58.989> know<00:02:59.079> more<00:02:59.980> about<00:03:00.370> teeth<00:03:01.269> and

dentures<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:03.129> here's<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:04.060> idea<00:03:04.799> I'm<00:03:05.799> thinking

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
dentures so here's the idea I'm thinking

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.970
