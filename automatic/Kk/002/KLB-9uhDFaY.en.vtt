00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.220
 operation of the production system 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.279
 of artificial queens will require three 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.200
 structures an apiary with 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.480
 hives from where they will be removed 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.230
 children up to three days 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.660
 called donor hives and also 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.100
 hive is re-breeding and production of 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.309
 Royal jelly 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.650
 a laboratory to make the domes 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.590
 grafting and then manipulating the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.629
 queens produced and a second the daily 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.629
 where the nuclei of fertilization will be 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.600
 the rearing apiary has basic structure 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.720
 very similar to a common apiary the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 begin standard of type long stanza and 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.730
 shall be equipped for the supply of 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.559
 artificial power supply and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.060
 these beehives because they are orphans 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.580
 They need a constant replacement 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.480
 its population with children's pictures 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.420
 feel the pictures will come from hives 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.570
 donors not orphanages that have queen 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.570
 always new and good layers in order to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.490
 always be populous will provide 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.160
 two types of frames 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.860
 use creates the new ones that will be used 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.080
 for grafting and those of nascent pups 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.400
 to maintain the population in the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.100
 comedies recreates the hives used to 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.040
 the production of royal jelly per pull 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.490
 natural by artificial techniques also 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.250
 are kept constantly or spoken to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.570
 royal jelly is used in grafting as 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.570
 larval food 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.050
 the laboratory should have benches for 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.780
 work lined with material 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.220
 as well as the walls and the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.110
 floor to facilitate sanitation 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.570
 need good lighting and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.250
 nylon on the windows and doors to prevent 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.040
 bees should also be 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.110
 situated as close as possible to the apiary 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.190
 for the time of transport 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.190
 of the larvae 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.770
 before and after the grafting is minimal 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.690
 avoiding losses of pups due to delay 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.690
 on their replacement in conversations 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.140
 already the fertilization apiary counts on 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.390
 different hives of the petroleum wool they have 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.890
 half the dimensions in terms of 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.530
 width and only five frames 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.270
 its function is to receive the virgin queen 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.030
 waiting for the wedding flight and the beginning of 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.590
 when it is withdrawn because of 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.590
 should be lower cost 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.150
 these comedies are called nuclei 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.400
 of fertilization and also depend on 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.560
 trade with creative staff 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.340
 so that they can keep 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.250
 activity as it has a small population 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.230
 They always have 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.690
 to reduce the chances of plundering 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.700
 food reserves and structure for 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.700
 artificial feeding supply 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.910
 in the apiary are placed on some 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.390
 type of support in this case 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.610
 wood that can be double every profit 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.040
 have al wahda facing one side 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.770
 support to make it easier to 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.540
 of the entrance of the beehive when returning 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.540
 of the queen after the official flight
