00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
concept there it's a shot glass of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.010 
concept there it's a shot glass of
course<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:08.610> start<00:01:08.790> melting<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.960> do

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
course when they start melting they do

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.690 
course when they start melting they do

it nice and cold these other ones now
I'm<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.650> use<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.159> lot<00:01:20.310> more<00:01:20.390> these<00:01:21.390> basically

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
I'm gonna use a lot more these basically

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.990 
I'm gonna use a lot more these basically
just<00:01:21.960> make<00:01:22.110> little<00:01:22.290> spheres<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.729> when<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
just make little spheres and when you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.330 
just make little spheres and when you
pour<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.330> into<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> mold<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.770> kind<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.220> uh

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pour it into the mold it kind of uh

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
pour it into the mold it kind of uh
because<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.820> lips<00:01:27.030> sharp<00:01:27.540> they're<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.259> water

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
because the lips sharp they're the water

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.990 
because the lips sharp they're the water
bubbles<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.400> before<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.700> spills

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
bubbles up a little bit before it spills

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.590 
bubbles up a little bit before it spills
over<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.229> pop<00:01:31.380> these<00:01:31.590> out<00:01:31.860> oh<00:01:32.600> just

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
over so when you pop these out oh just

over so when you pop these out oh just
guzzle<00:01:33.990> eat<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.290> one

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
guzzle eat that one

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.249 
guzzle eat that one
they<00:01:36.810> make<00:01:37.049> marble<00:01:37.770> shapes<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.490> marble<00:01:38.820> sized

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259

they make marble shapes or marble sized
perfectly<00:01:40.259> round<00:01:40.770> spheres<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.790> they're

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
perfectly round spheres and they're

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.830 
perfectly round spheres and they're
little<00:01:42.119> cloudy<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.600> used<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> have

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
little cloudy because I used to have

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.429 
little cloudy because I used to have
water<00:01:43.140> use<00:01:43.649> distilled<00:01:43.979> water<00:01:44.189> it'll<00:01:45.060> be

water use distilled water it'll be
perfectly<00:01:46.439> crystal<00:01:46.740> clear<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> punch

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
perfectly crystal clear so the punch

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.310 
perfectly crystal clear so the punch
these<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.259> class<00:01:50.750> stay<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:51.990> easy<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.229> get

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
these in class stay really easy to get

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.950 
these in class stay really easy to get
out

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.990 

which<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.830> pretty<00:01:55.950> cool<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.370> sphere<00:01:56.700> ice

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
which is pretty cool the sphere ice

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.370 
which is pretty cool the sphere ice
won't<00:01:57.660> melt<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.230> fast<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.920> a<00:02:00.200> traditional<00:02:01.200> ice

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
won't melt as fast as a traditional ice

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.380 
won't melt as fast as a traditional ice
because<00:02:01.770> there's<00:02:02.070> less<00:02:02.580> surface<00:02:02.790> area<00:02:03.090> with

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
because there's less surface area with

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.080 
because there's less surface area with
those<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:04.260> surface<00:02:04.590> area<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.160> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
those that surface area but the the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.660 
those that surface area but the the
corners<00:02:07.130> at<00:02:08.130> all<00:02:08.250> them

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
corners at all them

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850 
corners at all them
yeah<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.300> corners<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.810> ice<00:02:09.960> is<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.350> helps<00:02:10.710> it

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
yeah the corners of ice is what helps it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.240 
yeah the corners of ice is what helps it
to<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.730> melt<00:02:11.970> or<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.530> allows<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.010> melt

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
to to melt or you know allows it to melt

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.850 
to to melt or you know allows it to melt
faster<00:02:14.580> kind<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:14.940> same<00:02:15.120> concept<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:15.960> burning

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
faster kind of same concept as burning

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.530 
faster kind of same concept as burning
wood<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.550> harder<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.000> burn<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:19.940> rounded<00:02:20.940> log

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
wood it's harder to burn a rounded log

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.760 
wood it's harder to burn a rounded log
than<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:23.010> burn<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.730> log<00:02:24.300> get<00:02:24.510> some<00:02:24.780> air

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
than it is to burn a log get some air

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.300 
than it is to burn a log get some air
rectangular<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.460> edge<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:32.040> mean<00:02:32.190> it's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
rectangular with edge so I mean it's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.620 
rectangular with edge so I mean it's
total<00:02:32.580> novelty<00:02:33.350> yes<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.650> kind<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.830> cool

total novelty yes so it's kind of cool
these<00:02:36.630> are<00:02:36.690> much<00:02:37.590> better<00:02:37.770> suited<00:02:38.310> for<00:02:38.370> for

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
these are much better suited for for

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.480 
these are much better suited for for
party<00:02:39.330> stuff<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.920> know<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.070> doubt<00:02:41.280> people
