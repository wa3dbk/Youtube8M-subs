all<00:00:01.949> right<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.100> want<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.340> talk<00:00:02.490> real<00:00:02.700> quickly

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
all right I want to talk real quickly

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.120 
all right I want to talk real quickly
about<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:04.020> disc<00:00:04.259> brake<00:00:04.500> setup<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:04.980> an

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
about the the disc brake setup on an

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.450 
about the the disc brake setup on an
early<00:00:05.460> if<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> dana<00:00:06.509> 25<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.649> dana<00:00:07.830> 27

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
early if this is a dana 25 the dana 27

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.669 
early if this is a dana 25 the dana 27
is<00:00:08.550> also<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> similar<00:00:09.150> axle<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.290> knuckles<00:00:10.620> are

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
is also a similar axle the knuckles are

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.959 
is also a similar axle the knuckles are
going<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.370> same<00:00:11.519> so<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:11.880> going

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
going to be about the same so it's going

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.150 
going to be about the same so it's going
to<00:00:12.030> be<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> same<00:00:12.450> process<00:00:12.830> but<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
to be the same process but this is the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.860 
to be the same process but this is the
original<00:00:14.340> axle<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.330> know<00:00:15.450> we've<00:00:15.660> still

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
original axle with you know we've still

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.689 
original axle with you know we've still
got<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.949> closed<00:00:17.190> knuckles<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
got the the closed knuckles the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.790 
got the the closed knuckles the
old-style<00:00:18.000> knuckles<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.590> looks

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
old-style knuckles on it so it looks

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.439 
old-style knuckles on it so it looks
original<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> backing<00:00:20.789> plates<00:00:21.000> are<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.180> there

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
original the backing plates are on there

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
original the backing plates are on there
but<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.260> basically<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.650> disc<00:00:22.949> brake<00:00:23.189> setup

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
but this is basically a disc brake setup

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.370 
but this is basically a disc brake setup
we<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.170> look

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
we have on here so it's going to look

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.810 
we have on here so it's going to look
original<00:00:25.619> from<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.039> outside<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.789> only

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
original from the outside the only

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.130 
original from the outside the only
difference<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.449> you're<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
difference is you're going to have the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.080 
difference is you're going to have the
calipers<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> back<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> be

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
calipers on the back so it's going to be

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.250 
calipers on the back so it's going to be
a<00:00:30.119> little<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.510> different<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.960> still

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
a little bit different but it still

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.540 
a little bit different but it still
looks<00:00:31.410> original<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> give<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
looks original it's going to give you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
looks original it's going to give you
the<00:00:32.669> stopping<00:00:33.030> power<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.360> need<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.809> able

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the stopping power you need to be able

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.959 
the stopping power you need to be able
to<00:00:34.020> drive<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.469> everyday<00:00:35.340> traffic<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> that's

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to drive in everyday traffic and that's

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.340 
to drive in everyday traffic and that's
that's<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> our<00:00:36.630> big<00:00:36.809> goals<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.260> this

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that's one of our big goals with this

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.610 
that's one of our big goals with this
this<00:00:37.950> will<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.309> spilled<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.629> my<00:00:40.110> concern<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
this will is spilled but my concern is I

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
this will is spilled but my concern is I
want<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> keep<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.399> original<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:42.030> possible

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
want to keep it as original as possible

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.880 
want to keep it as original as possible
I<00:00:42.540> want<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> modify<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.320> bit<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.770> make

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I want to modify it a little bit to make

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.479 
I want to modify it a little bit to make
it<00:00:43.920> drivable<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.180> don't<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:47.340> make

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
it drivable but I don't want to to make

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.100 
it drivable but I don't want to to make
it<00:00:47.610> look<00:00:47.760> extreme<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.210> don't<00:00:48.329> want<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> make<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it look extreme I don't want to make it

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.479 
it look extreme I don't want to make it
look<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> hot<00:00:49.649> rod<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> wanted<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> make<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
look like a hot rod I wanted to make it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
look like a hot rod I wanted to make it
look<00:00:50.879> original<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:52.140> still<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
look original but still have the the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
look original but still have the the
drivability<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.730> newer<00:00:53.910> vehicle<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.480> that's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
drivability of a newer vehicle so that's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.880 
drivability of a newer vehicle so that's
that's<00:00:54.989> some<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.440> things<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.680> I'm

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that's some of the things that I'm

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
that's some of the things that I'm
keeping<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.489> mind<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.879> building<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.329> but

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
keeping in mind as I'm building this but

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
keeping in mind as I'm building this but
basically<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.160> rotors<00:01:00.030> came<00:01:00.239> off

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
basically we have these rotors came off

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.189 
basically we have these rotors came off
of<00:01:02.239> 1976<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> I'll<00:01:03.449> write<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
of 1976 and I'll write this all out is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.300 
of 1976 and I'll write this all out is
the<00:01:04.339> 1976-77<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:07.380> think<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.680> was<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.010> rotors

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the 1976-77 I think it was the rotors

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
the 1976-77 I think it was the rotors
off<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.729> cj5<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:09.600> cj7<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:11.720> these<00:01:12.720> are

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
off of a cj5 or as cj7 and these are

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.179 
off of a cj5 or as cj7 and these are
also<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.260> same<00:01:13.290> rotors<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:13.860> use<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
also the same rotors that they use on

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.670 
also the same rotors that they use on
some<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> international<00:01:15.090> Scouts<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
some of the international Scouts so it's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.550 
some of the international Scouts so it's
a<00:01:16.799> five<00:01:17.040> lug<00:01:17.250> rotor<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.600> disc<00:01:18.869> brake

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
a five lug rotor but the disc brake

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
a five lug rotor but the disc brake
backing<00:01:19.979> plates<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.509> off<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
backing plates are actually off of a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.980 
backing plates are actually off of a
half-ton<00:01:22.320> GM<00:01:23.130> four-wheel<00:01:23.549> drive<00:01:23.759> truck<00:01:24.060> which

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
half-ton GM four-wheel drive truck which

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
half-ton GM four-wheel drive truck which
the<00:01:25.170> backing<00:01:25.500> plates<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.860> believe<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.850> use

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the backing plates I believe you can use

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.749 
the backing plates I believe you can use
them<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> 1991<00:01:28.350> these<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.829> early

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
them up to about a 1991 these are early

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149 
them up to about a 1991 these are early
70s<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> early<00:01:31.290> backing

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
70s these are some of the early backing

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
70s these are some of the early backing
plates<00:01:32.369> you'll<00:01:32.520> notice<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.850> they're<00:01:33.030> about

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
plates you'll notice that they're about

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
plates you'll notice that they're about
a<00:01:34.040> quarter<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> an<00:01:35.250> inch<00:01:35.369> eight<00:01:35.640> inch<00:01:35.670> thick

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
a quarter of an inch eight inch thick

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.340 
a quarter of an inch eight inch thick
and<00:01:36.210> they're<00:01:36.450> they're<00:01:36.689> pretty<00:01:36.900> thick<00:01:37.049> steel

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and they're they're pretty thick steel

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.050 
and they're they're pretty thick steel
the<00:01:38.009> newer<00:01:38.220> ones<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> find<00:01:38.880> aren't

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the newer ones are going to find aren't

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.460 
the newer ones are going to find aren't
going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.450> thick<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.930> these<00:01:40.049> are<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
going to be as thick so these are the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.990 
going to be as thick so these are the
better<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.890> earlier<00:01:41.189> ones<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.700> find<00:01:41.880> are

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
better the earlier ones you can find are

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.530 
better the earlier ones you can find are
going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> better<00:01:42.509> ones<00:01:44.540> so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
going to be the better ones so

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
going to be the better ones so
originally<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> 11<00:01:46.680> inch<00:01:46.829> drum

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
originally we have the 11 inch drum

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.109 
originally we have the 11 inch drum
brakes<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.759> went<00:01:47.939> ahead<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
brakes on here we went ahead and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.389 
brakes on here we went ahead and
hammered<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> old<00:01:49.530> studs<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:50.100> use<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
hammered out the old studs we use the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.370 
hammered out the old studs we use the
original<00:01:50.610> knuckle<00:01:51.180> our<00:01:51.750> ons<00:01:51.990> are<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
original knuckle our ons are the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
original knuckle our ons are the
original<00:01:52.829> hub<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.189> didn't<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> modify

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
original hub we didn't have to modify

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.209 
original hub we didn't have to modify
the<00:01:53.909> hub<00:01:54.149> at<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.439> did<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> run<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the hub at all but we did have to run a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.499 
the hub at all but we did have to run a
little<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.549> longer<00:01:56.820> studs<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
little bit longer studs because of

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.730 
little bit longer studs because of
course<00:01:57.689> they've<00:01:57.840> got<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> press<00:01:58.290> through<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
course they've got to press through the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.100 
course they've got to press through the
the<00:01:59.460> rotor<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.880> well<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> hub<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.899> did

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the rotor as well as the hub so we did

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
the rotor as well as the hub so we did
use<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.009> all<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> part<00:02:02.880> numbers<00:02:03.119> for

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
use and all this the part numbers for

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.480 
use and all this the part numbers for
that<00:02:03.420> eventually<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.799> those<00:02:04.920> studs

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that eventually for those studs

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.950 
that eventually for those studs
I<00:02:05.670> believe<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.180> come<00:02:06.329> off<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.600> an<00:02:06.719> Oldsmobile

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
I believe they come off of an Oldsmobile

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.440 
I believe they come off of an Oldsmobile
car<00:02:07.469> or<00:02:07.619> something<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.849> didn't<00:02:12.090> modify<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
car or something so we didn't modify the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.300 
car or something so we didn't modify the
hubs<00:02:12.720> at<00:02:12.870> all<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
hubs at all the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.860 
hubs at all the
think<00:02:13.489> we<00:02:13.610> did<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:14.030> modify<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.420> little<00:02:14.750> bit

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
think we did have to modify a little bit

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.720 
think we did have to modify a little bit
if<00:02:14.989> you'll<00:02:15.470> notice<00:02:15.800> these<00:02:16.099> knuckles<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:16.580> went

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
if you'll notice these knuckles I went

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.370 
if you'll notice these knuckles I went
ahead<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:16.880> rebuilt<00:02:17.270> them<00:02:17.450> obtaining<00:02:18.290> them

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
ahead and rebuilt them obtaining them

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.900 
ahead and rebuilt them obtaining them
with<00:02:18.530> por-15<00:02:18.890> with<00:02:19.220> new<00:02:19.430> seals<00:02:19.700> and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
with por-15 with new seals and

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.820 
with por-15 with new seals and
everything<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.959> only<00:02:21.140> thing<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.739> have

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
everything the only thing that you have

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.199 
everything the only thing that you have

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
to modify on these and you'll notice

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.699 
to modify on these and you'll notice
that<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.390> did<00:02:23.690> grind<00:02:23.959> some<00:02:24.170> metal<00:02:24.380> away<00:02:24.470> on

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
that I did grind some metal away on

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.770 
that I did grind some metal away on

there you'll see and that's where we had

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.449 
there you'll see and that's where we had
to<00:03:32.540> remove<00:03:32.810> some<00:03:33.079> from<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.319> knuckle<00:03:33.680> now<00:03:34.400> the

a half-inch it's a recessed head it's a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.509 
a half-inch it's a recessed head it's a
hex<00:04:17.180> socket<00:04:17.389> pipe<00:04:18.200> plug<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:18.950> it's<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.220> half<00:04:19.370> inch

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
hex socket pipe plug so it's a half inch

NPT pipe plug and you want to have the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.800 
NPT pipe plug and you want to have the
recessed<00:04:21.739> head<00:04:22.000> because<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.150> original<00:04:23.360> plugs

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
recessed head because the original plugs

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.200 
recessed head because the original plugs
that<00:04:23.930> are<00:04:24.020> on<00:04:24.470> there<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:25.070> just<00:04:25.250> use<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.400> wrench

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
that are on there you just use a wrench

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.890 
that are on there you just use a wrench
to<00:04:26.479> take<00:04:26.599> them

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
to take them

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.540

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
off and those are going to stick out to

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.650 
off and those are going to stick out to
where<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.820> caliper<00:04:29.180> is<00:04:29.240> not<00:04:29.389> going<00:04:29.509> to<00:04:29.600> be

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
able to sit on the knuckle there so

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.510 
able to sit on the knuckle there so
those<00:04:30.919> aren't<00:04:31.100> going<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.310> work

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.620 

of<00:04:37.520> course<00:04:37.759> you'll<00:04:37.880> notice<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:38.180> went<00:04:38.300> ahead<00:04:38.419> and

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
of course you'll notice I went ahead and

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.939 
of course you'll notice I went ahead and
remove<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.990> master<00:04:39.289> cylinder<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.740> I'll
