00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hi, what's up with the project radio? 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.200
 Like you, okay? 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.480
 I'm going to have a chat today because 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.730
 to understand of striking taturana 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.400
 You may have seen several videos of my 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.300
 and on the youtube channel talking about this 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.260
 subject matter 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.090
 the truth is that when you start 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.740
 always act if you have a better 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.400
 application of paint on the skin 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.510
 This is something that really does the whole thing. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.489
 the difference 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.149
 I believe the vast majority want to have 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.579
 a fifth earl application on the skin and 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.200
 it's often no good to know 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.489
 how to apply the paint to the skin but only 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.079
 machine is not working 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.079
 properly right 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.530
 Come there, it will take more time for you. 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.670
 do the work will connect 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 unregulated heated machine opinions 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.100
 makes it difficult to apply and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.690
 comfortable for both you and your 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.280
 customer who is waiting for a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.710
 I work often was 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.430
 Can you do it for an hour? 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 12 because only a brand can be regulated 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.299
 so you need to be a 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.479
 tact machine expert is smart 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.890
 me when I started to study 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.979
 between machine and touch helped me a lot 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.500
 but it 's not just the machine issue 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.020
 is the technique how you apply this 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.490
 ink on the skin and also the knowledge 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.000
 artistic 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.479
 it would be a tripod and the material you use 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.070
 the technique then the artistic knowledge 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.100
 I'll show you some too. 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.780
 books here that I help myself a lot in this 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.310
 question of tattoo machine called 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.670
 machine gun a magazine is there or cantiga 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.340
 but she has several issues of it and talks a lot 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.820
 on the tobacco machine crack girl 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.000
 the good song the book ends up helping 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.899
 enough bowls magazine here was 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.940
 illustrated and has a lot of legal content 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.649
 All About Me About Armadillo Machine 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.030
 Spring four gold 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.170
 then dani so maybe putting it 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.140
 In practice 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.810
 Let's do a little more 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.519
 Are you and lieutenant knowledge and of 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.370
 but at least the basics are 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.870
 in the beginning when I started messing with 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.660
 tractor unit 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.640
 I used to stay there too hours and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.700
 dismantled machine she has ravaged 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.209
 it seems that the more I moved anmr 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.510
 I was short of water and suddenly there 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.299
 to install a finger the machine found the point 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.470
 the regulation and it was enough work 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.599
 Good friend and my friend worked 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.099
 in the same studio rÃ©is takes a look at 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.860
 me on my machine has a noise 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.870
 It's strange, she's in a hurry . 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.920
 too slow 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.380
 I used to go there for a while and I kept messing 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.880
 mounted and dismounted that was me 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.269
 helping a lot 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.430
 every machine so boss to work 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.569
 having then signed something very 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.380
 so easy is the same as a person like you 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.799
 starting to learn music, you have to 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.810
 play the tuned instrument and it will 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.540
 acquire this auditory perception for 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.880
 that she may have tuned an instrument 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.019
 to be able to play the same thing with people 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.540
 can not get a tattoo 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.459
 beautiful with the unregulated mark put 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.340
 dye any place for you today 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.139
 tip is the following take a machine there and 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.730
 preferably you do not use it much 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.669
 that machine that is leaning closer 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.650
 in the corner of your drawer you know to buy 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:54.630
 stops and dismounts there that it mounts 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.000
 and disassemble do not need to disassemble to take 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.560
 I can not take the team, that's not what I'm 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.569
 Speaking 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.600
 look at the top spring and 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.780
 bottom mount again even on the screw 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.760
 the contact becomes familiar with this 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.480
 thing over time you will gain this 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.350
 perception and will know exactly how you are 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.680
 and regulate in the machine of yours to look for 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.810
 clean one hour two mounts 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.750
 disassembled by a spring for printing 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.520
 take the pressure increase the speed 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.130
 watch on the source watch the videos 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.510
 all does not indicate this will end up helping 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.850
 you're 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.490
 takes a while at first mainly 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.920
 Who are you starting to learn now? 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.080
 Well, for those of you who are new to buying 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.690
 material may be developing more 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.340
 I think we 'll get there soon. 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.400
 issue day patients 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.010
 I'll ask you if you like it. 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.750
 of this video and that shortens our part 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.350
 did not like also short opinion 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.690
 You are very important to me, I leave the 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.550
 your life your comment on the 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.420
 website design armadillo 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.680
 I put it there a machine list is 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:10.710
 on this list talked about some machines 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.050
 that being you can buy there that are 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.020
 good and you can work with it already 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.210
 well regulated copper that understood and there 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.460
 I 'm talking about each one of them so much 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.510
 of the machine of fashion as of the machine 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.340
 rotating 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.120
 I have nothing to do with merchants. 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.970
 I did not speak with a machine, but it does not have an end. 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.450
 no profit with that my goal 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.760
 It's just giving the force to 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.530
 you're there getting good stuff 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.250
 quality by facilitating the work of 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.370
 you 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.800
 This is my idea, thank you guys 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.800
 Once again, thank you very much.
