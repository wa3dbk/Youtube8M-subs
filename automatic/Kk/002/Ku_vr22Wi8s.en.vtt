fuchsias<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.660> heavy<00:02:09.840> feeding<00:02:10.170> plants

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
fuchsias are really heavy feeding plants

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.200 
fuchsias are really heavy feeding plants
and<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:10.830> where<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.460> lot<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.730> people<00:02:11.880> fail

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
and I think where a lot of people fail

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.630 
and I think where a lot of people fail
is<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.450> keeping<00:02:12.870> them<00:02:13.050> fed<00:02:13.290> good<00:02:13.560> enough<00:02:13.830> so

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
is not keeping them fed good enough so

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.770 
is not keeping them fed good enough so
