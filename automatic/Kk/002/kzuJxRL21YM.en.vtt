00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:17.060
While the world looks upon me as I struggle along

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.760
They say I have nothing but they are so wrong

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.520
In my heart I'm rejoicing how I wish they could see

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:42.140
Thank You Lord for Your blessings on me!

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:50.140
There's a roof up above me and I've a good place to sleep

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.640
There's food on my table and shoes on my feet

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.520
You gave me Your Love Lord and a fine family

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.680
Thank You Lord for Your blessings on me!

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:23.000
Now I know that I'm not weathly and these clothes they're not new

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.680
And I don't have much money but Lord I have You!

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.500
And to me that's all that matters though the world may not see

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.220
Thank You Lord for Your blessings on me!

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.460
There's a roof up above me and I've a good place to sleep

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.080
There's food on my table and shoes on my feet

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:13.040
You gave me Your Love Lord and a fine family

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:21.480
Thank You Lord for Your blessings on me!

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.540
And now I know that I'm not weathly and these clothes they're not new

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.200
And I don't have much money but Lord I have You!

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:51.340
And to me that's all that matters though the world may not see

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.420
Thank You Lord for Your blessings on me!

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.280
There's a roof up above me and I've a good place to sleep

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.960
There's food on my table and shoes on my feet

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.280
You gave me Your Love Lord and a fine family

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.960
And I thank You Lord for Your blessings on me!

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:45.640
And I thank You Lord for Your blessings on me!
