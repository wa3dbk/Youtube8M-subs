kickstand<00:00:14.760> from<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.719> project<00:00:16.170> bike<00:00:16.379> because

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
kickstand from the project bike because

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.220 
kickstand from the project bike because
remember<00:00:17.070> race<00:00:17.400> track<00:00:17.670> point<00:00:17.970> no<00:00:18.660> kickstand

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
remember race track point no kickstand

actually<00:00:20.190> it<00:00:20.970> won't<00:00:21.179> pass<00:00:21.330> tech<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.500> erase

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
actually it won't pass tech that erase

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.939 
actually it won't pass tech that erase
me<00:00:23.099> with<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.970> kickstand<00:00:24.630> okay<00:00:25.109> we're<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.679> to

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.230 
remove that and there's one really
really<00:00:28.080> important<00:00:28.740> step<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.000> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
really important step with that and that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.210 
really important step with that and that
is<00:00:30.509> the<00:00:30.900> kickstand<00:00:31.820> safety<00:00:32.820> switch<00:00:33.510> okay<00:00:34.230> when

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
is the kickstand safety switch okay when

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.440 
is the kickstand safety switch okay when
you<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:36.080> you<00:00:37.080> have<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.730> basically<00:00:38.730> jump

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
you do that you have to basically jump

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.380 
you do that you have to basically jump
the<00:00:39.720> wires<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:41.160> kickstand<00:00:41.640> safety<00:00:42.120> switch

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the wires on the kickstand safety switch

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.440 
the wires on the kickstand safety switch
so<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> motorcycle<00:00:43.980> will<00:00:44.490> still<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.880> start<00:00:45.180> I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
so the motorcycle will still to start I

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
so the motorcycle will still to start I
know<00:00:46.110> you're<00:00:46.350> thinking<00:00:46.560> hey<00:00:46.770> man<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.010> twist

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
know you're thinking hey man just twist

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.890 
know you're thinking hey man just twist
them<00:00:47.550> together<00:00:47.640> put<00:00:47.880> some<00:00:48.180> duct<00:00:48.330> tape<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
them together put some duct tape on it

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.360 
them together put some duct tape on it
call<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> day<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.560> or<00:00:49.920> use<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> butt

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
call it a day right or use a butt

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.550 
call it a day right or use a butt
connector<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.780> that'll<00:00:52.080> work<00:00:52.200> really

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
connector you know that'll work really

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.170 
connector you know that'll work really
good<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> first<00:00:53.460> few<00:00:53.670> months<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.150> maybe

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
good for the first few months or maybe

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.560 
good for the first few months or maybe
even<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> first<00:00:54.660> season<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.670> but<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
even the first season or so but that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.600 
even the first season or so but that
connection<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.500> very<00:00:58.620> important<00:00:59.310> because<00:00:59.400> you

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
connection is very important because you

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.080 
connection is very important because you
remember<00:01:00.380> if<00:01:01.380> that<00:01:01.440> connection<00:01:02.010> breaks<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
remember if that connection breaks the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.329 
remember if that connection breaks the
motor<00:01:03.300> stops<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.990> you're<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.040> fast

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
motor stops if you're in a really fast

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.770 
motor stops if you're in a really fast
corner<00:01:05.790> where<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.150> need<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.390> keep<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.659> bike

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
corner where you need to keep the bike

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.240 
corner where you need to keep the bike
balanced<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.350> stay<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> throttle<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
balanced and stay on the throttle in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.850 
balanced and stay on the throttle in
that<00:01:08.970> connections<00:01:09.480> hookey<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.650> bike

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that connections hookey and the bike

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
that connections hookey and the bike
comes<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.840> you're<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> wad

your up and a good friend that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.360 
your up and a good friend that
that's<00:01:15.390> happened<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.050> right<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.040> happened<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
that's happened to right it happened to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.040 
that's happened to right it happened to
him<00:01:17.520> twice<00:01:17.730> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> same<00:01:18.090> bike<00:01:18.510> before<00:01:18.720> he

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
him twice on the same bike before he

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.570 
him twice on the same bike before he
figured<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
figured out what it was because it was a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.970 
figured out what it was because it was a
brief<00:01:20.850> interruption<00:01:21.480> after<00:01:21.659> he<00:01:22.500> corrected

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
brief interruption after he corrected

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.250 
brief interruption after he corrected
that<00:01:23.159> connection<00:01:23.540> he<00:01:24.540> didn't<00:01:24.780> fall<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:24.990> on

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
that connection he didn't fall down on

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.350 
that connection he didn't fall down on
that<00:01:25.320> motorcycle<00:01:25.650> anymore<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that motorcycle anymore so that's the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.610 
that motorcycle anymore so that's the
reason<00:01:27.600> when<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.780> take<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> time<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.500> this

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
reason when I take the time to do this

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.050 
reason when I take the time to do this
video<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.250> actually<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
video because I'm actually going to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.660 
video because I'm actually going to
solder<00:01:30.930> those<00:01:31.230> wires<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.520> some

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
solder those wires and then put some

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.270 
solder those wires and then put some
shrink<00:01:32.940> tubing<00:01:33.240> over<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.870> it<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.320> permanent<00:01:34.830> if

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
shrink tubing over so it is permanent if

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
shrink tubing over so it is permanent if
whoever<00:01:35.580> wins<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> bike<00:01:36.180> wants<00:01:36.510> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
whoever wins the bike wants the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.050 
whoever wins the bike wants the
kickstand<00:01:37.140> switch<00:01:37.409> back<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.880> wire

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
kickstand switch back on it we can wire

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.390 
kickstand switch back on it we can wire
around<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.170> big<00:01:40.409> deal<00:01:40.620> when<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.220> come

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
around it not a big deal when I come

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.399 
around it not a big deal when I come
back<00:01:41.550> I'll<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.270> lower<00:01:42.450> fairing<00:01:42.900> off<00:01:43.050> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
back I'll have the lower fairing off and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.270 
back I'll have the lower fairing off and
we're<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.740> begin<00:01:43.860> taking<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
we're going to begin taking the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.149 
we're going to begin taking the
kickstand<00:01:44.700> off<00:01:45.680> all<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:46.830> you're<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.070> to

kickstand off all right you're going to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.910 
kickstand off all right you're going to
first<00:01:48.200> loosen<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:51.180> pivot<00:01:51.510> bolt<00:01:51.890> for<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
first loosen up the pivot bolt for the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.310 
first loosen up the pivot bolt for the
kickstand<00:01:53.460> itself<00:01:53.760> there's<00:01:54.180> pretty<00:01:54.990> healthy

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
kickstand itself there's pretty healthy

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.149 
kickstand itself there's pretty healthy
spring<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.970> kickstand<00:01:57.950> right<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
spring on the kickstand right and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.500 
spring on the kickstand right and
because<00:01:59.370> we<00:01:59.580> need<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> lose<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> part<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.420> this

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
because we need to lose a part of this

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.850 
because we need to lose a part of this
assembly<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.990> most<00:02:01.200> bikes<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.590> mean<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.740> would

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
assembly on most bikes I mean I would

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.950 
assembly on most bikes I mean I would
just<00:02:01.979> pull<00:02:02.220> unbolt<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.940> thing<00:02:03.180> right<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just pull unbolt this thing right and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.210 
just pull unbolt this thing right and
you're<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.260> putting<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.650> whole<00:02:04.770> kickstand

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
you're just putting the whole kickstand

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.770 
you're just putting the whole kickstand
in<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.369> garbage<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.540> bike

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
in a garbage can but on this bike

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.559 
in a garbage can but on this bike
because<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.799> shifter<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.369> need<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.330> piece

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
because of the shifter I need that piece

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.430 
because of the shifter I need that piece
okay

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
okay

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.229 
okay
so<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.129> am<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.519> to<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.909> ahead<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:13.670> pull<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
so I am going to go ahead and pull the

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.670 
so I am going to go ahead and pull the
springs

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
springs

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.830 
springs
just<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.700> make<00:02:17.819> disassembly<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> little<00:02:18.720> bit

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
just to make disassembly a little bit

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.280 
just to make disassembly a little bit
easier<00:02:19.819> different<00:02:20.819> ways<00:02:20.939> to<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.239> this<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.140> we

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
easier different ways to do this and we

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.940 
easier different ways to do this and we
sell<00:02:22.500> some<00:02:22.709> spring<00:02:22.980> tools<00:02:24.680> I'm<00:02:25.680> gonna<00:02:25.829> use

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
sell some spring tools I'm gonna use

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.270 
sell some spring tools I'm gonna use
side<00:02:26.189> cutters<00:02:27.319> just<00:02:28.319> kind<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.530> grab<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.159> end

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
side cutters just kind of grab the end

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.190 
side cutters just kind of grab the end
of<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> spring<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:32.209> there<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.720> there's<00:02:34.049> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
of the spring and there is there's the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.819 
of the spring and there is there's the
easy<00:02:34.319> part

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
easy part

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.880 
easy part
okay<00:02:35.069> we've<00:02:35.220> got<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.519> kickstand<00:02:36.019> off<00:02:37.019> the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
okay we've got the kickstand off the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.309 
okay we've got the kickstand off the
motorcycle<00:02:38.220> okay<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.239> then<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> have<00:02:40.019> your

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
motorcycle okay and then you have your

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.559 
motorcycle okay and then you have your
kickstand<00:02:40.950> switch<00:02:41.280> that's<00:02:41.819> mounted<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.420> this

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
kickstand switch that's mounted to this

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.830 
kickstand switch that's mounted to this
little<00:02:43.379> bracket<00:02:43.650> right<00:02:44.129> here<00:02:44.239> okay<00:02:45.239> with<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
little bracket right here okay with the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.770 
little bracket right here okay with the
kickstand<00:02:46.290> off<00:02:46.500> what<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.159> to<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.340> is

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
kickstand off what I'm going to do is

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.360 
kickstand off what I'm going to do is
this<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.989> essentially<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.859> connector<00:02:50.250> is

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
this is essentially the connector is

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.720 
this is essentially the connector is
going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.639> be<00:02:51.650> under<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.799> tank<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.430> are<00:02:53.579> going

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
going to be under the tank we are going

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.160 
going to be under the tank we are going
to<00:02:53.790> go<00:02:53.879> back<00:02:54.090> under<00:02:54.389> there<00:02:54.510> for<00:02:54.540> some<00:02:54.870> other

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
to go back under there for some other

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.890 
to go back under there for some other
parts<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.889> this<00:02:56.069> project<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.420> what<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.569> want<00:02:57.810> to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
parts of this project and what I want to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.149 
parts of this project and what I want to
do<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.200> want<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.409> make<00:02:58.500> sure<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.859> I'd<00:02:58.980> love

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
do is I want to make sure that I'd love

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.420 
do is I want to make sure that I'd love
myself<00:02:59.510> plenty<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.659> wiring<00:03:01.620> harness<00:03:02.159> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
myself plenty of wiring harness to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.330 
myself plenty of wiring harness to
splice<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.480> back<00:03:03.689> together<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:04.260> where<00:03:05.159> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
splice this back together if where the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.879 
splice this back together if where the
light<00:03:05.519> needs<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.540> use<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.019> okay<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:07.590> what<00:03:07.799> I'm

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
light needs to use that okay so what I'm

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.330 
light needs to use that okay so what I'm
going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.040> do<00:03:08.189> I'm<00:03:08.909> actually<00:03:09.239> going<00:03:09.659> to<00:03:10.189> cut<00:03:11.189> it

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
going to do I'm actually going to cut it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.460 
going to do I'm actually going to cut it
right<00:03:11.489> about<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:12.989> good<00:03:13.230> spot

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
right about here this is a good spot

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.929 
right about here this is a good spot
where<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.709> can<00:03:13.799> make<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> nice<00:03:14.189> connection<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
where you can make a nice connection and

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.129 
where you can make a nice connection and
put<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.239> all<00:03:15.299> back<00:03:15.450> together<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:15.840> make<00:03:15.959> it

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
put it all back together and make it

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.319 
put it all back together and make it
look<00:03:16.290> good<00:03:16.609> now<00:03:17.609> go<00:03:17.760> ahead<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.150> take

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
look good now go ahead and just take

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.589 
look good now go ahead and just take
side<00:03:18.629> cutters<00:03:19.790> make<00:03:20.790> sure<00:03:21.030> I've<00:03:21.150> got<00:03:21.209> the

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
side cutters make sure I've got the

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.890 
side cutters make sure I've got the
right<00:03:21.629> one<00:03:22.849> go<00:03:23.849> ahead<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.150> cut<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.780> then

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
right one go ahead and cut that and then

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.599 
right one go ahead and cut that and then
we're<00:03:24.989> going<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.139> work<00:03:25.319> on<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:26.040> side<00:03:26.220> as<00:03:26.489> you

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
we're going to work on this side as you

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.119 
we're going to work on this side as you
can<00:03:26.730> clearly<00:03:27.209> see<00:03:27.629> there<00:03:28.290> are<00:03:28.500> two<00:03:28.829> pieces

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
can clearly see there are two pieces

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.189 
can clearly see there are two pieces
just<00:03:29.579> two<00:03:30.090> wires<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.629> there<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.169> a

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
just two wires in there so this is a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.289 
just two wires in there so this is a
pretty<00:03:31.470> simple<00:03:31.709> operation<00:03:32.519> right<00:03:35.150> trim<00:03:36.150> back

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
pretty simple operation right trim back

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.330 
pretty simple operation right trim back
the<00:03:36.569> insulation<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.379> little<00:03:37.590> bit<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.949> need

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
the insulation just a little bit I need

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.530 
the insulation just a little bit I need
to<00:03:38.430> be<00:03:38.489> able<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.639> get<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:38.970> wire<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.419> I<00:03:39.510> can

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
to be able to get to the wire so I can

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.490 
to be able to get to the wire so I can
strip<00:03:39.959> each<00:03:40.500> wire<00:03:40.889> and<00:03:41.879> then<00:03:42.000> we're<00:03:42.150> sorry<00:03:42.690> to

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
strip each wire and then we're sorry to

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.920 
strip each wire and then we're sorry to
make<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.739> connection<00:03:46.099> alright<00:03:47.099> simple<00:03:47.489> stuff

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
make the connection alright simple stuff

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.240 
make the connection alright simple stuff
got<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.049> wires<00:03:49.260> stripped<00:03:49.680> back<00:03:49.799> just<00:03:50.159> a

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
got the wires stripped back just a

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.469 
got the wires stripped back just a
little<00:03:50.280> bit<00:03:50.519> I've<00:03:50.849> got<00:03:51.000> them<00:03:51.120> twisted

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
little bit I've got them twisted

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.420 
little bit I've got them twisted
together<00:03:51.599> nicely<00:03:52.129> obviously<00:03:53.129> they're<00:03:53.280> good

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
together nicely obviously they're good

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.449 
together nicely obviously they're good
and<00:03:53.519> clean<00:03:53.930> I'm<00:03:54.930> going<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.139> go<00:03:55.229> ahead<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.620> get

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
and clean I'm going to go ahead and get

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.830 
and clean I'm going to go ahead and get
the<00:03:56.549> soldering<00:03:56.909> iron<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.299> there<00:03:57.479> get<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.659> little

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
the soldering iron on there get a little

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.339 
the soldering iron on there get a little
heat<00:03:58.019> into<00:03:58.379> them<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:59.819> this<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:01.079> really

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
heat into them and this is just really

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.839 
heat into them and this is just really
the<00:04:01.560> right<00:04:01.799> way<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.069> do<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.760> know

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
the right way to do this you know

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.990 
the right way to do this you know
because<00:04:03.979> like<00:04:04.979> I<00:04:05.069> described<00:04:05.489> earlier<00:04:05.639> in<00:04:05.909> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
because like I described earlier in the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.589 
because like I described earlier in the
video<00:04:06.269> man<00:04:06.629> I<00:04:06.900> mean<00:04:07.680> if<00:04:07.859> this<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.599> more

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
video man I mean if this is a more

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.920 
video man I mean if this is a more
important<00:04:10.139> step<00:04:10.379> than<00:04:10.650> most<00:04:11.519> people<00:04:11.970> would

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
important step than most people would

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.500 
important step than most people would
imagine<00:04:13.229> so<00:04:13.739> take<00:04:14.010> them<00:04:14.099> init<00:04:14.370> here<00:04:14.609> do<00:04:15.479> it

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
imagine so take them init here do it

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.710 
imagine so take them init here do it
right

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.449 

and<00:04:19.720> have<00:04:20.079> a<00:04:20.109> good<00:04:20.470> connection<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.220> count

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
and have a good connection you can count

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.390 
and have a good connection you can count
on<00:04:21.579> for<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:21.970> long<00:04:22.330> time<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:23.020> come<00:04:23.400> because

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
on for a long time to come because

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.360 
on for a long time to come because
realistically<00:04:25.300> most<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:26.080> us<00:04:26.199> with<00:04:27.160> these

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
realistically most of us with these

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.390 
realistically most of us with these
bikes<00:04:29.160> we<00:04:30.160> keep<00:04:30.370> them<00:04:30.490> for<00:04:30.520> quite<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:30.850> long<00:04:31.030> time

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
bikes we keep them for quite a long time

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.680 
bikes we keep them for quite a long time
and<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.550> don't<00:04:33.580> want<00:04:34.000> something<00:04:34.360> like<00:04:34.510> this

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
and you don't want something like this

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.740 
and you don't want something like this
to<00:04:35.500> jump<00:04:35.740> up<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.070> bite<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.580> ass<00:04:36.750> down

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
to jump up and bite you in the ass down

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.270 
to jump up and bite you in the ass down
the<00:04:37.870> road<00:04:38.080> next<00:04:38.979> step<00:04:39.310> really<00:04:40.270> simple<00:04:40.690> here

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
the road next step really simple here

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.560 
the road next step really simple here
and<00:04:42.280> go<00:04:42.400> ahead<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:42.729> put<00:04:42.850> some<00:04:42.880> shrink<00:04:43.270> tubing

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
and go ahead and put some shrink tubing

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.719 
and go ahead and put some shrink tubing
on<00:04:43.750> I'm<00:04:44.650> going<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.800> cut<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:45.040> shrink<00:04:45.310> tubing<00:04:45.580> a

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
on I'm going to cut the shrink tubing a

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.430 
on I'm going to cut the shrink tubing a
little<00:04:46.150> bit<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.540> long<00:04:46.720> side<00:04:46.750> because<00:04:47.350> I

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
little bit to the long side because I

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.530 
little bit to the long side because I
want<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.680> be<00:04:47.770> able<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:47.979> seal<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.430> one<00:04:48.610> end<00:04:48.850> off

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
want to be able to seal the one end off

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.850 
want to be able to seal the one end off
all<00:04:49.660> right<00:04:49.750> I'm<00:04:49.870> actually<00:04:50.229> heat<00:04:50.440> it<00:04:50.530> up<00:04:50.620> and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
all right I'm actually heat it up and

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.740 
all right I'm actually heat it up and
then<00:04:51.040> pinch<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.520> over<00:04:54.360> just<00:04:55.360> go<00:04:55.479> ahead<00:04:55.570> and

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
then pinch it over just go ahead and

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:15.510 
then pinch it over just go ahead and
take<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.900> lad<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.169> little<00:04:56.500> bit

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520

now<00:05:16.520> like<00:05:16.730> I<00:05:16.880> said<00:05:16.940> as<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.840> move<00:05:18.080> forward<00:05:18.350> with

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
now like I said as I move forward with

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.980 
now like I said as I move forward with
this<00:05:18.830> okay<00:05:19.640> I<00:05:19.790> have<00:05:20.210> to<00:05:20.360> get<00:05:20.480> back<00:05:20.630> under<00:05:20.960> that

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
this okay I have to get back under that

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.170 
this okay I have to get back under that
gas<00:05:21.350> tank<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.830> then<00:05:22.430> I'm<00:05:22.580> going<00:05:22.730> to<00:05:22.790> take<00:05:23.000> the

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
gas tank and then I'm going to take the

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.360 
gas tank and then I'm going to take the
time<00:05:23.420> and<00:05:24.070> get<00:05:25.070> this<00:05:25.280> harness<00:05:26.090> put<00:05:26.950> away<00:05:27.950> very

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
time and get this harness put away very

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.540 
time and get this harness put away very
nicely<00:05:29.260> underneath<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.830> tank<00:05:31.070> so<00:05:31.280> I've<00:05:31.370> got<00:05:31.520> a

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
nicely underneath the tank so I've got a

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.850 
nicely underneath the tank so I've got a
good<00:05:31.940> clean<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.040> result<00:05:34.540> next<00:05:35.540> up<00:05:35.840> just<00:05:36.770> going

to take a minute four millimeter allen
unbolt<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.520> switch<00:05:40.900> we'll<00:05:41.900> put<00:05:42.080> that<00:05:42.230> to<00:05:42.380> the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
unbolt the switch we'll put that to the

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.250 
unbolt the switch we'll put that to the
side<00:05:42.670> so<00:05:43.670> it<00:05:43.970> is<00:05:44.090> available<00:05:44.570> in<00:05:44.780> case<00:05:44.960> you<00:05:45.110> need

to put it back on the bike after

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.220 
to put it back on the bike after
somebody<00:05:47.690> winds<00:05:47.900> it<00:05:48.790> okay<00:05:49.790> this<00:05:50.690> is<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:50.900> final

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
somebody winds it okay this is the final

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.900 
somebody winds it okay this is the final
result<00:05:51.380> here<00:05:51.800> right<00:05:52.250> I've<00:05:52.370> actually<00:05:52.550> got<00:05:52.820> an

result here right I've actually got an
extra<00:05:53.210> layer<00:05:53.390> of<00:05:53.420> shrink<00:05:53.840> tube<00:05:54.050> over<00:05:54.350> it's

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
extra layer of shrink tube over it's

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.130 
extra layer of shrink tube over it's
sealed<00:05:54.740> off<00:05:54.920> nicely<00:05:55.430> you<00:05:55.550> can<00:05:55.670> see<00:05:55.850> that<00:05:56.140> tuck

resulted in a pretty solid injury and he

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.400 
resulted in a pretty solid injury and he
is<00:06:18.700> 99%<00:06:19.700> sure<00:06:19.970> that<00:06:20.180> was<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:20.990> cause<00:06:21.200> because

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
is 99% sure that was the cause because

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.890 
is 99% sure that was the cause because
he<00:06:21.560> found<00:06:21.920> it<00:06:22.160> after<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:23.180> second<00:06:23.540> accident

he found it after the second accident
which<00:06:24.020> was<00:06:24.170> a<00:06:24.200> really<00:06:24.560> small<00:06:24.830> one<00:06:25.180> not<00:06:26.180> like

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
which was a really small one not like

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.570 
which was a really small one not like
the<00:06:26.990> first<00:06:27.200> one<00:06:27.500> so<00:06:27.830> there<00:06:27.980> you<00:06:28.070> have<00:06:28.100> it

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
the first one so there you have it

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.420 
the first one so there you have it
kickstand<00:06:29.240> removal<00:06:29.750> take<00:06:30.320> your<00:06:30.500> time<00:06:30.950> solder

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
kickstand removal take your time solder

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.880 
kickstand removal take your time solder
the<00:06:31.970> connection<00:06:32.450> together<00:06:32.990> so<00:06:33.380> it<00:06:33.500> lasts<00:06:33.830> a

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
the connection together so it lasts a

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.070 
the connection together so it lasts a
long<00:06:34.010> time
