climbing rated at 4,000 pounds here we

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.030 
climbing rated at 4,000 pounds here we

webbing<00:00:11.599> what<00:00:12.599> you're<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:13.080> is

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
webbing what you're going to do is

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.720 
webbing what you're going to do is
you're<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.679> take<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> two<00:00:14.130> ends<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
you're going to take the two ends and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.570 
you're going to take the two ends and
you're<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.809> pull<00:00:16.020> out<00:00:16.190> about<00:00:17.190> three

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
you're going to pull out about three

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.970 
you're going to pull out about three
feet<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.180> end<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.380> makes<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.710> wind

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
feet of one end so it makes that wind

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.849 
feet of one end so it makes that wind
three<00:00:20.580> feet<00:00:20.760> longer<00:00:20.910> than<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> other<00:00:21.859> you're

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
three feet longer than the other you're

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.380 
three feet longer than the other you're
going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> fold<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.550> two<00:00:23.699> over<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.269> can

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
going to fold the two over so you can

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.950 
going to fold the two over so you can
find<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> midpoint<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.980> remaining

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
find the midpoint of the remaining

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.290 
find the midpoint of the remaining
webbing<00:00:27.960> once<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.859> find<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.189> point<00:00:29.609> you

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
webbing once you find that point you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.139 
webbing once you find that point you
take<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.869> shorter<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:31.890> ends<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.610> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
take the shorter of the two ends and you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.930 
take the shorter of the two ends and you
put<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.930> your<00:00:34.430> right<00:00:35.430> side<00:00:35.640> your<00:00:35.790> body
