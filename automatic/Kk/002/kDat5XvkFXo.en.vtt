00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 perfect video sound for digital 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.750
 mirror-image cameras like that 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:15.570
 I'll show you now 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:18.890
 musicstar tv hello and sincerely 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.760
 welcome to musicstar tv digital 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 SLR cameras are the absolute 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.180
 trend when it comes to videos 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.279
 take 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 but it was due to the design of these 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 Cameras always comes too short is the sound 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 because they do not have like normal 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.829
 video cameras stereo microphones 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.260
 integrated but mostly here is just 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.340
 a little relatively inferior 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.930
 microphone installed 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.270
 and of course that will be one 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.480
 professional claim not at all 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.390
 A good solution for this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.969
 Problem are external microphones which one 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 up here on the accessory shoe 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.559
 You can put it on 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.570
 various manufacturers and the company 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.789
 Rohde is right there in the lead 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.840
 several models and have now 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.600
 the whole new video may cry coupe and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.700
 what is hidden under this name and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.810
 what the microphone can we look 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.860
 us now in detail it looks like this 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 new video michael roth ii from rohde and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.220
 here under the removable windscreen there 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.159
 then hides the right ear 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.770
 microphone that is the most common 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.530
 in the sound for video recordings to do that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.630
 means one has just right effects around 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.520
 even from further afield 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.340
 record sound sources 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.820
 the special and eponymous 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.729
 this model is very reiki 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.759
 stuffy- looking red elastic 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.590
 plastic suspension man had so far 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.869
 elastic hang up with rubber bands 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.450
 worked and they were partial 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.549
 prone to tear the rubbers and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.270
 wear that is not here anymore 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.180
 the case 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.909
 that is very functional and very stable 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.549
 very effective from the suspension 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.729
 that means you can rumble here 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.950
 and other vibration noises 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.940
 really stay away from the microphone completely 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.100
 a very very functional and also 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.130
 very very robust and practicable 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.200
 solutions on the back of the 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.410
 Microphones we see the power 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.940
 switch in principle the only one 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.340
 controls of the microphone you can 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.380
 it as the name implies and 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.410
 switch off and is still one 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.690
 another function is integrated 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.530
 additional impact sound filter all 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.970
 frequencies below 80 heart rate 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 very nice with this microphones 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.640
 that it is here under this battery compartment 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.840
 with a standard 9 volt blog 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.120
 battery is powered 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.490
 Of course that ensures that we have one 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.230
 have a very long service life from to 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.440
 to 100 hours the manufacturer here 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.840
 indicates in the battery compartment hides 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.630
 then the patch shoulder one 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.540
 Another feature of the video Mike can do 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:09.040
 I adjust the level of the microphone from 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.640
 0 over -10 up to minus 20 db 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.350
 So I can the microphone to the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.459
 ambient level or to the 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.050
 adjust the material to be recorded 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.270
 the connection takes place as with the 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.170
 Most digital SLR cameras 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.020
 usually via a 3.5 mm jack plug 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.090
 how it looked with a spiral cable with the 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.890
 microphone connected so that one here 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.050
 Conveniently the cable is not around 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.900
 hang because it is too long you can 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.500
 It easily on the required length 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.020
 pull 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.570
 attaching to the camera is complete 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.030
 simply because all cameras have the top 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.550
 taken lightning shoe and there it will be 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.970
 simply plug in the microphone and afterwards 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.980
 you can fix it with the road bike and 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.860
 already one has mounted it has all 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.400
 really nice unit with the man 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.720
 Film can and the elastic suspension 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.560
 definitely fulfills its purpose and 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.330
 is very very stable 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.489
 with the video micro which is rohde 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.250
 really a big hit managed the 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.130
 sound quality is absolutely excellent 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 and the workmanship is excellent 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.150
 Manufacturer himself is so very much of it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.100
 convinced that he was a full ten years old 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.820
 warranty on the products gives that 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.890
 should really ensure trust 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.810
 I can absolutely recommend only comes 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.910
 over in the music store brings yours 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.370
 Camera with to try the thing on the spot 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.070
 from you will be amazed especially since 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.510
 if you hear the price absolutely 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.880
 Surprisingly, that is surprising 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.350
 cheap you experience it as always

 the technical data of this microphone 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.900
 can read 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.680
 Thanks for watching and until the
