00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.219
 is what we are going to create now is 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.200
 a carto for an art for the cheek 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.000
 this art you can draw this point 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.010
 you can draw her on the arm like 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.480
 a tattoo or just on 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.600
 cheek and then maybe add gods 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.550
 details to compose your own 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.400
 the design on the face to face today 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.099
 let's go for the pegasus mini pony one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.960
 horn what you want and then the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.579
 drawing could be completed if it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.120
 let's do it on the cheek instead of like 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.370
 tattoo for example with little hearts 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.870
 or a rainbow across the forehead 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 so here are several ideas 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.950
 the important thing is to put some of the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.480
 own and have a basic idea of ​​how 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.579
 we can make the face of a unicorn 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.670
 then we're going to draw an oval e 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.609
 then a small excrescence on one side 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.170
 in this way at this point always with 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.189
 the white we go to draw a 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.189
 ear and horn 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.659
 by we do a little piece of neck and to 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.780
 this point the white is not Sardinian film 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:31.630
 what a service you are now to design i 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.400
 hair and purple them to do then the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.840
 shades or the blue second of 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.130
 colors that ask you like them 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 more soul do a little tuft first 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 here we are going to create more slices 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.580
 on the forehead and then we go to create 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.580
 just the real career 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.439
 domain we are going to put more 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.439
 shade 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:51.110
 like this or do we stretch out 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.520
 shorter depending on how we like to 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.440
 this point the only thing we have to 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.800
 do is take the black and go to 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.510
 define the details then with two 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.060
 frattini 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.660
 let's go make the ears two strokes 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.920
 inside an inner part of the ear 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.900
 with a straight line and then an all in one 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.970
 series of round lines that gradually become 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.300
 we enlarge more and more we have 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:23.170
 made the unicorn we go to draw the 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.170
 musetti know 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.020
 which will end with a strip upwards 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.569
 so that it looks like it is smiling and then 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:44.530
 let's finish the rest of the horse 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:49.239
 with just one line we go to revise 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:56.319
 not even all hair care 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:04:01.630
 obviously only some lines and taste 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.590
 ours and then the most part comes 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:10.450
 difficult that is the goal 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:17.829
 let's go to which two dashes of 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:25.150
 semicircle this point we put a 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:27.900
 pallino as if it were the eye then 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.900
 celletti né 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:47.140
 a lot of decision work obviously at 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:55.330
 center of the black we put one again 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:57.400
 white tip to create light 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.900
 so we got our unicorn 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.340
 at the point to point we read 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:12.160
 we can put which we can 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:14.680
 maybe create here not mastella intoned 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.690
 we can put a rainbow sum 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.830
 what we say most we go to 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.830
 finish with glitter 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.960
 and here we have got the 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.090
 our unicorn begs about what we do 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.510
 like it more or but the pony iter 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.510
 bye thank you
