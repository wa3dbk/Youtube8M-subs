00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
first thing I'm going to do is take an

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.259 
first thing I'm going to do is take an
angled<00:00:10.530> eyeliner<00:00:10.650> brush<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.610> eye<00:00:11.880> shadow

angled eyeliner brush or eye shadow
brush<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:13.410> define<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.219> lower<00:00:14.490> lash

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
brush and just define the lower lash

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.670 
brush and just define the lower lash
line<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> third<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> way<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.080> then<00:00:16.560> I'm

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
line a third of the way and then I'm

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.560 
line a third of the way and then I'm
going<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> extend<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> line<00:00:17.609> up<00:00:17.789> slightly<00:00:18.210> as

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
going to extend the line up slightly as

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
going to extend the line up slightly as
to<00:00:19.080> give<00:00:19.230> me<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> guideline<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:20.100> where<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> want

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
to go with the shadow now the next thing

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.620 
to go with the shadow now the next thing
I'm<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.490> take<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> tissue<00:00:24.240> and

created and this is gonna start the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.209 
created and this is gonna start the
process<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:30.570> defining<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.619> eye<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.070> this

give<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.600> an<00:00:48.719> incredibly<00:00:49.289> hard<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.890> find<00:00:49.920> line

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
give you an incredibly hard to find line

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.889

to the inner corner of the eye and then
I'm<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> take<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> slightly<00:01:00.989> lighter

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I'm going to take a slightly lighter

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.560 
I'm going to take a slightly lighter
shadow<00:01:01.680> still<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.430> apply<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
inner corner and bring that about

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
inner corner and bring that about
halfway<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> whole<00:01:06.750> thing

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
halfway so that the whole thing

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.440 
halfway so that the whole thing
graduates<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.799> dark<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.369> light<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.299> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
because I don't like strong highlights

liner<00:02:17.080> brush<00:02:17.380> I'm<00:02:17.530> gonna<00:02:17.770> line<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.190> lash<00:02:18.340> line

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
liner brush I'm gonna line the lash line

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.810 
liner brush I'm gonna line the lash line
as<00:02:18.700> close<00:02:18.970> as<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.300> can<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.170> lashes<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.670> this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
as close as I can to the lashes and this

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.640 
as close as I can to the lashes and this
is<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> great<00:02:22.270> technique<00:02:22.450> for<00:02:22.960> hooded<00:02:23.470> eyes

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
is a great technique for hooded eyes

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.680 
is a great technique for hooded eyes
because<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.520> allows<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.940> define<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.570> eyes

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
because it allows you to define the eyes

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.180 
because it allows you to define the eyes
without<00:02:26.680> kind<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.160> applying<00:02:27.490> too<00:02:27.730> much<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:29.190> tiny

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
without kind of applying too much a tiny

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.250 
without kind of applying too much a tiny
bit<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.670> shimmer<00:02:31.120> eyeshadow<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.780> applied<00:02:32.080> to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
bit of shimmer eyeshadow is applied to

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.990 
bit of shimmer eyeshadow is applied to
the<00:02:32.350> tear<00:02:32.560> duct<00:02:32.770> area<00:02:32.890> because<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.880> an

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the tear duct area because this is an

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.090 
the tear duct area because this is an
entirely<00:02:34.330> matte<00:02:34.600> look<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:35.050> quick<00:02:35.860> application

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
entirely matte look a quick application

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.220 
entirely matte look a quick application
of<00:02:36.640> mascara<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.300> then<00:02:37.780> you'll<00:02:37.930> see<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
of mascara and then you'll see the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.960 
of mascara and then you'll see the
completed<00:02:38.770> look<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.130> imagine<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.820> can

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
completed look and imagine that you can

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.970 
completed look and imagine that you can
do<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:40.330> different<00:02:40.360> colors<00:02:41.020> with<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.560> use

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
do all different colors with this I use

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.250 
do all different colors with this I use
Browns<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:43.000> can<00:02:43.120> used<00:02:43.240> pinks<00:02:43.630> or<00:02:43.780> greens<00:02:44.020> or

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
Browns you can used pinks or greens or

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.530 
Browns you can used pinks or greens or
purples<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.400> completes<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.880> look<00:02:46.030> and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
purples and that completes the look and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.850 
purples and that completes the look and
once<00:02:46.690> you've<00:02:46.840> got<00:02:46.960> it<00:02:46.990> down<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.440> very<00:02:47.470> easy
