 welcome friends today we will learn to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.480
 make this pretty sphere with flowers that 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.370
 It is very elegant very colorful for 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.309
 any special occasion for some 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.049
 party for whatever you want here 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 we have put a small pendant for 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.900
 that you can hold it to the ceiling in a 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.840
 You can use the door at the reception 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.580
 even also as centerpieces in 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.689
 what you want to do and in the tones 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 what you want 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.619
 this is a tone that I did but 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.420
 that you can do it in the colors that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.219
 want so, if you like to stay 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.190
 see how we recover is a 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.559
 unicel ball we are going to occupy a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.110
 hot silicone gun 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.879
 let's take some scissors something with 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.100
 tie in this case I have a bit of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.620
 curly this ribbon that I know is 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.149
 decorative we are going to occupy also 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 glue buttons for the center of the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.530
 pompom flowers or what you want him 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 put we are going to also occupy some 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.090
 squares in this case I see them that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.520
 for in white that measure five 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.430
 centimeters by five centimeters and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.430
 some for the flowers that are going to make 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.120
 8 x 8 the color that you want we are going to 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.580
 start by tying the ribbon 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.740
 half to give us what part 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.870
 hold our sphere like this in this way 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.030
 so we can hang it up we're going to 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.190
 cut the excess so we can 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.960
 start decorating already with our flowers 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.479
 these flowers I had already taught them be 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.580
 in a video then that only very 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 I will quickly show you how to make them 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.860
 with our square of 8 x 8 we are going to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 do a fold here in half is going 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.670
 to stay like this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.119
 now let's measure half here in the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.119
 center 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 and we are going to fold in the two piquitos to 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.030
 the extremes will be like this now 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.990
 once we already did this we are going to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.990
 cut a petal 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.230
 thus 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:07.330
 we open here is now this I'm going to 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.330
 mark with the scissors 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.970
 the center or you can do it with your hand 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.970
 nothing else 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.340
 now I'm going to take some glue 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.040
 I put it on this side and I'll put it on 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.079
 the flower 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.790
 here we just have to be careful 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:38.750
 to put it in the middle of the petal here 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.670
 between the two that I have there so we'll do 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.010
 that with the three flowers and it's going to 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.079
 something like this once we have 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.140
 this part to do the center only 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:51.640
 Bend 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.950
 and leaves in this case is 5 x 5 of 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.470
 this form I will fold them one more time 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.940
 and now these corners will take them to 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.140
 center in this way the other 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.400
 and ready 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.129
 and I will have something like that 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.290
 now I'm just going to mark I 'm going to cut 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.290
 a petal more or less like that 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.280
 that I have cut it here now 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.920
 we only extend and I already have a flower of 8 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.080
 petals now 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.080
 I'm going to hit the center 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.630
 and with a little silicone 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.900
 I'm going to place the button in the center of the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.900
 flower 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.390

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.160
 my flowers all that I want to put 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.010
 in my sphere 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.620
 the amount of flowers will depend on the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.930
 size of your sphere now here and only 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.540
