Bonner<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.000> picked<00:01:30.240> him<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.630> quite

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
Bonner and I picked him up for quite

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.890 
Bonner and I picked him up for quite
cheap<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.350> believe<00:01:31.590> how<00:01:31.939> 3,100<00:01:32.939> coins<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
cheap I believe how 3,100 coins and the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390 
cheap I believe how 3,100 coins and the
average<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> market<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> minute<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
average on the market and the minute is

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.330 
average on the market and the minute is
like<00:01:35.520> 5000<00:01:36.509> coins<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.320> maybe<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.920> could<00:01:38.159> make<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
like 5000 coins so maybe I could make a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.370 
like 5000 coins so maybe I could make a
little<00:01:38.579> bit<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.790> profit<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.150> him<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.320> was

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
little bit of a profit on him but it was

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.370 
little bit of a profit on him but it was
absolutely<00:01:40.829> beast<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.310> fee<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.820> 12<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:43.170> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
absolutely beast in fee for 12 and as I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
absolutely beast in fee for 12 and as I
think<00:01:43.649> he<00:01:43.740> continues<00:01:44.280> his<00:01:44.310> form<00:01:44.790> into<00:01:45.180> fifa<00:01:45.390> 13

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
something something along those lines

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.069 
something something along those lines
but<00:03:14.370> that's<00:03:14.909> who<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.090> did<00:03:15.329> one<00:03:15.510> but<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> end
