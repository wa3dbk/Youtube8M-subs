00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.860
 I have the answer , wonder how much 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.289
 many people have done it to me and simply 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.380
 it is a product only a product that I 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:25.449
 use that is being 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:28.090
 has to see the part that is this and 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.390
 it just helps me make my hair 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.730
 güero güero tufts turn white 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.800
 and just to make it work in 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.900
 actually you have to have first the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.760
 white hair this does not return 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.489
 white you have to have hair 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.809
 white the hair guero so that this you 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.850
 make it white 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.370
 I'll leave it for 15 minutes 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.329
 add it to your routine that is being 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.760
 a lift the hair with shampoo that later 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.309
 that the base of this Monday for 15 minutes 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.729
 and then you rinse it but the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.009
 conditioner and you leave it as with 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:05.320
 kneecaps is simply you add this to me 

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:08.680
 I liked it very cheap, I can say that it is 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.080
 take a common one more year this kind of 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.780
 So big bottle cost me only 7 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.330
 dollars in going out and subway 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.010
 and simply that if you do not leave it a bit 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.830
 more than what your hair should have 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.860
 it returns it turns it into a tone 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.200
 purple blue is not permanent that tone 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.270
 simply with the next wash and not 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.250
 you use it, you turned against them 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.500
 simply that I recommend that you take 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.409
 a mirror with you and what are you 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.030
 observing this is like checking and that 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.799
 good the tone that you want that comes 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.260
 being this I leave it but ten minutes 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.070
 every wash when I wash my hair 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.350
 very simple easy cheap and that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.700
 personally I do not know almost by three 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.340
 years and I do not buy this new his 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.540

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.390
