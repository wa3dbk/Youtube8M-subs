00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:12.030
 well and so and so hello to you all I 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:17.250
 Kirill is not today we have a small video 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 about the fact that if my bike grieved 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.640
 In general, that my grandfather wound up sapet 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.730
 me stealth challenger he has brakes 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.220
 usual vibrating i'm here let's first 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.579
 consider the electronics in then all sorts 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:41.489
 handbags and things like that 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:44.800
 play stop what we have for 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.430
 start lanterns let's see 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.400
 front lamp we have it from China 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.280
 company do not experience 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.260
 Arshin advantage means he has 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.370
 three glow modes 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.250
 this is now a strong mode is average 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.940
 there is a strong flashing 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.940
 also let's turn on normal mode 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.350
 in this lantern there is a focusing it 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:22.000
 can be such a movement with 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 look passive at night 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.330
 coco 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.820
 ok but if there was a front lantern 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.300
 taillight taillight and us too 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:39.220
 from China he is also not quite usually his 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:44.620
 lantern what is it asking whether 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.430
 it means we show it again 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.430
 3 modes of operation 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.450
 and also here it is here on top 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.830
 is the solar battery that is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.690
 he with the battery he recharges 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.100
 here is a flashlight 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.770
 okay next we have electronics further u 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.540
 we have a bike computer china introduced again 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.220
 we have it though he actually stains 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.380
 do not imagine nikita because I take off drunk 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.820
 resistor and now it performs more 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:22.400
 functions than usually 5 means that we have 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:26.900
 eat it measures calories 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:34.280
 distance elapsed time shows 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:37.560
 travel time further total distance 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.490
 average speed maximum speed y 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.270
 calore 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:48.340
 from it the code total distance it will give 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.550
 it is with us 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.209
 like here then again like ours 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:00.400
 connects 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:04.510
 front with the front wheel well here in 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.790
 Generally here it is to the reader readers 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.260
 speeds 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.599
 we look further we have the main 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.990
 our current advantages of this 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:18.240
 bike is availability 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.640
 phone pay 916 what is its plus 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.750
 firstly there is gps 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.210
 secondly, he is very cheap already 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.700
 unfortunately for sale here but still 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.530
 good phone action its minus it 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.060
 the fact that he has a resistive screen but me 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.500
 it seems on the bike that you can eat 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:40.950
 Without wifi bluetooth 3g in general, everything is as 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:45.400
 need to through it can do 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.480
 back home study is worth it 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.280
 cyanogenmod firmware 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:56.140
 2 android version android 2 3 7 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.240
 Doctors I write here is a rating when I 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.750
 bike and record in the morning where I come 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.490
 distance speed there are the same 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.660
 principles of function that on the bike computer 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.940
 guests 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.370
 tips on the phone except dps of course 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.730
 the people dropped the rag 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.730
 so look 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.010
 he writes our current 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.560
 location 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.400
 how are we moving 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.400
 where are we going 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.090
 are watching 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.690
 here today I left home 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.230
 didn't go don't show everything where 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.230
 drove 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.810
 it is a service and service 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.530
 ok 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:59.080
 Well, very much further what else can you do 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:02.620
 here we brought through removed 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.260
 The standard speaker phone is not 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.860
 let's focus 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.540
 just above her phone bunny and this is the price 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.720
 for and again the place brought provodochek here 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.580
 this 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.560
 wire 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.560
 and we will come to this speaker 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:20.699
 we can listen 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.250
 Well, such a topic to detect you straight 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.240
 music plays our headphones do not need than 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.919
 convenient is the way 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.650
 what advantage over ordinary 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.850
 headphones that is, when we usually see 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.810
 if the headphones do not hear here 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.250
 environment what's around us 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.410
 going all over the forest on a bike it's 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.470
 it is generally very dangerous in this case 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.320
 comfortable listening to music see each other this 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.360
 will be distracted nowhere we are not leaving 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.710
 that's the same even that we still have hosting 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.660
 Yes, that can just give a general view 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.470
 bicycle 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.470
 This is how it looks 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.150
 he is a two-suspension so big speaker 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.710
 I wanted to put the bottom did not work 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.870
 Sorry here's another thing that we have 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.240
 there is also a seat bag 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:31.560
 what is in it to me of course 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:33.880
 all kinds of tools 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.190
 Well, we will not simply show them 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.300
 the strument and there is also here still 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.699
 Here is the charger 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.650
 portable he has a nominal volume 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:46.710
 11200 hopefully fixed 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.190
 what is this 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.840
 that's 11,200 milliamps hours in fact he 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.780
 already quite old there remains 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.480
 seven thousand area means why 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.970
 and further from it it is now included from 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.440
 He's out there, he took provodochek 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.260
 pairs pairs pairs parameter 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.570
 informants and he comes to this 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.889
 that is, if we always have 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.660
 recharging 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:15.830
 convenience store I will compare 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.830
 that's actually 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.510
 I think that all I wanted to show 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.510
 Today 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.580
 Thanks for attention 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:27.759
 good
