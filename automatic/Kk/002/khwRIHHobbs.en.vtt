black on right and we will pass red and
into<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.740> two<00:01:06.220> beads<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:08.020> front<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.740> beat

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
into the two beads the front to beat

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.170 
into the two beads the front to beat
one<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:12.020> another<00:01:13.020> one

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.770 

so<00:01:20.180> make<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.450> into<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:21.290> center<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.040> line

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
so make it into the center of the line

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.100 
so make it into the center of the line
red<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.049> put<00:01:24.740> three<00:01:25.399> light<00:01:26.030> brown<00:01:26.390> four

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
red and put three light brown four

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.649 
red and put three light brown four
millimeter

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.600 

criss-cross<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.829> dragon<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.700> pool<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> now

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
criss-cross with dragon and pool so now

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.080 
criss-cross with dragon and pool so now
we<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:37.789> now<00:01:38.789> read<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.689> will<00:01:40.590> put<00:01:40.829> in

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
we got like this now read in will put in

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.340 
we got like this now read in will put in
to<00:01:42.090> beat<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:45.630> work<00:01:45.780> around<00:01:46.170> these

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
to beat so we will work around these

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.840 
to beat so we will work around these
three<00:01:46.829> beats<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.920> tube<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.399> will<00:01:50.670> be

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
three beats and the tube it will be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.279 
three beats and the tube it will be
first<00:01:51.270> one<00:01:52.220> here<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.640> one

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.310 

the<00:02:01.289> second<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.899> at<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.109> back

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the second one is the one at the back

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.949 
the second one is the one at the back
this<00:02:05.039> one

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.839 

so<00:02:09.560> right<00:02:09.769> now<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.009> line<00:02:10.519> will<00:02:11.209> be<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.959> these

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
so right now the line will be in these

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:20.630 
so right now the line will be in these
three<00:02:13.849> beats<00:02:14.950> 1<00:02:15.950> 2<00:02:16.549> &amp;<00:02:17.359> 3

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.330 

now<00:02:21.640> black<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.000> put<00:02:22.570> two<00:02:22.870> light<00:02:23.380> brown<00:02:23.830> four

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
now black and put two light brown four

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.810 
now black and put two light brown four
millimeter<00:02:25.320> criss<00:02:26.320> cross<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:26.950> red<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.460> and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
again black and we'll put into next two

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.830 
again black and we'll put into next two
bits<00:02:35.790> which<00:02:36.420> will<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:38.520> same<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.390> the
