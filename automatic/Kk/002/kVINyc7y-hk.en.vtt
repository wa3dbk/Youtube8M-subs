the same time this liner retails at
about<00:01:31.710> 16<00:01:32.710> euro<00:01:33.009> I<00:01:33.250> think<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.700> then<00:01:34.149> the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
about 16 euro I think and then the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.980 
Catrice one is only 4 euro I think it's
actually<00:01:36.310> less<00:01:36.729> than<00:01:36.759> 4<00:01:37.149> euro<00:01:37.360> in<00:01:37.540> some<00:01:37.750> shops

and easily like with a little swipe of a

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.890 
and easily like with a little swipe of a
wet<00:04:21.560> cotton<00:04:21.859> swab<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:23.390> Catrice<00:04:23.720> one

taking off your

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.680 
taking off your
I<00:04:26.569> find<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.680> this<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.789> results<00:04:29.150> of<00:04:29.240> one

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
I find so this is the results of one

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.140 
I find so this is the results of one
drugstore<00:04:30.289> eyeball<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:30.979> one<00:04:31.490> high-end

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
drugstore eyeball and one high-end

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.230 
drugstore eyeball and one high-end
eyeball<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:33.160> as<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.400> can<00:04:34.520> see<00:04:34.699> there's<00:04:35.030> not

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
eyeball and as you can see there's not

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.700 
eyeball and as you can see there's not
that<00:04:35.419> much<00:04:35.629> of<00:04:35.659> a<00:04:35.780> drastic<00:04:35.990> difference<00:04:36.560> if

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
that much of a drastic difference if

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.559 
that much of a drastic difference if
anything<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.400> think<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.699> Catrice<00:04:38.120> eyeball

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
anything I think the Catrice eyeball

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.809 
anything I think the Catrice eyeball
looks<00:04:38.960> better<00:04:39.229> yeah<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.039> all<00:04:40.159> honestly<00:04:40.430> guys

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
looks better yeah and all honestly guys

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.649 
looks better yeah and all honestly guys
I<00:04:41.090> prefer<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:42.590> trace<00:04:42.800> liner<00:04:43.039> icon<00:04:43.970> is<00:04:44.180> great<00:04:44.449> it

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
I prefer to trace liner icon is great it

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.149 
I prefer to trace liner icon is great it
has<00:04:44.810> some<00:04:45.169> kind<00:04:45.409> of<00:04:45.440> ingredient<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:46.069> it

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
has some kind of ingredient in it

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.119 
has some kind of ingredient in it
apparently<00:04:46.520> lash<00:04:47.210> enhancing<00:04:47.620> there<00:04:48.620> we<00:04:48.770> go

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
apparently lash enhancing there we go

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.010 
apparently lash enhancing there we go
however<00:04:49.639> I<00:04:49.909> think<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.330> your<00:04:50.569> hair<00:04:50.810> growth

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
however I think that your hair growth

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.649 
however I think that your hair growth
and<00:04:51.259> stuff<00:04:51.470> comes<00:04:51.889> more<00:04:52.190> from<00:04:52.220> within<00:04:52.819> not<00:04:53.509> so

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
and stuff comes more from within not so

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:54.879 
and stuff comes more from within not so
much<00:04:53.810> about<00:04:53.900> what<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.259> put<00:04:54.409> on<00:04:54.590> your<00:04:54.620> eyes

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
much about what you put on your eyes

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.339 
much about what you put on your eyes
like<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.550> use<00:04:56.150> coconut<00:04:56.419> oil<00:04:56.659> to<00:04:56.870> take<00:04:57.020> off<00:04:57.199> my

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349

makeup<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.099> really<00:04:58.400> conditions<00:04:58.909> my

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
makeup and that really conditions my

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.089 
makeup and that really conditions my
lashes<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.479> makes<00:04:59.750> them<00:04:59.960> long<00:05:00.139> anyway<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:00.650> if
