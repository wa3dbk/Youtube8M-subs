00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
sink to the bottom of the bottle and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.859 
sink to the bottom of the bottle and
they<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.699> quite<00:00:30.029> hard<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.359> pick<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
they can be quite hard to pick up on the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
they can be quite hard to pick up on the
broth<00:00:31.080> actually<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.619> there's<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:32.040> heaps<00:00:32.399> in

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
broth actually if there's not heaps in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.310 
broth actually if there's not heaps in
the<00:00:32.790> bottle<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.630> more<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.989> spaz

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the bottle so it's more of a spaz

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.280 
the bottle so it's more of a spaz
glitter<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> bit<00:00:36.480> hard<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.870> get

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
glitter so it can be a bit hard to get

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.380 
glitter so it can be a bit hard to get
some<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.559> your<00:00:37.710> brush<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.270> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
some on your brush so what I do is I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.869 
some on your brush so what I do is I
usually<00:00:40.010> give<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> bottle<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.489> bit<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
usually give the bottle a little bit of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.389 
usually give the bottle a little bit of
a<00:00:41.969> shake<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.570> roll<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> around<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:43.559> hands<00:00:43.980> or

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
a shake or roll it around in my hands or

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
a shake or roll it around in my hands or
I<00:00:44.539> swirl<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.780> brush<00:00:45.899> around<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> bottle

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
I swirl the brush around in the bottle

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.529 
I swirl the brush around in the bottle
eventually<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.940> some<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> black

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
this one was pretty easy to get the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.760 
this one was pretty easy to get the
shapes<00:02:17.780> out<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.230> didn't<00:02:18.440> really<00:02:18.590> have<00:02:18.710> a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
shapes out I didn't really have a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.770

problem with it again this is sped up a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:30.710 
problem with it again this is sped up a
little<00:02:20.930> bit

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.450
