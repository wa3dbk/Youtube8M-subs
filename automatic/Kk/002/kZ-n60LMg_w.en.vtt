00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 and what that really means on the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.819
 nose to land 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.120
 These are currently the experience 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.580
 Berlin with its capital city airport 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.309
 bad luck and breakdown the much money 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.080
 But it's not just Berlin 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 If we look over Germany 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.939
 then we see there are guaranteed too 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.890
 near you a airport of deep in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.590
 the lousy we have namely in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 germany more airports per head than 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.640
 For example, the USA has been a low-cost airline since 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.210
 Some years, you lift from the airport 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.850
 Dortmund to aim throughout Europe 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.700
 The passengers can be happy for 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 she is a true fly from dortmund 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.850
 bargain 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.739
 stupid only that the airport dortmund 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.930
 while it makes it pays in 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.449
 last year 19 5 million euros 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.030
 loss must stand straight for the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.990
 Stadtwerke dortmund so the city 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.640
 dortmund so ultimately the citizen everyone 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.439
 He will pay for Dortmund last year 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 thus for the lossy runway 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.000
 exactly 34 euros 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.460
 You could ever go to Mallorca 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.619
 somehow fly crazy 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.479
 despite flying super cheap tickets 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.270
 cheap airlines also still high profits 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.330
 a moment could be the loss 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.060
 of the airport 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.130
 yes, at least the eu commission says 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.979
 she accuses the dortmundern unauthorized 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.920
 aid before the toll BE REDUCED namely 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.689
 below the actual cost of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 airport knows that, of course, outraged 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.470
 back that is all as it is called 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.360
 nice market usual but market usual 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.430
 Unfortunately, that means the cheap flyer 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.110
 with low fees must attract 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.710
 otherwise they fly over one 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.880
 regional airport just over it 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.350
 the problem is that an airport itself 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.820
 Can not move but in the plane can 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.280
 to move that means so if they are the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.500
 raise prices above the market level 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.320
 the aircraft is taken off and at a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.810
 placed at another airport 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.399
 only a small hopping is it from 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 Dortmund to Paderborn 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.900
 The airport here has been winning for years 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.240
 earned last but migrated 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.550
 many people leave for dortmund 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.340
 Fly Paderborn in the red numbers 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.070
 the descent brought a minus of 15 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.290
 million euros must be in favor 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.280
 the surrounding districts so the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.930
 taxpayer 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.760
 about the cheap competition in the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.220
 neighboring dortmund is annoyed 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.830
 landrat manfred m端ller therefore very much he 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.830
 has now complained at the top 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.190
 the eu commission the eu has to go for it 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.080
 stand that the charges from the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.890
 airports are taken to 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.580
 they do not cover their costs 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.540
 correspond to dumping prices 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:58.489
 so that you do not fly cheap 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.489
 to work the prices demand the 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.590
 under the cost again only one 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.180
 small hoppers from Paderborn 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 But the next one is already coming into being 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.709
 brand new airport kassel calden with 271 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.630
 million euro tax convey the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.970
 regional politicians in hessen wanted that 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.799
 so and nobody could stop them 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.790
 because the construction of airports is 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:26.360
 Country thing for the airport paderborn 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.870
 the airport kassel becomes the airport 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.430
 Of course, this is also a burden 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.560
 pay our passenger 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.060
 that is relatively likely but that 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.280
 will also mean that kassel calden 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.560
 actually hardly in the black numbers 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.040
 In the long run, that was not possible 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.860
 from the outset a million grave for the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.780
 Taxpayers will come in April 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.209
 airport kassel go into operation 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.060
 Well it will not be tight here 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.860
 Currently, there are only twelve per week 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.079
 regular departures planned 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.329
 so the taxpayer must be comfortable 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.780
 again, we judge it 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:05.690
 that we have to 2 at the latest 20 18 20 20 in 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.630
 the order of magnitude depending on the course of 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.360
 The accepted are the market 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.470
 corresponding positive 0 then 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.980
 can write out 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.079
 So start free for the subsidies in 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.829
 were completely germany 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.750
 regional airport expanded 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.419
 a little glamor for the vile 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.180
 The province now ravages a ruinous one 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:30.199
 The airport has competition 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.050
 Friedrichshafen 2011 a deficit of 2.7 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:36.139
 millions of euros are generated in 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.320
 saarbr端cken the loss was 8.8 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.820
 million with two bridges and tap has 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.580
 Rhineland-Palatinate is equal to two 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.919
 Loss bringer in North Rhine-Westphalia 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.560
 the citizens paid in dortmund and in 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.480
 paderborn on the airports in 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.180
 erfurt and dresden fell to the 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.310
 Taxpayers flew to the load in the north 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.830
 Rostock laage and l端beck deep into the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.750
 lousy 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.910
 in Luebeck the city of 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.940
 Merchants are particularly dramatic 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.720
 the Hanseatic city wants its airport 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.060
 be sure to get rid of it 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.220
 but that's not that easy 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.240
 City offers private investors now 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.419
 even on 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.639
 you get the airport as a gift and 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.060
 plus four million euros on top 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.440
 according to the motto main thing takes over 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.160
 still love the debts of 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.590
 namely about 40 million euro 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.420
 and by the way also in l端beck landed 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.250
 part of the tax money ultimately in the 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:36.560
 At least the EU thinks cheap airlines 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.040
 there is still a question like that 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.150
 stop insane subvention race 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.340
 dortmund is now afraid of a word of law 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.530
 from Brussels, the EU demands the 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.900
 repayment of state aid then would be 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.300
 the airport immediately went broke in dortmund 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.430
 one hopes therefore on a grace period 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.180
 but it should be longer than that 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.190
 Some runway loud business plan can 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.230
 the airport dortmund namely only in 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.590
 Eight years on his own 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.170
 cover super cheap fly just works 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.630
 only with government help a 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.740
 Bargain for the taxpayer is that 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.740
 certainly not
