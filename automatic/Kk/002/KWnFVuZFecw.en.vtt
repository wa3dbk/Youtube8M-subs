00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.609
 face sere 1500 mm emily ampere battery we cannot say autonomy 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.830
 however, if I do not have a penis, we assume that I can talk about the day 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.850
 amperage is high 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.220
 slot for the sim slot for the micro sd supplied a mycosis of 16 giga bytes 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.850
 while

 her father's gigabyte of user memory and 16 re sorry 512 megabytes of 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.380
 very nice cloth either 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.200
 as housings and as a screen cleaning poisson text 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.489
 the data cable which is not the standard micro sd but is proprietary 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.190
 then 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.190
 I say the network with ip 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.880

 Italian is intended in the packaging 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.240
 we turn on the really huge display 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.979
 let's make a small dimensional comparison with the i. nievo here 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.100
 as you see 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.650
 a 480-by-800 5-inch display is very much much bigger 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.560
 in glass 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.369
 said capacitive screen very good the answer 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.159
 the display in front we have a singer of - I add also for now not of 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.040
 use on the application 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.930
 we have brightness and proximity sensor 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.030
 3 touch-sensitive buttons omg menu that back while back 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.610
 there is 5 megapixel meat with the flash led autofocus app 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.539
 we tried it in kampala great photos 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.090
 for it does not even 720p video that sometimes takes a little bit but 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.250
 the could be more because we will load a test 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.419
 d a video made 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:17.109
 the phone the hundred actively with android 1 point six o2 you already have 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.769
 published laroma2. 1 the usual android cooks cooked it we went out 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:23.759
 to install the 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.590
 on our device anyway 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.840
 tend to end the year two rom two point two 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:30.599

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.409
 down 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.700
 moreover, the one does not only work in total vertical queries in Naples 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.270
 er la 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.779

 collective herbiceps 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.170
 where there was not 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.490
 mts we enter the menu we go immediately to see 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.119
 the navigation is beautiful 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.919
 let's try to see 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.409
 phone 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 and see how it is most viewed 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.509
 page weather and rain is as fast as all the android ninja 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.519

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.339
 d flash that will come when 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:39.550
 the phone will be 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.860
 updated and of course we have the pinch to zoom 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.179
 puts the fluidity but definitely good to enter 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.179
 in a news 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.309
 obviously the 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.770
 so large multidisplay helps navigation a lot 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.870
 and it is that of medium which allows however of usable dimension also for 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.870
 As for phone calls, he immediately gives me access 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.959
 mask of phone calls here it is 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.299
 and while we're at it just doing the usual calling 39 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.870
 - speakers for 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.870
 I have 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.479
 at that volume the voice is really in bed movies 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.139
 the phone distorts a little maybe I try because the book is so high 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.380
 but we assure you that from the earphone always very well 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.030
 for maybe a little bit 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.980
 that I use but that volume remains very very high to compose a 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.039
 message 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.120
 so I'll show you the virtual keyboard here it is 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.139
 keyboard that works 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.050
 well it has no problems too 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.210
 to type 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.050
 quickly towards some typo but obviously talk about that 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.379
 writes together 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.759
 to you a little complicated then typing dr are at fault 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.040
 let's go back 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.639
 f flight applications to see 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.689
