ride away right it just doesn't make
sense<00:01:34.430> in<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.610> opinion<00:01:36.140> well<00:01:37.140> first<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.770> all

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.700 

Jews<00:01:41.410> should<00:01:41.800> be<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:41.980> lifetime<00:01:42.910> commitment<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
Jews should be a lifetime commitment it

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.740 
Jews should be a lifetime commitment it
is<00:01:44.740> just<00:01:45.010> pointless<00:01:45.370> for<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:46.090> think<00:01:46.420> that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
is just pointless for you to think that

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.930 
is just pointless for you to think that
you<00:01:47.290> can<00:01:47.470> jump<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:47.980> this<00:01:48.160> stuff<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.700> stay<00:01:48.910> on

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
you can jump on this stuff and stay on

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.210 
you can jump on this stuff and stay on
for<00:01:49.420> like<00:01:49.660> just<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:50.050> while<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.440> then<00:01:50.560> stop<00:01:50.920> and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
for like just a while and then stop and

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.670 
for like just a while and then stop and
go<00:01:51.370> back<00:01:51.400> nati<00:01:51.880> doesn't<00:01:52.360> work<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.780> way<00:01:53.020> when

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
go back nati doesn't work that way when

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.560 
go back nati doesn't work that way when
you<00:01:53.800> stop<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:55.030> will<00:01:55.180> wind<00:01:55.450> up<00:01:57.570> best-case

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
you stop you will wind up best-case

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.160 
you stop you will wind up best-case
scenario<00:01:59.520> just<00:02:00.520> like<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.820> started<00:02:01.300> but<00:02:01.810> in

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
scenario just like you started but in

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.500 
scenario just like you started but in
most<00:02:02.380> cases<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:03.070> will<00:02:03.490> wind<00:02:03.790> up<00:02:03.880> also<00:02:04.300> what

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
most cases you will wind up also what

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.359 
most cases you will wind up also what
side<00:02:04.750> effects<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.619> is<00:02:05.800> more<00:02:05.950> freeride

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
side effects and that is more freeride

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.249 
side effects and that is more freeride
in<00:02:06.610> this<00:02:06.760> lifetime<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.479> this<00:02:07.660> matrix<00:02:07.869> I'm

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
in this lifetime and this matrix I'm

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.530 
in this lifetime and this matrix I'm
