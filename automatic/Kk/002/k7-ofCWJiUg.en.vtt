be proactive now some of the biotech
industry<00:02:48.150> are<00:02:48.600> saying<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.990> sin<00:02:49.230> by<00:02:49.410> was

industry are saying that sin by was
being<00:02:49.950> overhyped<00:02:50.580> basically<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:51.840> genetic

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
being overhyped basically just genetic

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.500 
being overhyped basically just genetic
modification<00:02:53.490> but<00:02:53.730> taken<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.180> little<00:02:54.390> bit

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510

further Hoffman disagrees noting that

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.130 
further Hoffman disagrees noting that
there<00:02:56.700> were<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.180> bunch<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.630> different

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
there were a bunch of different

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
when talking to funders and you know we

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.670 
when talking to funders and you know we
don't<00:03:21.540> think<00:03:21.660> we<00:03:21.960> think<00:03:22.110> they<00:03:22.200> can't<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:22.590> it

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680

don't think we think they can't have it
both<00:03:22.800> ways<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.430> we<00:03:23.610> need<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.850> take<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.420> time

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.580 
both ways so we need to take the time
and<00:03:24.750> think<00:03:24.840> about<00:03:25.050> how<00:03:25.200> we<00:03:25.260> want<00:03:25.410> this

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
biology that we don't want I think now

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.200 
biology that we don't want I think now
is<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.920> time<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.400> conversation<00:03:35.520> my

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
is the time to have that conversation my

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.180 
is the time to have that conversation my
opinion<00:03:36.630> is<00:03:36.750> generally<00:03:37.140> pretty<00:03:37.410> gung-ho<00:03:37.710> on

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
opinion is generally pretty gung-ho on

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.950 
opinion is generally pretty gung-ho on
this<00:03:38.430> stuff<00:03:38.670> but<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.940> understand<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.630> need<00:03:39.930> for

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
this stuff but I understand the need for

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.770 
this stuff but I understand the need for
us<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.830> temper<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.490> enthusiasm<00:03:42.270> but<00:03:42.570> what<00:03:42.720> do

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
us to temper that enthusiasm but what do

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.450 
us to temper that enthusiasm but what do
you<00:03:42.930> think<00:03:43.290> should<00:03:43.380> we<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.680> worried<00:03:43.950> or<00:03:44.100> should

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
you think should we be worried or should

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.130 
you think should we be worried or should
we<00:03:44.550> be<00:03:44.580> excited<00:03:45.060> about<00:03:45.120> synthetic<00:03:45.540> biology<00:03:46.050> we

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
we be excited about synthetic biology we

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.740 
we be excited about synthetic biology we
probably<00:03:46.380> should<00:03:47.310> be<00:03:47.490> both<00:03:47.760> frankly<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:48.630> know

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
probably should be both frankly I know

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.420 
probably should be both frankly I know
that<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.170> want<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> glow-in-the-dark<00:03:49.980> llama

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
that I want to glow-in-the-dark llama

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.910 
that I want to glow-in-the-dark llama
but<00:03:50.670> let<00:03:50.850> us<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.630> what<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.350> want<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
but let us know what you want in the
