00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.489
 but today 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:19.130
 but now 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:28.220
 but the truth that you have to value 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.220
 please 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.530

 bergara 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.690
 the experimentation and the consequent innovations 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.190
 that were developed during the period of 4 80 euros 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.170
 when the change arrives in theory 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.590
 in a moment of maximum fullness artistic brilliance 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.670
 that consolidates the triumph of classicism 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.040
 the 5 80 is therefore a period of splendor of full rebirth 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.420
 that is named like this in attention to the moment in which it develops 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.060
 the beginning of the 16th century 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.740
 It is also an especially fortunate moment 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.840
 by generational coincidence a drought of renowned artists 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.039
 universal 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.040
 that give an unsuspected flash to this artistic episode 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.740
 just remember the names 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.250
 by leonardo da vinci 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.439
 rafael sanzio 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.909
 or the great angel Miguel Buonarroti to certify what was said 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.120
 nevertheless and despite all this 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.320
 this full Renaissance classicism 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.230
 it will not last long 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.620
 the classical language soon becomes repetitive and encorseta the creativity of 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.530
 the artists in a too narrow margin 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.680
 especially if the genius of Miguel Angel 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.979
 is loaded with concerns to innovate 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.129
 and to reorient the paths of art through new criteria 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.310
 an increasingly critical response to the language of the plenary is emerging 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.270
 Renaissance 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.890
 which assumes progressively 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 anti classic positions and formal and thematic solutions 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.690
 more imaginative and personal 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.189
 it's the mannerism 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.780
 an artistic period 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.490
 and begins to manifest itself in the second third of the 16th century and that until the end 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.680
 of the painting will already displace the language of the plenary session to a second plane 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.299
 cent 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.389
 During 50, characteristic aspects of the first Renaissance were preserved 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.479
 especially the attachment to the classic guidelines 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.199
 However, there are also certain people who in the Italy of the 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.869
 time 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:35.219
 that alter the general universe that defined the art of 4 80 euros 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.239
 especially the political imposition of the papacy 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.069
 whose new patronage converting Rome into the artistic capital of the world in this 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.989
 time 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.710
 the 53 by so much of the silo of roma 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.609
 and the dads 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.579
 princes who were the greatest patrons of art 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.860
 as July second 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.930

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.659
 or clement seventh 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.420
 it will be their commissions that attract the capital 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.740
 to the great artists of the moment with Miguel Angel

 rafael foto dna all lover 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.139
 in the field of architecture 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.029
 the classical influence on the use of young people remains 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:13.449
 as well as in constructive elements and techniques 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.179
 highlights the construction of new palaces of greater magnificence than 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:18.469
 in the previous century 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.820
 and of temples that seek 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.100
 a new approach with the centralization of your plants 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.329
 in this sense the prolonged work of the new Vatican 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.520
 marks a milestone 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.409
 the whole century 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.859

 donato lover 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.630
 Sometime later the singular legacy will also arrive 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.500
 that show 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.739
 the villas of Andrea Palladio 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.019
 in sculpture continues the sense that the cyclist of 4 80 euros balanced and 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:48.880
 harmonic 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.700
 and whose theme retains the perfect symbiosis 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.329
 between reasons to prost and mythology 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.840
 in any case you can talk 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.550
 of a growing trend 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.870
 to the compositional agitation to the constant search of the movement 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.389
 read it monumentality 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.459
 find their final synthesis in the first pobras of Miguel Angel 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.250
 the painting although equally balanced and static 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.099
 in a large part of the works 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.450
 rafael or leonardo 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.440
 he is very soon with revolutionary contributions 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.519
 as in his mantle 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.489
 with the perspective adriÃ¡ leonard es k 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.640
 as the Mannerist incursions themselves 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.789
 from Rafael himself 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.090
 all this without forgetting 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.840
 the growing influence of Venetian painting 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.700
 and add its colorful strength 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.779
 to the classicism of the first pitching not intentions 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:36.750
 and the far from the limitations 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.950
 the 4 80 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.409
 turning it on a new trajectory 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.600
 whose first step will be Real Madrid 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.600
 and his goal the baroque painting 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.990
 from the second third of the 16th century 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.379
 a new artistic response emerges 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.169
 contrary to the dogmatic imposition of classical orthodoxy 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.280
 a new art 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.350
 and a new language much more spontaneous and fanciful 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.719
 that wield anti-classical proposals 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.470
 it's the marinismo whose main mentor 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.330
 It will be the emblematic figure 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.289
 from miguel to 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.800
 as a result of it 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.240
 the lilian artist of the 16th century 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.349
 keep filling 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.990
 by the tension in front of the classic equilibrium 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.699
 by spatial audio versus amplitude 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.360
 the contrasted light versus the homogeneous 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.139
 intense chromatism versus soft 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.610
 Volumetry versus volatility 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.280
 the expressiveness in front of the idealism and the restlessness the surprise and the anxiety 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.990
 against the euro 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.060
 the whore wholesaler of miguel angel 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.730
 other authors will follow 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.980
 they will complete the artistic framework of the Menem period 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.960
 in sculpture and despite the artistic monopoly exercised by Miguel Angel 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.580
 in this period appear other renowned artists as well as years 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.879
 hoben minutes and livni 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.279
 in painting but also the influence of Miguel Angel 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.680
 he practically occupied 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.030
 all the work done 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.520
 in the second half of the 16th century 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.619
 especially in its decoration of the Sistine Chapel is no less true 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.589
 in this field, the payroll of painters with their own personality and marked 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:12.729
 is greater than in other arts 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.060
 not only in venice where it emerges with enormous strength 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.949
 the personality of tintoretto or Peronism 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.729
 but in other areas those that arise painters like farmville I do not 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.990
 bronzino arcimboldo 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.320
 pontormo or the doctor himself 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.970
 that enrich pluralist Mannerist art in painting 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:35.450
 the expansion of the Renaissance in the rest of Europe 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.200
 will be an inevitable phenomenon given the enormous tactical force no longer of the century 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.150
 16 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.080
 its adaptation to different European environments 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.210
 they will be any other case 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.389
 and emphasized the approximation to the Italian art to which they derive will be different 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.310
 according to the artistic substrate 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.419
 Of each country 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.840
 in Spain the weight of the Gothic tradition and the limited success of the language 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.590
 classic 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.740
 will lead to a singular renaissance 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.800
 very ornate in architecture 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.819
 and in general, little humanist content 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:11.729
 In any case, the Mannerist style stands out in an exceptional way 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:12.550
 personal 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.409

 in the Netherlands and Germany 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.689
 Expressionist vein will predominate 

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.909
 she had developed brilliantly 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.169
 in the preceding centuries 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.589
 in germany the work of painters like matÃ­as of a rival

 pieter brueghel 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.580
 and the bosco preserve the bright tradition 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.680
 of flamenco painting 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.300
 finally in france 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.860
 the classicism triumph 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.860
 and will persevere in his art even beyond 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.699
 Baroque style
