00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.450
 and well, you are welcome here to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 this boyfriend I have to use the 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.680
 sorry things to the custom of call 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 of duty cost and good because it 's for vélez 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.970
 about the s is good there is already a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 estimate there is already an image there is already 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.140
 many things rumors rumors and more 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.510
 rumors about those of the excess that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.489
 to start you remember that in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.140
 black ops 1 if not bad memory we form 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.450
 a word when putting all the letters together 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.270
 of the dl ses that said first and no less 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.210
 but more memory or were black ops 2 not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.310
 I know I'm sure it was in black ops one 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780
 that said fire and yes because we 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.260
 they said something like he was going to have 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.810
 something firm then follow it ok 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.239
 now yes that is they have not done the 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.220
 exception right now it's simple that simple and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.290
 simply that as it leaked the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.040
 issue here in the question of what 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.020
 This image is being since then 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.119
 in the rose they resumed it in 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 the twitter of infinity ward but without the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.399
 names of what is coming from what 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.170
 is going to give the maps ok that in a 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.700
 image that says the Ticos save you 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.870
 10 dollars will be able to see it here in the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.430
 video is unmatched they will leave 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.430
 in the description to nail a little bit 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.620
 bigger that says season pass and has 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.190
 the names of the dlc that form the 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.280
 word odin which is the satellite that 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.200
 destroyed at the beginning of the campaign and 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.970
 well now we have the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.280
 names of what the maps can be 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.480
 almost certain of the forgiveness of those of 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.330
 the maps that are going to come out ok we have 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.280
 at a slow we have after skiing 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.830
 there is no base station I guess so 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.840
 although he listens very weird after invasion 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.260
 and then nemesis ok 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.070
 are these four maps and how good 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.780
 we can start thinking a little bit about 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.179
 how the matter is going to work 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.220
 he spoke of maps not recycled but of 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.560
 maps of other mobile workforce that has 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.090
 been very popular is one of the cases is 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.680
 of road scrap as I mentioned a video 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.780
 earlier that it could be that it will come back 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.790
 that was almost a fact and right now 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.160
 is talking about what's coming 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.380
 being the map of tomb in or of dome in 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.420
 modern warfare 3 that is not my favorite 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.010
 honestly and I do not think a map like 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.260
 to return it but 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.390
 Well now we use so we can 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.299
 do I would settle for them to come back 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.099
 two or three maps of modern warfare 2 with 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.769
 that pretty pretty pretty happy stamp ok 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.810
 then we have here what comes 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.430
 being these data about the new of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.890
 he is from one of those who are more 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.400
 well and the other fact that I have is the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.140
 approximate departure date or maybe 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.700
 Well, I do not know what we could say is a 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.730
 little precise about what's coming 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.939
 being the output of the first dlc that is 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.640
 more or less in put for the 28 of 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.290
 January 2014 which I think is a 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.450
 date a little long in fact I 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.370
 It seems that now it is lengthened not a 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.720
 little bit is fine because that way people do not 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.940
 he feels that they put the chorizo ​​with the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.489
 of them is so fast what good then 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.680
 it's a good strategy then and given 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.359
 this is good because we have already started what 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.609
 that are being those of the stool and a 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.500
 approximate estimated date that I think 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.700
 that is going to be fulfilled and if it is not going to 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.129
 fulfill will be as close as possible 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.840
 if we are talking about 28 we can be 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.310
 talking about a week before or a 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.379
 week later in what he's saying 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.700
 the range of what they say the 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.800
 is that what 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.590
 very good very good news the truth is 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.450
 but I honestly think retro maps 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.330
 so to speak or minimal expected to chirp what 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.420
 put in the first dlc I think that already 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.860
 once seeing how this comes out 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.230
 I would buy what has been the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.760
 season pass I say thankfully I think 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.540
 buy it with someone so it's not going to 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.459
 going out in 800 pesos will leave me in 400 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.890
 and well, now they have never been 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.330
 of putting achievements those of infinity ward 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.010
 good has never beaten to put the 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.290
 divinity guard achievements in the dlc is 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.299
 until quarter 3 with the achievements of the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.459
 click on survival engine that does not 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.860
 okay mother came in I think that here they go to 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.260
 meter achievements on how the 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.730
 aliens what is good because I think 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.290
 well I said I played that thing because 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.540
 it really did not get my attention but 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.090
 for nothing or as a team, it is very 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.290
 boring but good maybe playing with 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.910
 the right people or that the 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.200
 people guide us to know what to do 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.080
 Well maybe it goes a little bit more 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.360
 entertaining that leaving it on the good side 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.889
 Well, now we're ready 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.710
 practically for what it is being 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.110
 the dlcs of those all the information that 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.850
 is that was collected so far is 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.240
 all the information confirmed by 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.479
 tell 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.819
 like rumor I say we're not talking about 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.080
 map names which is what a lot 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.210
 people we are seeing right now names of 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.150
 maps that nothing to see and of course I was 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.310
 they make very absurd but this is very 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.530
 important not the names of the what 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.970
 that are being maps give us a 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.669
 more or less idea of ​​how it will work 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.130
 I'm almost sure and I would not like 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.169
 think what by the names the name 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.569
 of nemesis 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.490
 it's going to be the fact that until this dlc 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.729
 that is the last one they are going to put the maps 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.440
 of dead I do not want to think about it but 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.270
 Now it sounds to me like that 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.210
 Once the name is possible I do not know a 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.639
 little could not say what is 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.199
 a little bit about this maybe I say 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.479
 maybe it's my imagination I have no idea 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.860
 but let's hope not and the 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.020
 they retain the first ones at least is what 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.520
 I hope it is not good people remember 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.289
 leave your law if you liked sharing it 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.699
 with your friends and well then remember 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.990
 it's very important that they tell me what 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.120
 they think about this not to the 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.289
 information that we already have date and 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.270
 well remember the season pass 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.400
 costs 4000 microsoft points 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.740
 and 800 pesos already then well then 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.580
 I hope you liked me here 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.580
 dismissal see you next
