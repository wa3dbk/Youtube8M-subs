it's<00:01:02.340> basically<00:01:02.789> behaving<00:01:03.149> itself<00:01:03.739> this<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it's basically behaving itself this is

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
it's basically behaving itself this is
what<00:01:05.280> yarn<00:01:05.729> should<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:08.990> this

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
what yarn should really look like this

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
what yarn should really look like this
is<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> ball<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.500> yarn<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.070> had<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
is a ball of yarn that's had a little

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
is a ball of yarn that's had a little
bit<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> use<00:01:11.909> there's<00:01:12.450> an<00:01:12.810> end<00:01:13.290> hanging<00:01:13.830> out

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
bit of use there's an end hanging out

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.670 
bit of use there's an end hanging out
one<00:01:14.280> side<00:01:14.640> there's<00:01:15.180> another<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.750> end<00:01:15.960> sort

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
one side there's another little end sort

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
one side there's another little end sort
of<00:01:16.740> attached<00:01:17.040> possibly<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> get

of attached possibly going to get

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
of attached possibly going to get
tangled<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.320> point<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.340> sleeve<00:01:20.759> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
tangled at some point the sleeve is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
tangled at some point the sleeve is
getting<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.720> loose<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:23.159> starting

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
getting a little loose and it's starting

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.260 
getting a little loose and it's starting
to<00:01:23.640> lose<00:01:23.909> its<00:01:24.210> structural<00:01:25.140> integrity<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:26.270> if

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
to lose its structural integrity but if

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.840 
to lose its structural integrity but if
I<00:01:27.689> put<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> shelf<00:01:28.619> it'll<00:01:29.579> still<00:01:29.820> stay

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I put it on a shelf it'll still stay

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.710 
I put it on a shelf it'll still stay
where<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
where I put it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
where I put it
I<00:01:30.869> might<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> tuck<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> few<00:01:32.369> ends<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I might have to tuck a few ends up to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.609 
I might have to tuck a few ends up to
make<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> look<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> little<00:01:33.659> neater<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.170> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
make it look a little neater but it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
make it look a little neater but it's
not<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.310> roll<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
not going to roll and it's not going to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.960 
not going to roll and it's not going to
fall<00:01:36.570> off<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.960> shelf<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> an

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
fall off the shelf so this is an

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.410 
fall off the shelf so this is an
acceptable<00:01:39.720> ball<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> yarn<00:01:42.710> but<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.420> well

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
acceptable ball of yarn but it's well

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.120 
acceptable ball of yarn but it's well
it's<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.049> edge<00:01:49.189> this

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
it's on the edge this

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.399 
it's on the edge this
that<00:01:51.700> acquittal<00:01:52.090> pile<00:01:52.300> of<00:01:52.510> string<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:52.960> what's

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
that acquittal pile of string is what's

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.140 
that acquittal pile of string is what's
left<00:01:53.800> over<00:01:53.979> after<00:01:54.159> you've<00:01:54.550> been<00:01:54.700> crocheting

it's<00:01:57.180> brown<00:01:58.180> but<00:01:58.810> that's<00:01:58.960> roughly<00:01:59.260> all<00:01:59.440> I<00:01:59.470> know

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
it's brown but that's roughly all I know

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's brown but that's roughly all I know
about<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.070> because<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:01.600> thing<00:02:01.870> its<00:02:02.200> wrapper
