the safest way to do that is through

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.999 
the safest way to do that is through
taking<00:00:30.360> a<00:00:30.720> free<00:00:31.020> flight<00:00:31.260> course<00:00:31.530> with<00:00:31.710> us<00:00:31.830> so

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.650 
clipper outside completely untethered
just<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.850> hell<00:00:44.970> of<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> because<00:00:45.540> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
just for the hell of it because you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.030 
just for the hell of it because you
think<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.140> likes<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.470> it's<00:00:46.590> gonna<00:00:46.830> come

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.869 
back that's not really the case
especially<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.350> don't<00:00:49.530> treat<00:00:49.800> teach<00:00:50.640> and
