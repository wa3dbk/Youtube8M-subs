00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
because we don't want our butter to burn
which<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.579> our<00:01:56.759> next<00:01:56.939> step<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.600> we're<00:01:57.689> just

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
which is our next step so we're just

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
which is our next step so we're just
going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> pop<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> butter<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:58.920> let<00:01:59.670> this

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
going to pop the butter in here let this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.880 
going to pop the butter in here let this
melt

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
melt

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.310 
melt
and<00:02:01.280> while<00:02:01.460> that's<00:02:01.640> melting<00:02:01.909> we<00:02:02.720> are<00:02:02.930> going<00:02:03.110> to

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
and while that's melting we are going to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.910 
and while that's melting we are going to
put<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.710> our<00:02:03.890> first<00:02:04.250> piece<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.880> bread<00:02:05.870> into<00:02:06.170> the

put in our first piece of bread into the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.710 
put in our first piece of bread into the
mixture<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:07.820> just<00:02:08.000> do<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> little<00:02:08.360> bit<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.509> this

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
mixture so just do a little bit of this

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.110 
mixture so just do a little bit of this
kind<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.110> mix<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.410> around<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.789> want<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.000> make

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
kind of mix it around you want to make

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.370 
kind of mix it around you want to make
sure<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.510> soaks<00:02:11.720> all<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.959> way<00:02:12.140> through

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
sure that it soaks all the way through

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.949 
sure that it soaks all the way through
to<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.560> other<00:02:12.590> side<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:14.390> don't<00:02:14.569> want<00:02:14.780> just

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
to the other side you don't want just

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.270 
to the other side you don't want just
dry<00:02:15.230> bread<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.740> middle<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.069> if<00:02:16.160> you're

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
dry bread in the middle and if you're

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.770 
dry bread in the middle and if you're
using<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.670> whole<00:02:16.850> wheat<00:02:17.030> bread<00:02:17.180> that's<00:02:17.420> really

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
using a whole wheat bread that's really

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.199 
using a whole wheat bread that's really
important<00:02:18.230> it's<00:02:18.320> much<00:02:18.590> more<00:02:18.800> dense<00:02:19.160> than<00:02:19.490> a

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
important it's much more dense than a

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.460 
important it's much more dense than a
white<00:02:20.480> bread<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.020> want<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.260> make<00:02:21.440> sure

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
white bread is you want to make sure

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.080 
white bread is you want to make sure
that<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.220> really<00:02:22.459> getting<00:02:22.700> all<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.000> way

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
that it's really getting all the way

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.020 
that it's really getting all the way
through<00:02:23.590> then<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.800> recommend<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:25.550> holding<00:02:25.970> it

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
through then I recommend just holding it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.740 
through then I recommend just holding it
up<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.780> any<00:02:26.959> excess<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:28.340> drip<00:02:28.640> off<00:02:28.850> let's

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
up so any excess can drip off let's

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.420 
up so any excess can drip off let's
check<00:02:29.989> out<00:02:30.110> how<00:02:30.230> we're<00:02:30.380> doing<00:02:30.440> over<00:02:30.739> here<00:02:31.040> give
