00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
removing exactly this basically I'm

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.399 
removing exactly this basically I'm
close<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:08.220> things<00:01:08.490> get<00:01:08.670> snagged<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.630> if

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
close when things get snagged up or if

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.440
