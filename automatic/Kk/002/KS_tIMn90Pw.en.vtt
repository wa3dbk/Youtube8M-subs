this time we're going to take a look at

this time we're going to take a look at
the<00:00:17.600> three<00:00:17.930> different<00:00:18.290> Titan<00:00:18.620> shushies<00:00:18.980> that

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
the three different Titan shushies that

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.310 
the three different Titan shushies that
you<00:00:19.310> can<00:00:19.490> use<00:00:19.700> in<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:19.940> game<00:00:20.270> my<00:00:20.840> personal

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
you can use in the game my personal

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.720 
you can use in the game my personal
favorite<00:00:21.500> is<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.950> Strider<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:22.580> that's

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
favorite is the Strider and that's

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.580 
favorite is the Strider and that's
because<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:23.180> like<00:00:23.390> maneuverability<00:00:24.320> whether

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
because I like maneuverability whether

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.800 
because I like maneuverability whether
it's<00:00:24.800> on<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.100> ground<00:00:25.130> as<00:00:25.580> a<00:00:25.640> pilot<00:00:25.970> or<00:00:26.300> as<00:00:26.780> a

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
it's on the ground as a pilot or as a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.840 
it's on the ground as a pilot or as a
Titan<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.860> Titan<00:00:28.250> with<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.670> most

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
Titan and the Titan with the most

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.030 
Titan and the Titan with the most
maneuverability<00:00:29.600> is<00:00:29.780> by<00:00:29.990> far<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:30.500> Strider

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
maneuverability is by far the Strider

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.619 
maneuverability is by far the Strider
and<00:00:31.340> that's<00:00:31.460> because<00:00:31.550> it<00:00:31.700> has<00:00:31.790> three<00:00:32.119> dash<00:00:32.360> cos

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
and that's because it has three dash cos

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.540 
and that's because it has three dash cos
and<00:00:33.140> once<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:33.530> unlock<00:00:33.800> your<00:00:33.859> special<00:00:34.399> ties

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
and once you unlock your special ties

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.849 
and once you unlock your special ties
mobility<00:00:35.059> you<00:00:35.420> have<00:00:35.570> infinite<00:00:36.170> dashes<00:00:36.589> it's

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
mobility you have infinite dashes it's

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.889 
mobility you have infinite dashes it's
pretty<00:00:37.129> cool<00:00:37.309> and<00:00:37.969> what<00:00:38.179> I<00:00:38.210> actually<00:00:38.480> like<00:00:38.780> to

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
pretty cool and what I actually like to

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.360 
pretty cool and what I actually like to
do<00:00:39.019> with<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.320> Strider<00:00:39.559> is<00:00:39.769> paired<00:00:40.070> up<00:00:40.219> with

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
do with the Strider is paired up with

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.340 
do with the Strider is paired up with
the<00:00:40.579> electric<00:00:41.359> smoke<00:00:41.600> ability<00:00:41.960> because<00:00:42.140> you

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
the electric smoke ability because you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.930 
the electric smoke ability because you
use<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.710> kind<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:42.949> fast-paced<00:00:43.309> movement<00:00:43.850> to

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
use the kind of fast-paced movement to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.610 
use the kind of fast-paced movement to
the<00:00:43.969> other<00:00:44.149> sort<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.329> dash<00:00:44.510> in<00:00:44.780> drop<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.320> smoke

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
the other sort of dash in drop the smoke

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.020 
the other sort of dash in drop the smoke
and<00:00:45.800> use<00:00:45.949> that<00:00:45.980> triple<00:00:46.519> dash<00:00:46.670> board<00:00:46.909> to<00:00:46.999> make

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
and use that triple dash board to make

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.459 
and use that triple dash board to make
sure<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.300> can<00:00:47.390> get<00:00:47.510> out<00:00:47.719> really<00:00:47.899> fast<00:00:48.109> as<00:00:48.320> well

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
sure you can get out really fast as well

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.899 
sure you can get out really fast as well
so<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:48.980> know<00:00:49.070> really<00:00:49.280> allows<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.699> kind<00:00:49.789> of

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
so you know really allows you to kind of

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.090 
so you know really allows you to kind of
mess<00:00:50.359> up<00:00:50.480> your<00:00:50.600> enemies<00:00:50.839> so<00:00:51.649> my<00:00:51.769> favorite

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
Tyson is actually the Atlas because you

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.329 
Tyson is actually the Atlas because you
know<00:00:54.109> you<00:00:54.170> may<00:00:54.379> have<00:00:54.499> real<00:00:54.710> experience<00:00:55.249> this

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
know you may have real experience this

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.069 
know you may have real experience this
in<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.640> beta<00:00:55.819> it's<00:00:56.420> kind<00:00:56.539> of<00:00:56.629> your<00:00:56.749> all<00:00:56.870> around

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
in the beta it's kind of your all around

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.360 
in the beta it's kind of your all around
Tyson<00:00:57.409> it's<00:00:57.499> got<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:57.769> know<00:00:57.800> relatively<00:00:58.190> good

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
Tyson it's got you know relatively good

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.399 
Tyson it's got you know relatively good
defense<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:58.850> maneuverability<00:00:59.839> and<00:01:00.050> it's

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
defense and maneuverability and it's

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.569 
defense and maneuverability and it's
just<00:01:00.530> sort<00:01:00.679> of<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.800> know<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.039> just<00:01:01.159> kind<00:01:01.489> of

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
just sort of you know it just kind of

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.669 
just sort of you know it just kind of
suits<00:01:01.999> multiple<00:01:02.809> different<00:01:02.899> situations<00:01:03.499> so

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
suits multiple different situations so

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.020 
suits multiple different situations so
you<00:01:03.739> know<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:03.949> find<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.489> one<00:01:04.610> works<00:01:04.790> really

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
you know I find that one works really

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.240 
you know I find that one works really
well<00:01:05.120> for<00:01:05.239> me<00:01:05.450> I've<00:01:05.660> got<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.500> be<00:01:06.590> honest<00:01:06.890> whilst

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
well for me I've got to be honest whilst

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.160 
well for me I've got to be honest whilst
I<00:01:07.400> do<00:01:07.460> like<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.060> Strider<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.870> my

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
I do like the Strider and it is my

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.080 
I do like the Strider and it is my
favorite<00:01:09.590> Titan<00:01:09.980> I<00:01:10.190> would<00:01:10.670> have<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.970> agree

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
favorite Titan I would have to agree

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.330 
favorite Titan I would have to agree
that<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.570> Atlas<00:01:11.930> is<00:01:12.080> probably<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.160> most

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
that the Atlas is probably the most

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.850 
that the Atlas is probably the most
versatile<00:01:13.850> Titan<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.080> best<00:01:15.320> if<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.770> want

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
versatile Titan and the best if you want

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.590 
versatile Titan and the best if you want
to<00:01:16.010> just<00:01:16.190> get<00:01:16.340> good<00:01:16.550> scores<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.150> keep<00:01:17.450> it

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
to just get good scores and keep it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.930 
to just get good scores and keep it
simple<00:01:17.960> on<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.130> other<00:01:19.220> hand<00:01:19.340> we<00:01:19.730> have<00:01:19.760> the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
simple on the other hand we have the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.600 
simple on the other hand we have the
ogre<00:01:20.450> which<00:01:20.630> for<00:01:20.870> me<00:01:21.080> is<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.380> Titan<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.340> quite

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
ogre which for me is a Titan it's quite

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.000 
ogre which for me is a Titan it's quite
difficult<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.090> use<00:01:23.330> its<00:01:23.540> lumbering<00:01:23.960> it's<00:01:24.410> slow

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
difficult to use its lumbering it's slow

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.850 
difficult to use its lumbering it's slow
but<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.640> does<00:01:25.790> have<00:01:26.030> very<00:01:26.300> high<00:01:26.390> defense<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
but it does have very high defense the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.020 
but it does have very high defense the
thing<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.100> like<00:01:28.250> about<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:28.580> one<00:01:28.760> though<00:01:28.880> is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
thing I like about that one though is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.640 
thing I like about that one though is
that<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.330> way<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.660> use<00:01:29.960> my<00:01:30.140> Titans<00:01:30.500> I

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
that the way that I use my Titans I

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.110 
that the way that I use my Titans I
don't<00:01:30.830> actually<00:01:31.040> pile<00:01:31.490> up<00:01:31.610> my<00:01:31.700> Tyson<00:01:32.030> that

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
don't actually pile up my Tyson that

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.940 
don't actually pile up my Tyson that
often<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:32.540> tend<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:33.110> use<00:01:33.200> my<00:01:33.410> sniper<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:33.830> stay

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
often I tend to use my sniper and stay

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.320 
often I tend to use my sniper and stay
on<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.130> roof<00:01:34.310> while<00:01:34.550> I<00:01:34.580> use<00:01:34.820> my<00:01:34.970> tightening

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
on the roof while I use my tightening

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.090 
on the roof while I use my tightening
autopilot<00:01:35.810> mode<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.620> thing<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:36.890> do<00:01:36.950> like

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
autopilot mode so the thing I do like

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.010 
autopilot mode so the thing I do like
about<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.550> ogre<00:01:37.790> is<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.030> can<00:01:38.270> deploy<00:01:38.870> it

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
about the ogre is that I can deploy it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.750 
about the ogre is that I can deploy it
and<00:01:39.200> they<00:01:39.380> set<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.770> follow<00:01:39.980> mode<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:40.520> can

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
and they set it to follow mode and I can

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.070 
and they set it to follow mode and I can
normally<00:01:41.270> rely<00:01:41.510> on<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.690> fact<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:41.870> it<00:01:41.990> will

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
normally rely on the fact that it will

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.930 
normally rely on the fact that it will
stay<00:01:42.230> alive<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.470> bit<00:01:42.650> longer<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.430> if<00:01:43.730> I'm

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
stay alive a bit longer so if I'm

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.580 
stay alive a bit longer so if I'm
planning<00:01:44.270> on<00:01:44.330> playing<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.660> that<00:01:45.170> way<00:01:45.290> then<00:01:45.530> I

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
planning on playing that that way then I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.260 
planning on playing that that way then I
tend<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.860> Saul<00:01:46.070> pair<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.400> up<00:01:46.460> with<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.150> right

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
tend to Saul pair it up with the right

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.400 
tend to Saul pair it up with the right
weapons<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.810> then<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:47.990> can<00:01:48.110> just<00:01:48.140> kind<00:01:48.380> of

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
weapons and then I can just kind of

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.630 
weapons and then I can just kind of
leave<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.830> its<00:01:48.950> own<00:01:49.040> thing<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.490> i<00:01:49.520> think

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
leave it to do its own thing so i think

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.820 
leave it to do its own thing so i think
the<00:01:50.000> ogre<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.390> great<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:51.320> light<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:51.740> if

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
the ogre is great in that light but if

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.960 
the ogre is great in that light but if
you<00:01:51.920> want<00:01:52.040> to<00:01:52.070> pilot<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.430> yourself<00:01:52.790> here<00:01:52.940> i

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
you want to pilot it yourself here i

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.430 
you want to pilot it yourself here i
definitely<00:01:53.360> agree<00:01:53.420> either<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.930> Atlas<00:01:54.200> or<00:01:54.350> the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
definitely agree either the Atlas or the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.980 
definitely agree either the Atlas or the
Strider<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.950> do<00:01:55.580> agree<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.210> love<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.630> be<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.750> pilot

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
Strider I do agree I love to be a pilot

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.840 
Strider I do agree I love to be a pilot
