fair warning to get this out of the way

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.800 
fair warning to get this out of the way
this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.950> purely<00:00:17.250> speculation<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.360> this<00:00:18.390> point

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
this is purely speculation at this point

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.589 
this is purely speculation at this point
in<00:00:19.230> time<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:20.040> with<00:00:20.490> my<00:00:20.700> strong<00:00:21.029> hunch<00:00:21.300> and

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
in time but with my strong hunch and

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.810 
in time but with my strong hunch and
this<00:00:21.960> research<00:00:22.200> so<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.920> done<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.400> if

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
this research so that I have done and if

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.939 
this research so that I have done and if
history<00:00:24.029> would<00:00:24.480> repeat<00:00:24.539> itself<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.529> may<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.710> on

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
history would repeat itself we may be on

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.380 
history would repeat itself we may be on
to<00:00:26.070> something<00:00:26.100> that<00:00:26.400> may<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.640> highly<00:00:27.119> likely

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
to something that may be highly likely

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.689 
to something that may be highly likely
and<00:00:27.750> very<00:00:28.199> plausible<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.430> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and very plausible and that is the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.450 
and very plausible and that is the
addition<00:00:30.270> of<00:00:30.390> two<00:00:30.480> new<00:00:31.140> vehicles<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.010> Halo

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
the watcher and everybody went crazy
like<00:01:48.659> what's<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.650> these<00:01:49.770> new

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
like what's going on what are these new

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.920 
like what's going on what are these new
enemies<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.060> added<00:01:51.390> into<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.659> new

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
enemies going to be added into a new

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.990 
enemies going to be added into a new
halo<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.560> sure<00:01:53.040> enough<00:01:53.070> those<00:01:53.490> two<00:01:53.759> turned

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
halo and sure enough those two turned

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
halo and sure enough those two turned
out<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.299> true<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.869> met<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> watcher<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
out to be true we met to the watcher the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.980 
out to be true we met to the watcher the
crawler<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.640> Promethean<00:01:57.240> nights<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
crawler the Promethean nights into the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.289 
crawler the Promethean nights into the
halo<00:01:58.259> 4<00:01:58.619> game<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.850> if<00:01:59.970> history<00:02:00.270> will

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
halo 4 game and so if history will

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.120 
halo 4 game and so if history will
repeat<00:02:00.570> itself<00:02:00.720> this<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.619> very<00:02:01.710> likely

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
repeat itself this could be very likely

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
repeat itself this could be very likely
that<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.520> could<00:02:02.759> see<00:02:03.030> these<00:02:03.210> two<00:02:03.509> new<00:02:03.720> vehicles

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that we could see these two new vehicles

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
that we could see these two new vehicles
a<00:02:04.380> siege<00:02:04.680> bike<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.610> light<00:02:05.880> assault<00:02:06.299> VTOL

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a siege bike or the light assault VTOL

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.340 
a siege bike or the light assault VTOL
and<00:02:07.049> from<00:02:07.890> looking<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.310> mega<00:02:08.640> bloks<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
and from looking at mega bloks is a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.470 
and from looking at mega bloks is a
inventory<00:02:10.350> they<00:02:10.860> don't<00:02:11.130> stray<00:02:11.519> away<00:02:11.670> too<00:02:11.820> far

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
inventory they don't stray away too far

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.810 
inventory they don't stray away too far
or<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> doll<00:02:13.170> from<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> Halo<00:02:14.040> universe<00:02:14.070> they

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
or a doll from the Halo universe they

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.180 
or a doll from the Halo universe they
follow<00:02:15.209> things<00:02:15.540> almost<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> teeth<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
follow things almost to the teeth here I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.800 
follow things almost to the teeth here I
looked<00:02:17.550> at<00:02:17.670> what<00:02:17.819> their<00:02:17.970> collection<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.569> just

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
looked at what their collection is just

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.510 
looked at what their collection is just
to<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.080> if<00:02:19.200> they<00:02:19.319> make<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.770> vehicles<00:02:20.280> or<00:02:20.430> they

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
to see if they make up vehicles or they

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.950 
to see if they make up vehicles or they
make<00:02:20.730> stuff<00:02:21.060> up<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.480> they

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
make stuff up and they

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.840 
make stuff up and they
have<00:02:22.050> nothing<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.620> regards<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.430> something

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
have nothing in regards to something

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.700 
have nothing in regards to something
they<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.120> created<00:02:24.630> they<00:02:24.930> cover<00:02:25.200> vehicles

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
they have created they cover vehicles

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.700 
they have created they cover vehicles
from<00:02:25.950> Halo<00:02:26.610> Wars<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.210> such<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> UNSC<00:02:28.320> Rhino

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
from Halo Wars so such as the UNSC Rhino

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.370 
from Halo Wars so such as the UNSC Rhino
tank<00:02:29.220> which<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.610> only<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.330> know<00:02:30.420> seen<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.990> Halo

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
tank which is only you know seen in Halo

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.710 
tank which is only you know seen in Halo
Wars<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:32.280> also<00:02:32.580> seems<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> other<00:02:33.150> vehicles<00:02:33.600> and

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
Wars it also seems to other vehicles and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.140 
Wars it also seems to other vehicles and
reach<00:02:33.990> all<00:02:34.350> across<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.220> Halo<00:02:35.520> franchise<00:02:35.700> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
reach all across the Halo franchise so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.300 
reach all across the Halo franchise so
they're<00:02:36.300> not<00:02:36.450> just<00:02:36.630> making<00:02:37.020> stuff<00:02:37.320> up<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.920> this

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
they're not just making stuff up so this

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.310 
they're not just making stuff up so this
could<00:02:38.520> potentially<00:02:38.670> lead<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.510> me<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.140> believe

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
could potentially lead on me to believe

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.890 
could potentially lead on me to believe
that<00:02:40.440> these<00:02:40.800> vehicles<00:02:41.160> are<00:02:41.430> yet<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.150> come<00:02:42.420> like

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
that these vehicles are yet to come like

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.360 
that these vehicles are yet to come like
how<00:02:43.020> we<00:02:43.080> saw<00:02:43.320> from<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> toilet<00:02:43.860> from

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
how we saw from the toilet from

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.950 
how we saw from the toilet from
mcfarlane<00:02:44.910> toys<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.330> those<00:02:45.570> were<00:02:45.750> enemies

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
mcfarlane toys that those were enemies

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.770 
mcfarlane toys that those were enemies
yet<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.680> come<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> halo<00:02:47.610> game<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.420> my

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
yet to come to a halo game so my

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.270 
yet to come to a halo game so my
question<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.290> when<00:02:49.710> are<00:02:49.830> these<00:02:49.950> vehicles

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
question is when are these vehicles

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.190 
question is when are these vehicles
going<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:50.880> here<00:02:50.910> now<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.660> lot<00:02:51.990> of<00:02:52.020> people

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
going on up here now a lot of people

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.830 
going on up here now a lot of people
speculated<00:02:53.040> maybe<00:02:53.430> Spartan<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.210> season<00:02:54.660> two

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
speculated maybe Spartan up season two

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
speculated maybe Spartan up season two
because<00:02:55.200> there's<00:02:55.350> no<00:02:55.470> confirmation<00:02:55.920> date<00:02:56.400> on

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
because there's no confirmation date on

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.330 
because there's no confirmation date on
when<00:02:57.300> halo<00:02:57.660> 5<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.260> going<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.680> be<00:02:58.800> released<00:02:59.160> we

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
when halo 5 is going to be released we

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.740 
when halo 5 is going to be released we
don't<00:02:59.520> know<00:02:59.640> if<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.940> going<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.210> be<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.720> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
don't know if it's going to be on to a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.050 
don't know if it's going to be on to a
yearly<00:03:01.230> release<00:03:01.590> pattern<00:03:02.100> or<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.760> we're<00:03:02.970> going

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
yearly release pattern or if we're going

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.330 
yearly release pattern or if we're going
to<00:03:03.180> wait<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> few<00:03:03.840> years<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:04.860> we're<00:03:05.250> gonna

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
to wait a few years so if we're gonna

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.130 
to wait a few years so if we're gonna
have<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.580> wait<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> few<00:03:06.180> years<00:03:06.420> then<00:03:06.660> maybe

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
have to wait a few years then maybe

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.340 
have to wait a few years then maybe
we'll<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.770> Spartan<00:03:08.370> up<00:03:08.430> season<00:03:08.820> two<00:03:09.030> as<00:03:09.350> DLC

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
we'll see a Spartan up season two as DLC

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.620 
we'll see a Spartan up season two as DLC
now<00:03:10.770> we<00:03:10.830> do<00:03:11.250> not<00:03:11.400> know<00:03:11.640> right<00:03:11.670> now<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> Spartan

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
now we do not know right now a Spartan

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.990 
now we do not know right now a Spartan
up<00:03:12.720> season<00:03:13.140> 2<00:03:13.320> will<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.680> DLC<00:03:14.220> or<00:03:14.400> maybe

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
up season 2 will be DLC or maybe

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.270 
up season 2 will be DLC or maybe
included<00:03:15.600> with<00:03:15.780> halo<00:03:16.140> 5<00:03:16.410> like<00:03:16.650> they<00:03:16.800> included

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
included with halo 5 like they included

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.450 
included with halo 5 like they included
season<00:03:17.460> one<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.330> Halo<00:03:18.720> 4<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:20.130> were<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
season one with Halo 4 so if it were to

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.060 
season one with Halo 4 so if it were to
be<00:03:20.490> a<00:03:20.750> DLC<00:03:21.750> content<00:03:21.990> for<00:03:22.380> season<00:03:22.680> two<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
be a DLC content for season two and

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.950 
be a DLC content for season two and
maybe<00:03:23.430> likely<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.120> these<00:03:24.300> vehicles<00:03:24.570> could

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
the vehicles so they have descriptions

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.960 
the vehicles so they have descriptions
that<00:03:34.320> did<00:03:34.530> follow<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.040> images<00:03:35.400> now<00:03:35.580> for<00:03:35.820> the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.210 
that did follow the images now for the
siege<00:03:36.210> but<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:37.020> described<00:03:37.560> as<00:03:37.740> only

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
siege but it is described as only

brood chopper is none other than the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.340 
brood chopper is none other than the
UNSC<00:03:44.820> siege<00:03:45.090> bike<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.540> obviously<00:03:45.990> this

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
UNSC siege bike so obviously this

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.170 
UNSC siege bike so obviously this
vehicle<00:03:46.740> has<00:03:46.800> been<00:03:46.950> built<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.370> counter<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
ghost and the brute chopper so maybe

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.770 
ghost and the brute chopper so maybe
we'll<00:03:50.220> see<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> brute<00:03:50.670> chopper<00:03:50.910> return<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.690> a

we'll see a brute chopper return in a

come<00:06:58.310> up<00:06:58.400> with<00:06:58.490> something<00:06:58.790> out<00:06:58.940> of<00:06:58.970> the<00:06:59.150> blue

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
come up with something out of the blue

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.090 
come up with something out of the blue
it<00:06:59.630> seems<00:07:00.020> very<00:07:00.110> unlikely<00:07:00.470> that<00:07:00.770> they<00:07:00.980> would

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
it seems very unlikely that they would

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.950 
it seems very unlikely that they would
do<00:07:01.310> this<00:07:01.550> without<00:07:02.000> having<00:07:02.450> those<00:07:02.600> vehicles

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
do this without having those vehicles

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.440 
do this without having those vehicles
somehow<00:07:03.560> appear<00:07:04.070> in<00:07:04.250> a<00:07:04.430> halo<00:07:04.730> franchise<00:07:04.970> in

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
somehow appear in a halo franchise in

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.080 
somehow appear in a halo franchise in
some<00:07:05.690> way<00:07:05.870> or<00:07:06.020> some<00:07:06.260> form<00:07:06.560> so<00:07:06.980> these<00:07:07.400> toys<00:07:07.730> do

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090 
some way or some form so these toys do

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.930 
some way or some form so these toys do
have<00:07:08.420> a<00:07:08.720> set<00:07:09.140> fall<00:07:09.470> release<00:07:09.770> so<00:07:10.190> maybe<00:07:10.460> they

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
have a set fall release so maybe they

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.880 
have a set fall release so maybe they
could<00:07:11.240> be<00:07:11.390> an<00:07:11.510> indicator<00:07:12.020> that<00:07:12.320> we<00:07:12.590> may<00:07:12.830> be

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:12.890 
could be an indicator that we may be

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.160 
could be an indicator that we may be
seen<00:07:13.250> Spartan<00:07:13.790> Ops<00:07:13.880> season<00:07:14.510> 2<00:07:14.750> released

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
sometime in the fall so maybe these

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.330 
sometime in the fall so maybe these
vehicles<00:07:17.180> could<00:07:17.450> be<00:07:17.570> DLC<00:07:18.080> or<00:07:18.230> who<00:07:18.890> knows<00:07:19.100> maybe

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
vehicles could be DLC or who knows maybe

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.280 
vehicles could be DLC or who knows maybe
they<00:07:19.550> may<00:07:19.700> not<00:07:19.850> even<00:07:19.910> appear<00:07:20.240> at<00:07:20.660> all<00:07:20.870> and<00:07:21.140> now
