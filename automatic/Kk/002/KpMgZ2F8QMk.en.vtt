00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.510 
many problems happened so far we've had
a<00:00:42.239> couple<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.719> brief<00:00:43.649> power<00:00:43.920> shortages<00:00:44.460> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
a couple like brief power shortages that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.160 
a couple like brief power shortages that
that<00:00:45.090> cut<00:00:45.270> off<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> lights<00:00:45.660> once<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.079> twice

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that cut off the lights once or twice

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.950 
that cut off the lights once or twice
but<00:00:46.969> outside<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.780> been

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
but outside of that it's actually been

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290 
but outside of that it's actually been
going<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.559> smoothly<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.670> don't<00:00:51.090> have

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
going really smoothly so I don't have

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
going really smoothly so I don't have
very<00:00:51.480> many<00:00:51.629> complaints<00:00:52.110> from<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
very many complaints from like the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.639 
very many complaints from like the
technical<00:00:53.760> standpoint<00:00:54.410> what<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.530> guys

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
technical standpoint what have you guys

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
technical standpoint what have you guys
learned<00:00:55.890> thus<00:00:56.399> far<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> first<00:00:57.660> finals

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
learned thus far from the first finals

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
learned thus far from the first finals
because<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> scale<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
because I know the just the scale and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.709 
because I know the just the scale and
everything<00:01:00.899> has<00:01:00.989> been<00:01:01.109> quite<00:01:01.440> different

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
everything has been quite different

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.620 
everything has been quite different
definitely<00:01:03.860> more<00:01:04.860> preparation<00:01:05.189> um<00:01:05.700> for

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
definitely more preparation um for

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.510 
definitely more preparation um for
season<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.890> into<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> convention

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
season one we got into the convention

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.850 
season one we got into the convention
center<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.939> day<00:01:09.060> before<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> event<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.860> try

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
center one day before the event and try

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.929 
center one day before the event and try
to<00:01:10.920> set<00:01:11.130> everything<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:11.700> obviously

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to set everything up which obviously

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.179 
to set everything up which obviously
didn't<00:01:12.270> work<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:12.600> well<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.860> we've<00:01:14.040> been

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
didn't work out very well so we've been

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.640 
didn't work out very well so we've been
here<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.640> almost<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.390> whole<00:01:15.420> week<00:01:15.689> doing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
here for almost the whole week doing

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.960 
here for almost the whole week doing
setup<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.549> think<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
setup so that's I think that's the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.710 
setup so that's I think that's the
biggest<00:01:18.330> thing<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.040> setup<00:01:20.310> time<00:01:20.720> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
biggest thing is just the setup time and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.230 
biggest thing is just the setup time and
obviously<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.759> things<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.000> went

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
obviously a lot of the things that went

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.810 
obviously a lot of the things that went
wrong<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.750> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.020> figured<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.700> know

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
wrong we kind of figured out you know

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.130 
wrong we kind of figured out you know
some<00:01:27.030> problems<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.600> always<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.020> you're

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
some problems because always when you're

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.210 
some problems because always when you're
hosting<00:01:28.259> an<00:01:28.530> event<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.860> there's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
hosting an event like this there's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
hosting an event like this there's
things<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> come<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.570> don't

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
things that come up that you just don't

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.840 
things that come up that you just don't
expect<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.130> season<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.640> gave

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
expect and so you know season one gave

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
expect and so you know season one gave
us<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.390> good<00:01:33.600> trial<00:01:33.869> run<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
us a really good trial run to see you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.140 
us a really good trial run to see you
know<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:35.100> works<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:35.490> doesn't<00:01:35.549> work<00:01:35.880> what

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
know what works what doesn't work what

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.840 
know what works what doesn't work what
are<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> potential<00:01:36.630> problems<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.290> then<00:01:37.380> we

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
are the potential problems and then we

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.280 
are the potential problems and then we
you<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:38.970> made<00:01:39.150> sure<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.540> did<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.259> we

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you know made sure that we did what we

think<00:04:58.700> a<00:04:58.910> lot<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.300> is<00:04:59.360> obviously<00:04:59.660> due<00:04:59.900> to

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
think a lot of it is obviously due to

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.980 
think a lot of it is obviously due to
the<00:05:01.010> like<00:05:01.580> massive<00:05:02.150> amount<00:05:02.420> of<00:05:02.480> hype<00:05:02.660> we<00:05:02.810> had

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
the like massive amount of hype we had

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.320 
the like massive amount of hype we had
starting<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:03.650> season<00:05:03.920> one<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.220> kind<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.460> you

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
starting in season one it kind of you

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.840 
starting in season one it kind of you
know<00:05:05.390> obviously<00:05:05.920> this<00:05:06.920> hype<00:05:07.160> train<00:05:07.400> built<00:05:07.670> up

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
know obviously this hype train built up

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.520 
know obviously this hype train built up
and<00:05:08.090> then<00:05:08.240> you<00:05:08.510> know<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.630> lot<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.840> people<00:05:08.930> feel

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
and then you know a lot of people feel

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.140 
and then you know a lot of people feel
as<00:05:09.770> if<00:05:09.800> we<00:05:10.100> fail<00:05:10.280> to<00:05:10.460> deliver<00:05:10.580> on<00:05:10.850> that<00:05:10.880> pipe

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
as if we fail to deliver on that pipe

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150 
as if we fail to deliver on that pipe
and<00:05:11.360> then<00:05:11.450> so<00:05:11.630> kind<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:11.990> like<00:05:12.200> that<00:05:12.710> left<00:05:12.950> a<00:05:13.040> bad

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
and then so kind of like that left a bad

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.710 
and then so kind of like that left a bad
taste<00:05:13.190> in<00:05:13.490> people's<00:05:13.550> mouths<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.150> now<00:05:14.270> so<00:05:14.540> it's

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
taste in people's mouths and now so it's

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.659 
taste in people's mouths and now so it's
everything<00:05:15.590> successive<00:05:16.100> that<00:05:16.220> we've<00:05:16.340> done<00:05:16.520> is

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
everything successive that we've done is

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.159 
everything successive that we've done is
you<00:05:16.880> know<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.000> lot<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.270> people<00:05:17.390> still<00:05:17.870> are<00:05:18.020> just

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
you know a lot of people still are just

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.750 
you know a lot of people still are just
kind<00:05:18.290> of<00:05:18.380> like<00:05:18.560> waiting<00:05:19.130> for<00:05:19.160> any<00:05:19.340> sort<00:05:19.669> of

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
fail I don't necessarily think it's

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.380

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
feel very confident in their ability to

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.020 
feel very confident in their ability to
you<00:06:32.140> know<00:06:32.170> create<00:06:32.500> the<00:06:32.740> product<00:06:32.950> in<00:06:33.280> much

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
you know create the product in much

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.210 
you know create the product in much
faster<00:06:34.210> period<00:06:34.600> of<00:06:34.690> time<00:06:34.810> so<00:06:35.530> you<00:06:35.950> know<00:06:36.040> the

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
faster period of time so you know the

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.820 
faster period of time so you know the
biggest<00:06:36.880> change<00:06:37.120> I<00:06:37.330> think<00:06:37.390> is<00:06:37.660> going<00:06:37.930> to<00:06:38.050> as

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
biggest change I think is going to as

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.880 
biggest change I think is going to as
live<00:06:39.730> as<00:06:39.970> possible<00:06:40.450> so<00:06:41.140> I<00:06:41.170> think<00:06:41.260> that<00:06:41.440> you<00:06:41.770> can

live as possible so I think that you can

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.410 
live as possible so I think that you can
expect<00:06:42.250> that<00:06:43.000> what's<00:06:43.960> your<00:06:44.170> finals<00:06:44.560> pick<00:06:45.420> for
