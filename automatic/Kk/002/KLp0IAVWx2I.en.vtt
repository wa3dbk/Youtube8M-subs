00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 dear friends we will talk today in 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.819
 next on the same which was provided 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.340
 for the review of the Novosibirsk store residents 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.190
 legs will be a knife from the company cold steel 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.040
 such a butt knife on where it is 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.830
 called from the classic series for the kitchen 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.779
 on so let's say here is the actual graph so he 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.580
 glittered this deal comes that is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.130
 actually a set of such knives right 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.750
 huge here but in this case we have 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.090
 deal with the version that comes as 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.099
 one knife although you can certainly buy and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.050
 whole set if it will be you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 interesting to see what implies 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.570
 cold steel company under butt knife 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.850
 for the kitchen we start with the fact that this knife 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.079
 made so that's specific purchases 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.640
 caress made for. so let's say on 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.950
 because usually from the third to the same 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.430
 suggest such pretty long 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.500
 his wavelike we say so 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.270
 the teeth on the knife canvas has already gone 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.260
 naturally in this way 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.390
 take advantage of their 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.510
 earlier work done here 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.790
 such a classic one serrated blade 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.500
 which usually Klovsky use 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.119
 them peculiar form that's to help that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.060
 she looks like this 3 cloves then 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.640
 failure is exactly cold steel to do 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.680
 such saltpeters and here actually 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.350
 saying here they are so clever too 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.930
 use cases in taiwan made 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.479
 knife understandable 3 companies coles and so 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 Here is the kitchen series write off 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.509
 who will come on the very knives 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.900
 Some 400 series as written here 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.979
 high carbon steel here 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.479
 used that is set for 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.170
 kitchen knife quite ordinary 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.880
 it is clear that 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.130
 cold steel generally came to this case 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.560
 so that the knives are enough 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.509
 inexpensive understand that with 3 bloom on 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.270
 Blade ear overlays also not nasazhat 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.710
 Here one must be in general that, in principle, 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.210
 they have knives and a hall h 8 them 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.340
 traditional how to say so here 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.390
 have become used another cheaper 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.820
 somewhat answer such a very 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.830
 noticeable side on the side of the surreytor 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.960
 a knife pours like this 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.759
 whether grass series have already cut out essentially 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.560
 hardened steel this follows exactly 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.630
 heat treatment as it were so 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.009
 but personally it seems to me at least 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.269
 maybe somebody corrected me 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.440
 At least it does not wipe 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.239
 really the impression is that 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.890
 just when working hard enough 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.569
 heats up the blade here but actually 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.580
 again press the kitchen enough 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.250
 here is the thickness of the butt here 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.790
 I think millimeter and a half than that 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.680
 maximum as was rather pleasant 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.489
 feature is the handle of this knife 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.200
 here she is 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.720
 3d has such a form a little bit 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.580
 protrusions in the center reminds me of this 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.620
 all about 40 honestly speaking 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.450
 call profile hands yo she is certainly less 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.390
 but nevertheless here there is also a similar 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.640
 the solution used the entire handle 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.440
 made of croton as here is enough 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.750
 often happens on a knife made in japan 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.810
 here the knife is made thailand me too 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.519
 craton and very naturally it's nice 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.200
 such material I love him very much and 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.150
 cold steel knives and knives juice me 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.420
 personally really like some sitting in 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.670
 arm and how it fits to your arm 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.190
 it seems to be simple in appearance but very 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.900
 comfortable handle that is generally well here 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.070
 such an interesting piece of pushover knife 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.720
 it is generally such a highly specialized 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.880
 the device it is intended for 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.269
 so that when eating cut pieces 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.430
 meat under whole pieces 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.640
 But I must say that in principle 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.200
 In principle, this knife is quite convenient 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.620
 can be used as 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.870
 well let's say a knife for infidelity vegetables 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.849
 probably so here you can say the walls 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.550
 just not a lot of course that I eat 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.830
 vegetables will be somewhat difficult 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.379
 lead him to such a serrated bore but 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.849
 This can perfectly cut bread but here 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.730
 But as if to understand that there is some 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.709
 lack of blade length this knife 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.390
 great cut vegetables including 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.280
 tomatoes and it turns out exactly 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.549
 neatly despite such a sereu 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.110
 There is generally in principle I remember that 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.940
 to my mind 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.280
 the creator of the community rune finale to the house 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.930
 lacquer talked about what he had in 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.910
 collections pretty many cool knives 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.040
 skills he and his wife use them here 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.130
 exactly serial knives as a kitchen 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.380
 cove and in general it is comparable to so 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.000
 called self-sharpening on 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.980
 kitchen knives there tramontina such 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.690
 produced in particular or by knives from 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.639
 laser sharpened from that crayon shallow 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.079
 series then did press sharpen almost 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.080
 never need they cuts enough 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.380
 comfortable here about here such 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.260
 same thing and in general there let's say 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.910
 it is of course like a universal knife 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.410
 you use the impossible in principle 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.210
 such a pretty funny kitchen 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.520
 tool here but all the more so 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.919
 we produce so famous that the knife 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.780
 a brand that could be 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.070
 take advantage in your kitchen but apart 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.780
 In addition, our clear deal has 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.110
 extreme low weight 40 1 grams 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.720
 just such a cutting that even. well then 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.460
 I honestly say that I am very 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.070
 like the cardboard you and handles so 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.630
 let's say i would probably with great 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.220
 pleasure in the kitchen would work 5 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.990
 mitrius larger knives which 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.539
 the handle would be made of cardboard not from 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.770
 wood and plastic from which it used to be 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.350
 made kitchen knives 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.150
 Here is such a nice handsome from the company 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.370
 coles moaning that he was you too 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.880
 interesting thank you very much for watching 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.880
 until
