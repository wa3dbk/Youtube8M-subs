00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
see if we can get it to do it one more

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.580 
see if we can get it to do it one more
time<00:01:49.790> maybe<00:01:50.329> a<00:01:50.450> little<00:01:50.570> bit<00:01:50.750> more<00:01:50.930> sound<00:01:51.170> a

little<00:01:52.220> more<00:01:52.340> speed<00:01:52.610> yelling<00:01:53.060> should<00:01:53.930> kick<00:01:54.140> on

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
little more speed yelling should kick on

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:25.640 
little more speed yelling should kick on
a<00:01:54.350> little<00:01:54.619> faster
