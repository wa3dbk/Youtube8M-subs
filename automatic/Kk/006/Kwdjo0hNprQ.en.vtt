science<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.249> bio<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.879> had<00:01:00.510> never<00:01:00.629> taken<00:01:00.839> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
science and bio I had never taken a

science and bio I had never taken a
programming<00:01:01.829> course<00:01:01.980> before<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.870> that<00:01:03.870> sort

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
programming course before and that sort

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
programming course before and that sort
of<00:01:04.589> changed<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.610> outlook<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> was

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
of changed my outlook on what I was

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.470 
of changed my outlook on what I was
going<00:01:07.230> to<00:01:07.350> study<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.400> course<00:01:08.730> and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
going to study that one course and

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.840 
going to study that one course and
that's<00:01:09.810> why<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> ended<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.800> declaring<00:01:11.280> CS<00:01:11.640> bio

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that's why I ended up declaring CS bio

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.090 
that's why I ended up declaring CS bio
as<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.150> program<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.500> fields<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
as a program the fields of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730 
as a program the fields of
bioinformatics<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.270> computational<00:01:15.780> biology

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
bioinformatics and computational biology

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.520 
bioinformatics and computational biology
are<00:01:17.010> huge<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.150> only<00:01:19.020> getting<00:01:19.200> bigger<00:01:21.290> we<00:01:22.290> have

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
are huge and only getting bigger we have

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
are huge and only getting bigger we have
a<00:01:22.860> wonderful<00:01:23.370> program<00:01:23.550> in<00:01:23.970> Earth<00:01:24.300> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a wonderful program in Earth and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.380 
a wonderful program in Earth and
Planetary<00:01:24.510> Sciences<00:01:26.150> it's<00:01:27.150> mostly<00:01:27.900> geology

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.180 

another<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.960> great<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.410> is<00:01:34.650> atmospheric

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
another really great one is atmospheric

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.620 
another really great one is atmospheric
and<00:01:35.700> oceanic<00:01:35.730> sciences

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and oceanic sciences

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
and oceanic sciences
that's<00:01:36.930> essentially<00:01:37.620> studying<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> climate

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that's essentially studying the climate

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
that's essentially studying the climate
and<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.120> meteorology<00:01:39.870> is<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> big<00:01:40.290> part<00:01:40.620> of<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and so meteorology is a big part of it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.310 
and so meteorology is a big part of it
both<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> those<00:01:41.910> programs<00:01:42.390> are<00:01:42.570> quite<00:01:42.840> small

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
both of those programs are quite small

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.620 
both of those programs are quite small
and<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> classes<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.580> small<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and so the classes are small which is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.000 
and so the classes are small which is
something<00:01:46.050> students<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.920> appreciate

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
something students really appreciate

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.980 
something students really appreciate
they<00:01:47.550> get<00:01:47.730> to<00:01:47.880> know<00:01:48.030> their<00:01:48.240> fellow<00:01:48.390> students

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
they get to know their fellow students

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.180 
they get to know their fellow students
they<00:01:49.080> get<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.320> know<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.500> professors<00:01:49.980> on<00:01:50.160> a

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
they get to know the professors on a

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.190 
they get to know the professors on a
first-name<00:01:50.670> basis<00:01:51.150> it's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.810> really

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
first-name basis it's a really

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.380 
first-name basis it's a really
comfortable<00:01:53.100> setting<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.700> there's<00:01:54.240> some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
comfortable setting and there's some

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780 
comfortable setting and there's some
remarkable<00:01:54.900> research<00:01:55.230> going<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.710> there

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
remarkable research going on there

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.530 
remarkable research going on there

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
are about their research a huge number

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.350 
are about their research a huge number
of<00:02:09.649> our<00:02:09.800> students<00:02:10.220> their<00:02:10.520> work<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:10.940> published

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
of our students their work is published

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.690 
of our students their work is published
in<00:02:11.569> scientific<00:02:12.140> journals<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:13.250> they're<00:02:13.430> part

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
in scientific journals so they're part

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.490 
in scientific journals so they're part

McGill<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.519> is<00:02:16.700> not<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.360> an<00:02:17.540> experience

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
McGill this is not just an experience

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.000 
McGill this is not just an experience
it's<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.700> real<00:02:19.910> thing

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
it's the real thing

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.470 
it's the real thing
very<00:02:22.010> often<00:02:22.370> students<00:02:22.760> will<00:02:22.849> spend<00:02:23.090> two<00:02:23.450> or

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
very often students will spend two or

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.839 
very often students will spend two or
three<00:02:23.890> summers<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.099> working<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.550> different

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
three summers and working in different

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.250 
three summers and working in different
labs<00:02:26.030> within<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.810> chemistry<00:02:27.230> department

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
labs within the chemistry department

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.250 
labs within the chemistry department
before<00:02:28.250> they<00:02:28.640> decide<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:29.540> path<00:02:29.840> they<00:02:30.049> take

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
before they decide what path they take

before they decide what path they take
after<00:02:30.500> their<00:02:30.799> their<00:02:31.010> degree<00:02:32.739> this<00:02:33.739> summer<00:02:34.010> I

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
after their their degree this summer I

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.860 
after their their degree this summer I
will<00:02:34.430> definitely<00:02:34.850> be<00:02:34.910> doing<00:02:35.030> research<00:02:35.510> in

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
will definitely be doing research in

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.949 
will definitely be doing research in
some<00:02:36.319> computer<00:02:36.860> science<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.489> biology

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
some computer science and biology

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.150 
some computer science and biology
laboratory<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.170> feel<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:39.799> if<00:02:39.950> there's

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
laboratory I feel like if there's

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.580 
laboratory I feel like if there's
anything<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.700> McGill<00:02:41.540> does<00:02:41.780> very<00:02:42.049> well<00:02:42.260> it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
anything that McGill does very well it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.830 
anything that McGill does very well it
is<00:02:42.860> getting<00:02:43.819> its<00:02:44.000> undergraduates<00:02:44.360> involved

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
is getting its undergraduates involved

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.259 
is getting its undergraduates involved
in<00:02:45.049> research<00:02:45.489> there<00:02:46.489> are<00:02:46.610> just<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.850> million<00:02:47.180> in

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
in research there are just a million in

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.470 
in research there are just a million in
one<00:02:47.420> different<00:02:47.989> ways<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.709> opportunities<00:02:49.480> to

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
one different ways and opportunities to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.990 
one different ways and opportunities to
end<00:02:50.750> up<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.140> laboratory<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.160> great

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.039 

every<00:02:56.000> student<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.450> going<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.810> an

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
every student is going to have an

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.110 
every student is going to have an
advisor<00:02:57.349> from<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.099> Faculty<00:02:58.549> of<00:02:58.580> science<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
advisor from the Faculty of science and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.729 
advisor from the Faculty of science and
they<00:02:59.360> stay<00:02:59.660> with<00:02:59.840> those<00:03:00.019> students<00:03:00.440> for<00:03:00.620> the

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
they stay with those students for the

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.530 
they stay with those students for the
full<00:03:00.980> four<00:03:01.430> years<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.790> their<00:03:01.880> degree<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
full four years of their degree so the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.910 
full four years of their degree so the
idea<00:03:02.840> being<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.260> get<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.650> know<00:03:03.769> your

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
idea being that you get to know your

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.479 
idea being that you get to know your
advisor<00:03:04.070> your<00:03:04.519> advisor<00:03:04.760> gets<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.239> know<00:03:05.359> you<00:03:06.489> we

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
advisor your advisor gets to know you we

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.880 
advisor your advisor gets to know you we
also<00:03:07.670> have<00:03:07.850> both<00:03:08.780> internships<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.500> field

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
also have both internships and field

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.890 
also have both internships and field
studies<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.549> like<00:03:10.880> we<00:03:11.060> have<00:03:11.090> individual<00:03:11.690> field

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
studies so like we have individual field

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.750 
studies so like we have individual field
studies<00:03:12.230> courses<00:03:12.560> but<00:03:12.890> it's<00:03:13.040> also<00:03:13.190> possible

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
studies courses but it's also possible

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.099 
studies courses but it's also possible
for<00:03:13.820> students<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.359> go<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.600> spend<00:03:14.840> an<00:03:14.959> entire

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
for students to go and spend an entire

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.039 
for students to go and spend an entire
semester<00:03:15.519> studying<00:03:16.519> in<00:03:16.880> either<00:03:17.060> Africa

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
semester studying in either Africa

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.740 
semester studying in either Africa
Panama<00:03:18.560> or<00:03:18.709> Barbados<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.489> this<00:03:19.640> really<00:03:20.630> gives

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
Panama or Barbados and this really gives

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.390 
Panama or Barbados and this really gives
them<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:20.989> opportunity<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.799> apply<00:03:22.040> what<00:03:22.130> they

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
them the opportunity to apply what they

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.130 
them the opportunity to apply what they
learn<00:03:22.609> outside<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.390> classroom<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.019> they

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
learn outside of the classroom and they

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.580 
learn outside of the classroom and they
find<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.650> really<00:03:24.980> great<00:03:25.160> experience

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
find it's a really great experience

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.390 
find it's a really great experience
our<00:03:27.580> students<00:03:28.090> are<00:03:28.270> really<00:03:29.400> remarkable

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
our students are really remarkable

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.240 
our students are really remarkable
people<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.880> mean<00:03:31.060> they're<00:03:31.270> they're
