it's a beautiful organic broccoli and as
well<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:23.240> makes<00:04:23.419> 2<00:04:24.020> litres<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.349> soup<00:04:24.620> so

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
that's the fair now at this point you

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.140 
that's the fair now at this point you
can<00:04:27.560> add<00:04:27.680> in<00:04:27.800> some<00:04:27.830> sour<00:04:28.220> cream<00:04:28.370> I've<00:04:28.760> got<00:04:28.940> some

creme fraiche there you can just stir
through<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:31.010> little<00:04:31.669> bit<00:04:31.820> it's<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.210> fairly

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
through a little bit it's a fairly

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.629 
through a little bit it's a fairly
creamy<00:04:32.810> soup<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.320> think<00:04:33.740> just<00:04:34.130> with<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.340> potato

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
creamy soup I think just with the potato

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:47.450 
creamy soup I think just with the potato
and<00:04:34.849> it<00:04:34.940> makes<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.330> bit<00:04:35.419> creamy

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:57.629 

that's<00:04:48.240> delicious<00:04:53.419> impatient

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.089 

I'm<00:04:58.419> sure<00:04:58.629> you<00:04:58.750> could<00:04:58.840> replace<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.379> we're<00:05:02.099> a

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
I'm sure you could replace that we're a

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.290 
I'm sure you could replace that we're a
little<00:05:03.340> bit<00:05:03.460> just<00:05:04.389> a<00:05:04.900> little<00:05:05.439> bit<00:05:05.620> creamy<00:05:06.300> so

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
little bit just a little bit creamy so

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.369 
little bit just a little bit creamy so
but<00:05:07.449> you<00:05:07.509> get<00:05:07.629> the<00:05:07.750> idea

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
but you get the idea

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.230 
but you get the idea
I<00:05:08.409> mean<00:05:08.889> that's<00:05:09.039> just<00:05:09.280> how<00:05:09.340> easy<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:10.090> know<00:05:10.180> you

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
I mean that's just how easy you know you

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.249 
I mean that's just how easy you know you
imagine<00:05:10.569> you<00:05:10.629> park<00:05:10.840> on<00:05:10.960> soup<00:05:12.780> we<00:05:13.780> never<00:05:13.960> do<00:05:14.169> the

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
imagine you park on soup we never do the

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:15.990 
imagine you park on soup we never do the
minestrone<00:05:14.740> in<00:05:14.979> there<00:05:15.159> as<00:05:15.250> well<00:05:15.430> obviously<00:05:15.610> to

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
minestrone in there as well obviously to

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.290 
minestrone in there as well obviously to
start<00:05:16.289> puree<00:05:17.289> at<00:05:17.439> the<00:05:17.560> end<00:05:17.710> but<00:05:18.180> can<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.270> think

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
start puree at the end but can you think

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.909 
start puree at the end but can you think
of<00:05:19.539> how<00:05:19.750> much<00:05:19.900> time<00:05:20.229> it<00:05:20.379> takes<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.740> make<00:05:20.860> a

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
of how much time it takes to make a

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:30.029 
of how much time it takes to make a
circuit<00:05:21.460> home<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:28.349> so<00:05:29.349> good<00:05:29.590> to<00:05:29.680> use<00:05:29.889> your

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
circuit home and so good to use your

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.460 
circuit home and so good to use your
veggie<00:05:30.219> soup
