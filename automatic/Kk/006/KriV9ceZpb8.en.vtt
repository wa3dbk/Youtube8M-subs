maps you need in the world it's pretty

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:34.319

good<00:00:31.839> they<00:00:32.230> go<00:00:33.100> into<00:00:33.220> addresses<00:00:33.790> and<00:00:33.970> isn't

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
good they go into addresses and isn't

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.020 
good they go into addresses and isn't
the<00:00:34.420> best<00:00:35.280> whether<00:00:36.280> it's<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.519> maps<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:36.940> the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
the best whether it's the maps of the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.520 
the best whether it's the maps of the
Garmin<00:00:37.329> I'm<00:00:37.420> not<00:00:37.540> sure<00:00:37.750> but<00:00:37.899> it<00:00:38.019> doesn't<00:00:38.320> know

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
Garmin I'm not sure but it doesn't know

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.979 
Garmin I'm not sure but it doesn't know
where<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.579> addresses<00:00:39.970> are<00:00:40.149> we've<00:00:40.720> missed<00:00:40.870> a

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
where the addresses are we've missed a

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.790 
where the addresses are we've missed a
few<00:00:41.140> houses<00:00:41.379> before<00:00:42.809> 5:50<00:00:43.809> UK's<00:00:44.170> really<00:00:44.589> a<00:00:44.620> bit

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
few houses before 5:50 UK's really a bit

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.530 
few houses before 5:50 UK's really a bit
yet<00:00:45.010> completely<00:00:45.399> other<00:00:45.640> end<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:45.969> the<00:00:46.059> road<00:00:46.239> and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
yet completely other end of the road and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.499 
yet completely other end of the road and
so<00:00:47.500> obviously<00:00:47.800> like<00:00:48.430> with<00:00:48.610> car<00:00:48.850> GPS<00:00:49.089> though

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:49.509 
so obviously like with car GPS though

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:51.929 
so obviously like with car GPS though
trust<00:00:49.780> implicitly<00:00:50.400> you've<00:00:51.400> definitely<00:00:51.610> got

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:51.939 
trust implicitly you've definitely got

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:53.759 
trust implicitly you've definitely got
to<00:00:52.000> be<00:00:52.629> aware<00:00:52.869> of<00:00:52.930> where<00:00:53.229> you're<00:00:53.350> going<00:00:53.650> as

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769

well but on the whole we are really
really<00:00:57.189> good<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:58.089> maps<00:00:58.780> on<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.110> fly<00:00:59.379> like

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
really good the maps on the fly like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.039 
really good the maps on the fly like
we're<00:01:01.000> doing<00:01:01.150> at<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.269> moment<00:01:01.420> just<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.839> get

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
we're doing at the moment just to get

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.270 
we're doing at the moment just to get
paid<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.290> people's<00:01:02.559> houses<00:01:02.710> get<00:01:03.159> to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
paid to people's houses get to

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.840

restaurants<00:01:03.850> hotels<00:01:04.030> whatever

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.070 

they<00:01:08.220> they're<00:01:09.220> okay<00:01:09.700> but<00:01:10.630> you've<00:01:10.750> got<00:01:11.049> a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
they they're okay but you've got a

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.780 
they they're okay but you've got a
double<00:01:11.320> check<00:01:11.680> I'll<00:01:11.920> do<00:01:12.009> is<00:01:12.100> double<00:01:12.369> check<00:01:12.610> on

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
double check I'll do is double check on

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.749 
double check I'll do is double check on
like<00:01:13.060> Google<00:01:13.600> as<00:01:13.930> well<00:01:14.439> if<00:01:14.799> possible<00:01:15.220> or<00:01:15.549> on<00:01:15.670> an

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
like Google as well if possible or on an

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.850 
like Google as well if possible or on an
actual<00:01:16.060> map<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:17.290> you're<00:01:17.409> go<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.740> right

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
actual map that you're go in the right

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.830 
actual map that you're go in the right
direction<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.430> goes<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.670> right<00:01:18.790> place

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.940 

what<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:25.960> tend<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.289> do<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.530> it's<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.799> much

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
what we tend to do and it's a much

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.160 
what we tend to do and it's a much
better<00:01:27.159> way<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.399> do<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.850> this<00:01:28.630> plan<00:01:28.899> all<00:01:29.049> your

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
better way to do it this plan all your

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.109 
better way to do it this plan all your
routes<00:01:29.350> on<00:01:29.530> something<00:01:29.770> like<00:01:29.860> Strava<00:01:30.220> then

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
routes on something like Strava then

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.600 
routes on something like Strava then
easy<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.570> do<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.289> then<00:01:32.740> just<00:01:32.770> export<00:01:33.430> them

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
easy to do and then just export them

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.160 
easy to do and then just export them
onto<00:01:33.820> your<00:01:34.770> onto<00:01:35.770> device<00:01:36.690> then<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.780> get<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.049> go

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
onto your onto device then you get to go

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.540 
onto your onto device then you get to go
these<00:01:38.289> that<00:01:38.500> way<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.680> want<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.039> go<00:01:39.190> pick<00:01:39.490> the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
these that way you want to go pick the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.830 
these that way you want to go pick the
best<00:01:39.729> route<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:43.030> your<00:01:43.210> languages<00:01:43.600> and

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
best route and take your languages and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.740 
best route and take your languages and
some<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.319> routes<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.450> edges<00:01:46.450> come<00:01:46.659> up

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
some of the routes on the edges come up

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.649 
some of the routes on the edges come up
with<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:46.990> pretty<00:01:47.110> crazy<00:01:48.390> taking<00:01:49.390> us<00:01:49.479> about

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
with it pretty crazy taking us about

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.389 
with it pretty crazy taking us about
three<00:01:49.960> times<00:01:50.229> longer<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.590> get<00:01:50.800> somewhere<00:01:51.190> then

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
three times longer to get somewhere then

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.779 
three times longer to get somewhere then
would<00:01:52.030> have<00:01:52.090> been<00:01:52.149> take<00:01:52.539> us<00:01:52.659> on<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.869> busy<00:01:53.080> road

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
would have been take us on a busy road

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.749 
would have been take us on a busy road
so<00:01:55.470> yeah<00:01:56.470> plan<00:01:57.039> them<00:01:57.159> if<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.340> can<00:01:57.520> plan<00:01:57.700> your

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
so yeah plan them if you can plan your

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.440 
so yeah plan them if you can plan your
plan<00:01:58.060> your<00:01:58.270> longer<00:01:58.479> rides<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.860> Strava<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:01.270> if

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
plan your longer rides on Strava and if

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.960 
plan your longer rides on Strava and if
you<00:02:01.539> got<00:02:01.690> get<00:02:01.869> somewhere<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.319> city<00:02:02.819> then<00:02:03.819> do

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
you got get somewhere in a city then do

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.639 
you got get somewhere in a city then do
want<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.179> device<00:02:04.420> yourself<00:02:04.780> one<00:02:05.409> little

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
want to device yourself one little
