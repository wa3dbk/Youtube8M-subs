00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
our digital button as well too okay so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200 
our digital button as well too okay so
we<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.800> our<00:01:55.830> band<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:56.970> have<00:01:57.060> everything

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210

we have our band then we have everything
on<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.690> back<00:01:57.840> okay<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.550> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> see

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
on the back okay so here you can see

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.460 
on the back okay so here you can see
where<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.630> don't<00:02:00.780> actually<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.260> take

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
where you don't actually have to take

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.469 
where you don't actually have to take
the<00:02:01.590> case<00:02:01.770> off<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.040> charge<00:02:02.550> it<00:02:02.759> or<00:02:03.300> anything

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the case off to charge it or anything

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.109 
the case off to charge it or anything
well<00:02:03.990> now<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.860> about<00:02:05.160> what<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> rugged

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
well now this is about what the rugged

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.620 
well now this is about what the rugged
case<00:02:06.720> would<00:02:06.960> look<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:08.179> before<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.240> there's

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
case would look like before now there's

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.290 
case would look like before now there's
a<00:02:09.690> little<00:02:09.869> bit<00:02:09.990> thicker<00:02:10.259> than<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.890> rugged<00:02:11.730> but

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
a little bit thicker than the rugged but

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.030 
a little bit thicker than the rugged but
the<00:02:12.420> cool<00:02:12.630> thing<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:12.959> with<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.410> tough<00:02:13.590> armor

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
the cool thing is with the tough armor

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.320 
the cool thing is with the tough armor
then<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> built-in<00:02:15.180> screen

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
then you get the built-in screen

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.510 
then you get the built-in screen
protector<00:02:15.620> okay<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.770> it's<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> hard<00:02:17.280> plastic

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
protector okay so it's the hard plastic

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.280 
protector okay so it's the hard plastic
and<00:02:18.300> let's<00:02:18.450> make<00:02:18.570> sure<00:02:18.630> we've<00:02:18.810> got<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.050> up<00:02:19.140> so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and let's make sure we've got it up so

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.870 
and let's make sure we've got it up so
the<00:02:19.530> correct<00:02:19.770> way<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.070> says<00:02:20.220> tough<00:02:20.430> warmer<00:02:20.730> on

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the correct way it says tough warmer on

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.970 
the correct way it says tough warmer on
the<00:02:20.970> top<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.080> shock<00:02:22.380> resist<00:02:22.739> at<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the top and it's the shock resist at the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.759 
the top and it's the shock resist at the
bottom<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.110> tangerine<00:02:25.530> tango

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
bottom so this is that tangerine tango

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.800 
bottom so this is that tangerine tango
now<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.160> goes<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.550> these<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.880> nubs<00:02:27.239> that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
now it goes on to these little nubs that

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.090 
now it goes on to these little nubs that
you<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> end<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.830> almost<00:02:28.950> looks

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
you see on the end so it almost looks

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.400 
you see on the end so it almost looks
like<00:02:29.250> little<00:02:29.519> screw<00:02:29.700> joints<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.300> then<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
like little screw joints and then it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.910 
like little screw joints and then it
just<00:02:31.530> pops<00:02:31.830> right<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.380> actually<00:02:34.560> hear

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just pops right on you can actually hear

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.800 
just pops right on you can actually hear
them<00:02:35.070> pop<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:39.060> love<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.540> way<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
them pop on and I love the way this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.110 
them pop on and I love the way this
thing<00:02:40.019> looks<00:02:40.290> especially<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.950> less<00:02:41.310> than<00:02:41.459> $20

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
thing looks especially for less than $20

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.880 
thing looks especially for less than $20
and<00:02:42.750> I've<00:02:43.110> got<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> built-in<00:02:43.560> screen<00:02:43.800> protector

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
and I've got a built-in screen protector

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.130 
and I've got a built-in screen protector
now<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.760> rugged<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.390> does<00:02:45.630> come<00:02:45.750> with<00:02:46.080> two

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
now the rugged one does come with two

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.660 
now the rugged one does come with two
screen<00:02:46.560> protectors<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:47.100> didn't<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.580> way

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
screen protectors I didn't like the way

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.830 
screen protectors I didn't like the way
that<00:02:47.820> they<00:02:47.940> felt<00:02:48.150> though<00:02:48.390> because<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.690> was

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that they felt though because it was

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.560 
that they felt though because it was
just<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.080> little<00:02:49.260> cut<00:02:49.560> out<00:02:49.590> slab<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.209> this

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
just a little cut out slab on it so this

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.259 
just a little cut out slab on it so this
is<00:02:51.810> nice<00:02:52.079> I<00:02:52.410> love<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.799> way<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.160> looks

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
is nice I love the way that this looks

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.990 
is nice I love the way that this looks
so<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.660> sealed<00:02:55.350> now<00:02:55.829> not<00:02:56.160> water-resistant

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
so it is sealed now not water-resistant

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.180 
so it is sealed now not water-resistant
okay<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.540> be<00:02:58.440> sure<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.620> don't<00:02:58.799> think<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
okay so be sure and don't think that

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.069 
okay so be sure and don't think that
this<00:02:59.280> adds<00:02:59.519> any<00:02:59.730> kind<00:02:59.940> of<00:02:59.970> water<00:03:00.239> durability

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
this adds any kind of water durability

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.860 
this adds any kind of water durability
but<00:03:01.790> definitely<00:03:02.790> gonna<00:03:02.910> add<00:03:03.000> some<00:03:03.690> more

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
but definitely gonna add some more

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.229 
but definitely gonna add some more
rugged<00:03:04.260> feel<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:05.579> you're<00:03:05.940> gonna<00:03:06.060> be

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
rugged feel to it so you're gonna be

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.670 
rugged feel to it so you're gonna be
able<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.390> take<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> little<00:03:06.870> bit<00:03:07.019> more<00:03:07.079> bang<00:03:07.410> with

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
able to take a little bit more bang with

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.039 
able to take a little bit more bang with
this<00:03:07.910> comes<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.090> couple<00:03:09.540> different<00:03:09.720> colors

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
this comes in a couple different colors

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.090 
this comes in a couple different colors
I've<00:03:10.350> seen<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> gunmetal

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
I've seen the gunmetal

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.250 
I've seen the gunmetal
I<00:03:11.220> love<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.850> tangerine<00:03:12.299> though<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.750> think<00:03:13.170> it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
I love the tangerine though I think it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.440 
I love the tangerine though I think it
really<00:03:13.769> makes<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.040> stand<00:03:14.160> out<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:14.820> let's<00:03:15.329> see

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
really makes it stand out so let's see

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.940 
really makes it stand out so let's see
what<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.600> looks<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
what it looks like so you can see the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.800 
what it looks like so you can see the
difference<00:03:17.489> for<00:03:18.060> those<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.630> have

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
difference for those of you that have

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.170 
difference for those of you that have
the<00:03:19.019> watch<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.829> you've<00:03:20.340> got<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.640> little

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the watch and you've got that little

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.600 
the watch and you've got that little
bitty<00:03:21.390> square<00:03:21.959> which<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.650> really<00:03:23.010> wish<00:03:23.220> Apple

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
bitty square which I really wish Apple

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.920 
bitty square which I really wish Apple
