00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
capabilities of this phone and there's

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
capabilities of this phone and there's
two<00:01:03.629> demos<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.199> could<00:01:04.320> run<00:01:04.500> them<00:01:04.589> with

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
two demos here we could run them with

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.760 
two demos here we could run them with
full<00:01:05.309> screen<00:01:05.580> anti-aliasing<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.290> off<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
full screen anti-aliasing on or off and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.200 
full screen anti-aliasing on or off and
we're<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.090> has

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
we're just going to do the one that has

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.230 
we're just going to do the one that has
off<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> let<00:01:11.130> me<00:01:11.220> pull<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.700> nexus<00:01:12.030> one

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
off and let me pull up the nexus one

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.770 
off and let me pull up the nexus one
here<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:15.210> we'll<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:17.780> we've

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
here and we'll get this going we've

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.130 
here and we'll get this going we've
shown<00:01:19.140> before<00:01:20.479> let<00:01:21.479> me<00:01:21.600> start<00:01:21.840> these<00:01:21.960> at<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
shown before let me start these at the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.510 
shown before let me start these at the
same<00:01:22.229> time<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> pretty<00:01:25.920> intensive

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
same time this is a pretty intensive

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.300 
same time this is a pretty intensive
benchmark<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.840> takes<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.229> minute<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.250> two

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
benchmark so this takes a minute or two

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
benchmark so this takes a minute or two
to<00:01:29.460> load<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.909> how<00:01:30.720> we've<00:01:30.900> shown<00:01:31.140> before<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
to load up how we've shown before and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.580 
to load up how we've shown before and
our<00:01:31.710> testing<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:34.110> motorola<00:01:34.500> droid

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
our testing that the the motorola droid

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.190 
our testing that the the motorola droid
the<00:01:35.070> original<00:01:35.430> droid<00:01:35.729> was<00:01:36.570> actually<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the original droid was actually the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.530 
the original droid was actually the
fastest<00:01:37.740> phone<00:01:38.610> when<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.909> came<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> graphics

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
fastest phone when it came to graphics

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.990 
fastest phone when it came to graphics
that<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.439> has<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.000> texas

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
they actually all have the power vr

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
they actually all have the power vr
sgx540<00:02:09.739> GPU<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> power<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.360> urs<00:02:12.810> g<00:02:12.989> x<00:02:13.080> 540

sgx540 GPU and the power of urs g x 540
you<00:02:13.890> had<00:02:14.310> twice<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.730> performance<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:16.319> 530

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you had twice the performance of the 530

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.330 
you had twice the performance of the 530
and<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.319> starting<00:02:19.620> up<00:02:19.709> here<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.069> see

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
and this is starting up here you can see

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.270 
and this is starting up here you can see
this<00:02:20.900> look<00:02:21.900> how<00:02:22.049> smooth<00:02:22.560> everything<00:02:22.769> is<00:02:23.159> on

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
this look how smooth everything is on

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
this look how smooth everything is on
the<00:02:23.340> top<00:02:23.489> one<00:02:23.730> here<00:02:23.909> I<00:02:24.180> look<00:02:25.140> at<00:02:25.290> my<00:02:25.409> nexus<00:02:25.799> one

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the top one here I look at my nexus one

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.690 
the top one here I look at my nexus one
just<00:02:26.250> chugging<00:02:26.760> down<00:02:26.909> on<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> bottom<00:02:28.700> what's

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
just chugging down on the bottom what's

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.149 
just chugging down on the bottom what's
really<00:02:29.849> amazing<00:02:30.120> here<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.620> distance<00:02:31.799> have

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
really amazing here this distance have

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.179 
really amazing here this distance have
the<00:02:32.310> android<00:02:32.519> 2.2<00:02:33.030> which<00:02:33.599> offers<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.200> nice

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
the android 2.2 which offers a nice

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.429 
the android 2.2 which offers a nice
performance<00:02:36.150> boost<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.140> overall

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
performance boost on on the overall

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.030 
performance boost on on the overall
system<00:02:37.829> performance<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.819> graphics

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
system performance but in graphics

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.380 
system performance but in graphics
benchmarks<00:02:41.040> doesn't<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:41.909> make<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.329> much

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
benchmarks doesn't really make that much

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.449 
benchmarks doesn't really make that much
of<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.840> difference<00:02:43.079> but<00:02:43.680> here<00:02:44.159> you<00:02:44.310> can<00:02:44.340> just

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
of a difference but here you can just

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.030 
of a difference but here you can just
see<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.299> is<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.480> Qualcomm<00:02:46.109> one<00:02:46.769> gigahertz

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
see this is the Qualcomm one gigahertz

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.160 
see this is the Qualcomm one gigahertz
processor<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.359> paired<00:02:48.659> this<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.989> one

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
processor and I paired this is the one

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.940 
processor and I paired this is the one
gigahertz<00:02:49.730> hummingbird<00:02:50.730> GPU<00:02:51.329> but<00:02:52.139> just<00:02:52.769> look

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
gigahertz hummingbird GPU but just look

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.970 
gigahertz hummingbird GPU but just look
at<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.159> difference<00:02:53.519> here<00:02:54.379> how<00:02:55.379> this<00:02:55.560> used<00:02:55.859> to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
at the difference here how this used to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.099 
at the difference here how this used to
be<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.159> champ<00:02:56.549> will<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.540> one<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> droid

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
be the champ will this one on the droid

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.110 
be the champ will this one on the droid
I'll<00:02:58.590> bow<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.189> same<00:02:59.430> level<00:02:59.459> with<00:02:59.730> graphics

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
I'll bow on the same level with graphics

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.390 
I'll bow on the same level with graphics
performance<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.620> benchmark<00:03:02.159> just

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
performance and this benchmark just

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.339 
performance and this benchmark just
kills<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.909> phone<00:03:04.790> let's<00:03:05.790> zoom<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.329> on<00:03:06.599> here<00:03:06.900> a

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
kills this phone let's zoom in on here a

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.690 
kills this phone let's zoom in on here a
little<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:07.950> we<00:03:08.010> can<00:03:08.129> get<00:03:08.189> a<00:03:08.250> better<00:03:08.310> look<00:03:08.489> at

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
little so we can get a better look at

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.720 
little so we can get a better look at
this<00:03:08.849> guy<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.530> like<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.620> said<00:03:10.769> this<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:10.889> power<00:03:11.310> I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
this guy I like I said this is power I

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.210 
this guy I like I said this is power I
mean<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.599> GL<00:03:12.989> benchmark<00:03:14.569> 2.0<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:16.260> this

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
mean this is GL benchmark 2.0 and this

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.199 
mean this is GL benchmark 2.0 and this
is<00:03:17.430> not<00:03:17.699> available<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:19.019> download<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:20.209> just

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.729 
results and we'll compare this with some
of<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.569> other<00:04:12.629> android<00:04:12.989> phones<00:04:13.019> but<00:04:13.530> just

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
of the other android phones but just

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.219 
of the other android phones but just
from<00:04:13.829> what<00:04:14.010> i've<00:04:14.099> seen<00:04:14.129> so<00:04:14.340> far<00:04:14.849> this<00:04:15.690> thing

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
from what i've seen so far this thing

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.420 
from what i've seen so far this thing
just<00:04:16.380> blows<00:04:16.620> everything<00:04:16.859> else<00:04:17.130> out<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.310> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
just blows everything else out of the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.439 
just blows everything else out of the
water<00:04:18.349> this<00:04:19.349> power<00:04:19.650> BR<00:04:19.889> sgx540<00:04:20.789> GPU<00:04:21.150> is<00:04:21.180> is

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
water this power BR sgx540 GPU is is

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.529 
water this power BR sgx540 GPU is is
really<00:04:21.719> fast<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:23.669> i<00:04:23.909> haven't<00:04:24.240> seen<00:04:24.300> anything

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
really fast and i haven't seen anything

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.920 
really fast and i haven't seen anything
at<00:04:24.990> all<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.260> even<00:04:25.680> could<00:04:25.800> slow<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.039> down

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
at all that even could slow it down

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.159 
at all that even could slow it down
so<00:04:27.139> it'll<00:04:28.100> be<00:04:28.130> interesting<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:29.270> run<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.900> couple

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
so it'll be interesting to run a couple

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.650 
so it'll be interesting to run a couple
more<00:04:30.320> benchmarks<00:04:31.070> on<00:04:31.190> this<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.669> we<00:04:32.270> will<00:04:32.389> show

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
more benchmarks on this and we will show

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.450 
more benchmarks on this and we will show
you<00:04:32.720> how<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.080> compares<00:04:33.410> follow<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.340> other

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
you how it compares follow the other

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.699 
you how it compares follow the other
phones
