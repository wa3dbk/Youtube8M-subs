00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.090
 obvious 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.590
 in the hon unit principles and concepts of 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.330
 education field as already said 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.760
 objective is to reflect on the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.930
 concepts of education field education 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.029
 rural peasant championship that is for 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.530
 people understand it initially what 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.070
 education is the beginner course the CETAC 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.710
 the epigraph of professor bernardo mançano 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.420
 which is the following field in place of 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.790
 life where people can live 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.800
 work and study with dignity 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.090
 Who has your place to your identity? 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.430
 cultural 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.710
 the field is not just a place of production 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.600
 agribusiness and agroindustrial 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.579
 land grabbing latifundio 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.579
 the field is to spread the territory 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.320
 peasants and quilombolas is in the countryside 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.690
 that are forests where would 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.180
 various indigenous nations 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.729
 for all this the field in the place of life and 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.060
 especially education 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.180
 this reflection then brings to us what 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.420
 ocampo as life or I field as 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.950
 what respects nature that 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.320
 produces ecologically 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.110
 so we can say that the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.030
 Field is like life this life 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.880
 today is surrounded by the challenges of 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.390
 agricultural policy which is the credit for the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.710
 small producer to the dwelling that is 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.710
 for them 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.380
 production depending on credit 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.479
 depends on conditions depends on roads 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.820
 the concentration of land that exists in 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.490
 field that is formed by the latifundio that 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.759
 only grows most of the time 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.570
 export crops or soybeans 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.439
 eucalyptus 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.829
 the type of plan that favors the 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.780
 export policy for the people 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.299
 start talking about education 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.670
 Let's talk in the inner city about education. 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.259
 rural that this rural education 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.650
 what we can say today that the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.870
 education is planned and it is 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.840
 part of the urban environment in all 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.040
 the fact that until today it is trying to change 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.630
 this happens conception is the school 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.590
 rural is an appendix of urban school 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.650
 she is seen as a needy school 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.569
 and in some cases it is thought for the jeca 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.200
 the jeca armadillo all montado lobado da 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.680
 and education is still heard 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.799
 that is equal to the rural school that 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.930
 the diminutives themselves behind the idea of 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.579
 diminutive money and 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.329
 preconception that exists with the school 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:56.120
 field here brings an image 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.290
 school of the field seeded corintian dream 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.760
 rights or a slogan is a 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.810
 in the second meeting of the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.849
 Monday 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.970
 in national education meetings to 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.159
 meet little indication of the people 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.989
 the then I'm already getting so field 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.810
 in what is the education of the field 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.389
 is that which is accessed in the values ​​and 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.819
 attitudes the peasants who staged 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.470
 this educational proposal also education 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.739
 the field implies understanding the process 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.859
 diversity in dimensions 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.260
 they constitute social processes 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.689
 political and cultural forms of being 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.959
 society and sound 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:39.979
 sayings of miguel arroyo dacal da xii 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.299
 molina 2004 Page 113 that brings this 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.489
 reflection 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:48.109
 so that the education of the field goes 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.419
 of processes is of life itself as well 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.790
 education in the field involves the whole 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.849
 and social and cultural struggles 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.549
 of peasants in their diversity and 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:02.209
 when workers of this space time 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.109
 from this we also bring a 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.280
 idea of peasant culture 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:13.159
 which it is designated as small. 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.669
 for the resources they have for meals 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.769
 potentiate their productive forces 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.859
 but she is not a peasant because she is 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.349
 little this is not yours its your 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.360
 dimension which determines its nature and 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:30.919
 rather their internal and external relations 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.530
 cut during the first 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.509
 mark of the peasant struggle in that space 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.010
 time already peasantry 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:42.249
 second coast oak 2012 to 113 o 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.439
 set of peasant families 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.599
 this is a territory the families 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.239
 this territory, this is in the 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:52.479
 context of social relations that 

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:55.899
 expressed in rules and practices institutions 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:59.049
 of the natural available biomes and 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:05:02.319
 ecosystems and cultural capacity 

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:05.069
 internalized spindles people and paw 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:08.759
 tangible and intangible infrastructures 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:11.469
 of a geographically defined geographical area 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.929
 delimited therefore that the footprint 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.759
 the broader question of peasant struggle is 

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:18.519
 recent years have seen new 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:21.819
 concepts and one of them is agriculture 

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:24.219
 family as disclosed in the media and by 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:27.729
 by the government in the concept of oak 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:29.889
 also it says is that are those 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.679
 that under the impact of the 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.839
 more general character is the importance of 

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:35.709
 city ​​of urban culture centered on the 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.299
 Marketplace 

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:40.569
 most recently globalization of 

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:43.449
 economy etc try to adapt to this 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.759
 new production model by transforming 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.579
 internally and externally in an agenda 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:51.549
 modern culture this in other words 

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:55.749
 it means that family lyoto has strong 

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:57.879
 relation to the modernized culture of 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:01.019
 production system 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.019
 in the country
