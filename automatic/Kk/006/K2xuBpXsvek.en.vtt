00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
skin it's really hard for me to find a

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.930 
skin it's really hard for me to find a
good<00:03:45.600> foundation<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.440> my<00:03:47.310> skin<00:03:47.609> has<00:03:47.730> been

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
good foundation and my skin has been

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.890 
good foundation and my skin has been
super<00:03:48.510> iffy<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:49.079> year<00:03:49.350> it's<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.340> dry<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:51.120> don't

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
super iffy this year it's so dry I don't

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.090 
super iffy this year it's so dry I don't
know<00:03:51.989> what's<00:03:52.139> going<00:03:52.410> on<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.769> think<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
know what's going on and I think the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.789 
know what's going on and I think the
weather<00:03:53.340> outside<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.760> just<00:03:53.910> super<00:03:54.569> dry<00:03:54.840> my

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
weather outside is just super dry my

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.910 
weather outside is just super dry my
skin<00:03:55.859> is<00:03:56.190> not<00:03:56.310> having<00:03:56.639> it<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.690> tried<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.380> mix

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
skin is not having it so I tried to mix

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.039 
skin is not having it so I tried to mix
these<00:03:59.190> two<00:03:59.459> because<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.150> color<00:04:00.420> range<00:04:00.720> is

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
these two because the color range is

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.900 
these two because the color range is
terrible<00:04:01.739> especially<00:04:02.280> if<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.459> have<00:04:02.489> olive

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
terrible especially if you have olive

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.690 
terrible especially if you have olive
skin<00:04:02.940> not<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.840> best<00:04:03.959> color<00:04:04.230> range<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.220> mix

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
skin not the best color range so I mix

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.830 
skin not the best color range so I mix
for<00:04:06.630> 40<00:04:07.019> natural<00:04:07.440> beige<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.150> 240<00:04:09.150> soft<00:04:09.540> beige

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
for 40 natural beige and 240 soft beige

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.590 
for 40 natural beige and 240 soft beige
to<00:04:10.260> get<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.709> color<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.400> matches<00:04:11.549> my<00:04:11.819> skin<00:04:11.970> so

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
to get a color that matches my skin so

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.020 
to get a color that matches my skin so
purchasing<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.709> cost<00:04:14.160> me<00:04:14.459> maybe<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.970> little

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
purchasing the to cost me maybe a little

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.180 
purchasing the to cost me maybe a little
under<00:04:15.480> twelve<00:04:15.750> dollars<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.799> get<00:04:17.010> double

foundation<00:04:37.060> on<00:04:37.120> my<00:04:37.240> skin<00:04:37.450> up<00:04:37.600> for<00:04:37.810> probably

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
foundation on my skin up for probably

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.440 
foundation on my skin up for probably
around<00:04:38.830> 18<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.520> 19<00:04:39.880> hours<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:41.820> it's<00:04:42.820> definitely

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
around 18 to 19 hours so it's definitely

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.200 
around 18 to 19 hours so it's definitely
long<00:04:43.780> lasting<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:45.160> coverage<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.670> nice<00:04:45.940> it's

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
long lasting the coverage is nice it's

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.270 
long lasting the coverage is nice it's
very<00:04:46.300> buildable<00:04:46.900> it's<00:04:47.410> nice<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:47.800> smooth<00:04:48.130> and

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
very buildable it's nice and smooth and

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.460 
very buildable it's nice and smooth and
soft<00:04:48.610> doesn't<00:04:49.600> leave<00:04:49.690> my<00:04:49.810> skin<00:04:49.900> too<00:04:50.260> oily

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
soft doesn't leave my skin too oily

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.100 
soft doesn't leave my skin too oily
doesn't<00:04:51.040> leave<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.430> Matt<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.870> think

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
doesn't leave it to Matt and I think

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.950 
doesn't leave it to Matt and I think
that<00:04:53.320> has<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.650> do<00:04:54.040> with<00:04:54.280> mixing<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.300> two<00:04:55.600> I'm

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
that has to do with mixing the two I'm

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.420 
that has to do with mixing the two I'm
pretty<00:04:56.380> sure<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.680> would<00:04:56.800> get<00:04:56.950> a<00:04:57.010> little<00:04:57.340> bit

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
pretty sure you would get a little bit

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.920 
pretty sure you would get a little bit
more<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:57.790> matte<00:04:58.030> finish<00:04:58.060> because<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.690> tried

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
more of a matte finish because I tried

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.930 
more of a matte finish because I tried
this<00:04:59.080> on<00:04:59.260> its<00:04:59.440> own<00:04:59.680> and<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.250> was<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.400> little<00:05:00.700> bit

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
this on its own and it was a little bit

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.320 
this on its own and it was a little bit
too<00:05:01.210> dry<00:05:01.450> for<00:05:01.480> my<00:05:01.960> skin<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:03.640> think<00:05:03.760> if<00:05:04.060> you

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
too dry for my skin so I think if you

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.600 
too dry for my skin so I think if you
have<00:05:04.630> oily<00:05:05.260> skin<00:05:05.500> you'll<00:05:05.890> probably<00:05:06.100> really

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
have oily skin you'll probably really

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.130 
have oily skin you'll probably really
like<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.880> mat<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.540> just<00:05:07.750> have<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.870> play

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
like the mat you just have to play

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.750
