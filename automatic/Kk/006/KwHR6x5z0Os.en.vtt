sweetener okay so to 11 and the coconut

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.670 
sweetener okay so to 11 and the coconut
is<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:53.189> probably<00:01:53.490> need<00:01:53.640> about<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.850> half<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.299> cup

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
is you probably need about a half a cup

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
is you probably need about a half a cup
maybe<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.860> even<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.729> enough<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
maybe not even it's just enough that you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.969 
maybe not even it's just enough that you
can<00:01:57.329> kind<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> root<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.350> you'll<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.979> you

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
can kind of root it you'll see so you

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.560

ziplock<00:02:03.930> bag<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.229> use<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.159> again<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:06.119> really

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
ziplock bag and use it again not really

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.830 
ziplock bag and use it again not really
a<00:02:06.479> big<00:02:06.719> deal<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.700> okay<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.209> we're<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.660> do

butter gets real cold and solid and and
the<00:05:35.660> I<00:05:35.930> think<00:05:36.169> that<00:05:36.320> cookin<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.740> kind<00:05:36.919> of

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
the I think that cookin it kind of

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.650 
the I think that cookin it kind of
soaked<00:05:37.220> up<00:05:37.400> all<00:05:37.490> over<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:37.820> moisture<00:05:38.390> from

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
soaked up all over the moisture from

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.580 
soaked up all over the moisture from
from<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:39.860> as<00:05:40.040> well<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.760> it<00:05:40.850> just<00:05:41.150> kind<00:05:41.390> of

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
from it as well and it just kind of

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.290 
from it as well and it just kind of
stiffens<00:05:42.590> up<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.100> when<00:05:43.820> you<00:05:43.940> only

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
stiffens up and when you only

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.490 
stiffens up and when you only
refrigerate<00:05:44.840> this<00:05:44.960> so<00:05:45.110> this<00:05:45.229> is<00:05:45.350> going<00:05:45.440> to

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500
