00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
on these are going to work fine if you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.700 
on these are going to work fine if you
look<00:01:06.630> down<00:01:06.810> your<00:01:06.990> chicken<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.560> almost

spot his backbone and we're going to
basically<00:01:09.990> cut<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.530> side<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.130> over

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
basically cut on one side of it over

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.219 
basically cut on one side of it over
here<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> other<00:01:12.570> side<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.960> over

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
here and on the other side of it over

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.130 
here and on the other side of it over
there<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:14.010> almost<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.720> easy<00:01:15.900> when

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
there it's almost it's kind of easy when

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.899

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
this thigh area that's a little hard you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.800 
this thigh area that's a little hard you
might<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:20.880> kind<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.450> two<00:01:21.570> hands

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
might have to get kind of with two hands

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.469 
might have to get kind of with two hands
once<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.740> through<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.119> really<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.299> goes

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
really kind of quick and then you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.880 
really kind of quick and then you
basically<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:27.000> finish<00:01:27.600> cutting<00:01:27.869> jump<00:01:28.770> on
