 There you go 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.969
 Christmas is horrible 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.930
 I have to get back to work 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.490
 after 500 ha 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.309
 quebec 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.640
 so yes canaccord in the world 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 like 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.230
 I'm done 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.450
 wonderful 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.720
 but this system 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.670
 does he really need you 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210
 blige premeditated ears 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.270
 listen to me more than victory 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.330
 you saved me 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.640
 and at the same time save Christmas 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.820
 this commitment 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.350
 promise me that you do not ask me more 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.100
 when all is over 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.360
 I hope that does not plan to take my place once again 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.890
 I told myself that you need a little help for a car 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.900
 adjusted 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.210
 we should not be used with all these preparations and I would also 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.210
 have a second chance to make a beautiful Christmas 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.450
 it's true that being Santa Claus is not easy 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.040
 but the chips 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.499
 what a nerve as soon as I see the joy on the children's faces 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:04.909
 who discovers what I brought them martic often unconscious he knows 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.660
 like that 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.659
 already humiliated 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.109
 schalke victory 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.519
 you like to startle children and see them tremble with fear 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.519
 what do you think the club has decided to take your place 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.630
 we both 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.749
 your job is very simple 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.149
 the best is to take care of my life 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:28.219
 and the worst 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.569
 the organizers wanted 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 we must do each 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.640
 he is the halloween symbol 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.149
 Catherine Glue 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.839
 the king of pumpkins 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.949
 to buy a nightmare 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.640
 and despite the fascination for the party 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.830
 the result 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.959
 halloween and what why since the facts 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.389
 it seems obvious to me the kids are counting on us 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.539
 so he needs you two months 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.789
 urgently 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.019
 you are right 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.189
 I am the mayor on the ground and if I launched myself into the void it's up to me 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.189
 it's up to find new and terrifying ideas 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:13.640
 because next 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.640
 several acts 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.289
 he has already done absolutely not 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:25.139
 we have to look at the cost of the project does not have the budget of the state of 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.649
 health causes a stir 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.649
 9th rate 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.119
 good luck jacques secretin anyway 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.639
 and here they go again 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.349
 yes I still have a lot of novelties and preparations completed 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.299
 access 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.679
 believe that this is not the moment more and more 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:53.999

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.199
 vaud 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.419

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.419

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.979

 or leave you 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.440
 one last thing 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.689
 will be 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.279

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.699
 if it is adopted saturday leaves to be bedded that Santa Claus 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.699

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.729
 it is true 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.729
 he transmits him but since the highest of seine 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.669

 but he does not give up 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.779
 and he does not forget 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.439
 if you believe in him 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.490
 then you will find him 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.820
