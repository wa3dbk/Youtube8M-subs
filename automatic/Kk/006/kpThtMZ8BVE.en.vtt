I<00:00:28.789> just<00:00:29.789> picked<00:00:30.030> this<00:00:30.240> truck<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.600> it<00:00:31.050> only

the<00:00:34.680> dash<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.180> doesn't<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.630> roll

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the dash but it doesn't actually roll

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.990 
the dash but it doesn't actually roll
over<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.600> most<00:00:39.870> likely<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.820> more<00:00:41.820> than

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
over so it most likely has more than

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.660 
over so it most likely has more than
that<00:00:42.350> I'd<00:00:43.350> say<00:00:43.380> at<00:00:43.649> least<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:44.190> hundred<00:00:44.430> ninety

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that I'd say at least one hundred ninety

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.930 
that I'd say at least one hundred ninety
eight<00:00:44.760> thousand<00:00:46.430> it's<00:00:47.430> been<00:00:47.610> sitting<00:00:47.910> here

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
eight thousand it's been sitting here

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.280 
eight thousand it's been sitting here
all<00:00:48.630> day<00:00:49.370> was<00:00:50.370> ten<00:00:50.850> degrees<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.390> morning<00:00:51.450> so

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
all day was ten degrees this morning so

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:03.380 
all day was ten degrees this morning so
we'll<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.950> how<00:00:53.070> easy<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.700> start<00:00:53.969> here

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.830 

a<00:01:03.450> little<00:01:03.989> bit<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.229> lifter<00:01:05.010> noise<00:01:05.630> right<00:01:06.630> out

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
a little bit of lifter noise right out

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
a little bit of lifter noise right out
the<00:01:06.990> gate<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.850> goes<00:01:09.120> away<00:01:09.270> quickly<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the gate but it goes away quickly I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.109 
the gate but it goes away quickly I
think<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.110> might<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.860> old<00:01:11.520> oil<00:01:11.729> pump

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
think it might just be the old oil pump

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:22.520 
think it might just be the old oil pump
there<00:01:20.690> pop<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.810> hood<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.290> she's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
there pop the hood and see how she's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:49.350 
there pop the hood and see how she's
running<00:01:22.830> underneath<00:01:23.220> there

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:02:00.430 

it's<00:01:50.360> got<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.659> famous<00:01:51.049> 302<00:01:51.409> oil<00:01:51.890> leak<00:01:59.440> other

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
it's got the famous 302 oil leak other

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.350 
it's got the famous 302 oil leak other
than<00:02:00.650> that<00:02:00.799> not<00:02:01.070> too<00:02:01.340> bad<00:02:01.549> for<00:02:01.880> an<00:02:01.970> old<00:02:02.119> beat-up

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
than that not too bad for an old beat-up

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.199 
than that not too bad for an old beat-up
two<00:02:02.750> wheel<00:02:02.960> drive<00:02:02.990> truck

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.619 

so<00:02:09.780> far<00:02:10.370> everything<00:02:11.370> works<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.969> it<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.269> far<00:02:12.480> as

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
so far everything works on it as far as

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:23.670 
so far everything works on it as far as
I<00:02:12.750> know

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.420 

seats<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.770> little<00:02:24.800> torn<00:02:25.160> up

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.270 

she<00:02:31.430> runs<00:02:31.610> pretty<00:02:31.820> good<00:02:31.940> though
