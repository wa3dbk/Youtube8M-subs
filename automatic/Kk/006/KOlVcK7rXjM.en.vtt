00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
that look the transformation of them but

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.190 
that look the transformation of them but
it<00:02:44.580> may<00:02:44.700> take<00:02:44.730> over<00:02:45.210> 10<00:02:45.450> years<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.780> complete

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200

so<00:02:48.480> we<00:02:48.600> would<00:02:48.720> like<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> make<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> part<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.620> them

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
so we would like to make a part of them

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.310 
so we would like to make a part of them
instead<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.100> just<00:02:50.310> waiting<00:02:50.520> ok<00:02:51.360> cool<00:02:51.570> being

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
that process like we go to the factory

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.530 
that process like we go to the factory
when<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:56.310> get<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.490> batch<00:02:56.700> done<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.360> do<00:02:57.420> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
modification of mold costs much more

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.150

time than we thought it would it is for

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160 
time than we thought it would it is for
both<00:03:08.340> us<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> factory<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.600> first<00:03:09.810> time<00:03:10.020> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
both us in the factory the first time to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.290 
both us in the factory the first time to
make<00:03:10.290> such<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> complex<00:03:11.040> figure<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.090> first

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
make such a complex figure and the first

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.870 
make such a complex figure and the first
batch<00:03:12.570> had<00:03:12.870> some<00:03:13.050> assembling<00:03:13.530> problems<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.730> we

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
batch had some assembling problems so we

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.850 
batch had some assembling problems so we
asked<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.240> factory<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.810> fix<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.440> then

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
asked the factory to fix it and then

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.160 
asked the factory to fix it and then
reproduce<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.610> cool<00:03:18.180> do<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.690> still<00:03:18.900> purchase
