00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
because I was originally sent as small

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.599 
because I was originally sent as small
but<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.410> was<00:03:59.500> really<00:03:59.709> too<00:04:00.010> small<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.310> really

but it was really too small I really
couldn't<00:04:00.850> even<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.120> couldn't<00:04:01.600> fit<00:04:01.840> my<00:04:01.989> wrist

have<00:04:05.079> a<00:04:05.109> zip<00:04:05.230> at<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.190> bottom<00:04:06.639> so<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:08.079> asked<00:04:09.069> if<00:04:09.250> I

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
have a zip at the bottom so I asked if I

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.099 
have a zip at the bottom so I asked if I
could<00:04:09.519> give<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.120> away<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.600> one<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.019> my
