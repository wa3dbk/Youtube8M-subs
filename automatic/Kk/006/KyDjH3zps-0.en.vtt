00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:09.360
 that's it in general here I bought 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.820
 counter tumanki even dive 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.300
 fog lights 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:23.730
 high beam headlights but due to the fact that not 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:30.230
 believe here will show that's what they themselves 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.230
 represents the 27th 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:42.030
 2 it turns out we do not really 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.920
 but 9 LEDs 3 watts 520 it 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:51.440
 commodity we are here so they look at 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 car now see their work 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 at first 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.469
 LED headlamps only 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:08.450
 it looks like this 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:12.080
 cool and capture a small close 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.080
 toyota sprinter machine 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.810
 98 year 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.810
 so it looks from the car 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.060
 here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:33.400
 rather saves our hood 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.860
 so it looks if you meet ahead 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:48.039
 very strong bright 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:51.520
 this is a strip that's if you put here 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.390
 so as not quite arranged here for 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.860
 beam it certainly does not pull a 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.170
 for the neighbor itself, then the total power 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.289
 happens 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.200
 1 27 both 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:16.269
 much more now check it out with 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:22.030
 pairs of low beam headlights and lower 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:26.850
 colors here are dim light pairs and shine 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 than without protivotumanok it is clear that 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.280
 tumankami 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.500
 usually illuminated much better but here 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.490
 so here 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.490
 so the light looks like 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.580
 side hood center 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.450
 it's high beam 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.450
 my usb river 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.800
 This is the main beam foglights 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.800
 stadiums 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.150
 much better 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:09.459
 Well, to be honest, 70 centimeters 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:12.450
 fog lights shine but not 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.450
 generally not bad light 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.370
 so now when will regulate 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:26.590
 further down by the way red is suspended 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.590
 there is such a topic with us 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.910
 this and the sprint in the door open 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.150
 so long ago put two more muffler and 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:51.250
 machine theme scary mechanics 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.760
 improvement but here is a photo 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.260
 video report just a diode on banks 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.710
 I said from China 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:05.610
 they walked me almost a month respectfully 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:08.850
 expensive just somewhere in the 1700s is not normal 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.850
 but now
