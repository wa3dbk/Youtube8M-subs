00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.740
 the curious thing of this spring or this 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.330
 year in general that I remember on day 10 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.610
 March this year a storm 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.139
 electric in santiago with heat a 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.969
 storm like the one that has all the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.290
 less tropical climates but we're going to 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.420
 starting to dance the beasties of 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.160
 areas where there are no winds so 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.529
 strong as precisely the area 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.210
 Central is a windy area will 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.460
 vibrate episodes of wind yesterday in 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.460
 santiago mailbox of patagonia 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.460
 what happens now is that I feel that it is 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.109
 because one is afraid of radio 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:43.609
 one is afraid of water you have the 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:46.010
 importance of that grate obviously 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.959
 collapsible metal and one says old ya 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.059
 everything that happens inside is sure the 

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:55.399
 day of the downloads and they were one 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.749
 that you relax you get roof race with 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.749
 walls and everything else 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.850
 awesome we are seeing a set 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.100
 images of the same storm lashing 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.910
 in Japan 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.530
 well in fact like what are you 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.110
 writing and once I had to go up 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.420
 I was on the plane I had the Santiago mine and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.010
 At some point the pilot shows you me 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.220
 It was good to be able to take the meat, you say good 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.080
 there it shows the cloudiness that there is and 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.430
 the colors determine that in some in 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.830
 a part where because everything is the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.780
 red color can not be passed because the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.880
 condensation of 93 serious plane 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.800
 what was moving disintegrates what 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.200
 lining the fan and passes us 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.740
 let's join that separation with the next 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.869
 because it looks like flights but the house 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.750
 we agreed when you get it, say look, look 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.850
 of garbage are loaded or are tremendous 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.950
 metal things by braiding like 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.990
 because they are not anchored he got inside 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.570
 of the deposit and started the bald and what 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.649
 threw against all the cars the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.660
 that are recording a couple of 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.570
 teenagers who laugh at nerves that 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.070
 can not believe it look at the 380 auto a 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.660
 those and that among 10 people raise it 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.580
 with much difficulty and the wind 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.580
 take like they want to blow a fluff 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.140
 we have also lived long before 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.670
 get to have two incredible now like this 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.130
 is that when we speak that he was in the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.900
 most seismic country in the world we 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.120
 we have much more less than the earthquake 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.310
 itself to the solar look and the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.140
 next video please all this and 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.420
 by the end of this year only happens 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 attention please look at the post 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.910
 that then people can not stand and 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.910
 obviously with heat 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:47.379
 is exactly what all the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.000
 corn mangroves are tremendous crime the 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.579
 to calculate the million dollars that is 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.439
 that has gone through the winter but now 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.480
 we spent money costing say 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.120
 I wanted to grow as a kind of television 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.069
 that over the years the signs there owe us 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.359
 install super well that they were clear 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.079
 nothing to see how we do it in Chile 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:10.230
 even so they manage to free themselves from flying 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.230
 also knowing 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.930
 because for them of all life 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.489
 Now look for the next video 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.489
 this impressive when the water 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:32.879
 in the boats it does not happen to you 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.010
 how many three seconds where that in a 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.379
 wet road alone with the rain 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.319
 people walking and suddenly the sea is 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.500
 took a large portion of what is 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.500
 now 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:51.450
 those images that were recorded was 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.000
 with the collective unconscious 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.379
 sorry if I tell you what are some 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.030
 of the most powerful videos that I am 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.260
 bringing today without a doubt the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.260
 which is coming now 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.510
 this is bravo old I'm dying or not 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.150
 they see him technically at heart 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.370
 there is nothing 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.870
 man wants to start in japan 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.870
 inform on your ship 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:25.550
 and water the vehicle on a street is 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.500
 piss off the car is floating can not 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.860
 get out self truth the driver lose 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.449
 with 261 second your home what demonstrates 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.250
 that the tsunami does not necessarily have 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.919
 what to see with a wave a train of waves 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.150
 giants but you 'll literally see that 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.150
 in one minute there is no water 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:52.479
 flood most of the others are 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.479
 ready to navigate some things 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.930
 classic but it's not very nice either 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.840
 I had control 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.789
 please do not forget a dry street 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.050
 where only the transfer was started and 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.880
 not only to the back but also to the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.979
 in front of those trucks besides those that 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.020
 they come in front they are driven by 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.660
 Water 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.669
 the type already lost the color since we 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.160
 serves the handlebar let's say accelerator 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.530
 I brake the water does what it wants with you 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.330
 I tear you out of the bag the bread has a 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.129
 street was transformed into a river is high 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.080
 there's a good there that focused alan 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.819
 says that the best thing is that it raises the coin 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.860
 of the water they wrote down until the 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.139
 obviously common criterion tell you that 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.879
 when the water exceeds the limit of 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.229
 door and there you have to open the 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.539
 windows because later he can not 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.280
 open up clear if the water covers you full 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.960
 and you have the doors closed is not going to 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.879
 to be able to speak because the pressure of 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.830
 night when you plan to go up you have to 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.300
 only better to get clear waters 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.310
 but finally he will be able to open the 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.630
 plant and you can go out and 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.819
 rack made to try to grab 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.970
 anything because in a tsunami what 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.830
 that kills you is not so much the accomplished one is 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.509
 that the amount of things that hit you 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.099
 It is much clearer than the way you are 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.110
 dragging and you're hitting a car 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.940
 an old garbage container a term 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.860
 ceiling and that's what many people 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.630
 Well, of course, because what is eager to 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.280
 important week because it does not have 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.080
 necessarily to do with the speed 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.120
 that comes in fact one sees there and we go 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.060
 at high speed nothing but clear that 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.520
 I have a truck in my head even if I go 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.040
 but for now it kills you and selena that 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.710
 they moored the ass well portrayed in a 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.710
 movie yes of course 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:32.180
 of the Southeast Asian tsunami is 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.180
 highly attention with
