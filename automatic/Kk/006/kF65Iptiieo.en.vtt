 case I find even better resp 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.870
 the first single quite cool the second 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.640
 was also very cool but I think now 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.810
 also a little better 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.360
 That's why I'm very excited 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.310
 the album will come soon 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.620
 so who are now no longer friends 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.660

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.120
 full of action and perry adwords from 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.060
 lumix g2 has been around for a while now 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.650

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.880
 now that explained very sweetly they said 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.760
 namely Perry would be the perfect one 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.680
 Daughter-in-law they plan where else 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.500
 no wedding so that's still going on 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.970
 bit but she wants that up 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.980
 any case that the two somehow 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.740
 come together later because they are perry 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.810
 So nice and they just love it so much 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.040

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.649
 you find the two fit perfectly 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.170
 together or do you think who should 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.230
 rather come to you or to you or 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.100
 whatever said your opinions below 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.560
 at the comments 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.090
 yes and to investigate apropos have the yes 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.100

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.140
 madison square likes to play in new york 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.459
 and there is one or there was one 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.380
 super cool surprise 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.630
 who suddenly gets out of the background 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.870
 came out and with the guys say that 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.870
 Now 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.520
 from 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.680
 so the chairman comes to it at once 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.720
 the qs he is a very very good friend of 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.160
 Harry and the other guys and 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.650
 favorite she also described by him 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.060
 he thinks that one hears it too 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.350
 six also makes a very good figure 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.450

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.350

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.900

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.800
