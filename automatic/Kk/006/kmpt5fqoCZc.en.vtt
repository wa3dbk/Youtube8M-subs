in this video will show you how to set
up<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.060> control<00:00:03.449> software<00:00:03.720> for<00:00:04.259> turning

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
up the control software for turning

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.070 
up the control software for turning
between<00:00:05.009> centers<00:00:05.450> will<00:00:06.450> assume<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:06.839> you

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
between centers will assume that you

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.870 
between centers will assume that you
have<00:00:07.379> already<00:00:07.649> performed<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.460> startup

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
have already performed the startup

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.780 
have already performed the startup
routine<00:00:09.300> if<00:00:10.080> not<00:00:10.380> you'll<00:00:11.070> want<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.400> refer<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
routine if not you'll want to refer to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.099 
routine if not you'll want to refer to
the<00:00:11.910> startup<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.509> shutdown<00:00:12.540> video<00:00:15.109> first

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
the startup and shutdown video first

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.540 
the startup and shutdown video first
we'll<00:00:16.470> simply<00:00:16.830> go<00:00:16.949> through<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> setup

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
we'll simply go through the setup

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.640 
we'll simply go through the setup
without<00:00:17.789> any<00:00:18.180> explanation<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.500> can

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
without any explanation so that you can

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.550 
without any explanation so that you can
see<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:20.250> quick<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.730> easy<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.240> is

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
see just how quick and easy it really is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.840 
see just how quick and easy it really is
then<00:00:22.560> we'll<00:00:22.740> come<00:00:22.949> back<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.400> go<00:00:23.550> through<00:00:23.760> the
