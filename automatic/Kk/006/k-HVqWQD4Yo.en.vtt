some sort of temperature measuring

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.760 
some sort of temperature measuring
device<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> think<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.560> judge

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
device but I think I think I can judge

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.050 
device but I think I think I can judge
it<00:01:07.920> pretty<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:08.310> seen<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.729> I've<00:01:08.880> done<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it pretty well seen as I've done this

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.760 
it pretty well seen as I've done this
many<00:01:09.330> times<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:09.990> worked<00:01:10.229> every<00:01:10.409> time

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
many times and it's worked every time

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.429 
many times and it's worked every time
I've<00:01:11.010> perfected<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> way<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
I've perfected the way to do this the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.289 
I've perfected the way to do this the
next<00:01:13.710> steps<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:14.100> tricky<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.909> need<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> grab

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
next steps very tricky you need to grab

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.570 
next steps very tricky you need to grab
a<00:01:15.330> pair<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> scissors<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.259> cut<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.400> tip

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
a pair of scissors and just cut the tip

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.420 
a pair of scissors and just cut the tip
off<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> every<00:01:18.240> corner<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:19.430> obviously

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
off of every corner like this obviously

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
off of every corner like this obviously
be<00:01:20.610> careful<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.509> cut<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> cards<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
be careful you don't cut the cards and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
be careful you don't cut the cards and
you<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> try<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.939> keep<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> pack<00:01:24.420> as

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you want to try and keep the pack as

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.109 
you want to try and keep the pack as
sealed<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.680> well<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:26.790> don't<00:01:27.000> want

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
sealed as you can as well you don't want

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.469 
sealed as you can as well you don't want
to<00:01:27.210> open<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.659> too<00:01:27.930> much<00:01:28.170> by<00:01:28.470> doing<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.479> there

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
to open it too much by doing this there

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.210 
to open it too much by doing this there
we<00:01:30.600> go

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
we go

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.890 
we go
so<00:01:32.220> once<00:01:32.579> you've<00:01:32.820> cut<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.540> corners

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
so once you've cut all of the corners

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.469 
so once you've cut all of the corners
off<00:01:34.049> very<00:01:34.380> carefully<00:01:34.820> you'll<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:36.000> left<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
off very carefully you'll be left with a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.920 
off very carefully you'll be left with a
pack<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> looks<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:39.360> next<00:01:39.689> step

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
pack that looks like this the next step

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.340 
pack that looks like this the next step
we<00:01:40.049> want<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:42.119> want<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> go<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
we want to do is you want to go down to
