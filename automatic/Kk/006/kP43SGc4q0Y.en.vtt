00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
nutless I had to hold the base as I turn

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.490 
nutless I had to hold the base as I turn
it<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.210> I'm<00:02:06.420> trying<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.689> film<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.049> explain

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
it it I'm trying to film this explain

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.249 
it it I'm trying to film this explain
what<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.710> did<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.179> turn<00:02:09.360> with<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:09.599> hand<00:02:09.989> if

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
what I did so just turn with one hand if

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.660 
what I did so just turn with one hand if
the<00:02:10.410> base<00:02:10.560> starts<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> spin<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.310> hold<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.580> in

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the base starts to spin just hold it in

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
the base starts to spin just hold it in
place<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.000> it'll<00:02:12.150> break<00:02:12.330> free<00:02:12.599> for<00:02:12.810> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
place and it'll break free for you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:27.949 
place and it'll break free for you
and<00:02:14.220> then<00:02:22.610> turn<00:02:23.610> over<00:02:26.360> remove<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.870> I'll

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
and then turn over remove this and I'll

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.839 
and then turn over remove this and I'll
show<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> little<00:02:28.799> Kim's<00:02:29.190> art<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.580> need

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
show you with a little Kim's art I need

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.930 
show you with a little Kim's art I need
to<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.060> place<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.780> make<00:02:30.930> gear<00:02:31.230> agitated<00:02:32.040> working

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:48.550 

and<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.299> think<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:38.030> somehow

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:03:00.619 

take<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.799> off<00:02:52.640> look<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.849> take

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
take this off look like that and take

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:09.699 
take this off look like that and take
the<00:03:00.780> belt<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.319> like<00:03:01.409> a<00:03:01.500> spring<00:03:01.769> on<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.129> one

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.250 

and<00:03:10.709> take<00:03:11.670> off<00:03:11.819> flip<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.180> over<00:03:12.239> alright<00:03:12.780> so

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
and take off flip it over alright so

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.890 
and take off flip it over alright so
right<00:03:13.500> underneath<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:14.489> here's<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.659> little

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
right underneath this here's the little

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.770 
right underneath this here's the little
dog<00:03:16.140> ears<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:17.340> replaced<00:03:18.060> these<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.269> little<00:03:18.599> while

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
dog ears I replaced these a little while

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.920 
dog ears I replaced these a little while
ago<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.410> what<00:03:20.160> happens<00:03:20.609> is<00:03:20.910> these<00:03:21.750> little

ridges<00:03:22.230> we're<00:03:22.799> out<00:03:22.950> over<00:03:23.790> time<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.299> they<00:03:25.139> stop

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
ridges we're out over time and they stop

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.150 
ridges we're out over time and they stop
grabbing<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:27.470> spinning<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.500> agitator<00:03:28.950> so

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
grabbing and spinning the agitator so

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.830 
grabbing and spinning the agitator so
like<00:03:29.310> go<00:03:29.730> back<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.090> forth<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.419> they<00:03:30.540> come<00:03:30.750> out

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
like go back and forth and they come out

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
like this and they kind of go back and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.119 
like this and they kind of go back and
forth<00:03:32.519> by<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.480> washes<00:03:34.079> churning<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.709> wash

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
forth by a washes churning of the wash

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.430 
forth by a washes churning of the wash
machine<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.669> replace<00:03:36.000> these<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.660> think<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.260> said

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
machine so replace these I think I said

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.780 
machine so replace these I think I said
it<00:03:37.560> has<00:03:37.709> three<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:38.400> actually<00:03:38.549> has

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
it has three but this one actually has

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.900 
it has three but this one actually has
four<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.680> if<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.829> go<00:03:40.950> online<00:03:41.069> look<00:03:41.430> up<00:03:41.579> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
four and if you go online look up the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.849 
four and if you go online look up the
meet<00:03:42.209> year<00:03:42.389> make<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:42.599> model<00:03:42.750> your<00:03:43.139> machine<00:03:43.530> I

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
meet year make and model your machine I

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.110 
meet year make and model your machine I
bought<00:03:43.889> these<00:03:44.190> online<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.790> think<00:03:45.000> they're

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
bought these online and I think they're

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.280 
bought these online and I think they're
like<00:03:45.299> ten<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.410> ten<00:03:46.590> dollars<00:03:46.799> shipped<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.290> if

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
like ten to ten dollars shipped so if

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.960 
like ten to ten dollars shipped so if
you<00:03:49.410> need<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.709> replace<00:03:49.919> them<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.400> GT<00:03:50.819> to

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
you need to replace them for a GT to

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.740 
you need to replace them for a GT to
stops<00:03:51.209> working

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
stops working

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.439 
stops working
that's<00:03:51.989> how<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.169> get<00:03:52.379> at<00:03:52.530> them<00:03:53.389> should<00:03:54.389> be

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
that's how to get at them should be

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.629 
that's how to get at them should be
pretty<00:03:55.440> much<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.620> same<00:03:55.949> on<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.160> lot<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.430> different

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
pretty much a same on a lot of different

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.800 
pretty much a same on a lot of different
