was<00:00:15.690> having<00:00:15.929> difficulties<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:17.039> laptop<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
was having difficulties with my laptop I

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.599 
was having difficulties with my laptop I
guess<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.410> two<00:00:19.560> years<00:00:19.590> old<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
guess it's about two years old it's a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.109 
guess it's about two years old it's a
gaming<00:00:20.939> pc<00:00:21.500> laptop<00:00:22.500> PC<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> PC<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.060> a

gaming pc laptop PC or not a PC just a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.529 
gaming pc laptop PC or not a PC just a
laptop<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.130> it's<00:00:26.130> pretty<00:00:26.400> quick<00:00:26.699> against<00:00:27.060> i7

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
laptop and it's pretty quick against i7

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.080 
laptop and it's pretty quick against i7
processors<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.619> 2.2<00:00:29.429> gigahertz<00:00:31.850> with<00:00:32.850> an

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
processors it's a 2.2 gigahertz with an

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
processors it's a 2.2 gigahertz with an
intel<00:00:33.420> boost<00:00:33.690> up<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.079> 3.2<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:37.160> think<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
intel boost up to 3.2 and I think the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.560 
intel boost up to 3.2 and I think the
ram<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.910> getting<00:00:39.120> old<00:00:39.239> because<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
ram was just getting old because it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.840 
ram was just getting old because it
started<00:00:39.870> making<00:00:40.500> sounds<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> messing<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.700> my

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
started making sounds and messing up my

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.479 
started making sounds and messing up my
recording<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.480> good<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.780> yeah<00:00:43.219> like<00:00:44.219> just

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
recording so good like yeah like just

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.450 
recording so good like yeah like just
for<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> second<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.649> enough<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.190> throw

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
for a second but it was enough to throw

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.709 
for a second but it was enough to throw
off<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:48.770> recording<00:00:49.770> tour<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> tried<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.479 
off my recording tour when I tried to
edit<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.260> Sony<00:00:52.590> Vegas<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.250> would<00:00:53.370> actually

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
edit it in Sony Vegas it would actually

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
edit it in Sony Vegas it would actually
just<00:00:53.850> crash<00:00:54.180> Sony<00:00:54.510> Vegas<00:00:54.750> because<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.530> was

from eight megabytes of ram to 16
megabytes<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.649> ram<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.460> since

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
megabytes of ram so it's actually since

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
megabytes of ram so it's actually since
i've<00:01:48.119> done<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.619> it's<00:01:49.619> actually<00:01:49.890> going

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
i've done that it's actually going

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.749

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
dual shock charge but a yeah let's uh if

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.950 
dual shock charge but a yeah let's uh if
you<00:06:16.900> hold<00:06:17.140> triangle<00:06:18.150> release<00:06:19.150> it<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.510> tap<00:06:19.810> it

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
you hold triangle release it and tap it

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.520 
you hold triangle release it and tap it
again<00:06:20.140> it<00:06:20.260> does<00:06:20.440> this<00:06:21.930> which<00:06:22.930> is<00:06:23.110> pretty<00:06:23.290> cool

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
again it does this which is pretty cool
