essentially based on the media tech 6589
chipset<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:25.330> do<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.660> identical<00:03:26.200> specs

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
chipset so you do have identical specs

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.840 
chipset so you do have identical specs
well<00:03:26.590> if<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.770> compare<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.520> micromax

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
well if you compare it to the micromax

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.130 
well if you compare it to the micromax
