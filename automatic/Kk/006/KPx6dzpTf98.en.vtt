kind of entry into the more serious and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.649 
kind of entry into the more serious and
to<00:01:59.430> watch<00:01:59.610> to<00:02:00.090> over<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.689> watches

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.030 
Moon but now I think it might be
the<00:02:13.000> maybe<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:13.990> supposed<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.320> be<00:02:14.440> like<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.830> the

as<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.250> transitional<00:03:58.090> because<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:59.200> has<00:03:59.380> the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
as the transitional because it has the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.330 
as the transitional because it has the
old-style

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
old-style

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.830 
old-style

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
acrylic crystal you know plastic but it

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.370 
acrylic crystal you know plastic but it
still<00:04:05.050> has<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.410> white<00:04:05.620> gold<00:04:05.890> our<00:04:06.220> markers<00:04:07.380> I

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
still has the white gold our markers I

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.230 
still has the white gold our markers I
don't<00:04:08.770> that's<00:04:08.890> correct<00:04:09.400> clinic<00:04:09.700> transitional

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
don't that's correct clinic transitional

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.880 
don't that's correct clinic transitional
I'm<00:04:10.300> not<00:04:10.480> sure<00:04:10.630> maybe<00:04:10.870> see<00:04:11.170> badger<00:04:11.410> or<00:04:11.620> someone

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
I'm not sure maybe see badger or someone

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.360 
I'm not sure maybe see badger or someone

more knowledgeable will be able to
answer<00:04:15.370> this<00:04:15.490> by<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.730> was<00:04:16.330> like<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:16.480> impression

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
answer this by I was like the impression

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.800 
answer this by I was like the impression
transitional<00:04:17.410> was<00:04:17.560> more<00:04:17.770> like<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.820> 1680

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
transitional was more like the the 1680

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.409 
transitional was more like the the 1680
zero<00:04:20.410> or<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.890> one<00:04:21.040> six<00:04:21.280> seven<00:04:21.370> five<00:04:21.609> zero<00:04:21.669> like

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
zero or the one six seven five zero like

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.030 
zero or the one six seven five zero like
where<00:04:22.990> they<00:04:23.080> specifically<00:04:23.650> gave<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.979> a

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
where they specifically gave it a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.760 
where they specifically gave it a
different

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.279 
different
reference<00:04:25.099> number<00:04:25.720> but<00:04:26.720> something<00:04:27.020> clear

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
reference number but something clear

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.420 
reference number but something clear
transitional<00:04:27.800> because<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:28.099> was<00:04:28.190> like<00:04:28.280> after

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
transitional because it was like after

don't worry as much they used to kind of

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.730 
don't worry as much they used to kind of
not<00:04:43.280> sure<00:04:43.400> why<00:04:44.199> maybe<00:04:45.199> because<00:04:45.319> it's<00:04:45.620> in<00:04:45.710> such

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740

so<00:05:15.319> yeah<00:05:15.470> so<00:05:15.830> that's<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.099> watch<00:05:16.250> which<00:05:16.639> I'll

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
so yeah so that's the watch which I'll

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.689 
so yeah so that's the watch which I'll
just<00:05:16.969> put<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.270> down<00:05:17.389> there<00:05:17.449> and<00:05:17.900> then<00:05:18.860> we<00:05:19.580> got

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
just put it down there and then we got

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.390 
just put it down there and then we got
in<00:05:19.819> the<00:05:19.880> box<00:05:20.469> but<00:05:21.469> the<00:05:21.620> felt<00:05:21.860> thing<00:05:22.069> as<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.280> said

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
in the box but the felt thing as I said

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.080 
in the box but the felt thing as I said
earlier<00:05:22.639> weight<00:05:22.759> about<00:05:22.940> watch<00:05:23.180> sits<00:05:23.449> on<00:05:25.090> we've

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
earlier weight about watch sits on we've

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.230 
earlier weight about watch sits on we've
got<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:27.190> hang<00:05:28.190> tag<00:05:28.520> which<00:05:28.819> I<00:05:28.969> guess<00:05:29.090> would

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
got the hang tag which I guess would

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.809 
got the hang tag which I guess would
have<00:05:29.710> hung<00:05:30.710> on<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:30.949> watch<00:05:31.130> and<00:05:31.400> had<00:05:31.550> maybe<00:05:31.729> the

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
have hung on the watch and had maybe the

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.089 
have hung on the watch and had maybe the
price<00:05:32.180> or<00:05:32.599> you<00:05:32.930> know<00:05:33.080> whether<00:05:33.500> when<00:05:33.860> I<00:05:33.889> was<00:05:34.039> in

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
price or you know whether when I was in

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.180 
price or you know whether when I was in
the<00:05:34.190> jeweler's<00:05:34.490> window<00:05:38.710> extra<00:05:39.710> links<00:05:40.009> which

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
the jeweler's window extra links which

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.879 
the jeweler's window extra links which
because<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:41.020> despite<00:05:42.020> being<00:05:42.169> quite<00:05:42.289> tall<00:05:42.620> I've

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889

got very thin wrists so I kind of have

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.659 
got very thin wrists so I kind of have
to<00:05:44.479> take<00:05:44.719> a<00:05:44.750> few<00:05:44.930> links<00:05:45.139> out<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.800> hand<00:05:46.490> then

to take a few links out and hand then

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.230 
to take a few links out and hand then
use<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.389> micro<00:05:47.690> adjust<00:05:47.990> back<00:05:49.060> so<00:05:50.060> yeah

four<00:06:53.400> pounds<00:06:53.850> which<00:06:54.030> you<00:06:54.360> did<00:06:55.050> that<00:06:55.260> in<00:06:55.500> looks

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
four pounds which you did that in looks

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.780 
four pounds which you did that in looks
like<00:06:56.490> September<00:06:57.210> 1986<00:06:58.110> so<00:06:59.070> I've<00:06:59.490> got<00:06:59.610> no<00:06:59.760> idea

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
like September 1986 so I've got no idea

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.940 
like September 1986 so I've got no idea
if<00:07:00.240> that's<00:07:00.480> what<00:07:00.870> that<00:07:01.020> is<00:07:01.140> adjusted<00:07:01.920> for

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
if that's what that is adjusted for

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.620 
if that's what that is adjusted for
inflation<00:07:02.070> but<00:07:02.940> I<00:07:03.000> think<00:07:03.210> it<00:07:03.300> seems<00:07:03.450> like

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
inflation but I think it seems like

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.040 
inflation but I think it seems like
pretty<00:07:03.840> good<00:07:03.930> value<00:07:05.750> so<00:07:06.750> yeah<00:07:06.810> it's<00:07:06.960> pretty

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
pretty good value so yeah it's pretty

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.410 
pretty good value so yeah it's pretty
again<00:07:07.470> you<00:07:08.040> know<00:07:08.100> nothing<00:07:08.880> is<00:07:09.030> going<00:07:09.060> to<00:07:09.300> make

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.420 
again you know nothing is going to make

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
again you know nothing is going to make
any<00:07:09.540> difference<00:07:09.630> but<00:07:10.050> I<00:07:10.110> just<00:07:10.200> think<00:07:10.290> it's

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
any difference but I just think it's

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.890 
any difference but I just think it's
kind<00:07:10.560> of<00:07:10.590> cool<00:07:10.740> to<00:07:10.770> have<00:07:10.980> this<00:07:11.160> stuff<00:07:11.750> I'll<00:07:12.750> put

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
kind of cool to have this stuff I'll put

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.930 
kind of cool to have this stuff I'll put
it<00:07:12.990> over<00:07:13.020> there<00:07:13.260> and<00:07:13.410> then<00:07:13.580> the<00:07:14.580> guarantee

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
it over there and then the guarantee

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.030 
it over there and then the guarantee
certificate<00:07:15.260> obviously<00:07:16.260> is<00:07:16.740> way<00:07:16.890> out

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
certificate obviously is way out

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.590 
certificate obviously is way out
guarantee<00:07:17.460> you<00:07:17.700> know<00:07:17.820> if<00:07:17.880> I<00:07:17.970> touched<00:07:18.150> of<00:07:18.300> Rolex
