00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
bring it down because then you'll just

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
bring it down because then you'll just
take<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> top<00:00:50.760> knot<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.270> middle<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.690> to

take the top knot to the middle not to
the<00:00:52.379> lower<00:00:52.530> knots<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.949> it'll<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.309> harder

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the lower knots and it'll just be harder

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.939 
the lower knots and it'll just be harder
like<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
like that so what you want to do is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
like that so what you want to do is
split<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.219> hair<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.460> sections<00:00:57.350> start<00:00:58.350> from

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
split your hair in sections start from

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.689 
split your hair in sections start from
the<00:00:58.590> bottom<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.100> work<00:01:00.090> your<00:01:00.120> way<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> top

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this method is easiest for me and I just

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
this method is easiest for me and I just
put<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> head<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> back<00:01:08.180> don't<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.299> just

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
put the head to the back don't you just

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.480

do<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> same

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.039 

I<00:01:13.549> know<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:14.299> looks<00:01:14.450> like<00:01:14.600> I'm<00:01:14.720> being<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.930> bit

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
I know it looks like I'm being a bit

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.530 
I know it looks like I'm being a bit
tough<00:01:15.229> on<00:01:15.320> my<00:01:15.470> hair<00:01:15.680> but<00:01:16.189> that<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.329> what<00:01:17.450> I've

much a healthy I guess so this is just
what<00:01:23.899> I<00:01:23.930> do<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:24.830> then<00:01:25.580> when<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.700> get<00:01:25.850> bored<00:01:26.060> I

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
start taking bigger sections then I'll

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.320
