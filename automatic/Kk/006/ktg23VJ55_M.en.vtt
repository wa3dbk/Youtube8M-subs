00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.710
 he 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.340
 hi to all and glitter cecile haxo 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.560
 so today we find ourselves on 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.390
 toulouse i beats of course on 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.820
 battlefield 3 for a brand new guide 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.009
 ch exclusively on my channel that tom 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.379
 and I found you remember you 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.329
 could go out there is not very 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.089
 long in thanks to a maul breach with 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.650
 of the c42 this map whose claude rich was 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.079
 patched up and let me introduce you to 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.000
 new way to get out of this one 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.890
 just go first there 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.440
 where we are currently on the map and the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.540
 purpose of the head to jump on its chandeliers 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.920
 so your friend will have to lie down on 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.140
 the side of these illustrious you you 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.180
 do it to get on and so 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.839
 you're going to have to do the technique of 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.089
 the short scale 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.430
 like in the previous glitch so you 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.199
 give a signal your friend will put himself 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.310
 squatting you skip a little bit 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.070
 to be able to stand on him and 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.110
 so you will give him a signal 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.240
 and this time he's going to stand up 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.909
 and you just have to jump and you 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.710
 shift on the beam quietly a 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.140
 times on the beam you just have that at 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.940
 walk towards fnath height so towards 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 the windows put your beacon so that 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.560
 your friend can and well this pony with 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.360
 you and so you are in out of map 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.240
 both of you quietly 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.659
 can rediscover the nooks and crannies 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.300
 of the map and well that's all 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.979
 simply admire the fnap height and 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.479
 of course you can kill the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.159
 enemies that are inside the map 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.680
 but know that bleaching is 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.630
 extremely hard to achieve we had 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.630
 really a lot of luck to succeed 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.850
 in one go but so yeah in 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.770
 line it's downright impossible 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.049
 have you kill mehdi to the only 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.360
 attempt or kill so that serves 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.740
 strictly nothing to achieve this guide 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.270
 online 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.130
 this is it so I hope this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.180
 video will have pleased you do not hesitate to
