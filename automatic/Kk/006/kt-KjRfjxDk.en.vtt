00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hi good people then for toys and 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.560
 Today's gadgets will do something 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.800
 that the 1 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.710
 I love it, it's yakissoba. 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.780
 I love how it goes up I ask direct 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.990
 is that on the question made at home only 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.730
 It is very expensive and there are places I 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.199
 I already know that I like there are places that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 I could regret having asked. 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.650
 Because I do not know, it never seems like that. 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.170
 way and I is to understand that meat soup 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.390
 of chicken and the most common is the traditional 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.730
 meat yakissoba with chicken 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.149
 I do not like chicken but I'm very 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 More fan of the only meat honda ex 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.950
 so I 'm going to teach it and I'm from 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.629
 meat but the difference between it the chicken 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.539
 It's just the chicken so it's just to sit. 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.510
 chicken and everything is fine and I will explain how 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.039
 It makes at home super easy I will do so 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.840
 I'll leave more to do in winter 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.899
 Because the heat is killing and eating. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.539
 thing here in the difficult state but I did 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.940
 a few days ago it's a delight my parents 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.650
 I'm not much of a fan of Japanese food. 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.680
 they are so much like the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.909
 ex the normal bank and that thing you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 you can put the ingredients that you 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.520
 like what you do not like you do not 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.860
 what is the bar is at home and in the other 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 good thing that does not get so expensive 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.060
 you can make individual portions of the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.640
 What can you do for the whole family? 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.150
 It's supposed to be very, very very much. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 Good, I liked it and we're going to recipe 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.220
 So good to start, we're going to cook. 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.430
 on steam a little broccoli 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.530
 so I put it there in the drainer 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.320
 of pasta on top of a pan with 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.930
 boiling water in the pack 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.760
 in another pot while we go 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.880
 cook the pasta 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.180
 I'll use ex's own pasta or you 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.010
 found in some markets and whether or not 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.080
 or you can use ordinary noodles 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.840
 spaghetti pasta 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.540
 so I'll cook 250 grams of 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.840
 noodles with boiling water a little 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.340
 I'll add 150 grams and leave 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.610
 cooking while in another pan 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.920
 or cook a carrot and each one of them 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.440
 Already the kitchen now let's do it 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.459
 a mix I'll add one 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.580
 spoon of maize and a half cup of tea 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.680
 then mix well to dissolve 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.800
 the maize that we will use this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.100
 mix later it 's just good to play and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.690
 save that later we will use 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.680
 Good while in another pan Let's go 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.320
 add olive oil so much olive oil 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.620
 We fry our meat and chicken. 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.140
 or add a little garlic with 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.250
 paste onions very little 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.560
 thing and 300 grams of falls in case who 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.570
 you want, you can only make 300 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:02.320
 chicken or melts in 50 grams of meat 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.610
 and 150 grams of chicken 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.519
 then stir the pan until cooking 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.410
 flesh will release the liquid from the meat 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.370
 It's what gives a little taste. 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.640
 the eye let's add a quarter of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.570
 cup of shoyu mix well 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.750
 a half a tablespoon of sugar 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.010
 to take away some of the very salty 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.960
 show you have to be careful with the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.060
 amount you are going to use now 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.280
 that mix that we made of 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.750
 with water, we add and 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.880
 mix well 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.950
 This will dry our sauce. 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.590
 thickening of the eye then decreases 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.740
 temperature has come down from your fire to 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.900
 burn nothing mix and now let's 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.540
 add the other ingredients already 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.540
 cooked our carrot that has already attacked 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.360
 cidinha and broccoli 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.980
 they are without seasoning because the seasoning 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.800
 It will be the sauce itself. 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.290
 I add all the ingredients and 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.140
 mix well 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.080
 It is important for you and proving and seeing how 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.000
 is the taste of our whole thing 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.220
 which can add a little shoyu 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.300
 but be very careful you can not stay 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.580
 very salty 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.010
 You see you're a little 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.959
 sauce you add or not 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.860
 so now I'm adding a 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.830
 cup of chard or cabbage tea then 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.400
 you find you prefer visit the 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.380
 chopped cabbage and if you do not need cuse 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.450
 and now let's add our 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.210
 pasta that I have already chosen it already is already 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.240
 with the single I have already chosen and mix 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.760
 We have to mix for shoyu the 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.430
 shoyu the ingredients and the pasta 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.210
 mix is ​​our sauce 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.880
 mixing well you put a little 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.949
 in a glass bowl to serve you 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.479
 You can eat on your cumbands, it's just like 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.680
 It is made on the casters guguinha and serve 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.990
 hot 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.210
 well then I served in cumbuquinhas and 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.280
 can serve on the dish that eats as the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.400
 hashish and acrylics you can also eat with 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.259
 knife and fork and it feels very 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.840
 very good is worth trying 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.789
 at home then this is what I hope you 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.560
