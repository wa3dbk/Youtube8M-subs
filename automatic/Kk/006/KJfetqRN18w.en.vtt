00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
more so myself I think the one thing

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.339 
more so myself I think the one thing
that<00:02:08.390> going<00:02:09.390> through<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.629> process<00:02:09.869> and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
that going through this process and

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.860 
that going through this process and
going<00:02:10.470> through<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.459> one

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
going through I think the one

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.280 
going through I think the one
it's<00:02:12.019> very<00:02:12.170> difficult<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.830> do<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.629> is<00:02:14.629> to<00:02:14.900> do

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
it's very difficult to do is to is to do

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.330

of all the court decisions and things
like<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.129> just<00:02:37.159> plain<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.819> unaware<00:02:38.659> of

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
like that and just plain and unaware of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.899 
like that and just plain and unaware of
so<00:02:38.959> many<00:02:39.170> things<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.799> were<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.129> on<00:02:40.340> you

so many things that were going on you

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.550 
so many things that were going on you
know<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.120> makes<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.450> very<00:02:41.569> tough<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:42.049> manage<00:02:42.230> so

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
I think that's one thing so I'm more mad

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.599 
I think that's one thing so I'm more mad
at<00:02:44.569> myself<00:02:44.780> more<00:02:45.349> so<00:02:45.590> than<00:02:45.950> my<00:02:46.069> financial

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
at myself more so than my financial

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.819 
at myself more so than my financial
advisor<00:02:47.019> because<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.290> was<00:02:48.379> a<00:02:48.410> point<00:02:48.709> in<00:02:48.769> time

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
advisor because it was a point in time

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.160 
advisor because it was a point in time
whether<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.609> market<00:02:50.000> was<00:02:50.180> real<00:02:50.390> good<00:02:50.629> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
whether the market was real good the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.449 
whether the market was real good the
things<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.560> we<00:02:51.680> were<00:02:51.769> buying<00:02:52.010> we<00:02:52.250> were<00:02:52.340> able

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
things that we were buying we were able

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.920 
things that we were buying we were able
to<00:02:52.700> flip<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.180> make<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.359> lot<00:02:53.569> of<00:02:53.660> different

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
to flip and make a lot of different

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.050 
to flip and make a lot of different
money<00:02:54.109> on<00:02:54.260> commercial<00:02:54.739> property<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.879> just

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
money on commercial property and it just

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.270 
money on commercial property and it just
went<00:02:56.180> bad<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.930> wasn't<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.739> only<00:02:57.769> one<00:02:58.129> in

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
went bad and I wasn't the only one in

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.890 
went bad and I wasn't the only one in
the<00:02:58.340> world<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.700> did<00:02:58.879> that<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.269> mean<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.810> was

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
the world that did that I mean it was

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.660 
the world that did that I mean it was
fortune<00:03:00.260> 500<00:03:00.799> companies<00:03:01.099> that<00:03:01.129> went<00:03:01.400> bad<00:03:01.640> and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
fortune 500 companies that went bad and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.160 
fortune 500 companies that went bad and
I<00:03:01.849> think<00:03:01.879> a<00:03:02.120> lot<00:03:02.269> of<00:03:02.299> people<00:03:02.629> don't<00:03:02.690> understand

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
I think a lot of people don't understand

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.330 
I think a lot of people don't understand
that<00:03:03.230> sometimes<00:03:03.530> when<00:03:03.920> those<00:03:04.040> situations

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
that sometimes when those situations

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.369 
that sometimes when those situations
happen<00:03:05.090> but<00:03:05.569> if<00:03:05.690> you're<00:03:05.780> not<00:03:05.900> there<00:03:06.109> to<00:03:06.200> watch

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
happen but if you're not there to watch

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.930 
happen but if you're not there to watch
it<00:03:06.409> think<00:03:06.950> bad<00:03:07.220> things<00:03:07.459> are<00:03:07.609> going<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.819> happen

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
it think bad things are going to happen

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.630 
it think bad things are going to happen
and<00:03:08.810> that's<00:03:09.560> why<00:03:09.769> you<00:03:09.829> alluded<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.609> fact
