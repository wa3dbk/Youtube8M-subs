their<00:01:41.430> gas<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> same<00:01:42.360> time<00:01:42.390> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
their gas about the same time so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
their gas about the same time so
production-wise<00:01:43.320> yeah<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.159> production

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
production-wise yeah that production

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.670 
production-wise yeah that production
overlay<00:01:44.880> shows<00:01:44.939> them<00:01:45.360> doing<00:01:46.020> exactly<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
going to get a tech lab first without

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.590 
going to get a tech lab first without
upgrading<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.579> orbital<00:01:56.909> command<00:01:57.149> by<00:01:57.360> both

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
upgrading the orbital command by both

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
upgrading the orbital command by both
players<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> training<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.619> single<00:01:58.890> marine<00:01:59.040> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
players and training a single marine so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.850 
players and training a single marine so
this<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> Terran<00:02:00.869> mirror<00:02:01.170> match<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.680> every

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
this is a Terran mirror match in every

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.219 
this is a Terran mirror match in every
sense<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> word<00:02:03.000> both<00:02:03.840> players<00:02:04.079> who

perhaps getting a supply depot now yeah

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.399 
perhaps getting a supply depot now yeah
one<00:02:06.030> player<00:02:06.240> Jim<00:02:06.540> already<00:02:06.960> gained<00:02:07.110> that's<00:02:07.320> a

one player Jim already gained that's a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.330 
one player Jim already gained that's a
5d<00:02:07.740> boat<00:02:07.920> now

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
5d boat now

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.460 
5d boat now
and<00:02:08.519> now<00:02:09.239> giving<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> apply<00:02:10.019> people<00:02:10.349> as

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and now giving them to apply people as

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.110 
and now giving them to apply people as
well<00:02:10.769> as<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.220> orbital<00:02:11.580> command<00:02:11.790> nearing

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
well as this orbital command nearing

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.630 
well as this orbital command nearing
completion<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.709> let's<00:02:13.709> see<00:02:13.890> whether<00:02:14.250> or<00:02:14.489> not

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
completion and let's see whether or not

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.059 
completion and let's see whether or not
both<00:02:14.879> players<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.569> early<00:02:15.959> refinery<00:02:16.440> so

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
both players go for early refinery so

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.920 
both players go for early refinery so
one<00:02:17.459> marine<00:02:17.760> already<00:02:18.060> completed<00:02:18.420> no

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
one marine already completed no

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.300 
one marine already completed no
additional<00:02:19.140> tech<00:02:19.560> lab<00:02:19.739> be<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.980> place<00:02:20.129> by

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
additional tech lab be in place by

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.670 
additional tech lab be in place by
gymflow<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.720> little<00:02:22.080> bit<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.440> change

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
gymflow so a little bit of a change

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.710 
gymflow so a little bit of a change
there<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.220> finally<00:02:23.790> some<00:02:24.209> changes<00:02:24.569> between

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
there so finally some changes between

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.089 
there so finally some changes between
the<00:02:24.959> two<00:02:25.080> players<00:02:25.290> more<00:02:25.560> real<00:02:25.680> doing<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.950> nice

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
the two players more real doing a nice

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.740 
the two players more real doing a nice
move<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.580> attack<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:27.180> order<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.540> take<00:02:27.720> down

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
move and attack in order to take down

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
move and attack in order to take down
this<00:02:27.989> SAV<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> looks<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:28.860> though<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.400> SCB<00:02:29.790> will

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
this SAV it looks as though the SCB will

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.539 
this SAV it looks as though the SCB will
be<00:02:30.090> able<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.569> escape<00:02:30.870> however<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:31.950> SME<00:02:32.370> now

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
be able to escape however so SME now

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.190 
be able to escape however so SME now
able<00:02:32.879> to<00:02:32.910> example<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.480> SUV<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.900> able<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.080> get

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
able to example that SUV be able to get

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.100 
able to example that SUV be able to get
no<00:02:34.709> unable<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.519> off<00:02:35.610> any<00:02:36.150> attacks<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.959> to
