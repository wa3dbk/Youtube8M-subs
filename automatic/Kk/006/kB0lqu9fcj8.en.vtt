 wide she was hanging down on it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.110
 Of course it would also work or now 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.570
 Just to undress I do this here 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.640

 Put this over my head 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.759
 the head and so the whole tightly stowed 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.700
 the straps here on the back and then 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.409
 the bag sits well outside a bag 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.970
 here in the front is located 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.040

 Here is a small bag 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.300
 I can open it like that 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.970
 and here comes my 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.380
 hiking map I have so pure 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.240

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.410
 Search my bags around but it has 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.560
 here very quickly at hand 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.520

 where I can put various things pure 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.500
 Gets all the time in the sense of 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.970
 smoker this bag absolutely optimal 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.870

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.680
 pure lighter 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.420
 I'm not a smoker, but I think 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.850
 time to the other people with and that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.850
 It occurred to me that this was true for everyone 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.770
 a practical matter for that 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.239
 would be like non-smoker for me 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.050
 said the front of the card in there me 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.480
 will be here 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.610
 I have the easy now I stocked 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.560
 For example , here would be a survival set 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.489
 clean up or today we go 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.750
 hikes are on trekking with 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.299
 many herbs we should find 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.299
 or do i want my book in here 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.299
 my herbal book , he fits perfectly pure 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.299
 and we can already see, I can leg 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.239
 Let's have a quick look at the book 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.060
 designed that she has strings here 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.860
 elastic and then the bag falls 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.049
 do not teach so if I work 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.450
 completely on and everything falls out of me 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.450
 but everything is beautiful in here 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.790
 I have a small stock could mine 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.709
 cell phone reinkamera fotocamera what synonymous 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.560
 I always have here now, for example 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:33.230
 Ballpoint pen in it's little pencil 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.720
 and notepads and then I'm here 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.610
 nicely organized i am looking today 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.410
 herbs i also write when i am 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.299
 new plant may find that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.030
 leaf off or write me any 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:48.590
 special foundations on so i use the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.610
 bag and abdi afterwards exists here 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.019
 in the back we have a net 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.780
 I can open net bag here 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.709
 I have sharper and radiometric and 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.989
 to pencil 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.000
 and here are also small ones 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.980
 I could loop this elastic there 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.269
 flashlights poke lighters 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:15.650
 driving style which is also interesting here 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.120
 is such a plete and that's nice is 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.970
 also attached here that means I can 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.229
 click here 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.610
 maybe a gps device or something 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.750
 what I hold so in hand then the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.310
 Pocket the use of the bag will become 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.479
 only with time does it turn out 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.130
 it with such things if I the 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.690
 But lengers wear then I realize that 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.620
 It is convenient for the customer as well 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.510
 purely that fits in very well and then 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.660
 will take advantage of the passage of time 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.280
 The bag would turn out to be as though 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.520
 I take off my bag once because it looks 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.660
 you can still take it off the back of 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.910
 as I said I 'm just the 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:56.210
 longer here the straps and you 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.490
 The bag just over your head 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.080
 down 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.199
 here we see the back of the bag 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.260
 is from heli context and now that comes 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.190
 special with the bag that is so 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.660
 a gift she is one 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:15.160
 custom-made and back here 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:21.979
 These belts are sewn extra 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:23.960
 and yes, neatly avoided with thread 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.550
 very special and I can do that 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.780
 as breast pocket hang else would it be 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.849
 probably a page as 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.729
 side pocket thought or as 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.430
 I do not know exactly how to do it 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.260
 This bag is perfect and is a 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.280
 quite a great gift so I'm happy 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.280

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:45.020
 and who likes to carry the bag more often 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.820
 me again such a great system or 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.729
 malus system maybe not here 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.159
 Such belts in any case 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.169
 yes and so the whole bag then looks 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:56.960
 again from beautifully processed up here 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:00.050
 To open the zippers everything 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.909
 done quite well so at this 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.279
 make a big thank you again 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:07.610

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:08.839
 I like it very much, thank you people 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.559
 I thank you for it 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.919
 daily 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:14.120
 I hope you have the little revier of 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.699
 like this bag 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.069
 if you like the bag then shows 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.689
 It's up with your thumb 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.719
 and if you have any suggestions 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:24.979
 have criticism or comments specifically to 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:26.059
 this bag then it writes 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.339
 just down there 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:30.770
 maybe you still know other pac 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.389
 systems i have websites in america 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.229
 seen 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:39.529
 equipment times have there too 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:41.990
 such bags here and I like it 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:43.639
 in any case, good such tactical matters 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.449
 because i can do the backpack fast 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.520
 move out 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.669
 I can go with it and have it 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.409
 always such a light touch I say 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.379
 when i mean that i always have 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:56.839
 a certain amount of equipment on the body 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:07:00.560
 I'm always a bit on the safe side 

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:01.819
 For this , keyword first-aid-set is used 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.259
 I want all things rescue blanket 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.300
 however, the rescue blanket is pure 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:08.449
 always great if you have something in there 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.610
 as shelter as heat protection and yes 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.169
 Can I wear it sz on my body 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.899
 it could also theoretically under the 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:17.959
 jacket for example in urban wear 

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:20.149
 area now let's say as a spray 

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:22.490
 or now as an adjunct to the crisis 

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:23.779
 backpack is its optimal utensil 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.490
 because he has something to do with me 

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:27.649
 I leave the backpack behind 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.499
 still on the body this bag in the 

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:32.749
 I have my emergency kit in it for me 

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:34.999
 to secure my life my survival 

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:36.499
 yes, today it's not about survival 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:37.939
 Here out today , it's all about enjoying 

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:38.689
 people and I still enjoy the 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:40.339
 rest of the day 

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:41.659
 I wish you all the best we see 

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:42.499
 us in the next video again until then 

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:45.020
 bye 

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:46.309
 the advantage of this kelly is 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.649
 Of course that's what the packaging says 

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:50.330
 that you feed him with all sorts of things 

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:52.099
 So I can there if he once 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.800
 also burned slightly wet wood 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:57.050
 even dump cow dung dry code 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.750
 circumstance on the packing dry 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:03.490
 Gras tap everything I have out here 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.490
 find flammable material
