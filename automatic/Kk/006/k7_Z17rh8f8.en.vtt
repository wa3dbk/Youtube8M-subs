of the CD drive I got this for my cousin
thanks<00:00:26.070> Michael<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:28.380> instead<00:00:28.829> of<00:00:28.890> using<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
thanks Michael and instead of using the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.080 
thanks Michael and instead of using the
magnetic<00:00:31.160> on/off<00:00:32.160> switch<00:00:32.460> i<00:00:32.720> used<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:33.930> adapter

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
magnetic on/off switch i used a adapter

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
magnetic on/off switch i used a adapter
which<00:00:36.090> has<00:00:36.450> settings<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.470> it<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.829> can

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
which has settings on it so you can

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.639 
which has settings on it so you can
change<00:00:38.399> from<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.210> volt<00:00:39.660> over<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> way<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> 12

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
change from one volt over to way to 12

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.370 
change from one volt over to way to 12
volt<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.640> i<00:00:41.670> only<00:00:41.910> need<00:00:42.120> 3<00:00:42.390> point<00:00:42.630> 5<00:00:42.810> volts<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
volt but i only need 3 point 5 volts to

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:51.260 
volt but i only need 3 point 5 volts to
operate<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:47.300> i've<00:00:48.300> also<00:00:48.510> got<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:50.000> i'll<00:00:51.000> just

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
operate it i've also got the i'll just

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.150 
operate it i've also got the i'll just
show<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.810> how<00:00:52.080> it<00:00:52.200> works<00:00:52.970> pretty<00:00:53.970> much<00:00:54.240> just

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
show you how it works pretty much just

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.510 
show you how it works pretty much just
plug<00:00:56.160> lee<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:58.560> then<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.860> see<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> light

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
plug lee and then you see that light

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.290 
plug lee and then you see that light
wood<00:00:59.730> pulp<00:00:59.970> on<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.800> its<00:01:02.040> own<00:01:02.190> line<00:01:02.370> 1.5

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
wood pulp on and then its own line 1.5

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
wood pulp on and then its own line 1.5
volts<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> needs<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> bit<00:01:04.470> more<00:01:04.530> juice<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
volts but it needs a bit more juice to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
volts but it needs a bit more juice to
open<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.329> it's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.509> nice<00:01:06.630> step<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.079> can<00:01:07.110> switch

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
open so it's a nice step you can switch

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
open so it's a nice step you can switch
the<00:01:07.590> polarity<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.549> too<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.200> it's<00:01:10.200> nice<00:01:10.380> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the polarity on this too so it's nice to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.050 
the polarity on this too so it's nice to
have<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:10.710> mode<00:01:11.009> where<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.460> switch<00:01:11.820> on

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
have a mode where you can just switch on

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.420 
have a mode where you can just switch on
and<00:01:12.299> off<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.720> line<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> can

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
and off that line and then you can

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.090 
and off that line and then you can
change<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.940> to<00:01:15.090> 3<00:01:15.300> point<00:01:15.570> 5<00:01:15.750> volts<00:01:16.100> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
change your up to 3 point 5 volts and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.550 
change your up to 3 point 5 volts and
then<00:01:18.680> it'll<00:01:19.680> come<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.190> that<00:01:21.560> select

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
then it'll come out like that select

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.260 
then it'll come out like that select
polarity<00:01:24.620> so<00:01:25.620> which<00:01:25.740> polarity<00:01:26.460> again<00:01:29.270> switch

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
polarity so which polarity again switch

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260 
polarity so which polarity again switch
clarity<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.560> i<00:01:31.680> also<00:01:31.860> art<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> light<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
clarity and i also art up the light to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.920 
clarity and i also art up the light to
not<00:01:33.690> just<00:01:33.960> stash<00:01:34.680> box<00:01:35.510> not<00:01:36.510> just<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:38.000> um<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
not just stash box not just a um the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.399 
not just stash box not just a um the
drive<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.520> also<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> light<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:44.250> opens<00:01:45.409> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
drive is also the light so opens and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.190 
drive is also the light so opens and
closes<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:50.390> light<00:01:51.390> color<00:01:51.630> changes

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
closes and then a light color changes

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.920 
closes and then a light color changes
also<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.830> change<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.490> voltage<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.630> i<00:01:54.689> want

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
also as a change in voltage but i want

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.300 
also as a change in voltage but i want
to<00:01:55.049> turn<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.590> our<00:01:55.650> it's<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> burn

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to turn it up to our it's going to burn

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.640 
to turn it up to our it's going to burn
out<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.640> light<00:01:56.880> bulb<00:01:57.119> now<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.380> show<00:01:58.590> you

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
out that light bulb now just show you

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.490 
out that light bulb now just show you
what's<00:01:58.860> inside<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.520> thing<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.720> basically

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
what's inside this thing so basically

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.480 
what's inside this thing so basically
here<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.100> opened<00:02:02.549> up<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.310> also

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
here it is opened up and you can also

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.539 
here it is opened up and you can also
press<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.330> thing<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:07.979> going<00:02:08.189> to<00:02:08.310> have

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
press that thing but it's going to have

press that thing but it's going to have
to<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> pull<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:10.799> open

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
to you have to pull it open

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.350 
to you have to pull it open
myself<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:14.170> also<00:02:14.350> have<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.920> plug<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.520> in<00:02:15.700> to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
myself you also have to plug it in to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:26.790 
myself you also have to plug it in to
open<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:22.620> hear<00:02:23.620> heroes<00:02:24.130> today<00:02:24.840> stop<00:02:25.840> inside

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
open it to hear heroes today stop inside

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.280 
open it to hear heroes today stop inside
of<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:28.950> basically<00:02:30.240> pulled<00:02:31.240> out<00:02:31.480> most<00:02:31.810> pulled

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
of it I basically pulled out most pulled

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.680 
of it I basically pulled out most pulled
out<00:02:32.440> all<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:33.450> old<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:35.230> know<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:36.690> laser

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
out all the old you know like the laser

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.440 
out all the old you know like the laser
diode<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:38.530> all<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.860> stuff<00:02:39.010> there<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:40.209> laser

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
diode and all that stuff there the laser

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.160 
diode and all that stuff there the laser
diode<00:02:40.780> wasn't<00:02:41.550> very<00:02:42.550> useful<00:02:43.120> anyway<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:47.020> on

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
diode wasn't very useful anyway but on

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.050 
diode wasn't very useful anyway but on
the<00:02:47.290> back<00:02:47.940> Wow<00:02:48.989> here<00:02:49.989> are<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.500> solder<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:51.940> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
the back Wow here are the solder for the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.360 
the back Wow here are the solder for the
motor<00:02:54.570> those<00:02:55.570> two<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.260> then<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> also<00:02:56.800> soldered

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
motor those two and then I also soldered

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.120 
motor those two and then I also soldered
these<00:02:57.580> two<00:02:57.910> for<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.390> light<00:02:58.630> bulb<00:02:58.930> which<00:02:59.890> also

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
these two for the light bulb which also

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.150 
these two for the light bulb which also
makes<00:03:00.489> my<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.190> another<00:03:03.190> feature<00:03:05.160> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
makes my have a another feature the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.180 
makes my have a another feature the
motor<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.880> light<00:03:07.750> bulb<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.830> then<00:03:08.980> also

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
motor is a light bulb and then also

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.780 
motor is a light bulb and then also
soldered<00:03:09.850> them<00:03:10.090> two<00:03:10.300> together<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:12.610> also

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
soldered them two together and I also

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.550 
soldered them two together and I also
put<00:03:13.209> some<00:03:13.239> tape<00:03:13.570> on<00:03:13.630> just<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.170> make<00:03:14.320> sure<00:03:14.350> I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
put some tape on just to make sure I

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.479 
put some tape on just to make sure I
don't<00:03:14.680> get<00:03:14.890> any<00:03:15.190> short<00:03:15.550> circuits<00:03:20.489> well

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
don't get any short circuits well

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.580 
don't get any short circuits well
actually<00:03:21.640> when<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.540> was<00:03:22.660> taking<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:23.080> apart<00:03:23.410> I

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
actually when I was taking this apart I

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.420 
actually when I was taking this apart I
messed<00:03:23.890> up<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:25.120> part<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.630> hard<00:03:26.430> disk

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
messed up this is part of the hard disk

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.960 
messed up this is part of the hard disk
drive<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:28.180> this<00:03:28.390> part<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.840> messed<00:03:29.140> up<00:03:29.790> can't<00:03:30.790> be

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
drive so this part is messed up can't be

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.330 
drive so this part is messed up can't be
used<00:03:31.060> anymore<00:03:31.650> that's<00:03:32.650> why<00:03:32.830> this<00:03:32.890> part<00:03:33.280> is

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
used anymore that's why this part is

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.020 
used anymore that's why this part is
good<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:35.970> yeah<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.000> also<00:03:37.269> put<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.250> little<00:03:39.250> paper

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
good so yeah I also put the little paper

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.660 
good so yeah I also put the little paper
here<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:42.060> bit<00:03:43.060> more<00:03:43.239> study<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.870> yeah

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
here so that a bit more study and yeah

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.370 
here so that a bit more study and yeah
there's<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.790> good<00:03:49.060> shot<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.690> light<00:03:49.870> bulb<00:03:50.170> in

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
there's a good shot of the light bulb in

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.910 
there's a good shot of the light bulb in
there<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.430> also<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.390> motor<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:55.470> also<00:03:56.470> use<00:03:56.739> my

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
there and also the motor I also use my

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.670 
there and also the motor I also use my
soldering<00:03:57.489> iron<00:03:57.850> there<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:59.019> melt<00:03:59.200> some<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
soldering iron there to melt some of the

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.580 
soldering iron there to melt some of the
plastic<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:00.519> when<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:01.450> put<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.840> back<00:04:02.110> on<00:04:02.350> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
plastic so when I put this back on the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.400 
plastic so when I put this back on the
wires<00:04:02.830> have<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.190> place<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.549> go<00:04:03.760> through

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.950 

so<00:04:07.190> yeah<00:04:07.400> it's<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.670> bit<00:04:07.820> awkward<00:04:07.850> I<00:04:08.570> would<00:04:08.720> like

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
so yeah it's a bit awkward I would like

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.470 
so yeah it's a bit awkward I would like
I<00:04:09.530> would<00:04:09.650> have<00:04:09.860> liked<00:04:10.280> waters<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:11.000> come<00:04:11.210> on<00:04:11.360> the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
I would have liked waters to come on the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.790 
I would have liked waters to come on the
back<00:04:11.750> somewhere<00:04:12.170> here<00:04:12.850> but<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:14.680> don't<00:04:15.680> really

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
back somewhere here but I don't really

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.420 
back somewhere here but I don't really
plan<00:04:16.160> for<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.830> now<00:04:18.830> other<00:04:19.070> wires<00:04:19.250> are

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
plan for that so now other wires are

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.789 
plan for that so now other wires are
going<00:04:19.640> to<00:04:19.700> come<00:04:20.030> out<00:04:20.060> from<00:04:20.390> there<00:04:20.650> those<00:04:21.650> are

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
going to come out from there those are

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.310 
going to come out from there those are
the<00:04:21.830> positive<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.520> negative<00:04:22.580> wires<00:04:23.320> and

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
the positive and negative wires and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.650 
the positive and negative wires and
these<00:04:24.560> screws<00:04:25.070> since<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.760> touched<00:04:26.090> me<00:04:26.270> for<00:04:26.540> my

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
these screws since I touched me for my

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.290 
these screws since I touched me for my
cousin<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:28.810> lost<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.080> original<00:04:30.230> screws<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:32.240> I

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
cousin I lost the original screws so I

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.150 
cousin I lost the original screws so I
have<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.630> use<00:04:32.810> these<00:04:32.960> cheap<00:04:33.470> screws<00:04:33.890> that<00:04:34.040> you

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
have to use these cheap screws that you
