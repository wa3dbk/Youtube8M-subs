exercising<00:00:48.820> too<00:00:49.450> much<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:50.380> can<00:00:50.620> elevate<00:00:50.890> your

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
exercising too much you can elevate your

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.360 
exercising too much you can elevate your
cortisol<00:00:51.940> levels<00:00:52.329> pretty<00:00:53.079> damn<00:00:53.649> high<00:00:54.040> if<00:00:54.310> you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
cortisol levels pretty damn high if you

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.970 
cortisol levels pretty damn high if you
are<00:00:54.760> working<00:00:55.239> for<00:00:55.450> an<00:00:55.540> hour<00:00:55.780> plus<00:00:56.170> so<00:00:56.770> for

are working for an hour plus so for

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.490 
are working for an hour plus so for
esa's<00:00:57.250> endurance<00:00:58.120> athletes<00:00:58.630> can<00:00:59.110> increase

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
esa's endurance athletes can increase

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500 
esa's endurance athletes can increase
their<00:00:59.710> cortisol<00:01:00.220> levels<00:01:00.579> and<00:01:00.700> also<00:01:01.090> people

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
their cortisol levels and also people

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.540 
their cortisol levels and also people
who<00:01:01.750> go<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.079> gym<00:01:02.350> for<00:01:02.590> two<00:01:02.620> hours<00:01:02.800> plus<00:01:03.309> can

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
who go to the gym for two hours plus can

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.580 
who go to the gym for two hours plus can
increase<00:01:03.970> their<00:01:04.180> cortisol<00:01:04.600> levels<00:01:04.899> so<00:01:05.379> what

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
increase their cortisol levels so what

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.280 
increase their cortisol levels so what
that<00:01:05.740> can<00:01:05.950> do<00:01:06.159> is<00:01:06.369> break<00:01:07.299> down<00:01:07.329> your<00:01:07.869> muscle

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
that can do is break down your muscle

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.620 
that can do is break down your muscle
turn<00:01:08.500> your<00:01:08.680> body<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.100> also<00:01:09.850> increase<00:01:10.600> your

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
turn your body and also increase your

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.020 
turn your body and also increase your
cortisol<00:01:11.260> levels<00:01:11.620> which<00:01:11.799> has<00:01:11.979> been<00:01:12.159> shown<00:01:12.190> to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
cortisol levels which has been shown to

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380 
cortisol levels which has been shown to
store<00:01:13.590> tummy<00:01:14.590> fat<00:01:14.850> another<00:01:15.850> thing<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.180> can

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
store tummy fat another thing you can

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.570 
store tummy fat another thing you can
look<00:01:16.450> at<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:17.470> may<00:01:18.040> feel<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:18.520> you<00:01:18.970> are

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
look at is you may feel that you are

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.670 
look at is you may feel that you are
ultimately<00:01:21.580> paleo<00:01:22.330> or<00:01:22.600> working<00:01:23.080> towards

ultimately paleo or working towards

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.730 
ultimately paleo or working towards
paleo<00:01:24.250> but<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.210> may<00:01:25.390> not<00:01:25.600> be<00:01:25.780> quite<00:01:26.170> where<00:01:26.590> you

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
paleo but you may not be quite where you

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.980 
paleo but you may not be quite where you
think<00:01:27.070> you<00:01:27.250> are<00:01:27.510> actually<00:01:28.510> what<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:28.750> might

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
think you are actually what you might

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.410 
think you are actually what you might
need<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> do<00:01:29.560> is<00:01:29.770> look<00:01:30.070> at<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.430> variance<00:01:31.150> of

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
need to do is look at the variance of

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.620 
need to do is look at the variance of
your<00:01:31.930> food<00:01:32.310> varying<00:01:33.310> your<00:01:33.340> proteins<00:01:34.060> can<00:01:34.330> have

your food varying your proteins can have

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.700 
your food varying your proteins can have
a<00:01:34.950> considerable<00:01:35.950> impact<00:01:36.159> on<00:01:36.960> allergies<00:01:37.960> water
