entrances<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.799> realism

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
entrances because I think from realism

light addition to have second

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
light addition to have second
improvement<00:01:18.500> environmental<00:01:19.500> grapples<00:01:19.950> with

improvement environmental grapples with

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
improvement environmental grapples with
the<00:01:20.189> chain<00:01:20.580> now<00:01:21.360> from<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.930> tell<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the chain now from what I can tell it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
the chain now from what I can tell it
took<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.619> full<00:01:22.770> team<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.610> isn't<00:01:23.939> actually

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
took a full team there isn't actually

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.810 
took a full team there isn't actually
any<00:01:24.570> proper<00:01:24.900> moves<00:01:25.170> available<00:01:25.920> involving<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
any proper moves available involving the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.420 
any proper moves available involving the
chain<00:01:27.060> itself<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.530> basically<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:29.189> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
chain itself or you can basically do is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.830 
chain itself or you can basically do is
throw<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.880> opponent<00:01:29.939> into<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> still

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
throw your opponent into the still

to see into the 15 is some moves

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.899 
to see into the 15 is some moves
actually<00:01:36.450> involve<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.079> chain<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.670> could

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
actually involve the chain so this could

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
actually involve the chain so this could
be<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.180> easy<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.750> important<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> cage<00:01:40.770> match

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
spring your opponent's face along the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.609 
spring your opponent's face along the
chain<00:01:50.220> plus<00:01:51.119> some<00:01:51.540> completely<00:01:52.020> new<00:01:52.200> ones<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
chain plus some completely new ones it

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.530 
chain plus some completely new ones it
would<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.920> great<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.579> well<00:01:53.759> maybe

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
would be great to have as well maybe

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810 
would be great to have as well maybe
something<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> sneaker<00:01:55.860> site<00:01:56.189> move<00:01:56.460> into

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
something like a sneaker site move into

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
something like a sneaker site move into
the<00:01:56.909> chain<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.689> even<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> suplex<00:01:58.530> into<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the chain or even a suplex into the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.499 
the chain or even a suplex into the
chain<00:01:59.219> or<00:01:59.399> something<00:01:59.549> along<00:02:00.180> those<00:02:00.390> lines

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
chain or something along those lines

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719 
chain or something along those lines
because<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:01.649> we'll<00:02:02.100> something<00:02:02.369> moves

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
because I think we'll something moves

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.940 
because I think we'll something moves
but<00:02:03.210> actually<00:02:03.659> evolved<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> surroundings<00:02:04.799> in

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
but actually evolved the surroundings in

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.859 
but actually evolved the surroundings in
the<00:02:05.040> match<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.149> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.600> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the match it's just going to make for a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
the match it's just going to make for a
much<00:02:06.990> more<00:02:07.200> fun<00:02:07.439> match<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.310> much<00:02:08.489> more

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
much more fun match and I much more

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.029 
much more fun match and I much more
interesting<00:02:09.209> match<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.590> finally

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
interesting match to have but finally

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.400 
interesting match to have but finally
guys<00:02:11.250> probably<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.239> smallest<00:02:12.750> change

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
guys probably the smallest change

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.340 
guys probably the smallest change
my<00:02:14.010> third<00:02:14.340> change<00:02:14.880> improvement<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.870> addition

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
my third change improvement and addition

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.410 
my third change improvement and addition
is<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:17.040> ability<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:18.000> an<00:02:18.210> elimination

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
is the ability to have an elimination

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.530 
is the ability to have an elimination
chamber<00:02:18.900> match<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.500> any<00:02:19.980> arena<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
chamber match in any arena not just the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.440 
chamber match in any arena not just the
Elimination<00:02:22.020> Chamber<00:02:22.230> pay-per-view<00:02:22.500> arena

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
Elimination Chamber pay-per-view arena

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.480 
Elimination Chamber pay-per-view arena
so<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.840> said<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.350> small<00:02:25.710> one<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.220> for

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
so like I said it is a small one but for

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.190 
so like I said it is a small one but for
whatever<00:02:26.640> reason<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> previous<00:02:27.780> games

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
whatever reason in the previous games

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.140 
whatever reason in the previous games
they<00:02:28.890> really<00:02:29.160> know<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.430> match<00:02:29.580> type<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.120> take

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
they really know the match type to take

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.910 
they really know the match type to take
place<00:02:30.630> at<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.230> elimination<00:02:31.440> chamber

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
place at the elimination chamber

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.760 
place at the elimination chamber
pay-per-view<00:02:32.190> arena<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:34.050> say<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:34.500> example

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
pay-per-view arena so say for example

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.280 
pay-per-view arena so say for example
you<00:02:35.370> had<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> SummerSlam<00:02:36.150> pay-per-view<00:02:36.290> coming

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you had a SummerSlam pay-per-view coming

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
you had a SummerSlam pay-per-view coming
up<00:02:37.350> in<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:37.560> universe<00:02:37.830> mode<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.520> you

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
up in your universe mode and you

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.700 
up in your universe mode and you
Francie's<00:02:39.420> having<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.720> Chamber<00:02:40.080> match<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
Francie's having a Chamber match as the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.710 
Francie's having a Chamber match as the
main<00:02:40.890> event<00:02:41.070> what<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.120> can<00:02:42.270> still<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:42.630> that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
main event what you can still have that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.020 
main event what you can still have that
match<00:02:42.960> type<00:02:43.290> as<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> main<00:02:43.830> event<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.730> arena

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
match type as the main event the arena

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
match type as the main event the arena
is<00:02:45.270> automatically<00:02:46.020> going<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.410> change<00:02:46.740> from

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
is automatically going to change from

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.700 
is automatically going to change from
SummerSlam<00:02:47.880> arena<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.170> Elimination

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
SummerSlam arena to the Elimination

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.040 
SummerSlam arena to the Elimination
Chamber<00:02:49.950> arena<00:02:50.430> which<00:02:51.180> kind<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.540> kills<00:02:51.810> any

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
Chamber arena which kind of kills any

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.350 
Chamber arena which kind of kills any
realism<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.770> it's<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.460> kind<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.850> one<00:02:54.210> big

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
realism and it's just kind of one big

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.930 
realism and it's just kind of one big
annoyance<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.710> I'm<00:02:55.860> hoping<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.460> because

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
annoyance so I'm hoping that because

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.610 
annoyance so I'm hoping that because
they<00:02:57.150> did<00:02:57.330> have<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> Chamber<00:02:57.900> match<00:02:58.050> at

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
they did have a Chamber match at

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.550 
they did have a Chamber match at
survivor<00:02:59.100> series<00:02:59.270> 2000<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.300> which<00:03:01.170> should<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
survivor series 2000 to which should a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.980 
survivor series 2000 to which should a
fury<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:02.100> featured<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.910> 2k<00:03:03.270> showcase<00:03:03.690> mode

hopefully<00:03:07.410> Elimination<00:03:08.280> Chamber<00:03:08.430> matches<00:03:08.760> in

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
hopefully Elimination Chamber matches in

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.330 
hopefully Elimination Chamber matches in
an<00:03:09.360> arena<00:03:09.600> which<00:03:10.290> isn't<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.830> Elimination

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
an arena which isn't the Elimination

an arena which isn't the Elimination
Chamber<00:03:11.520> pay-per-view<00:03:11.700> arena<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:13.320> to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
Chamber pay-per-view arena is going to

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.200 
Chamber pay-per-view arena is going to
be<00:03:13.470> durable<00:03:13.740> from<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:14.340> hopefully

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
be durable from that one hopefully

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.760 
be durable from that one hopefully
that's<00:03:15.570> not<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.870> over<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.080> case<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.530> for

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
that's not going over the case just for

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.960 
that's not going over the case just for
that<00:03:16.860> mode<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.310> that's<00:03:17.430> going<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.640> be<00:03:17.730> doable

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
that mode and that's going to be doable

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.840 
that mode and that's going to be doable
for<00:03:18.270> exhibition<00:03:19.080> as<00:03:19.170> well<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.650> guess<00:03:20.250> we'll<00:03:20.520> see

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
for exhibition as well I guess we'll see

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.630 
for exhibition as well I guess we'll see
come<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.270> final<00:03:21.600> release<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.440> hopefully<00:03:22.950> we

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
come the final release but hopefully we

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.760 
come the final release but hopefully we
will<00:03:23.850> better<00:03:24.030> have<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.240> match<00:03:24.510> type<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:25.110> any

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
will better have that match type in any

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.630 
will better have that match type in any
arena<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> game<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:27.000> 2k15<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:29.190> that's<00:03:29.459> it
