00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.660
 a little for you 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.710
 You must take away your lies. 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.410
 contact with dress a blouse or skirt 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.720
 so much compliance that you will use 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.680
 why is this one dressed in a podium in 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.740
 two parts 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.800
 You're going to take 40 here and 50 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.050
 so I 90cm you will not 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.570
 buy only 90 centimeters 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.060
 If you have only one account 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.320
 you can find a 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.510
 five and twenty 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.829
 but you also have to buy thinking 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.030
 that today I will dress for the handle will 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.059
 the bias 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 the finish is another record you have 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.189
 We remember that many animals we 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.280
 Let's cut one had to do that. 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.760
 via river to make a wise 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:18.890
 Are you going to buy a pencil skirt? 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:21.890
 She goes out there and buys 60 to do 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.670
 hearing is to focus zipper 31 came to 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.460
 put that make a waistband now 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.220
 strengthen the power 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.189
 You'll buy October then 50 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.650
 cents a skirt with merit because in 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:41.560
 time to cut you go with is cut the 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.560
 diagonal skew mode 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.770
 I'm going to buy two natures in this last one. 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.890
 dress I made you did not leave me 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.010
 down here I have a fruity with pecs 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.910
 and the thing kept holding franzin is going 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.070
 stay well trim and a silk fabric 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.820
 then you will also need to buy 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.530
 Now if I use it, it's 75 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.520
 inches in front to see if 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.760
 tie because the word the fabric is a 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.010
 50 the meter and a half in all have 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.220
 Most times you do not 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.230
 buy the dress already asks he is from 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.450
 an email of 1 80 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.450
 You 'll already know that the one in the needle 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:38.980
 pants also causes total compliance 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:42.480
 from your waist down to down is one meter 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.150
 You 'll buy more on the waistband for Bahia. 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.239
 be pocket then you can year 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.310
 Look I want three centimeters pocket. 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.120
 there was more dry because you have to leave 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.959
 seam margins remembering to have been 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:03.070
 big on the street long dresses also the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:08.320
 from here on the team of a 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:11.190
 clipping paths you will also take 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.190
 hence 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.510
 but when the sleeves 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:22.810
 this is it because you cut the front 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.790
 remembering 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.870
 You also have a human right mule. 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:34.209
 I'm not even going to make a sweater too. 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.870
 height then everything is based on height 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.880
 total 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.599
 You have to serve at all times. 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.660
 Also ask yourself the sizes of your 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.260
 garage feg 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.390
 if another site is more fragile 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.390
 stayed a little bit longer and leave a 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.000
 trimming you'd better squeeze a piece 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.280
 and make adjustments in itself than among 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.110
 then put the moment so I always 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.680
 I'll leave you a little belly when 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.580
 I just squeeze soy is in the body some 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.560

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.260
 skew which is like diagonal template 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.269
 he is fit is not myth is true 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.670
 if you cut and straight it will not have 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.120
 finish with you or to send 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.709

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.800
 piece 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.690
 so I'm going to make a special video and 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.070
 We'll have to find more uses. 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.470

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.750
