00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 special service of specialists the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.480
 individual production of slices the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.160
 it no longer exists here at it 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.210
 a slice of one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.059
 glass model s 12 04 convertible built in 1963 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.560
 I hardly know the car, I have to say 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.650
 I know it is under 50 times built 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.720
 been missing and the customer is now 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.220
 the curve slice broke and he 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.570
 then called me to ask if 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 I still have him a crank 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.500
 He could conjure up magic anywhere 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.270
 you can not do it but we can do it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 let's cut it is plan 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.010
 we do not need a big club med or 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.450
 so it is enough if we then one 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.480
 Customers are already getting drawing 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.070
 the exact other shows yes then is 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.760
 important to us that the slices strengthen 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.550
 it is yes and the car is safe 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.760
 that will be a clear issue 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.800
 now I can this template which is a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 old wallpaper is as I said quite simple 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.210
 sometimes I also get baking paper 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 Anything that has to be sent 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.860
 only have the size 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.869
 soon there will be more 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.100
 long was sigrid and they will me 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.780
 slice then cut 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.979
 I chose you for one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.750
 We already have that old citroen 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.390
 then i made the side windows 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.400
 we let produce completely 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.680
 the customer wanted a green glazing 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.500
 You can see that is very nice, that's green 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.939
 most importantly, it is determined not 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.880
 problem arises at the door 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.030
 and if you look it's easy 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.799
 perfectly super sick perfect 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.350
 processed 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.159
 no matter if common model or expensive exotic 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.479
 Berg's box has almost everything in stock 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.390
 it is so that we have our slices 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.439
 attach exclusively to holzwege and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.780
 so they just write on one 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.340
 to stand on soft ground 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.189
 it is a pity if you have metal 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.200
 Asked increases and the disc even if 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.460
 she is instructed and the one immediately 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.229
 chipping on the disc 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.630
 but the slices are too expensive for that 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.819
 is so we really rare pieces 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.649
 In stock, those who are sinfully expensive 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.539
 rather the price range of the disc is 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.459
 by virtue of course very far apart so 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.760
 do not say it's off somewhere 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.930
 100 euros and upwards is the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.660
 limit my eyes 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.069
 being two and a half thousand euros then 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.260
 but is really already around 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.870
 absolute exotics like for example 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.010
 but a slice of bentley so 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.560
 Here we have the usual 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.250
 models that is the mercedes 300 sl 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.880
 roadster and and calvin then we have 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.950
 stroke eight slices and if we then 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.180
 keep on leading it keeps on going 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.310
 mercedes and respectively 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.849
 write industry and so on and so on 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.260
 away and take, for example, we have 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.319
 we stand the pagoda slices 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.900
 The windscreen is hot for one 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.599
 sl is often ordered the price is 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.910
 at around 250 euro is actually already 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.400
 directly to a typical mercedes 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.150
 are very strong slices 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.950
 is very contemporary and yes me 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
 I think that the disc quality 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.500
 okay is it still here 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.040
 packed but when they unpack the same 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.040
 get a call 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.360
 so that's where we get 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.019
 check the quality again 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.430
 before the disk goes out to the customer 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.750
 at first glance, a clear distinction between 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.340
 we can look through it 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.159
 look again if I'm somewhere 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.159
 a scratch is namely spectators 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.970
 we do not have the edges 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:35.760
 they are ok there are, for example 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.019
 yes, glasshouses must remove where the 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.730
 edges very bad cut 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.200
 they are already polished 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.480
 almost cut one wanted to go over it 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.120
 with that and often is the foliation 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.139
 below gets to yellowish and it 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.139
 You can see goods from the Far East
