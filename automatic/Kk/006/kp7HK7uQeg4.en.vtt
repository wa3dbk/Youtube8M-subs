water barbaric king he's an attack type
and<00:00:35.579> let's<00:00:36.390> take<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.020> his<00:00:37.170> skills

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
and let's take a look at his skills

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.030 
and let's take a look at his skills
penalty<00:00:39.270> attacks<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> enemy<00:00:39.960> twice<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
penalty attacks the enemy twice with the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.549 
penalty attacks the enemy twice with the
axe<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.610> inflicts<00:00:42.059> continuous<00:00:42.629> damage<00:00:42.989> for

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
axe and inflicts continuous damage for

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.130 
axe and inflicts continuous damage for
one<00:00:43.590> turn<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> 50%<00:00:44.910> chance<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:46.020> each

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
one turn with a 50% chance for each

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.389 
one turn with a 50% chance for each
attack<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> there's<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.050> chance<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.890> he<00:00:50.160> can

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
attack so there's a chance that he can

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.850 
attack so there's a chance that he can
leave<00:00:50.610> continuous<00:00:51.120> damage<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.690> turn

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
leave continuous damage for one turn

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
leave continuous damage for one turn
twice<00:00:52.910> which<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.030> pretty<00:00:54.210> good<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> need

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
twice which is pretty good if you need

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.110 
twice which is pretty good if you need
to<00:00:54.960> stack<00:00:55.260> debuffs<00:00:57.320> 50%<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> pretty<00:00:58.680> good<00:00:58.890> and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.000 

wrathful<00:01:03.120> attack<00:01:03.480> attacks<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> enemy<00:01:04.860> by

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
wrathful attack attacks the enemy by

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
wrathful attack attacks the enemy by
hurling<00:01:05.339> an<00:01:05.489> axe<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.030> wrath<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.600> increases

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
hurling an axe of wrath and increases

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.140 
hurling an axe of wrath and increases
your<00:01:07.560> attack<00:01:07.650> gauge<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.280> 50%

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
your attack gauge by 50%

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.420 
your attack gauge by 50%
so<00:01:09.689> he<00:01:09.780> gets<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.439> bit<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.799> speed<00:01:11.189> buff

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so he gets a little bit of a speed buff

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.929 
so he gets a little bit of a speed buff
there<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.060> he<00:01:12.210> uses<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.720> attack<00:01:13.939> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
there when he uses this attack it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.210 
there when he uses this attack it
basically<00:01:15.360> cuts<00:01:15.630> his<00:01:15.900> wait<00:01:16.740> time<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.100> his

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
basically cuts his wait time for his

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
basically cuts his wait time for his
neck<00:01:17.400> turn<00:01:17.610> next<00:01:18.060> turn<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.930> half<00:01:20.570> that's<00:01:21.570> all

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
neck turn next turn in half that's all

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.359 
neck turn next turn in half that's all
it<00:01:21.869> does<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.350> ruins<00:01:22.920> aren't<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.280> gonna

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it does so ruins aren't really gonna

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.160 
it does so ruins aren't really gonna
help<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:25.939> confiscate<00:01:27.020> attacks<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
help that one and confiscate attacks the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
help that one and confiscate attacks the
enemy<00:01:28.290> two<00:01:28.680> times<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.369> steals<00:01:29.640> one

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
enemy two times and steals one

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.350 
enemy two times and steals one
beneficial<00:01:30.659> effect<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.470> 75%<00:01:32.369> chance<00:01:32.640> for

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
beneficial effect with a 75% chance for

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.280 
beneficial effect with a 75% chance for
each<00:01:33.630> attack<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.240> pretty<00:01:36.450> good<00:01:36.689> that's

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
each attack so that's pretty good that's

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.600 
each attack so that's pretty good that's
great

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
great

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.800 
great
he'll<00:01:39.240> steal<00:01:39.540> buffs<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.439> well<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.670> he<00:01:42.420> removes

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
he'll steal buffs as well as he removes

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.410 
he'll steal buffs as well as he removes
them<00:01:43.079> from<00:01:43.110> an<00:01:43.530> enemy<00:01:43.829> 75%<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.939> pretty<00:01:45.180> high

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
them from an enemy 75% is pretty high

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.730 
them from an enemy 75% is pretty high
and<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> feeling<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.350> when<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and I have a feeling that when you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.520 
and I have a feeling that when you
upgrade<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:48.180> attack<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:48.750> max<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.380> its

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
upgrade this attack or max out its

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.100 
upgrade this attack or max out its
skills<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.990> might<00:01:52.380> move<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:54.110> 80%

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
skills it might move up to like an 80%

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.800 
skills it might move up to like an 80%
or<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:55.890> higher<00:01:56.130> potentially<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:59.450> hmm<00:02:00.509> he's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
or even higher potentially so hmm he's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.660 
or even higher potentially so hmm he's
an<00:02:00.990> attack<00:02:01.320> type<00:02:04.100> with<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.130> ability<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
an attack type with the ability to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.839 
an attack type with the ability to
inflict<00:02:06.659> continuous<00:02:07.170> damage<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.849> steal

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
inflict continuous damage and steal

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.930 
inflict continuous damage and steal
buffs<00:02:09.649> he<00:02:10.649> also<00:02:10.890> attacks<00:02:11.190> twice<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.790> these

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
buffs he also attacks twice with these

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.190 
buffs he also attacks twice with these
two<00:02:12.150> skills

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
two skills

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440 
two skills
and<00:02:13.290> then<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.190> increases<00:02:14.670> his<00:02:14.940> speed<00:02:15.000> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and then this one increases his speed a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.509 
and then this one increases his speed a
little<00:02:15.720> bit<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.530> turn<00:02:18.200> hmm<00:02:19.260> well<00:02:20.190> he's<00:02:20.430> an

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
little bit for one turn hmm well he's an

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.800 
little bit for one turn hmm well he's an
attack<00:02:20.790> type<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> would<00:02:21.330> definitely<00:02:21.690> go

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
attack type so I would definitely go

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.280 
attack type so I would definitely go
attack<00:02:22.140> rune<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.269> fatal<00:02:24.690> runes<00:02:24.959> if

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
attack rune so you can do fatal runes if

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.740 
attack rune so you can do fatal runes if
your<00:02:25.470> earlier<00:02:26.129> levels<00:02:26.519> or<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:27.360> could<00:02:27.510> try<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
your earlier levels or you could try the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.830 
your earlier levels or you could try the
rage<00:02:28.080> blade<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.920> system<00:02:29.819> with<00:02:29.970> him<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.540> go

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
rage blade a system with him and go

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.370 
rage blade a system with him and go
all-out<00:02:31.050> attack<00:02:31.500> power<00:02:32.090> now<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.510> think<00:02:34.200> with

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
all-out attack power now I think with

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.229 
all-out attack power now I think with
him<00:02:34.620> something<00:02:35.130> that's<00:02:35.280> really<00:02:35.670> important<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
him something that's really important to

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.199 
him something that's really important to
keep<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.569> mind<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:37.280> having<00:02:38.280> sub<00:02:38.700> stats<00:02:39.000> with

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
keep in mind is having sub stats with

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.940 
keep in mind is having sub stats with
accuracy<00:02:40.310> because<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:42.000> resist<00:02:42.950> stealing

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
accuracy because you can resist stealing

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.150 
accuracy because you can resist stealing
beneficial<00:02:44.489> effects<00:02:45.470> when<00:02:46.470> he<00:02:46.620> attacks<00:02:46.920> they

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
beneficial effects when he attacks they

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.400 
beneficial effects when he attacks they
can<00:02:47.310> possibly<00:02:47.459> resist<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.420> they<00:02:49.049> can<00:02:49.170> also

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
can possibly resist it and they can also

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.020 
can possibly resist it and they can also
resist<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.069> continuous<00:02:50.549> damage<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:53.030> make

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
resist the continuous damage so make

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.160 
resist the continuous damage so make
sure<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.390> at<00:02:54.660> least<00:02:55.019> improve<00:02:55.799> his<00:02:56.010> accuracy

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
sure you at least improve his accuracy

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.170 
sure you at least improve his accuracy
85%<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.349> maxing<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.250> out<00:02:59.400> that's<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.819> best<00:03:00.060> you

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
85% is maxing it out that's the best you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.080 
85% is maxing it out that's the best you
can<00:03:00.299> do<00:03:00.450> really<00:03:00.690> with<00:03:00.900> accuracy

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
can do really with accuracy

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.270 
can do really with accuracy
you<00:03:03.420> could<00:03:03.870> go<00:03:04.709> fatal<00:03:05.489> runes<00:03:05.760> with<00:03:07.280> focus

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
you could go fatal runes with focus

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.960 
you could go fatal runes with focus
runes<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:09.650> then<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:11.010> attack<00:03:11.370> percentage<00:03:11.819> on

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
runes and then do attack percentage on

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.900 
runes and then do attack percentage on
to<00:03:12.209> attack<00:03:12.660> percentage<00:03:13.110> on<00:03:13.260> four<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.950> you

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
to attack percentage on four and you

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.850 
to attack percentage on four and you
could<00:03:15.209> do<00:03:15.329> accuracy<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:15.989> six<00:03:16.349> that's<00:03:16.560> if<00:03:16.739> you

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
could do accuracy on six that's if you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.920 
could do accuracy on six that's if you
can't<00:03:17.130> get<00:03:17.310> any<00:03:17.489> accuracy<00:03:18.000> sub<00:03:18.389> stats<00:03:18.660> if

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
can't get any accuracy sub stats if

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.530 
can't get any accuracy sub stats if
you've<00:03:19.530> got<00:03:19.739> great<00:03:20.069> accuracy<00:03:20.459> sub<00:03:20.880> stats<00:03:21.209> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
you've got great accuracy sub stats and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.910 
you've got great accuracy sub stats and
you<00:03:22.230> still<00:03:22.530> want<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.310> go<00:03:23.639> fatal<00:03:24.299> focus<00:03:24.920> do

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
you still want to go fatal focus do

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.160 
you still want to go fatal focus do
attack<00:03:26.190> percentage<00:03:26.609> on<00:03:26.790> slot<00:03:27.269> six<00:03:27.569> as<00:03:27.750> well

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:40.210 

let's<00:03:31.170> take<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> look<00:03:31.769> at<00:03:32.900> when<00:03:33.900> he<00:03:34.010> awakens

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.640 

what<00:03:41.220> does<00:03:41.430> he<00:03:41.670> receive<00:03:44.900> okay<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:45.959> he<00:03:46.290> gets<00:03:46.500> an

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
what does he receive okay so he gets an

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.920 
what does he receive okay so he gets an
accuracy<00:03:47.340> bonus<00:03:47.609> right<00:03:48.120> here<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:48.569> I<00:03:48.600> wouldn't

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
accuracy bonus right here so I wouldn't

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.599 
accuracy bonus right here so I wouldn't
even<00:03:49.019> bother<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.709> focus<00:03:50.069> runes<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.489> be

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
even bother with focus runes to be

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.210 
even bother with focus runes to be
honest<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.150> would<00:03:52.019> do<00:03:52.139> fatal<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.010> blade

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
honest I would do fatal and blade

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.979 
honest I would do fatal and blade
actually<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.700> would<00:03:53.910> go<00:03:54.030> rage<00:03:54.269> blade<00:03:54.630> with<00:03:54.840> this

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
actually I would go rage blade with this

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.500 
actually I would go rage blade with this
guy<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:56.400> might<00:03:56.639> be<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.910> best<00:03:57.060> way<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.269> use

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
guy that might be the best way to use

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.610 
guy that might be the best way to use
him<00:03:57.829> rageblade<00:03:58.940> still<00:03:59.940> look<00:04:00.329> for<00:04:00.720> accuracy

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
him rageblade still look for accuracy

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.129 
him rageblade still look for accuracy
sub<00:04:01.889> stats<00:04:02.190> because<00:04:02.459> 25%<00:04:03.359> is<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> bonus<00:04:03.959> but

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
sub stats because 25% is a bonus but

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.460 
sub stats because 25% is a bonus but
it's<00:04:04.319> not<00:04:04.579> necessarily<00:04:05.579> going<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.470> ensure

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it's not necessarily going to ensure

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.280 
it's not necessarily going to ensure
that<00:04:07.500> his<00:04:08.069> debuffs<00:04:08.819> are<00:04:09.090> going<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.480> work<00:04:09.720> for

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
that his debuffs are going to work for

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.180 
that his debuffs are going to work for
you<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.940> go<00:04:12.090> rage<00:04:12.299> blade<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.019> do<00:04:13.859> attack

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you so go rage blade and do attack

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.990 
you so go rage blade and do attack
percentage<00:04:14.669> on<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:16.280> attack<00:04:17.280> percentage<00:04:17.789> on

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
percentage on to attack percentage on

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.320 
percentage on to attack percentage on
six<00:04:19.549> crit<00:04:20.549> rate<00:04:20.849> on<00:04:22.370> four<00:04:23.370> unless<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:24.000> can<00:04:24.150> get

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
six crit rate on four unless you can get

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.930 
six crit rate on four unless you can get
really<00:04:24.840> high<00:04:25.140> crit<00:04:25.530> rate<00:04:25.740> substantially

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
really high crit rate substantially

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.880 
really high crit rate substantially
of<00:04:27.000> your<00:04:27.120> wounds<00:04:27.330> then<00:04:27.690> do<00:04:27.870> crit<00:04:28.140> damage<00:04:28.380> on

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
of your wounds then do crit damage on

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.070 
of your wounds then do crit damage on
four<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.670> he'll<00:04:29.760> do<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.940> crazy<00:04:30.570> amount<00:04:30.990> of

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
four and he'll do a crazy amount of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.960 
four and he'll do a crazy amount of
damage<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:32.070> he<00:04:32.190> doesn't<00:04:32.460> attack<00:04:32.670> multiple

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
damage so he doesn't attack multiple

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.080 
damage so he doesn't attack multiple
enemies<00:04:33.540> he's<00:04:34.110> sort<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.620> one-hit<00:04:35.220> I'm

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
enemies he's sort of a one-hit I'm

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.030 
enemies he's sort of a one-hit I'm
assuming<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.110> nuclear<00:04:37.530> tight

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
assuming a nuclear tight

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.540 
assuming a nuclear tight
so<00:04:38.700> go<00:04:38.850> rageblade<00:04:39.450> look<00:04:40.230> for<00:04:40.530> crit<00:04:41.010> rate<00:04:41.220> sub

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
so go rageblade look for crit rate sub

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.000 
so go rageblade look for crit rate sub
starts<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.180> accuracy<00:04:42.990> sub<00:04:43.230> stats<00:04:43.530> those<00:04:43.860> are

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
starts and accuracy sub stats those are

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.350 
starts and accuracy sub stats those are
the<00:04:44.130> two<00:04:44.310> things<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.700> are<00:04:44.820> going<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.150> really

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
the two things that are going to really

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.530 
the two things that are going to really
help<00:04:45.660> him<00:04:45.750> out<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.960> few<00:04:46.320> go<00:04:46.470> rageblade<00:04:47.360> if<00:04:48.360> you

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
help him out a few go rageblade if you
