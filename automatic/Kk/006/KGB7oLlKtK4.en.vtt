00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.690
 notebook cover damage and took advantage of 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.350
 milk carton in the river I cut 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.779

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.680
 of notebook makes with some cardboard that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.170
 is good movie that its role does not have to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.410
 be hard if that is not the soft cardboard 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.500
 O works out there that cardboard here is good 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.649
 very firm and that's all 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.930
 this is ideal or if you do with 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.129
 The notebook has to be the one that ends 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.100
 to work hard, huh? 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 it is very firm there if your 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
 Your notebook was cool, you do not even need it. 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.780
 paste the gift paper you can 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.659
 to take the picture of the notebook is good 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:14.369
 People will need glue scissors 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:20.070
 pen and gift paper 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:25.490
 Let's do it, then we'll go, my God, the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:30.930
 ii day hand that for power is to get around 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.780
 This will tell about your mother and after that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.130
 to get around people will cut this 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.130
 format aquino copila 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.530
 There are going to draw here, we'll go. 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:55.619
 Remember the young person I cut one here 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.630
 look like this 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.240
 we was not part of the fingers very 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.429
 thick because otherwise the ring after a 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.200
 The right fit is low 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.229
 I try to do a little bit more fininha 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.250
 when it was cut there will be left there to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.470
 people will get the gift paper one 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.239
 this paper you have chosen not 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.590
 any paper that is more or 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.540
 less cute, right? 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:30.450
 There we go and put your hand on it. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:34.019
 the paper and get around 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.739
 to finish as he did with his hand to 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.549
 then cut and paste here in 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.310
 top 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.049
 if you want to make one side a picture 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.849
 paper pinch on the other side you can 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.109
 put another different role for 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.400
 do not get sick 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:53.010
 You can vary coffees with this one. 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.180
 this here in front of the thing if this 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.120
 padinha and behind it was this pink uniso 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.060
 You may be doing this too if you 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.250
 you want with us means not 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.709
 neither here nor in the new role of 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.150
 Little hand and then I remember it already has 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.040
 one here clipped 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.989
 It stays there like this stays the way it is. 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.280
 same model of the hands there we go 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.459
 hang glue here in the little cardboard hand 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.139
 I like to start here because of this 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.810
 base not by fingers 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.760
 I pass the glue here and saw and I come 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.620
 speaking that there is no secret is very 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.760
 easy people she'll be like this 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:40.450
 okay we will paste 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.450
 the paper 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:54.409
 get off your glue and put on the fluff 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:14.569
 straightens just right so that justifies 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.569
 to pass a little thing practice the defendant 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.350
 I think normal 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.830
 if you want to do with fabric too 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:54.450
 It 's only okay to buy that glue for 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:05:00.590
 have been but with gift wrap 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.590
 It's also easier, and it looks beautiful. 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:27.450
 now adjusting the lion's share already had 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:30.030
 cane lid to wait to dry to make 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.970
 at the base we will need a 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.600
 if you want to make a round take a 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.810
 state bank is round 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.850
 So I took this square, it's the way it goes. 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.950
 what you want and if you want to do it 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.320
 more rectangular so longer 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.570
 you can do if you want to make it round like 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.990
 I spoke depending on your pocket 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:57.750
 there it is only to get around the card in the format 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:59.910
 you want to make the base and then cut 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.990
 and unable to play the role of gift 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.140
 you want 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:08.190
 now it's just a cut I've already made one here 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.630
 I already cut and in cape that part 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.420
 will stay up, will not you? 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.880
 We're going to fit the little hand here. 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.270
 necklace and poet ready, it's good to paste 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.100
 here the little hand on the base is good you use 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.800
 hot glue if you do not have hot glue 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:28.380
 You can use super bonder we've ever done 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:31.410
 one with the knife had I made a cut in the 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.500
 cardboard for us to pass glue 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.880
 here and fit little hand 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.840
 There, it's going to be ready. Then people. 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.000
 finished 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:47.980
 she got this way the base is that of 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.840
 cardboard with showed that we made the cut 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:56.139
 without here I pass the superbom 11 and put the 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.780
 she was on the other side also put 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:02.620
 the same role that I had with this role 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.120
 gift but as he had O 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.210
 the other is this one that I already had 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.620
 shown neither to you than the pink 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:14.440
 and it was very cool there 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.300
 I hope you have enjoyed people going 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.050
 put this I did since a little more 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:24.210
 thin 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:27.340
 The ring arrives until the end, this is for 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.450
 here to get better up here 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.040
 little end 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.960
 the other time we devote a little more 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.669
 thick then the ring is not up to the 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.479
 end this way 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:39.160
 now it's better that those who do not like it 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:44.490
 of a doubt 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.490
 You can write there and I'll answer, okay? 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.000
 I hope you have enjoyed people see
