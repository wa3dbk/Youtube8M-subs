this<00:00:04.980> at<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.190> different<00:00:05.549> speed<00:00:05.690> pursuit<00:00:06.690> angles

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
this at a different speed pursuit angles

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.750 
this at a different speed pursuit angles
visually<00:00:07.890> looking<00:00:08.160> like<00:00:08.340> they're<00:00:08.429> improved

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
visually looking like they're improved

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.970 
visually looking like they're improved
when<00:00:08.880> they're<00:00:09.030> not<00:00:09.179> here's<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.990> Griffin<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
when they're not here's a Griffin the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.919 
when they're not here's a Griffin the
safety<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.820> Titans<00:00:12.210> he's<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> ground

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
safety for the Titans he's on the ground

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.620 
safety for the Titans he's on the ground
and<00:00:13.500> i<00:00:14.340> want<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.580> show<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.880> he<00:00:15.089> gets<00:00:15.360> up

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and i want to show you that he gets up

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.990 
and i want to show you that he gets up
and<00:00:15.870> because<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.379> hitch<00:00:16.680> step<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.640> allows

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and because of this hitch step it allows

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.910 
and because of this hitch step it allows
him<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.300> catch<00:00:18.630> joseph<00:00:19.350> addai<00:00:19.470> which

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
him to catch joseph addai which

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.009 
him to catch joseph addai which
obviously<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.550> me<00:00:20.930> on<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.850> run<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:24.900> I've

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
obviously is me on this run so what I've

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.650 
obviously is me on this run so what I've
got<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:26.090> again<00:00:27.090> you're<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.449> see

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
got here is again you're going to see

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.750 
got here is again you're going to see
what<00:00:27.900> my<00:00:28.019> left<00:00:28.289> foot<00:00:28.500> plants<00:00:28.949> my<00:00:29.130> player<00:00:29.400> stops

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
what my left foot plants my player stops

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.590 
what my left foot plants my player stops
running<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:31.289> holds<00:00:31.949> my<00:00:32.250> player<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:32.880> until

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
running and it holds my player up until

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.490 
running and it holds my player up until
the<00:00:34.440> pursuit<00:00:34.950> angle<00:00:35.370> improves<00:00:36.140> where<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> can

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the pursuit angle improves where I can

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.729 
the pursuit angle improves where I can
get<00:00:37.620> tackled<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.719> hopefully<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.590> lot

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
get tackled and hopefully it's a lot

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
get tackled and hopefully it's a lot
easier<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.129> see<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> game<00:00:42.030> speed<00:00:42.360> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
easier to see now that the game speed is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.290 
easier to see now that the game speed is
on<00:00:42.629> fast<00:00:42.930> i'll<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.350> sit<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.800> time<00:00:44.300> real

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
on fast i'll just sit one more time real

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.760 
on fast i'll just sit one more time real
slow<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:45.899> i<00:00:45.989> want<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.559> time

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
slow and then i want to do it one time

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.310 
slow and then i want to do it one time
at<00:00:46.980> speed<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.020> almost

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
at speed and you can see how this almost

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709 
at speed and you can see how this almost
looks<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> frame<00:00:50.160> rate<00:00:50.430> issue<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.480> is

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
looks like a frame rate issue but it is

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.310 
looks like a frame rate issue but it is
the<00:00:51.899> game<00:00:52.110> impeding<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.070> players<00:00:53.730> progress

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
the game impeding your players progress

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.900 
the game impeding your players progress
so<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:55.980> tackled<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.789> i

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
so that you can get tackled and like i

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.689 
so that you can get tackled and like i
said<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.210> more<00:00:57.329> time<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:58.230> note<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.550> can

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
said one more time just note if you can

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.099 
said one more time just note if you can

how my player in the referee look and
how<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.339> does<00:01:05.489> look<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.880> maybe<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> frame

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
how it does look like maybe it's a frame

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.330 
how it does look like maybe it's a frame
rate<00:01:06.960> thing<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.159> see<00:01:08.310> just

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
rate thing but it's not you can see just

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.120 
rate thing but it's not you can see just
how<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> lipsy<00:01:09.090> things<00:01:09.330> start<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> look<00:01:09.720> here

am<00:01:25.640> now<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.659> into<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> settings

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
am now I want to go into the settings

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
am now I want to go into the settings
here<00:01:28.850> you'll<00:01:29.850> notice<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.420> four

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
here you'll notice that it's four

here you'll notice that it's four
minutes<00:01:31.020> seven<00:01:31.320> minute<00:01:31.500> quarters<00:01:31.710> I've<00:01:32.220> only

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
minutes seven minute quarters I've only

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.539 
minutes seven minute quarters I've only
had<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> ball<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.150> two<00:01:33.570> plays<00:01:34.290> we'll<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
had the ball for two plays we'll go to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.690 
had the ball for two plays we'll go to
the<00:01:36.090> game<00:01:36.630> settings<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> we'll<00:01:38.369> look<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.579> my

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the game settings and we'll look at my

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.640 
the game settings and we'll look at my
game<00:01:38.909> options<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.960> you'll<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.350> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
game options and you'll see that this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
game options and you'll see that this
game<00:01:40.950> speed<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.729> fast<00:01:42.000> last<00:01:42.479> video<00:01:42.780> is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
game speed is now on fast last video is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.240 
game speed is now on fast last video is
on<00:01:43.079> slow<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:43.920> bit<00:01:44.040> more

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on slow so it's a little bit more

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.399
