post a little quick video and show you
how<00:00:16.770> they<00:00:16.949> should<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.520> when<00:00:17.789> they're<00:00:17.970> all<00:00:18.119> said

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
how they should be when they're all said

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.279 
how they should be when they're all said
and<00:00:18.510> done<00:00:19.460> first<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.880> see<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> v2<00:00:21.570> RP

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

and done first of all you see the v2 RP
turnbuckle<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:23.100> installed<00:00:23.660> steering<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
turnbuckle here installed steering is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.349 
turnbuckle here installed steering is
basically<00:00:25.199> straight<00:00:25.859> forward<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:27.029> wheels

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
basically straight forward the wheels

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.800 
basically straight forward the wheels
are<00:00:27.539> straight<00:00:28.160> if<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.460> will<00:00:30.000> pan<00:00:30.240> down<00:00:30.480> here

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
are straight if you will pan down here

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.790 
are straight if you will pan down here
if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.890> look<00:00:32.210> at<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.420> outer<00:00:33.630> you'll<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
if you look at the outer you'll see the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.030 
if you look at the outer you'll see the
two<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.130> bands<00:00:35.809> signifying<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> outer<00:00:37.140> on

the<00:00:38.430> tie<00:00:38.579> rods<00:00:39.200> I'm<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.379> rotate<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:41.100> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the tie rods I'm gonna rotate this you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.740 
the tie rods I'm gonna rotate this you
look<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.480> there<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> possibly<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
look up in there and possibly see the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
look up in there and possibly see the
stand<00:00:45.750> off<00:00:45.930> spacer<00:00:46.410> goes<00:00:46.680> between<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> ball

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
stand off spacer goes between the ball

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.630 
stand off spacer goes between the ball
and<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.940> steering<00:00:48.210> arm<00:00:48.510> itself<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> outer

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
and the steering arm itself on the outer

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.090 
and the steering arm itself on the outer
it's<00:00:50.640> exactly<00:00:51.390> opposite<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it's exactly opposite of that on the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.720 
it's exactly opposite of that on the
inner<00:00:53.510> as<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.809> maybe<00:00:55.350> see<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.800> there<00:00:58.730> also

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
inner as you can maybe see in there also

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.110 
inner as you can maybe see in there also
if<00:01:00.359> you'll<00:01:00.539> notice<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:02.039> center<00:01:02.460> link<00:01:02.640> itself

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
if you'll notice the center link itself

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.969 
if you'll notice the center link itself
is<00:01:03.780> centered<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> threads<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.650> inner

rod end and the outer rod end the jam
that<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.560> run<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.979> tight<00:01:11.250> once<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.590> proper<00:01:13.590> toe

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that is run up tight once the proper toe

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
that is run up tight once the proper toe
is<00:01:13.950> set<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.250> lock<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:18.659> jam

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
is set you have this will lock the jam

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020

the<00:01:19.439> rod<00:01:19.710> end<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.490> keep<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.820> from

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the rod end on there and keep it from

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
the rod end on there and keep it from
backing<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:22.170> while<00:01:22.409> you're<00:01:22.590> running<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
backing out while you're running you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.530 
backing out while you're running you
don't<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> crank<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.210> this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
don't really have to crank down on this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.440 
don't really have to crank down on this
but<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> don't<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.350> pretty<00:01:25.560> snug<00:01:26.450> also

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
but you don't get it pretty snug also

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.660 
but you don't get it pretty snug also
you'll<00:01:27.630> notice<00:01:27.869> there's<00:01:28.799> free<00:01:29.189> range<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you'll notice there's free range of

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.260 
you'll notice there's free range of
motion<00:01:30.710> as<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:32.490> these<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.820> installed

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
motion as if these are installed

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
motion as if these are installed
properly<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.350> equal<00:01:34.530> rotation<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
properly you get equal rotation of the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.870 
properly you get equal rotation of the
inner<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> outer<00:01:36.380> rod<00:01:37.380> end<00:01:37.710> whether<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
inner and the outer rod end whether the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.490 
inner and the outer rod end whether the
steering<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.299> cranked<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.020> left<00:01:40.229> or

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
steering is cranked right to left or

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.600 
steering is cranked right to left or
straight<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:41.040> whatever

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
straight or whatever

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.420 
straight or whatever
this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.570> pretty<00:01:42.720> critical<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.250> this

plenty<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.909> range<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.360> motion<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.920> get

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
plenty of range of motion if you get

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.449 
plenty of range of motion if you get
them<00:02:05.280> installed<00:02:05.670> nice<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.149> equal<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:07.459> hope
