00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.189 
there John well I was working a lot with
the<00:03:43.220> government<00:03:43.669> in<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:43.910> US<00:03:44.030> Congress<00:03:44.419> years

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
the government in the US Congress years

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.240 
the government in the US Congress years
back<00:03:46.060> introducing<00:03:47.060> common-sense<00:03:48.250> solutions

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
back introducing common-sense solutions

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.189 
back introducing common-sense solutions
that<00:03:49.459> are<00:03:49.609> sustainable<00:03:52.090> prevention-oriented

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
that are sustainable prevention-oriented

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.589 
that are sustainable prevention-oriented
it<00:03:54.199> turns<00:03:54.470> out<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.919> there<00:03:55.129> are<00:03:55.159> solutions<00:03:55.639> to

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
it turns out that there are solutions to

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.199 
it turns out that there are solutions to
most<00:03:56.989> of<00:03:57.319> our<00:03:57.470> pressing<00:03:58.159> social<00:03:58.370> problems<00:03:58.549> of

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
most of our pressing social problems of

most of our pressing social problems of
health<00:03:59.720> care<00:04:00.109> and<00:04:00.290> education<00:04:00.530> crime

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
health care and education crime

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.569 
health care and education crime
prevention<00:04:01.599> that<00:04:02.599> government<00:04:03.079> just<00:04:03.230> isn't

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
prevention that government just isn't

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.149 
prevention that government just isn't

parallel<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.490> one<00:04:46.640> in<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.850> UK<00:04:47.060> but<00:04:47.450> it<00:04:47.540> was

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
parallel to one in the UK but it was

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.230 
parallel to one in the UK but it was
bigger<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.140> more<00:04:48.380> mainstream<00:04:49.240> eventually

bigger and more mainstream eventually
that<00:04:50.390> grew<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.870> absorb<00:04:51.350> most<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.520> what<00:04:52.670> is

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
that grew to absorb most of what is

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.340 
that grew to absorb most of what is
called<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.060> Reform<00:04:53.540> Party<00:04:53.600> that<00:04:54.230> was
