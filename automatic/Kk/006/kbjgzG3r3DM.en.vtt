00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
and and I think when you assemble a cast

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.650 
and and I think when you assemble a cast
like<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.579> it<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.060> was<00:02:57.090> destined<00:02:57.540> for

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
like that it was it was destined for

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.910 
like that it was it was destined for
success<00:02:57.810> but<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.319> was<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:58.799> cool

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
success but it was a really really cool

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.069 
success but it was a really really cool
movie<00:02:59.400> I<00:03:00.000> think<00:03:00.660> they're<00:03:00.750> gonna<00:03:00.840> come<00:03:01.049> out

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079
