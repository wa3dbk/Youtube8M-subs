00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
okay this is a glide okay first thing

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.220 
okay this is a glide okay first thing
you<00:00:13.960> do<00:00:14.140> to<00:00:15.099> make<00:00:15.250> glider<00:00:15.580> as<00:00:16.240> you<00:00:16.570> fold<00:00:16.900> the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
you do to make glider as you fold the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.420 
you do to make glider as you fold the
plane<00:00:17.769> in<00:00:18.070> half

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.540 

so<00:00:25.430> it's<00:00:25.700> a<00:00:25.820> half<00:00:26.290> nice<00:00:27.290> you<00:00:28.070> can<00:00:28.220> call<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.490> a

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
so it's a half nice you can call it a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.910 
so it's a half nice you can call it a
hot<00:00:28.760> dog<00:00:28.970> food<00:00:29.270> so<00:00:29.570> people<00:00:29.840> call<00:00:29.990> that<00:00:30.170> yeah

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
hot dog food so people call that yeah

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.020 
hot dog food so people call that yeah
and<00:00:31.300> then<00:00:32.300> what<00:00:32.720> you<00:00:32.810> do<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:34.010> open<00:00:34.850> this

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
and then what you do is you open this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.110 
and then what you do is you open this
back<00:00:35.270> up<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:36.230> know<00:00:36.440> still<00:00:36.500> nice<00:00:37.100> fold<00:00:37.580> how

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
back up you know still nice fold how

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.420 
back up you know still nice fold how
about<00:00:38.989> see<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.470> nice<00:00:40.720> crease<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:43.370> then

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
about see you a nice crease and then

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.330 
about see you a nice crease and then
like<00:00:44.030> as<00:00:44.210> with<00:00:44.450> austerity<00:00:44.780> between<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:46.010> fold

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
like as with austerity between you fold

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.700 
like as with austerity between you fold
the<00:00:46.640> triangle<00:00:47.080> in<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.600> crease<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.270> got

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
the triangle in to the crease so you got

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.460 
the triangle in to the crease so you got
two<00:00:54.710> triangles<00:00:55.660> in<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:58.129> crease<00:00:58.690> then<00:00:59.690> from

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
two triangles in the crease then from

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.770 
two triangles in the crease then from
this<00:01:00.710> part<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.250> fold<00:01:01.610> down<00:01:01.970> so<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:02.480> take<00:01:02.750> a

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
this part you fold down so you take a

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.360 
this part you fold down so you take a
whole<00:01:03.050> triangle<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:03.620> made<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:03.920> fold<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.220> down

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
whole triangle you made and fold it down

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.210 
whole triangle you made and fold it down
just<00:01:05.000> as<00:01:05.210> much<00:01:05.360> as<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.750> need<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.620> should

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
just as much as you need to so it should

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.910 
just as much as you need to so it should
be<00:01:07.250> folded<00:01:07.850> right<00:01:08.150> here<00:01:08.710> here's<00:01:09.710> falling

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
be folded right here here's falling

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.170 
be folded right here here's falling
straight<00:01:10.159> down<00:01:10.220> if<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.610> push<00:01:10.820> back<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.060> little

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
straight down if you push back a little

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.000 
straight down if you push back a little
you<00:01:11.570> feel<00:01:11.810> your<00:01:11.990> limits<00:01:13.210> sit<00:01:14.210> down<00:01:14.890> then<00:01:15.890> you

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
you feel your limits sit down then you

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.160 
you feel your limits sit down then you
take<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:16.400> triangle<00:01:17.150> part<00:01:17.390> on<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.659> tip<00:01:17.900> and

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
take this triangle part on the tip and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.270 
take this triangle part on the tip and
pull<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.770> about<00:01:19.010> an<00:01:19.310> inch<00:01:19.640> up<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.130> got<00:01:22.250> a

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
pull it about an inch up so you got a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.430 
pull it about an inch up so you got a
little<00:01:22.400> tip<00:01:22.700> now<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.420> take<00:01:23.540> this<00:01:23.750> corner<00:01:24.140> and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
little tip now you take this corner and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.720 
little tip now you take this corner and
bring<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.070> corner<00:01:25.370> of<00:01:25.640> this<00:01:26.270> triangle

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
bring it to the corner of this triangle

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.150 
bring it to the corner of this triangle
so<00:01:28.730> it<00:01:28.910> kind<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.240> makes<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.510> little<00:01:29.720> thing<00:01:31.180> so

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
so it kind of makes a little thing so

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.100 
so it kind of makes a little thing so
you're<00:01:34.160> folding<00:01:34.400> each<00:01:34.760> corner<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.510> the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
you're folding each corner to the

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.860 
you're folding each corner to the
triangle<00:01:36.970> are<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.060> doing<00:01:38.270> on<00:01:38.360> both<00:01:38.570> sides

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
triangle are you doing on both sides

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.460 
triangle are you doing on both sides
this<00:01:39.800> really

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.140 

and<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:45.800> have<00:01:46.010> something<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.730> car<00:01:46.940> looks

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
and you have something the car looks

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.120 
and you have something the car looks
like<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:48.650> then<00:01:49.660> since<00:01:50.660> you<00:01:51.050> this<00:01:51.560> when

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
like this and then since you this when

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.160 
like this and then since you this when
you<00:01:52.310> turn<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.790> over<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:56.440> close<00:01:57.440> it<00:01:59.080> so<00:02:00.080> you

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
you turn it over and you close it so you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.840 
you turn it over and you close it so you
have<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.530> folded<00:02:01.010> parts<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.430> did<00:02:01.700> on

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
have the folded parts that you did on

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.260 
have the folded parts that you did on
the<00:02:01.970> outside<00:02:02.830> then<00:02:03.830> what<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.100> do<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:05.240> take

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the outside then what you do is you take

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.050 
the outside then what you do is you take
this<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:05.990> fold<00:02:06.410> it<00:02:06.560> down<00:02:06.830> right<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.880> you

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
this and you fold it down right and you

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.060 
this and you fold it down right and you
match<00:02:08.290> this<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.399> bottom<00:02:11.240> here<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.980> you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
match this to the bottom here so you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.560 
match this to the bottom here so you
just<00:02:13.220> going<00:02:13.430> out<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.970> flatten<00:02:14.209> out<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:17.240> then

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
just going out and flatten out and then

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.740 
just going out and flatten out and then
you<00:02:17.900> flip<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.230> over<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:20.150> do<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.720> same

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
you flip it over and you do the same

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.550 
you flip it over and you do the same
thing<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.739> side<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:26.450> get<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:27.020> and

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
thing to this side so you get this and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.340 
thing to this side so you get this and
then<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.190> grabbed<00:02:28.640> by<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.940> end<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.810> closin

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
then you grabbed by the end you closin

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.160 
then you grabbed by the end you closin
up<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.270> this<00:02:32.270> is<00:02:32.540> how<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.840> play

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
up like this and this is how you play

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.340 
up like this and this is how you play
looks<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.610> end<00:02:37.690> okay<00:02:38.690> we<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
looks in the end okay we have the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.520 
looks in the end okay we have the
gliders<00:02:39.739> here<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:41.270> got<00:02:41.360> two<00:02:41.570> of<00:02:41.690> them<00:02:41.780> so

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
gliders here and we got two of them so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.050 
gliders here and we got two of them so
I'm<00:02:42.590> going<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.800> test<00:02:42.980> them<00:02:43.130> out<00:02:43.220> these<00:02:43.820> work

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
I'm going to test them out these work

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.430 
I'm going to test them out these work
better<00:02:49.269> they're<00:02:50.269> supposed<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.600> float<00:02:50.930> more<00:02:51.140> so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
better they're supposed to float more so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.930 
better they're supposed to float more so
fear<00:02:51.799> outside<00:02:52.610> are<00:02:52.760> more<00:02:53.000> space<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:54.049> full<00:02:54.940> 10

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
fear outside are more space like full 10

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.640 
fear outside are more space like full 10
second

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
second

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:13.640 
second
you<00:03:01.450> well<00:03:03.939> that's<00:03:04.939> our<00:03:05.239> show

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.709 

you
