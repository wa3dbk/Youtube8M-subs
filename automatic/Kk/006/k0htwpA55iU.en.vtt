00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hello and welcome to this factorio to

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.749 
hello and welcome to this factorio to
toriel<00:00:03.840> my<00:00:03.990> name<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.440> negative<00:00:04.920> root<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.370> we

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
toriel my name is negative root and we

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.570 
toriel my name is negative root and we
are<00:00:05.879> talking<00:00:06.299> about<00:00:06.509> defense<00:00:07.140> today<00:00:07.710> very

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
are talking about defense today very

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.360 
are talking about defense today very
important<00:00:09.090> defense<00:00:09.230> as<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:11.040> increase<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
important defense as you increase the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.419 
important defense as you increase the
bite<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.030> difficulty<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:13.410> will<00:00:13.620> need<00:00:13.920> better

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
bite of difficulty you will need better

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.380 
bite of difficulty you will need better
defenses<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.870> we're<00:00:16.650> going<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.119> run<00:00:18.119> through<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
defenses so we're going to run through a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.029 
defenses so we're going to run through a
couple<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.720> defensive<00:00:19.080> ideas<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:19.710> quickly

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
couple of defensive ideas really quickly

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:20.990 
couple of defensive ideas really quickly
shouldn't<00:00:20.340> take<00:00:20.460> too<00:00:20.490> long

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
shouldn't take too long

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.560 
shouldn't take too long
and<00:00:22.189> you<00:00:23.189> should<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.519> cover<00:00:23.789> off<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.060> all

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
and you should really cover off on all

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.950 
and you should really cover off on all
the<00:00:24.930> difference<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.380> ideas<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> game<00:00:26.310> now

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
the difference of ideas in the game now

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.290 
the difference of ideas in the game now
this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.769> mark<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> probably

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
this is the mark one this is probably

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
this is the mark one this is probably
the<00:00:30.779> first<00:00:31.109> kind<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.859> defensive<00:00:33.050> setup<00:00:34.050> you'll

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the first kind of defensive setup you'll

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.069 
the first kind of defensive setup you'll
create<00:00:34.770> okay<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.149> simple<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.570> very

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
create okay very very simple very very

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.889 
create okay very very simple very very
cheap<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:38.340> very<00:00:38.640> easy<00:00:38.700> now<00:00:39.329> I've<00:00:39.600> done

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
cheap and very very easy now I've done

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
cheap and very very easy now I've done
it<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.079> laser<00:00:40.290> tyrants<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> can't

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
it with laser tyrants because I can't

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.819 
it with laser tyrants because I can't
bother<00:00:41.579> building<00:00:41.879> gun<00:00:42.329> turrets<00:00:42.750> you'll<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
bother building gun turrets you'll do it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
bother building gun turrets you'll do it
with<00:00:43.920> gun<00:00:44.070> turrets<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> early<00:00:44.879> game<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
with gun turrets in the early game and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.720 
with gun turrets in the early game and
you<00:00:45.809> won't<00:00:45.960> need<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> power<00:00:46.320> pole<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
you won't need a power pole so the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
you won't need a power pole so the
standard<00:00:48.149> thing<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.539> gun<00:00:49.020> torrent<00:00:49.410> go<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
standard thing is gun torrent go and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.549 
standard thing is gun torrent go and
turn<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:50.190> turn<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.809> wall<00:00:51.989> one

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
turn don't turn and then just a wall one

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.430 
turn don't turn and then just a wall one
spacing<00:00:53.340> away<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.690> will<00:00:54.960> hold<00:00:55.199> off

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
spacing away from it that will hold off

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.689 
spacing away from it that will hold off
most<00:00:55.770> things<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.879> least<00:00:57.149> until<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
most things at least until you get to

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.750 
most things at least until you get to
the<00:00:59.699> heavier-duty<00:01:00.239> biters<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.260> when<00:01:01.500> you

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
the heavier-duty biters now when you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
the heavier-duty biters now when you
start<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> build<00:01:03.120> your<00:01:03.270> base<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.140> this

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
start to build your base you can do this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.590 
start to build your base you can do this
kind<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.769> okay<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.150> you've<00:01:06.390> got

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
kind of thing okay and then you've got

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.980 
kind of thing okay and then you've got
your<00:01:06.720> walls<00:01:07.369> starting<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.580> run<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.780> these

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
your walls starting to run from these

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
your walls starting to run from these
little<00:01:10.229> bunkers<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.890> you'll<00:01:11.790> set<00:01:12.180> things<00:01:12.450> up

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
little bunkers and you'll set things up

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.340 
little bunkers and you'll set things up
actually<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.040> ingress<00:01:14.729> points<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.750> you'll

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
actually on the ingress points so you'll

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
actually on the ingress points so you'll
notice<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.799> whenever<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.820> make<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> base

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
notice that whenever you make a base

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.800 
notice that whenever you make a base
right<00:01:18.750> you'll<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.700> biters<00:01:21.150> will<00:01:21.420> attack

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
right you'll have the biters will attack

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.679 
right you'll have the biters will attack
a<00:01:21.840> certain<00:01:22.380> point<00:01:22.590> every<00:01:23.220> single<00:01:23.250> time<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a certain point every single time so you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
a certain point every single time so you
will<00:01:24.960> set<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.340> point<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.850> best

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
will set this up on that point as best

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.140 
will set this up on that point as best
you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.810> okay<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> bit<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you can okay and you can have a bit of a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
you can okay and you can have a bit of a
gas<00:01:30.360> right<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.229> example<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.100> game

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
gas right so for example in this game

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
gas right so for example in this game
it's<00:01:32.640> quite<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.880> light<00:01:33.119> late-game<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it's quite a light late-game but the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's quite a light late-game but the
principle<00:01:34.860> holds<00:01:34.950> true<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.670> base<00:01:35.970> will

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
principle holds true this base will

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.569 
principle holds true this base will
probably<00:01:36.960> attack<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.310> direction

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
probably attack in this direction

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.760 
probably attack in this direction
somewhere<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.810> make<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> beeline

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
somewhere here they just make a beeline

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.639 
somewhere here they just make a beeline
for<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> most<00:01:41.460> polluting<00:01:41.939> source<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.320> is

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
for the most polluting source so that is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
for the most polluting source so that is
the<00:01:43.799> mark<00:01:44.009> 1<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.439> mark<00:01:46.860> 2<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:48.119> pretty

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the mark 1 this is the mark 2 now pretty

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.620 
the mark 1 this is the mark 2 now pretty
simple<00:01:49.140> idea<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:50.430> laser<00:01:50.670> turrets<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.270> wall

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
simple idea just laser turrets a wall

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.100 
simple idea just laser turrets a wall
and<00:01:52.040> Bob's<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.159> uncle<00:01:53.280> Freddy's<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:53.909> aunt

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
and Bob's your uncle Freddy's your aunt

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.350 
and Bob's your uncle Freddy's your aunt
now<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.070> an<00:01:56.219> upgraded<00:01:56.640> version<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
now there is an upgraded version of this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
now there is an upgraded version of this
and<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.560> two<00:01:58.740> things<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.130> can

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and that is one of two things you can

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.840 
and that is one of two things you can
double<00:02:00.450> thickness<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> wall<00:02:01.310> okay<00:02:02.340> that's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
double thickness the wall okay that's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.440 
double thickness the wall okay that's
one<00:02:03.060> option

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
one option

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.869 
one option
you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> also<00:02:04.770> add<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:06.540> transport<00:02:07.500> belts<00:02:07.879> now

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
you can also add in transport belts now

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.900 
you can also add in transport belts now
these<00:02:09.270> transport<00:02:09.899> belts<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.440> keep<00:02:10.910> biters

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
these transport belts will keep biters

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.730 
these transport belts will keep biters
away<00:02:12.209> from<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> wall<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:13.020> for<00:02:13.080> us

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
away from the wall just for us

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.590 
away from the wall just for us
second<00:02:14.070> longer<00:02:14.400> they'll<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.150> running<00:02:15.300> rain

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
second longer they'll be running rain

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.060 
second longer they'll be running rain
running<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.170> I'll<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.440> take<00:02:16.590> them<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.830> little

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
running and I'll just take them a little

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.190 
running and I'll just take them a little
bit<00:02:17.190> longer<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.550> get<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.820> wall<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.270> that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
bit longer to get to the wall and that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.930 
bit longer to get to the wall and that
helps<00:02:19.530> your<00:02:19.740> laser<00:02:20.130> turrets<00:02:20.520> close<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
helps your laser turrets close the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.600 
helps your laser turrets close the
damage<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:22.410> again<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.010> want<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.370> laser

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
damage on now again you want the laser

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.030 
damage on now again you want the laser
turns<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.510> standard<00:02:25.200> distance<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.740> one

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
turns to be a standard distance of one

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.430 
turns to be a standard distance of one
maybe<00:02:26.610> two<00:02:26.970> away<00:02:27.240> from<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.570> wall<00:02:27.750> they<00:02:28.380> do

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
maybe two away from the wall they do

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.010 
maybe two away from the wall they do
have<00:02:28.890> quite<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> good<00:02:29.460> range<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.910> them<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.180> then

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
have quite a good range on them and then

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.650 
have quite a good range on them and then
yeah<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.650> that's<00:02:32.100> kind<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.670> mark<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.210> idea

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
yeah so that's kind of the mark to idea

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.530 
yeah so that's kind of the mark to idea
well<00:02:34.020> mark<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:35.040> two<00:02:35.580> point<00:02:35.880> one<00:02:36.150> would<00:02:36.390> be

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
well mark to two point one would be

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.270 
well mark to two point one would be
double<00:02:36.900> thickness<00:02:37.320> than<00:02:37.590> two<00:02:37.800> point<00:02:38.070> three

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
double thickness than two point three

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.110 
double thickness than two point three
would<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.660> kind<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.020> idea<00:02:40.610> near<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.850> mark

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
would be this kind of idea near the mark

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.120 
would be this kind of idea near the mark
three<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.830> would<00:02:44.550> be<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.950> you're<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.070> going

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
three this would be the you're not going

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.970 
three this would be the you're not going
to<00:02:47.310> get<00:02:47.400> through<00:02:47.610> defense<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:49.320> plays<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
to get through defense it plays on the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.790 
to get through defense it plays on the
idea<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.510> biters<00:02:51.510> will<00:02:51.750> actually<00:02:52.230> take<00:02:52.740> a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
idea that biters will actually take a

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.070 
idea that biters will actually take a
direct<00:02:53.220> route<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.850> anything<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.840> if<00:02:54.930> you've

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
direct route to anything so if you've

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.180 
direct route to anything so if you've
got<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> polluting<00:02:55.710> source<00:02:55.950> back<00:02:56.220> here<00:02:56.520> say<00:02:57.480> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
got a polluting source back here say a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.070 
got a polluting source back here say a
stay<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> steam<00:02:59.910> engine<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.690> works<00:03:00.870> well

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
stay a steam engine that that works well

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.690 
stay a steam engine that that works well
okay<00:03:01.590> they're<00:03:01.800> going<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.980> gun<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.370> steam

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
okay they're going to gun for that steam

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.490 
okay they're going to gun for that steam
engine<00:03:03.000> every<00:03:03.210> single<00:03:03.480> time<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:04.110> say

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
engine every single time and and say

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
engine every single time and and say
this<00:03:04.680> connected<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.400> over<00:03:05.610> here<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.150> that's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
this connected to over here and that's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.450 
this connected to over here and that's
connected<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.990> another<00:03:07.200> wall<00:03:07.440> you'll<00:03:08.040> notice

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
connected to another wall you'll notice

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.700 
connected to another wall you'll notice
that<00:03:08.550> I'm<00:03:08.760> about<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.270> far<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:09.690> fast<00:03:10.110> as<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.350> biter

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
that I'm about as far as fast as a biter

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.490 
that I'm about as far as fast as a biter
and<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.490> takes<00:03:11.730> P<00:03:11.970> quite<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> while<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:13.350> get

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
and it takes P quite a while to get

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.070 
and it takes P quite a while to get
through<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:14.010> express<00:03:14.640> bells<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.870> this

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
through the express bells so this this

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.530 
through the express bells so this this
kind<00:03:16.320> of<00:03:16.410> defense<00:03:16.770> very<00:03:17.220> expensive<00:03:17.820> but<00:03:18.510> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
kind of defense very expensive but I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.490 
kind of defense very expensive but I
reckon<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.560> would<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.740> very<00:03:19.950> very<00:03:20.910> effective

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
reckon it would be very very effective

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.410 
reckon it would be very very effective
so<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.950> say<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.610> kind<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.880> thing<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.270> could

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
so this say the kind of thing you could

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.660 
so this say the kind of thing you could
beef<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:25.050> long<00:03:25.320> way<00:03:25.530> okay<00:03:26.160> you'll<00:03:26.340> notice

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
beef up a long way okay you'll notice

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.640 
beef up a long way okay you'll notice
that<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:26.880> can<00:03:27.210> place<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.480> lot<00:03:28.020> of<00:03:28.140> laser<00:03:28.320> sights

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
that I can place a lot of laser sights

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.650 
that I can place a lot of laser sights
here<00:03:28.920> all<00:03:29.610> off<00:03:30.060> one<00:03:30.300> power<00:03:30.570> pole<00:03:32.270> okay<00:03:33.270> I<00:03:33.420> can

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
here all off one power pole okay I can

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.260 
here all off one power pole okay I can
place<00:03:33.840> more<00:03:34.140> here<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:35.400> wall<00:03:35.640> this<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.090> and

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
place more here I can wall this in and

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.750 
place more here I can wall this in and
what<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.380> would<00:03:37.440> want<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.710> do<00:03:37.890> is<00:03:38.040> I'm<00:03:38.190> working

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
what you would want to do is I'm working

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.060 
what you would want to do is I'm working

on the memory here from a designer saw

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.990 
on the memory here from a designer saw
on<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.520> forums<00:03:43.250> what<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.370> would<00:03:44.550> want<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.880> do

is tweak this desire to make sure that
it<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.460> working<00:03:47.940> okay<00:03:48.900> you'd<00:03:49.530> place<00:03:49.800> one<00:03:50.070> of

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
it is working okay you'd place one of

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.790 
it is working okay you'd place one of
these<00:03:50.310> every<00:03:50.850> little<00:03:51.240> bit<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.810> when<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
these every little bit so that when the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.380 
these every little bit so that when the
bite<00:03:52.980> has<00:03:53.010> come<00:03:53.310> along<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.580> attack<00:03:54.000> they<00:03:54.210> don't

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
bite has come along to attack they don't

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.150 
bite has come along to attack they don't
go<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.750> wall<00:03:54.960> they<00:03:55.320> go<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.710> gap<00:03:55.920> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
go to the wall they go to the gap and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.950 
go to the wall they go to the gap and
then<00:03:56.250> try<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.490> get<00:03:56.640> through<00:03:56.880> here<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:57.420> then

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
then try and get through here and then

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.690 
then try and get through here and then
they<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.290> die<00:03:58.530> because<00:03:58.830> they<00:03:59.220> can't<00:03:59.490> move

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
they just die because they can't move

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.270 
they just die because they can't move
quick<00:03:59.970> enough<00:04:00.210> to<00:04:00.240> get<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.870> before<00:04:01.280> all

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
quick enough to get to it before all

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.000 
quick enough to get to it before all
your<00:04:02.610> lasers<00:04:02.940> blow<00:04:03.150> them<00:04:03.300> up<00:04:03.390> now<00:04:04.350> again<00:04:04.710> you

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
your lasers blow them up now again you

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.810 
your lasers blow them up now again you
can<00:04:05.040> add<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.550> extra<00:04:05.990> extra<00:04:06.990> idea<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:08.250> figures

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
can add in extra extra idea of figures

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.500 
can add in extra extra idea of figures
here<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.500> just<00:04:10.500> throw<00:04:10.709> in<00:04:10.860> extra<00:04:11.100> walls<00:04:11.510> pretty

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
here so just throw in extra walls pretty

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.470 
here so just throw in extra walls pretty
straightforward<00:04:13.670> making<00:04:14.670> sure<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.090> there's

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
straightforward making sure that there's

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.449 
straightforward making sure that there's
no<00:04:15.690> easy<00:04:15.720> way<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.799> getting<00:04:17.100> at<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.280> laser

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
no easy way of getting at the laser

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.460 
no easy way of getting at the laser
turrets<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.060> whatever<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.290> you're

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
turrets and whatever it is that you're

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.440 
turrets and whatever it is that you're
defending<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:20.220> actually<00:04:20.489> open<00:04:20.790> there<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.330> a

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
defending is actually open there is a

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.620 
defending is actually open there is a
line<00:04:21.690> straight<00:04:22.080> up<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.880> express<00:04:24.300> belts

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
line straight up the the express belts

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.540 
line straight up the the express belts
now<00:04:25.260> this<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.710> probably<00:04:25.919> won't<00:04:26.160> work<00:04:26.340> with

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
now this this probably won't work with

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.379 
now this this probably won't work with
anything<00:04:26.729> but

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
anything but

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.300 
anything but
wrist<00:04:27.539> belts<00:04:27.810> because<00:04:27.930> biters<00:04:28.560> are<00:04:28.830> about<00:04:29.159> as

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
wrist belts because biters are about as

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.800 
wrist belts because biters are about as
fast<00:04:29.520> as<00:04:29.819> I<00:04:29.969> am<00:04:29.999> right<00:04:30.419> now

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
fast as I am right now

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.350 
fast as I am right now
so<00:04:31.379> if<00:04:31.710> this<00:04:31.919> was<00:04:32.159> just<00:04:32.189> the<00:04:32.520> red<00:04:32.729> belts<00:04:33.120> they

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
so if this was just the red belts they

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.390 
so if this was just the red belts they
would<00:04:33.539> get<00:04:33.689> up<00:04:33.930> there<00:04:34.289> pretty<00:04:34.740> quickly<00:04:35.159> and

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
would get up there pretty quickly and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.409 
would get up there pretty quickly and
you<00:04:35.460> might<00:04:35.669> not<00:04:35.849> have<00:04:35.939> enough<00:04:36.060> time<00:04:36.360> to

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
you might not have enough time to

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.080 
you might not have enough time to
destroy<00:04:37.379> them<00:04:37.669> so<00:04:38.669> there<00:04:38.849> we<00:04:38.939> go

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
destroy them so there we go

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.179 
destroy them so there we go
a<00:04:39.270> couple<00:04:39.539> of<00:04:39.599> ideas<00:04:39.749> about<00:04:40.020> defense<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.949> the

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:41.189 
a couple of ideas about defense of the

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.779 
a couple of ideas about defense of the
mark<00:04:41.430> 1<00:04:41.699> 2<00:04:42.270> &amp;<00:04:42.599> 3

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
mark 1 2 &amp; 3

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.760 
mark 1 2 &amp; 3
happy<00:04:44.789> play<00:04:45.110> hopefully<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.259> will<00:04:46.319> help<00:04:46.529> you

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
happy play hopefully that will help you

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.580 
happy play hopefully that will help you
fend<00:04:47.520> off<00:04:47.669> those<00:04:47.849> natives<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:49.110> can<00:04:49.229> see<00:04:49.409> that

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
fend off those natives you can see that

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.279 
fend off those natives you can see that
this<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:50.009> my<00:04:50.279> idea<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:50.819> defense

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
this is my idea of defense

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.869 
this is my idea of defense
there's<00:04:52.650> also<00:04:52.889> another<00:04:53.430> idea<00:04:54.330> of<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:56.340> laser

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
there's also another idea of the laser

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.209 
there's also another idea of the laser
torrent<00:04:57.330> wall<00:04:57.479> which<00:04:58.409> looks<00:04:58.889> something<00:04:59.099> like

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
torrent wall which looks something like

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.230 
torrent wall which looks something like
this<00:05:00.259> this<00:05:01.259> is<00:05:01.439> a<00:05:01.469> pretty<00:05:01.800> hardcore<00:05:02.460> defensive

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
this this is a pretty hardcore defensive

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.219 
this this is a pretty hardcore defensive
idea<00:05:05.330> there's<00:05:06.330> nothing<00:05:06.719> going<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:06.900> be<00:05:07.020> getting

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
idea there's nothing going to be getting

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.890 
idea there's nothing going to be getting
through<00:05:07.379> this<00:05:07.620> kind<00:05:07.860> of<00:05:07.979> thing<00:05:08.300> go<00:05:09.300> so<00:05:09.539> like<00:05:09.870> a

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
through this kind of thing go so like a

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.379 
through this kind of thing go so like a
full<00:05:10.199> wall<00:05:10.469> of<00:05:10.500> these<00:05:11.009> is<00:05:11.340> just<00:05:11.669> that's

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
full wall of these is just that's

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.929 
full wall of these is just that's
ridiculous

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:13.939 
ridiculous

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.450 
ridiculous
very<00:05:14.939> heavy<00:05:15.210> on<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.449> resources<00:05:15.930> but

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
very heavy on the resources but

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.559 
very heavy on the resources but
absolutely<00:05:17.460> impregnable<00:05:17.729> I<00:05:18.150> would<00:05:18.419> say

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
absolutely impregnable I would say

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.189 
absolutely impregnable I would say
because<00:05:19.529> every<00:05:20.039> every<00:05:20.370> biter<00:05:20.849> that<00:05:21.449> comes<00:05:21.990> and

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
because every every biter that comes and

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.019 
because every every biter that comes and
visits<00:05:22.379> will<00:05:22.740> be<00:05:22.770> engaged<00:05:23.550> by<00:05:24.139> you<00:05:25.139> know

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:26.029 
visits will be engaged by you know

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.989 
visits will be engaged by you know
seventy<00:05:27.029> to<00:05:27.509> a<00:05:27.539> hundred<00:05:27.629> times<00:05:28.849> okay<00:05:29.849> I'll

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:29.999 
seventy to a hundred times okay I'll

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.420 
seventy to a hundred times okay I'll
just<00:05:30.150> placed<00:05:30.449> a<00:05:30.599> whole<00:05:30.810> bunch<00:05:31.050> there<00:05:31.430> that's

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
just placed a whole bunch there that's

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.300 
just placed a whole bunch there that's
that<00:05:33.360> that's<00:05:33.689> probably<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.139> mark<00:05:34.379> for<00:05:34.680> only

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
that that's probably the mark for only

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.309 
that that's probably the mark for only
for<00:05:35.550> you<00:05:35.819> know<00:05:35.939> the<00:05:36.089> late<00:05:36.270> sake<00:05:36.629> games<00:05:36.960> where

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
for you know the late sake games where

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.619 
for you know the late sake games where
you<00:05:38.129> know<00:05:38.250> you'll<00:05:38.430> pass<00:05:38.610> this<00:05:38.909> kind<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.270> idea

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
you know you'll pass this kind of idea

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.409 
you know you'll pass this kind of idea
you<00:05:40.219> you've<00:05:41.219> got<00:05:41.430> so<00:05:41.639> many<00:05:41.789> resources<00:05:42.360> you

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
you you've got so many resources you

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.230 
you you've got so many resources you
just<00:05:42.629> need<00:05:42.779> to<00:05:42.899> spend<00:05:43.020> them<00:05:43.259> and<00:05:43.639> dad<00:05:44.639> you<00:05:45.149> know

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
just need to spend them and dad you know

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.300 
just need to spend them and dad you know
why<00:05:45.750> not<00:05:45.960> laser<00:05:46.259> ball<00:05:46.469> so<00:05:47.039> there<00:05:47.159> you<00:05:47.219> go

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
why not laser ball so there you go

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.010 
why not laser ball so there you go
couple<00:05:47.699> ideas<00:05:47.879> about<00:05:48.270> defense<00:05:48.719> a<00:05:48.930> couple

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
couple ideas about defense a couple

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.320 
couple ideas about defense a couple
things<00:05:49.409> you<00:05:49.560> can<00:05:49.680> do<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:50.129> helpfully<00:05:50.699> hopefully

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
things you can do to helpfully hopefully

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.369 
things you can do to helpfully hopefully
get<00:05:51.449> you<00:05:51.539> through<00:05:51.689> the<00:05:51.839> game<00:05:51.990> get<00:05:52.199> you<00:05:52.259> to
