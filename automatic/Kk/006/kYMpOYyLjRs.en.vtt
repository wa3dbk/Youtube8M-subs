 8th 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.019
 Percent fly in life is about talents I have these for example 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.070
 talent 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.669
 Penny Stock the Spanish PrÃ¶ll 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.130

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.310
 Ping Pong 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 Table tennis at the glory spit 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.590
 that is my talent and since I have degree guests 2 absurdly blatant types 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.539
 those who are electrifying electrify themselves the idea 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.760
 who give full throttle to Dr 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.610
 We talked about the future and the question is where Kate lives her life 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.320
 hung 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.590
 and if you like that question too 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.539
 ask if you ask yourself these questions where is my life going then that is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.870
 Tamer talent absolutely important you ask yourself something 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.890
 Issum my talent 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.870
 sometimes dare yes on every way answers poured a flagstone from the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.549
 above 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.500
 also Bernd BuÃŸmann doctoral student that the right one swells and her flagranti 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.990
 the glasses rip Mitchell off her face 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.549
 to prove that he's on it what you should do not believe us 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.299
 Rather, it was also as fragile as it was to use there it is too 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.370
 important if you do not have a specialist gux what god already has in your talents 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.880
 Put life into it 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.110
 possible that at the radio message in Cannes maybe you are 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.230
 they constantly Pratt the Nissan comes to track world champion and you could 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.590
 an old woman's life because she just won 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.689
 are attacked by bandits and are so struck and runoff 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.950
 directly to the temple and it falls over 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.310
 skro and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.329
 when my brother takes off again 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.560
 Maybe it is now 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 not the most obvious APA would be possible 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.530
 if you want to know where your life is going then look at his 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.710
 Talents 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.340
 what does God already have 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.460
 put into your life 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.740
 Sometimes it is also blatant that God wants you to use every point 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.789
 what I'm talking about when it says in the bible 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.369
 that in these reports we already prepare works for him 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.320
 Did he get that good we can run the Bible 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.699
 and sometimes it is easier 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.809
 it's hard to just pay attention to the gifts 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.020
 Or it is unnecessary because 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.020
 "God with you, you do things you can not do 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.799
 and then, for example, it's important if you have your passions and coke 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.769
 What are the things that make you passionate when you are the one you have to 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.129
 maybe not too good 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.090
 is passionate about the job market 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.569
 It also starts to bring the positive momentum to life for itself 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.889
 can also be a sign that 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.559
 God wants your life to lead this direction and sometimes is Schwegler 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.100
 It's much easier to discover features 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.559
 to discover 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.919
 not just what I'm worried little 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.459
 where do I get angry that shows the passion too if you always have the rainbow 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.790
 she is, for example, in texts she is giving what is not 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.259
 do not stop 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.279
 because she is a passion in that 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.909
 then that covers in polish what are you pulsing here it annoys that there 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.199
 which is misspelled then you have a passion for 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.929
 so if you put on your gifts you will immediately recognize where 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.310
 your life strong 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.639
 and if you are too 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.389
 your passions in the text then you will recognize where your life is heading 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.349
 I wish you ORF will not only make a lot of friends in your life your goals too 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.230
 see also there to the way there 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.230
 as a contained link to see that is pure adventure 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.029
