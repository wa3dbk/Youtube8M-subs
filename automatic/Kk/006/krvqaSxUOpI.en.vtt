00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello everyone today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.379
 microcinema is going to be very simple to 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.110
 spring and summer these routines for 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.320
 oily skin because it's what I have I'm going to 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.320
 start 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.150
 it has served me well to control the 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.290
 fat and I feel that helped me apply 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.290
 my mineral base 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.600
 now I'm going to use my favorite corrector 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.640
 which is the basis of my website using the 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.910
 base as a proofreader because it's very 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.890
 opaque and covers everything with the theme I return to 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.440
 Cover all granites and areas 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.420
 that are red or dark to cover 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 well the place I'm going to stamp the product 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.040
 in the areas that I want to cover 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.550
 for my circles under my eyes I am using the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.550
 corrector of festines formula in uruguay 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.560
 that has a very light consistency to 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.989
 I do not like correctors very 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.760
 thick because they feel very clear and 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.000
 especially when he's doing a lot 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.460
 heat then I always use a correct 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.500
 some consistency to light and only 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.950
 I use a video to blur with very very 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.950
 easy 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.979
 Now I'm going to start applying my base 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.869
 mineral and I will do as in the 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.439
 commercial floor 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.509
 in pasco as I did in English the most 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.520
 that diffuses the base the more it goes to 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.729
 see natural the base that I'm using 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.740
 know how to have less evil that is perfect if 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.500
 you have oily skin like me but if 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.360
 think that the dry or normal uses the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.200
 normal version because it will look very 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.600
 rare for the skin 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.640
 I know it took me years to illuminate this 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.770
 base but I love that it looks like this 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.759
 natural and then I keep blurring 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.070
 until he is happy now to 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.259
 blush I will use this blush of push - ups 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.080
 with help is also from the new collection 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.020
 I already know that it looks very intense but the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.600
 it was truly a super natural look and me 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.700
 I loved all this rumor also the same 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.009
 as the base I will blur very very 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.069
 well the color so that it is natural and not 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.759
 there is no line very marked because the 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.069
 Very obvious blush is not something very nice 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.580
 to say that only you can see well 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.400
 a clown or something like that but it fades 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.000
 it is very well the flush sara the natural in 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.000
 your cheeks 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.110
 for illuminator I'm going to use this theme that 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.410
 is the ice mineral in phoenix and again 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.290
 I'm going to define very very well so that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.540
 my cheeks look very obvious and I already 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.510
 I think comfortable as an addict for 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.290
 illuminate but I love to blur 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.290
 good things 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.850
 and that was all for this easy routine 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.680
 and naturally I hope you liked this
