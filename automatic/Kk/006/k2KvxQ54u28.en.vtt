his back legs still work a bit but yeah
so<00:01:13.130> up<00:01:14.130> until<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.670> he's<00:01:15.390> been<00:01:15.420> doing<00:01:16.380> okay<00:01:16.740> but

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so up until now he's been doing okay but

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.810 
so up until now he's been doing okay but
he's<00:01:17.880> lost<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.360> lot<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.570> weight<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:20.009> just

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
he's lost a lot of weight and I just

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
he's lost a lot of weight and I just
don't<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.390> he's<00:01:21.600> enjoying<00:01:22.080> life

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
don't think that he's enjoying life

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.740 
don't think that he's enjoying life
anymore<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.700> I've<00:01:24.479> come<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:26.540> certain<00:01:27.540> point

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
anymore so I've come to a certain point

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.450 
anymore so I've come to a certain point
where<00:01:27.869> I've<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.350> decided<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.250> would<00:01:29.430> be

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
where I've just decided that it would be

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.609 
where I've just decided that it would be
best<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.329> put<00:01:30.810> him<00:01:30.960> down<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:34.170> really

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
best if I put him down and it's really

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.969 
best if I put him down and it's really
really<00:01:34.740> hard<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.670> me<00:01:35.850> because<00:01:36.799> he<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.829> very

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
really hard for me because he is very

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.249 
really hard for me because he is very
special<00:01:38.729> I've<00:01:38.850> had<00:01:39.150> other<00:01:39.420> hedgehogs<00:01:40.020> and
