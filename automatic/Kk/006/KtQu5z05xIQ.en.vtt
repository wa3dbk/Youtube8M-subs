00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.340
 The actor was on January 21, 2009 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:16.419
 The bright news of Tomohito Nishijima valid 1001 paid 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:18.609
 50 people here 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.750
 Yes, in regards to President Obama's appointment 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.919
 It is the birth of an African president 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.199
 a) A historic sound is coming to a moment 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.990
 Former Senator Barack Obama, 47 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.460
 Yes 20 o'clock noon American time 21 o'clock noon Japan time 2 am 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.180
 next 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.180
 Yes I took office as president 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.370
 It is President Toyokawa in the inauguration speech 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.790
 What is required 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.090
 Just like it's a new era of responsibility 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.160
 For regeneration of British and American cats 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.070
 I asked for the root cooperation of each and every one of the Americans 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.200
 It is to say 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.880
 Core 3 days are in financial crisis 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.980
 I feel that I was in a crisis worldwide due to the impact Japan 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.600
 It looks interesting but 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 The situation of Britain and the United States 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390
 I'm done 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.720
 So what does the role of the leader mean? 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.460
 When 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.040
 In such a situation, everyone hopes and we will do our best in the brain 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.530
 It seems like it sounds like 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.730
 Whether you can have an elen tongue 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.690
 Whether you can talk or not 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.820
 I thought that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.840
 In that respect, President Obama is amazing 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.990
 I think there is a lot of history up to the whole as a whole rice 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.520
 I did not say that I was nervous but 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.120
 President of the Air Pretend 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.520
 Until now from racial and racial 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.930
 Those people who were driven to a very tough place 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.090
 Count as representative of their country 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.950
 Advertising is said to be a great place for coordinators 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.050
 I think so 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.289
 Japan itself is also in a situation that has been imitated 0 Oita 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.269
 Lol I am really good at speaking and everyone can make sense in the same hope 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.569
 I think from the two hearts that the person who is 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.069
 It is 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.510
 It is continued and offer- 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.510

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.229
 Why do people in December 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.909
 Does Mickey get out of reality if there are no people in it? 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.509
 To that 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.489
 Should I respond to my return 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.839
 By the way but to my friend 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.789
 Mr. Kagawa and his eyes 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:48.029
 Someone is familiar with the awesome ones 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.139
 I've been listening to it since then 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.639

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.469

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.449

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.280
 Carrier 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.099
 It is to say 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.389
 At first my conclusion 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.259
 Yasutaka Chikuma Mickey Mouse and Mickey Mouse 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.199
 Agarest

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.049
 Kondo Akira 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.909
 On the other hand, in the magical land 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.249
 Correction means that you should not bring in problems 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:24.459

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.429
 I feel like you are at eta 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.340
 Even if it is very important to show a photo, it is also a complete cure 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.549
 Photograph which postpones the last purchase 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.659
 There is nothing else ahead 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.849
 It was done to be patient and introduced as a patient 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.849
 Let's do it 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.419
 Same b group 4 people 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.759

 Let's say we went to pv 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:03.739

 Do you think senior? 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.539

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.649
 It is with it 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.139
 The doctor against the key and in-house once it is almost not 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.139
 It means that from this point of view 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.840
 It is such a thing 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.049
 For those who are cherished, everything is not clear 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:21.379

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.819
 So take care of this picture of course of her second day 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.490
 My memories with her are also important 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.380
 In that 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.410
 For people based on rice with Mickey Mouse et al. 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.090
 Because there is an important existence 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.040
 Today's decision is not to think about anything extra 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.720
 You've been there 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.490
