00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
in the last episode we gave this track a

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.909

sort<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.540> Western<00:00:09.990> classical<00:00:10.259> feel<00:00:10.740> by

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:10.919 
sort of a Western classical feel by

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.879 
sort of a Western classical feel by
putting<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.309> strings<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:11.789> samba<00:00:12.209> and<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:13.200> know

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
putting a strings on samba and I know

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.409 
putting a strings on samba and I know
when<00:00:14.129> I<00:00:14.160> was<00:00:14.339> when<00:00:14.579> I<00:00:14.610> put<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.089> really

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419 
when I was when I put it I just really

liked<00:00:15.629> the<00:00:15.780> feel<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> thought<00:00:16.710> that

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
liked the feel of it so I thought that

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.430 
liked the feel of it so I thought that
let's<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.280> stay<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.850> same<00:00:18.330> mood<00:00:18.630> so

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
what we did was in Logic Pro X they have

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
what we did was in Logic Pro X they have
these<00:00:21.810> samples<00:00:22.710> actually<00:00:23.370> I'm<00:00:23.460> sorry<00:00:23.610> not

found them in Logic Pro X remember
nothing<00:00:41.700> outside<00:00:42.090> all<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> Logic<00:00:43.590> Pro<00:00:43.620> X

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
nothing outside all this is Logic Pro X

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.500 
nothing outside all this is Logic Pro X
remember<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.610> told<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.880> this<00:00:44.970> software<00:00:45.329> was

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
remember I told you this software was

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
remember I told you this software was
fantastic<00:00:46.079> well<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.560> is<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
fantastic well this is one of the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.389 
fantastic well this is one of the
reasons<00:00:47.220> why<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.610> why<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:47.940> fantastic

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
reasons why is it why it's fantastic

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
so we found a violet and again I didn't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.470 
so we found a violet and again I didn't
have<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.160> work<00:00:53.310> on<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.610> chords<00:00:53.970> because<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.300> had

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
have to work on my chords because I had

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
have to work on my chords because I had
already<00:00:54.630> worked<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.110> my<00:00:55.290> chord<00:00:55.559> progression

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
already worked on my chord progression

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.220 
already worked on my chord progression
when<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> did<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:56.820> pluck<00:00:57.059> sound<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.510> mean<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
when I did the pluck sound I mean the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
when I did the pluck sound I mean the
cord<00:00:58.470> plug<00:00:58.710> sound<00:00:58.950> so<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.730> took<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.420> cord<00:01:00.719> plug

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
cord plug sound so I took that cord plug

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590 
cord plug sound so I took that cord plug
sound<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.680> progression<00:01:02.430> put<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
sound the progression put it with the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.299 
sound the progression put it with the
strings<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.019> some<00:01:04.199> blur<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> did

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
strings on some blur and then what I did

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
strings on some blur and then what I did
was<00:01:05.460> took<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.360> same<00:01:06.659> progression<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
was took the same progression and put it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.440 
was took the same progression and put it
down<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.310> instrument<00:01:08.850> section<00:01:08.970> where<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
down in the instrument section where I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.080 
down in the instrument section where I
put<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.870> violence<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.040> when<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> put<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
put the violence so when I put the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.719 
put the violence so when I put the
violence<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.620> did<00:01:13.890> with<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
violence this is what I did with it the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
violence this is what I did with it the
chord<00:01:14.970> progression<00:01:15.420> was<00:01:15.570> sounding<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.650> like

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
chord progression was sounding just like

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.460 
chord progression was sounding just like
this<00:01:17.100> let's<00:01:17.580> listen<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> strings<00:01:21.320> cornet

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.920 

without<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> compression

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.580 

so<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.680> same<00:01:33.100> cord<00:01:33.520> same<00:01:34.270> progression<00:01:34.590> just

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
so the same cord same progression just

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.440 
so the same cord same progression just
copied<00:01:35.980> it<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.280> pasted<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.180> in<00:01:37.330> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
copied it and pasted it in the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.970 
copied it and pasted it in the
instrument<00:01:37.930> track<00:01:38.110> where<00:01:38.440> I<00:01:38.470> had<00:01:38.710> put<00:01:38.890> the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
instrument track where I had put the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.740 
instrument track where I had put the
violence<00:01:39.370> but<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.150> didn't<00:01:40.390> want<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.600> violence

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
violence but I didn't want the violence

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.680 
violence but I didn't want the violence
to<00:01:41.020> play<00:01:41.290> in<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.500> same<00:01:41.680> way<00:01:41.920> like<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.690> you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
to play in the same way like the you

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.360 
to play in the same way like the you
know<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.930> strings<00:01:44.710> were<00:01:44.860> playing<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:45.130> wanted

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
know the strings were playing I wanted

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.770 
know the strings were playing I wanted
something<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.670> little<00:01:45.880> bit<00:01:46.000> different<00:01:46.330> so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
something a little bit different so

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.780 
something a little bit different so
again<00:01:47.110> all<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.380> did<00:01:47.650> was<00:01:47.830> opened<00:01:48.250> up<00:01:48.340> my<00:01:48.520> piano

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
again all I did was opened up my piano

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.270 
again all I did was opened up my piano
roll<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.240> just<00:01:49.840> sliced<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.650> cut<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.950> sounds

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
roll and just sliced and cut the sounds

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.510 
roll and just sliced and cut the sounds
and<00:01:51.340> made<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:52.090> rhythm<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:52.720> so<00:01:53.590> if<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.220> listen

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
and made a rhythm to it so if we listen

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.110 
and made a rhythm to it so if we listen
to<00:01:54.550> it<00:01:54.670> now

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
to it now

once again like I told you that the VST

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.170 
once again like I told you that the VST
are<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.920> violin<00:05:04.250> was<00:05:04.370> really<00:05:04.730> good<00:05:04.940> when<00:05:05.090> I

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
are the violin was really good when I

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.550 
are the violin was really good when I
actually<00:05:05.420> opened<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.110> placed<00:05:06.350> it<00:05:06.500> over

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
actually opened it and placed it over

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.500 
actually opened it and placed it over
there<00:05:06.800> but<00:05:07.220> a<00:05:07.340> little<00:05:07.610> bit<00:05:07.760> of<00:05:07.790> processing<00:05:08.390> is

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
there but a little bit of processing is

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.230 
there but a little bit of processing is
always<00:05:09.050> necessary<00:05:09.590> once<00:05:10.310> again<00:05:10.610> I<00:05:10.730> told<00:05:10.790> you<00:05:11.090> I

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
always necessary once again I told you I

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.090 
always necessary once again I told you I
have<00:05:11.510> used<00:05:11.810> one<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:11.990> my<00:05:12.110> favorite<00:05:12.590> things<00:05:12.830> the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
have used one of my favorite things the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.350 
have used one of my favorite things the
compressor<00:05:13.490> yep

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
compressor yep

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.300 
compressor yep
I<00:05:14.390> always<00:05:14.750> feel<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.290> compressor<00:05:15.800> just<00:05:16.010> brings

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
I always feel the compressor just brings

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.340 
I always feel the compressor just brings
the<00:05:16.460> sound<00:05:16.730> out<00:05:16.940> there<00:05:17.270> so<00:05:17.780> I've<00:05:17.990> put<00:05:18.230> on<00:05:18.260> a

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
the sound out there so I've put on a

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.580 
the sound out there so I've put on a
compressor<00:05:18.920> in<00:05:19.520> my<00:05:19.820> violin<00:05:20.240> section<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:20.840> of

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
compressor in my violin section and of

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.160 
compressor in my violin section and of
course<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.190> EQ<00:05:22.550> once<00:05:23.300> again<00:05:23.600> this<00:05:23.750> violence

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
course the EQ once again this violence

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.540 
course the EQ once again this violence
were<00:05:24.290> pretty<00:05:24.560> clean<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.040> I've<00:05:25.130> played<00:05:25.400> them

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
were pretty clean and I've played them

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.310 
were pretty clean and I've played them
in<00:05:25.640> a<00:05:25.700> slightly<00:05:25.850> higher<00:05:26.330> octave<00:05:26.930> that's<00:05:27.200> you

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
in a slightly higher octave that's you

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.220 
in a slightly higher octave that's you
know<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.520> c3<00:05:28.520> octave<00:05:28.850> and<00:05:29.000> above<00:05:29.270> so<00:05:29.450> I<00:05:29.990> didn't

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
know a c3 octave and above so I didn't

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.440 
know a c3 octave and above so I didn't
really<00:05:30.320> need<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:31.040> know<00:05:31.130> cut<00:05:32.030> off<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.270> lows

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
really need to you know cut off the lows

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.850 
really need to you know cut off the lows
because<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.050> lows<00:05:33.230> are<00:05:33.380> already<00:05:33.620> pretty<00:05:33.770> much

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
because the lows are already pretty much

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.170 
because the lows are already pretty much
cut<00:05:34.190> out<00:05:34.310> we<00:05:34.430> are<00:05:34.490> already<00:05:34.730> playing<00:05:34.970> in<00:05:35.090> the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
cut out we are already playing in the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.450 
cut out we are already playing in the
treble<00:05:35.510> cleft<00:05:35.720> of<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:35.960> keyboard<00:05:36.410> so<00:05:37.040> just

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
treble cleft of the keyboard so just

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.650 
treble cleft of the keyboard so just
increase<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.940> mids<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.210> little<00:05:38.390> bit<00:05:38.480> and<00:05:38.630> I

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
increase the mids a little bit and I

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.060 
increase the mids a little bit and I
wanted<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.080> valance<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.530> just<00:05:39.830> have<00:05:39.950> that

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
wanted the valance to just have that

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.870 
wanted the valance to just have that
crispness

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
crispness

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.090 
crispness
so<00:05:41.480> boost<00:05:42.140> it<00:05:42.290> up<00:05:42.350> the<00:05:42.470> highs<00:05:42.650> a<00:05:42.680> little<00:05:42.980> bit

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
so boost it up the highs a little bit

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.610 
so boost it up the highs a little bit
and<00:05:43.250> this<00:05:43.730> is<00:05:43.910> how<00:05:44.270> a<00:05:44.450> violin<00:05:44.930> sounds<00:05:45.470> after

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
and this is how a violin sounds after

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.180 
and this is how a violin sounds after
the<00:05:46.070> EQ<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.760> compression<00:05:47.530> sorry<00:05:48.530> one

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
the EQ and the compression sorry one

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.460 
the EQ and the compression sorry one
more<00:05:49.460> little<00:05:49.640> detail<00:05:49.730> I<00:05:50.240> put<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.870> little<00:05:51.110> bit<00:05:51.290> of

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
more little detail I put a little bit of

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.190 
more little detail I put a little bit of
a<00:05:51.590> delay<00:05:51.980> a<00:05:52.160> simple<00:05:52.910> stereo<00:05:53.210> delay<00:05:53.390> from<00:05:53.780> Logic

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
a delay a simple stereo delay from Logic

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.490 
a delay a simple stereo delay from Logic
Pro<00:05:54.230> X<00:05:54.530> itself<00:05:55.070> onto<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.850> violin<00:05:56.210> so<00:05:56.810> now<00:05:57.440> we

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
Pro X itself onto the violin so now we

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.270 
Pro X itself onto the violin so now we
have<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:58.190> delay<00:05:58.930> for<00:05:59.930> EQ<00:06:00.410> and<00:06:00.650> the

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
have the delay for EQ and the

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.670 
have the delay for EQ and the
compression<00:06:01.610> together<00:06:02.030> and<00:06:02.270> this<00:06:02.780> is<00:06:03.020> how<00:06:03.470> a

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
compression together and this is how a

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.220 
compression together and this is how a
violin<00:06:04.130> sounds<00:06:07.690> can<00:06:08.690> you<00:06:08.720> listen<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.140> the

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
violin sounds can you listen to the

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.110 
violin sounds can you listen to the
delay<00:06:09.500> over<00:06:09.710> there<00:06:09.890> let's<00:06:10.460> say<00:06:10.610> I<00:06:10.640> just<00:06:10.850> wish<00:06:11.000> a

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
delay over there let's say I just wish a

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.970 
delay over there let's say I just wish a
switch<00:06:11.450> off<00:06:11.630> the<00:06:11.780> delay<00:06:14.440> it's<00:06:15.440> just<00:06:15.740> you<00:06:15.860> know

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
switch off the delay it's just you know

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.450 
switch off the delay it's just you know
definite<00:06:16.910> and<00:06:17.090> plain<00:06:17.900> just<00:06:18.710> one<00:06:19.010> simple

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
definite and plain just one simple

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.250 
definite and plain just one simple
effect<00:06:19.790> on<00:06:19.940> it<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.330> delay<00:06:20.600> can<00:06:20.990> actually

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
effect on it the delay can actually

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.380 
effect on it the delay can actually
change<00:06:21.530> the<00:06:21.710> sound<00:06:21.980> listen<00:06:22.640> to<00:06:22.760> it<00:06:22.820> again<00:06:22.940> now

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
change the sound listen to it again now

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.800 
change the sound listen to it again now
with<00:06:23.630> the<00:06:23.750> delay<00:06:24.910> without<00:06:25.910> delay<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:28.810> with

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
with the delay without delay and with

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.630 
with the delay without delay and with
the<00:06:29.930> delay<00:06:30.170> you<00:06:30.800> can<00:06:30.980> just<00:06:31.160> feel<00:06:31.400> that<00:06:31.430> the

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
the delay you can just feel that the

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.220 
the delay you can just feel that the
whole<00:06:31.820> sound<00:06:32.180> changes<00:06:32.540> this<00:06:32.690> becomes<00:06:33.020> more

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
whole sound changes this becomes more

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.500 
whole sound changes this becomes more
wide<00:06:33.530> you<00:06:33.980> just<00:06:34.220> sort<00:06:34.400> of<00:06:34.430> you<00:06:34.550> know<00:06:34.580> pans<00:06:35.270> on

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
wide you just sort of you know pans on

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.000 
wide you just sort of you know pans on
your<00:06:35.630> left<00:06:35.810> and<00:06:35.990> right<00:06:36.050> audio<00:06:36.290> speaker<00:06:36.830> and

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
your left and right audio speaker and

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.350 
your left and right audio speaker and
just<00:06:37.340> imagine<00:06:37.610> if<00:06:37.700> it's<00:06:37.820> sounding<00:06:38.150> they're

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
just imagine if it's sounding they're

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.760 
just imagine if it's sounding they're
good<00:06:38.600> right<00:06:38.780> now<00:06:38.990> how<00:06:39.290> it's<00:06:39.500> gonna<00:06:39.590> be
