you're when you're trying to weld things

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.440 
you're when you're trying to weld things
that<00:03:07.800> are<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.100> are<00:03:08.160> pretty<00:03:08.820> small<00:03:09.150> in

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
since since learned that the ramble can

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.860 
since since learned that the ramble can
suck<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.490> heat<00:03:26.670> out<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.940> your<00:03:27.090> shoe<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.570> you
