00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello girls found 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 today for new video tips 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.670
 I was spoken to liner because the trait 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.460
 liner is always a hassle 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 general we always have a hyper eye 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.800
 pretty successful hyper there is really 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.260
 perfect and when we move to the other eye 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.330
 either we have a trek is too fine or we 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.039
 track is too thick either one to the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.390
 comma is not quite the same on 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.009
 to the comma that went down 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.140
 finally we've never managed to get 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.059
 completely symmetrical liner 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 completely identical so suddenly 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.190
 today I will give you a 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 little trick 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.600
 basically you're just going to need your 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.329
 line up classic your breath their 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.700
 favorites and a little bit of scotch 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.289
 so basically the secret he's going to have to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.300
 cut two small pieces of scotch 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 you will come and glue them then 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 the attention is important we will come 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 paste them at the outer corner 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.219
 until then that eyebrows in 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.280
 simply 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.159
 and here the secret is to stick them well 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.720
 in the same way at the same level 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.630
 bench whether it's really something 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.909
 of symmetric to succeed the coup accra 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.860
 it's exactly the same line of liner 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.020
 so let's go for the tutorial so we 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.600
 agrees technically challenged there with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.509
 the scotch ale eyeliner firstly 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.090
 comes to make up his eyes first and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.920
 we make up the complexion last since 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.720
 when we will remove the tape and go to it 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.700
 have a little bit of fountain deposits 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860
 powder that will stay stuck on 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 so to avoid that avoid the traces 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.090
 you first make your eyes and we 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.920
 will come to make time after so as 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.869
 usually your cast iron db created a 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 it does not matter just that we get to the level 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.280
 eyes we are very careful 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.020
 is going smoothly but no worries so there 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.509
 I take a little scotch 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 that I will first come and stick and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.159
 take off on my hand to avoid 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.350
 just that it sticks a little bit of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.750
 fashion trim my skin and then all 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.510
 I 'm just going 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.480
 yves caullet my scotch tip so in 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.780
 starting right here from the outer corner of 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.750
 the eye 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.190
 up to a thousand dowser so that's what 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.410
 it gives with the scot to ask 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.120
 now simply I'm going to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.209
 take back an eye liner this one simple 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.590
 in whom side any simple black with a 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.970
 little tip a little felt tip so 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.880
 for starters I will come to make a 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.260
 simple line come follow my line 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.510
 natural eyelashes 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.720
 so I will not position my and the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.530
 north like that but rather on the side and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.610
 quite simply 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.830
 so here I put it down and I'll come 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.580
 to make toddlers truce pursue 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.440
 mali you will join the comma 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:51.860
 after the tralala for now I 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:53.840
 just work the tiny line I 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.959
 do not forget the inner corner it's 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.280
 important so there for now like 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.670
 I told you I'm just going to trace the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.920
 line 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.690
 now we're going to come thicken a little 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.410
 little trait and especially will come to form 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.380
 the comma 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.700
 and that's where we usually go wrong or 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.769
 make small mistakes 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.080
 so there the Scotch is going well we 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.700
 help so I started by reminded 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.989
 yesterday a little bit from this 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.170
 place there so three quarters of 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.170
 the eye 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.349
 a long time and the Scotch actually goes 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.450
 help me to tell where it's what I 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.730
 have to stop me so I do not hesitate to 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.280
 Unbeknown to him, it's not important 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.709
 will not be once we will remove it and 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.100
 again when gp su gp show 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.810
 so well with my brush like that no 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.650
 all right if the lift tremblay I 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.300
 would not have a line 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.300
 I remember playing the lines actually 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.460
 and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.250
 after you can thicken it you can 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.200
 do a little bit more of a land 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.090
 little less were there I'm doing some 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.530
 something you can intermediate I 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.599
 it was done enough to make it feel good 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.479
 still at the level at the level of the 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.709
 camera 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.340
 so here I 'm just doing a few small 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.410
 retouching 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.030
 I will insist on the edge 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:28.479
 to have a very neat edge and a 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.990
 time I finished so that's what 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.540
 it gives 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.340
 now I can come and withdraw the 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.340
 Scotch so slowly 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.539
 and now georges check that 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.860
 I'm not going to make any minor edits 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:48.970
 but the agent trek is still good 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.710
 net was not irregular so the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.710
 Scotch really did me good and 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.970
 games just make a touchup 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.970
 just here 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.700
 and that's it and that's what gives it a 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.590
 once we put the mascara so you tone 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.180
 at a quay look that is a lot more 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.890
 intense which is much more open 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.140
 much more simply awaken 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.880
 so I hope that one of you has more 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.650
 that these little tricks will have you 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.940
 helped and then we waited for the next 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.110
 the two facts complaining to both faces 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.110
 I tell you very quickly
