controller<00:00:05.160> review<00:00:05.759> for<00:00:06.569> trackball

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
controller review for trackball

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.459 
controller review for trackball
controller<00:00:08.210> they<00:00:09.210> sent<00:00:09.450> me<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> free<00:00:09.960> trackball

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
controller they sent me a free trackball

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.999 
controller they sent me a free trackball
controller<00:00:11.120> now<00:00:12.120> there<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.629> as<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.860> can

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
controller now there it is as you can

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.740 
controller now there it is as you can
see<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.700> not<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:14.969> analog<00:00:15.299> stick<00:00:15.509> at<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
see this is not an analog stick at the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.200 
see this is not an analog stick at the
trackball<00:00:16.140> it<00:00:16.290> comes<00:00:16.470> straight<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:17.210> Jesus

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
trackball it comes straight at Jesus

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.590 
trackball it comes straight at Jesus
Christ<00:00:18.510> um<00:00:19.280> yeah<00:00:20.280> it's<00:00:21.150> really<00:00:21.360> great

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
Christ um yeah it's really great

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.350 
Christ um yeah it's really great
controller<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.200> I<00:00:23.190> can't<00:00:23.700> think<00:00:23.940> the<00:00:24.120> more

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
controller and I can't think the more

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.120 
controller and I can't think the more
for<00:00:24.660> giving<00:00:24.870> me<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.080> go<00:00:25.620> check<00:00:25.830> out<00:00:25.980> their

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
for giving me this go check out their

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.560 
for giving me this go check out their
channel<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.520> their<00:00:26.670> website<00:00:27.030> that<00:00:27.210> will<00:00:27.330> both

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
channel on their website that will both

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.230 
channel on their website that will both
be<00:00:27.870> in<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.200> description<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.460> go<00:00:29.820> check<00:00:30.030> them

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
be in the description so go check them

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.490 
be in the description so go check them
out<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.510> go<00:00:30.690> see<00:00:30.870> if<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.050> would<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.440> of

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
out and go see if you would like one of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
out and go see if you would like one of
their<00:00:31.680> controllers<00:00:32.189> buy<00:00:33.089> that<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.359> set<00:00:33.570> out

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
their controllers buy that to set out

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
their controllers buy that to set out
this<00:00:33.929> you<00:00:34.589> see<00:00:34.769> everything<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.489> came<00:00:35.670> with

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
this you see everything that came with

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.250 
this you see everything that came with
the<00:00:35.969> controller<00:00:36.359> you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.629> you<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the controller you know you have the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.590 
the controller you know you have the
controller<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> stuff<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.399> wired<00:00:38.730> because

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
controller and stuff it is wired because

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.110 
controller and stuff it is wired because
it<00:00:39.719> takes<00:00:39.899> more<00:00:40.170> power<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.710> run<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.280> got<00:00:42.089> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it takes more power to run it you got a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.029 
it takes more power to run it you got a
little<00:00:42.600> paper<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.620> calibration<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.980> how<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
little paper on calibration and how to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.739 
little paper on calibration and how to
fix<00:00:47.309> anything<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.030> may<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.149> wrong<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
fix anything that may be wrong on the

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.709 
fix anything that may be wrong on the
back<00:00:48.929> you<00:00:49.890> got<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.339> black<00:00:50.940> plastic<00:00:51.300> ball

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
back you got a little black plastic ball

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.290 
back you got a little black plastic ball
that<00:00:51.899> came<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.640> those<00:00:53.640> are<00:00:53.789> obviously

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that came with it those are obviously

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.899 
that came with it those are obviously
interchangeable<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.319> think<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.249> silver<00:00:56.670> one

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
interchangeable I think the silver one

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.599 
interchangeable I think the silver one
is<00:00:57.149> better<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.859> my<00:00:58.979> opinion<00:00:59.100> because

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
is better that's just my opinion because

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.630 
is better that's just my opinion because
I<00:00:59.640> think<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.409> less<00:01:01.409> sensitive<00:01:01.469> because<00:01:02.339> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
I think it is less sensitive because the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
I think it is less sensitive because the
trackball<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.539> buy<00:01:03.659> it<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.019> will<00:01:04.170> see

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
trackball if you buy it you will see

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
trackball if you buy it you will see
that<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.620> is<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:05.430> more<00:01:05.640> sensitive<00:01:05.940> than<00:01:06.210> an

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that it is way more sensitive than an

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.380 
that it is way more sensitive than an
actual<00:01:06.540> controller<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> I'm<00:01:08.610> starting<00:01:09.300> off

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
actual controller so I'm starting off

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.580 
actual controller so I'm starting off
with<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.630> review<00:01:09.960> besides<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> know

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
with this review besides you know

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.550 
with this review besides you know
showing<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.370> the<00:01:11.460> controller<00:01:11.850> also<00:01:12.690> some

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
showing you the controller also some

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890 
showing you the controller also some
pros<00:01:13.860> about<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.340> controller<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.750> me<00:01:15.870> I

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
pros about this controller is for me I

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.890 
pros about this controller is for me I
plan<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.320> 10<00:01:16.560> sensitivity<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:18.300> really<00:01:18.750> like

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
plan on 10 sensitivity and I really like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.900 
plan on 10 sensitivity and I really like
a<00:01:18.930> sensitive<00:01:19.410> controller<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> move<00:01:20.700> me

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
a sensitive controller that can move me

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.880 
a sensitive controller that can move me
fast<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.480> me<00:01:21.570> around<00:01:21.720> corners<00:01:22.230> and<00:01:22.260> stuff<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
fast get me around corners and stuff and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.880 
fast get me around corners and stuff and
this<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:24.060> helps<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.440> slides

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
this really helps you know it slides

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
this really helps you know it slides
around<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.340> completely<00:01:26.820> easily<00:01:27.600> movable

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
around it's completely easily movable

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.110 
around it's completely easily movable
and<00:01:28.110> stuff<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.430> comes<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:29.910> if

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
and stuff you know comes right out if

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.220 
and stuff you know comes right out if
you<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.390> change<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.690> out<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.080> don't

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
you want to change it out if you don't

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.150 
you want to change it out if you don't
like<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.620> you<00:01:34.740> plan<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:34.950> 10

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
like that one you know if you plan on 10

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.010 
like that one you know if you plan on 10
sensitivity<00:01:35.700> usually<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.570> definitely<00:01:36.900> want

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
sensitivity usually you definitely want

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.800 
sensitivity usually you definitely want
to<00:01:37.080> change<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.440> down<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> few<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.810> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to change that down a few because you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.290 
to change that down a few because you
know<00:01:39.900> once<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> use<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.860> you'll<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.610> huge

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
know once you use this you'll see a huge

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.150 
know once you use this you'll see a huge
difference<00:01:42.660> in<00:01:44.870> WoW<00:01:45.870> sensitivity<00:01:46.560> it'll<00:01:47.070> go

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
difference in WoW sensitivity it'll go

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.560 
difference in WoW sensitivity it'll go
way<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.340> it'll<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.150> like<00:01:48.270> thirty

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
way up it'll be like it's on like thirty

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
way up it'll be like it's on like thirty
so<00:01:48.960> definitely<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.800> change<00:01:50.010> that<00:01:50.160> down<00:01:50.280> I

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so definitely one change that down I

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.500 
so definitely one change that down I
ended<00:01:50.580> up<00:01:50.640> having<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.000> change<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.300> down<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
ended up having to change it down to

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.690 
ended up having to change it down to
like<00:01:51.630> seven<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.140> eight<00:01:52.260> but<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.250> let<00:01:53.460> me<00:01:53.520> take

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
like seven or eight but I'm let me take

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.070 
like seven or eight but I'm let me take
that<00:01:53.910> out<00:01:54.120> and<00:01:54.360> when<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.720> comes<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.990> the

that out and when it comes to the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.530 
that out and when it comes to the
calibration<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.310> see<00:01:56.520> oh<00:01:56.700> gosh<00:01:56.970> these<00:01:57.240> girls

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
there the calibration here is the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.400 
there the calibration here is the
calibration<00:02:03.390> button<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:04.050> don't<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.260> if<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
calibration button I don't know if you

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.080 
calibration button I don't know if you
can<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.860> too<00:02:05.010> well<00:02:05.220> but<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:05.910> right

does help with your aim but only if you

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.920 
does help with your aim but only if you
like<00:03:19.889> high<00:03:20.040> sensitivity<00:03:20.549> if<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.599> prefer<00:03:21.900> a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
like high sensitivity if you prefer a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.809 
like high sensitivity if you prefer a
low<00:03:22.109> sensitivity<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.739> suggest<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.430> not<00:03:23.579> use

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
low sensitivity I suggest you do not use

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.629 
low sensitivity I suggest you do not use
this<00:03:24.650> unless<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.799> can<00:03:26.010> adjust<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.609> mean

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
I love high sensitivity after I got used

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.000 
I love high sensitivity after I got used
to<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.250> 30<00:03:29.549> sensitivity<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:31.019> says<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:31.889> have

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
to the 30 sensitivity I says I have

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.619 
to the 30 sensitivity I says I have
great<00:03:32.220> scores<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.760> started<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.150> really<00:03:33.329> enjoy

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
this and I just couldn't go back to an

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.819 
this and I just couldn't go back to an
analogue<00:03:35.909> stick<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.329> was<00:03:36.449> impossible<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.560> um

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
analogue stick it was impossible so um

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.159 
analogue stick it was impossible so um
I'm<00:03:38.340> really<00:03:38.549> glad<00:03:38.669> they<00:03:38.909> sent<00:03:39.030> me<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.269> really

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
I'm really glad they sent me this really

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.469 
I'm really glad they sent me this really
changed<00:03:40.620> my<00:03:40.769> thought<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.190> gaming<00:03:41.579> how<00:03:42.299> that

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
changed my thought of gaming how that

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.180 
changed my thought of gaming how that
you<00:03:42.540> could<00:03:42.659> actually<00:03:42.780> even<00:03:43.019> do<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.409> like<00:03:44.040> I

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
you could actually even do this like I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.469 
you could actually even do this like I
wish<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.459> guys<00:03:44.579> could<00:03:44.849> see<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.090> inside<00:03:45.449> of

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
wish you guys could see the inside of

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.259 
wish you guys could see the inside of
this<00:03:45.750> where<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.530> trackball<00:03:46.889> goes<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:48.180> can

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
this where the trackball goes you can

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.520 
this where the trackball goes you can
kind<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.629> see<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> little<00:03:49.049> bit<00:03:49.199> you<00:03:49.290> may<00:03:49.379> get

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
kind of see it a little bit you may get

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.289 
kind of see it a little bit you may get
the<00:03:49.620> little<00:03:49.799> motion<00:03:50.220> sensors<00:03:50.549> I<00:03:50.760> think<00:03:51.030> maybe

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
the little motion sensors I think maybe

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.899 
the little motion sensors I think maybe
on<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.049> side<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.560> then<00:03:53.370> there's<00:03:53.639> a<00:03:53.699> little

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
on the side and then there's a little

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.059 
on the side and then there's a little
light<00:03:54.060> down<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.389> there<00:03:54.479> that<00:03:54.540> lights<00:03:54.720> up<00:03:54.870> red

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
light down and there that lights up red

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.159 
light down and there that lights up red
on<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.310> occasion<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.389> think<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.959> liked<00:03:58.079> up

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
on the occasion so I think it liked up

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.180 
on the occasion so I think it liked up
when<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.379> thought<00:03:59.069> maybe<00:03:59.280> not<00:03:59.659> anyway<00:04:01.129> it's<00:04:02.129> uh

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
when I thought maybe not anyway it's uh

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.800 
when I thought maybe not anyway it's uh
it's<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.639> really<00:04:02.940> great<00:04:03.120> control<00:04:03.389> I<00:04:03.449> have<00:04:03.659> to

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
it's a really great control I have to

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.830 
it's a really great control I have to
