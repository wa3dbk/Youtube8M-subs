00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 the elected everyone knows jinks 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.660
 new video so it will not be on iis 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.090
 kraft will not be sure that the clan gauge this 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.130
 will be solo to the creatives of here 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.590
 I flat it is it is to make you a 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 tutorial on command and low unpayable in 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.939
 pet classic action ie that's them 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.279
 loudly and not surprisingly 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.680
 the 50 fps and that this computer this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.510
 I'm offered movies I can go 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 It's weird so I'm not going to 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.369
 complain again on the old one at the weekend 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.690
 next I will normally receive 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.820
 all the pieces to mount my 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.050
 new pc that is worth about 800 euros 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.530
 all of which, with very little to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.160
 5 euros premium at 795 I think so here 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.570
 I hope this tutorial is going to you 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.879
 the secular and will please 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.320
 precisely that you will like it and that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.000
 it's going to help you perfect looted 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 so jean will start right away 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 so already for prod and that this is the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.719
 based 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.149
 finished in full that everything for not getting 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.180
 stutter stuttering so do you after the jo 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.280
 will do several steps so in a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.270
 classical basis or to return some 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.430
 thing is called the Uzbek boat ix 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 the error the moghreb 01 floundering poses here 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.720
 put me in I throw an arrow I 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.820
 then falls I putting on 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.020
 mouth 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:27.689
 slash a game takes arrows 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:32.040
 to learn low araud arrow here are some 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.869
 hero mods here if that would be nice 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.070
 not me at home but I hope like that 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.860
 that's up and that makes us apart is in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.119
 below we do not see complicated to do 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.250
 so that's how people get 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 find or in the tooth your bases I 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.600
 then go on to avoid it we'll do 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.979
 a little diet 0 we will make a checkerboard 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.350
 this is actually a break 2 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.520
 going to ask a block is like that the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.020
 boat can not be put in the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.439
 blogs as know it does to a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.399
 half-length that after gone 06 imposes 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.759
 here as it is on spouses 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.110
 fall 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.840
 this is buggering me here so we 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.220
 can not go in here that I try 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.800
 to kill by chris klein 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.380
 so that's already where the roof down 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.820
 checkered roof like that for not doing this 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.370
 fair use boat of you and it's very 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.650
 simple it works even in multiplayer 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.020
 then there was the little spencer 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.580
 so the blue line sÃ©galen clear but 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.920
 seen that I'm a creative and solo and 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.510
 Well, there's no blogging that's the most 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.640
 of a faction or office live clegg 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.430
 so here's a clip that's sixteen of 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.790
 width so ben alaya 16 and 16 2 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.670
 lengths so a square like that it takes 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.160
 especially not put his opsi on bullets 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.520
 I insist wilderness here that you me 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.500
 please but here you go here and there if 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.060
 it's directly for example 23 fak 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.130
 it shows you that you are passing your 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.380
 claims territory should not be asked 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.010
 the psy directly but a block of gap 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.540
 so as I did here here here I am 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.440
 did not do so if you look good 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.450
 up or this gpo and that's exactly 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.580
 the same 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.989
 there you are, otherwise we can do 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.739
 something called the Uzbek ix 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.320
 dee spencer 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.880
 so you see if there is obsidian 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.370
 normally the base low if the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.989
 closures - can not get in there there is 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.910
 objects from in the trunk you think 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.340
 that it is viable but you put 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:33.190
 do they try to think and you do like 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.720
 that's not the voice the loppsi that the tnt 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.610
 to pass that destroys the chest so 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.190
 minecraft normally she does not want 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.360
 minecraft do not want this bug exists 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.299
 but it exists so you see well 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.200
 it's destroyed afterwards to counter it 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.420
 so it's going a little of everything destroy 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.730
 good the voacher cia you shift from a 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.640
 block like that you're here quiet 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.230
 you have your chests etc 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.000
 and if someone tries to him that goal 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.120
 like that it's going to be impossible actually 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.180
 because there was oblivion two years ago 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.799
 barely there is water the loppsi that is 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.570
 well posed or having hours outside 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.489
 this is not the second step 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.459
 already then to protect himself from the 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.010
 third step so that's the record 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.299
 joke and that breeders lose 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.930
 a lot of Thursday that's where the most 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.669
 used I think 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.780
 Here you will see that in tac bella 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.560
 no longer needs 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.930
 you will see how we do so 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.479
 it's not a tutorial to learn iceberg 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.780
 beyond it is especially for 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.520
 protect you will see hop there george 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.379
 and a cover for not dying jimmy 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.259
 that a thin helmet and parra and hop 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:39.860
 I discovered permanent and there I 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.479
 am in the database so that's if blackcurrant 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.970
 I do this green med 1 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.379
 ducasse and I'm fine get through 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.770
 so that's it, it's bug news mdeur 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.370
 pernes 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.139
 it's really easy so then there 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.060
 to counter it will have to put your only 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.759
 on the sides of course you put 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.930
 the oxi like that hop here he inside 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.580
 will not have to let the life blocks of my 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.080
 masters of the land of stone and 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.039
 steria doorman the block would only want 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.330
 it's a lot less easy 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.389
 it's possible but it's much less 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.460
 easy to youth bugs ok but you eat 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.500
 and a plush and to the body I'm going 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.430
 try to play here and you see I 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.250
 stay stuck so here we go 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.750
 blocked that already is another one 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.060
 step that we managed 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.360
 so here it is from below to 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.060
 the so-clever iceberg digs under with 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.940
 hues and a return so that's it 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.130
 1 SlashGear butt then I done 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.090
 to have when we make chests 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.690
 attributable in classical 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.830
 finally on classic minecraft what so 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.729
 are not the offers of creeper etc 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.860
 generally it worked so there the 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.199
 chests are poorly protected because if there is a 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.569
 server bug the look if it is 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.259
 considered low no loppsi and that 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.729
 will get through 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.169
 so it's really very rare but that's it 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.719
 it's stuck to the ground it's not very good 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.460
 then quoted stuck to the wall like that no 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:59.569
 more is not very good there so we can 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.919
 put like this and it pleaded even 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:06.650
 German so then the c1 cov well 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.300
 protected so I make you have 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.860
 I like it here it is for the decoration the 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.139
 so here is tight falls in the same 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.909
 cages he climbs a little higher up 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.729
 finally you put your only voice the 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.889
 normal not leave you a water hose 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.270
 of free you put your chest and 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.969
 see you put here for example there is 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.969
 gestures that would change nothing 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.750
 so that's it and it's not sticking 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.910
 neither on the ground nor the best behind years nor 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.050
 in front of or on the sides so that's fine 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.510
 then 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.310
 so we will go straight down to 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.580
 dallas table of the video it is the base 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.460
 that there is for me a looting ricv 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.950
 gable so with the checkerboard here we can 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.620
 not going in already josÃ© already made see 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.890
 then here which wants to dig below 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.020
 small maritime 12 bays gelder father 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.150
 here I put several layers 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.130
 so here are two layers of opci and the 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.180
 layer of decoration it will be impossible 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:10.780
 at the sight that these claims and the chests 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.910
 so unpayable here as I like to see 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.010
 the hand on it 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.230
 it stays in August on is a behind a 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.480
 on the sides finally two here and one down 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.480
 and that's it and then I'll have you 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.160
 what you need if you are here 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.020
 present in this square that sailboats under 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.400
 the ming map a party dropped slam in 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.800
 the savanna heart solo here 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.780
 Well, you like the area here 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.730
 it's on that same if you 're there on 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.270
 this neighborhood will bow here and not 16 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:39.640
 like that so here you have it 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.320
 to delimit the claim so that for me 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.120
 it would be the TV the territory and 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.650
 I like me loppsi not on the first 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.419
 block so here it would be a territory 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.210
 but I leave it free and I put 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:50.350
 directly after so I certify you 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.400
 what do you know I 've already done 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.730
 several times on multiple servers 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.290
 it's a market so two months 

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.460
 we do if you want or not 

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.520
 just to help her parents for 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.780
 you after weissberg and so it's not 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.250
 thank you all for watching the video
