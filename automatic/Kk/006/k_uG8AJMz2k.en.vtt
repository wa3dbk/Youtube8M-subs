 that is, they are different models of cats from 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.790

 3 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.909
 but you left over if for these for example 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.369
 usa is half 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.850

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.570
 look at the gaps me because it is a product 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.270
 that will be very much 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:14.280
 they are very attractive to this is another 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:19.590
 different form would seem a rule of 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.590
 that there are many pains 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.270
 and sometimes also it has this look form 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.450
 to the face 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.450
