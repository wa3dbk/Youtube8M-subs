00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.480
 Now you want a little bit of her 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.749
 as many customers know 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:31.179
 This is simply claimed show and then there is Prime 7 in total 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.360
 which you can touch as you want 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.480
 it would have to be here 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.620
 takes led budgeted 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.620
 where there should be around here must be free 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.410
 by historical he chirped time for Haiti 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.639
 SMS to the not 

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:50.639
 what has gotten so now by scrolling 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.630
 The widgets are sometimes very interesting, they just go in 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.100
 So at HTC with now 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.570
 Eat in it 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.960
 I can now rauswählen here, for example, Mark 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.220
 news 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.659
 and you can choose a layout okay 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.659
 but for example at 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.010
 So 1 of course I can choose different layouts and then I can do that here 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.300
 Scrolling lets you choose which numbers you like best 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.590
 then I could be in the top right now 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 around just today 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.960
 With that I could once again make the deeds cover up current city 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.240
 that bands of which there is data 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.030
 or even from the seas 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.400
 Data from the mobile network 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.870

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.299
 more interesting number the more he plays calendar too really 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.960

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 shows under the next dates 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.660
 if both are the looks compact 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.589

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.969
 I would also like to show it's just here in the contacts 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.359
 and can become equal with her 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.459

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.449

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.569
 on Facebook just wrote 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.329
 The loan should look for more updates 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.259
 and around Naples travels a profile 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.809
 they test that way 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.349
 that, for example, me now 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.689

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.139
 a second one to the updates and events so far 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.339

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.339
 Title the last the box state 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.559

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.959
 of the respective user 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.469
 The Facebook Dogs are working relatively well so you can either 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.769
 start here conditionally not far global contacts indicated the granny 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.989

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:45.209
 To connect Bene and also pull through the contact ban to add 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.019

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.639
 now make the two birthdays in five days without making the sixth one 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.329
 also very convenient 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.729
 Incidentally, this is so-called scenes you can save just synonymous only when 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:04.999
 new store 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.069
 to still cheer 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.659
 to get to the heart of it often brings with it more hate 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.849
 be used by his office 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.529
 how do you get then 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:20.079

 have their own profile 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.080

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.659

 HTC you have already 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.669
 Preliminary work has done already 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.409
 various scenes are already playing in the summer to play games 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.069
 On, the screen will be short points 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.850

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.840
