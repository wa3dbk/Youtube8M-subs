00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello to everyone so this time it's the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.309
 galaxy ace 6 and the iphone 6 with your 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.080
 servant quentin for android track 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.269
 point fr we'll talk a little bit about 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.190
 design because you know that the v6 he 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.470
 pleasant been decried a drawing a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 as soon as it is announced for its resemblance 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.830
 with the iphone 6 so from the front it's not 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.300
 obviously obvious even if it's good 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.029
 rectangular is a smartphone we are going 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.070
 say but two sides the fred singing frame 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.900
 us if it is a little different but 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.539
 volume buttons are same place them 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.170
 angles are frankly the same it's 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.030
 looks a lot like 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.230
 we will not blame you either 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.710
 you bluntly confuse the two 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.360
 smartphones 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.180
 when we look on the part 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.190
 lower 1 finally that's it that's basically 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 the shape of the usb jack and who 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.399
 will change in the years to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 come on I think on android and the top 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.120
 speaker who changes on the other side good 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 it's clearly it's clearly the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.320
 same one to the location for the map 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 sim and the power button that are not 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.079
 exactly in the same place but good in 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.280
 water on the other hand it changes a little bit 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.140
 for the a6 we have the infrared port 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.239
 the home buttons are different 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.400
 but still remains that the 6 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.530
 is one of the only android to have a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.510
 physical button in terms of systems 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.710
 good suddenly we will not expand and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.930
 normally in this video I you 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.760
 invite to take a look at on the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.530
 compare to the writings you have links in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.850
 the video is a little more complete on 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.710
 is always on big differences 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 fundamental even though less than before 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.350
 with 5.0.2 lollipop the overlay 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.200
 touchwiz for the ciss and ios 8 on 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.850
 the iphone 6 so well we will not say that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.610
 feels but at the design level we are 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.530
 we are on flat design we are sure on 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.820
 new apple notifications 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.430
 which also looks pretty android 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.180
 good here is no controversy do not waste 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.979
 in the comments 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.299
 I do not want to venture into this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.740
 subject we will say that it is enough 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.790
 different but the features 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.259
 offered are basically the same 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.820
 note that fingerprint scanners 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.500
 digital are both very very 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.280
 good not like the five had one that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.619
 was really 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.610
 better than the iphone 6 at the level of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.119
 the screen against big fat 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.310
 differences 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.080
 we felt it a good screen that's it 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.159
 clear the galaxy sii that he bury it 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.619
 still not bad at least on the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.340
 paper we have a slab of 5.1 inches with 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.319
 the double of pixels of the ass hd it is 2560 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.700
 among four hundred and forty-four 4.7 inches 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.370
 for iphone 6334 by 750 pixels 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.940
 only 326 pixels per inch on is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.040
 far from the 560 almost 600 of the galaxy to 6 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.690
 could see at the back construction in green 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.540
 so for the ciss construction in 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.250
 aluminum for the iphone 6 at the level of 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.989
 ergonomics me I think to prefer 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.120
 iphone ci hangs more in hand that 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.530
 hold well without being adrar the iphone 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.019
 if it's a bit slippery it's 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.160
 subjective I know the microsd pad for 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.290
 both that's a novelty for 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.300
 read here 6 but there never 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.100
 had on the iphone 6 removable battery pack 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.860
 it's the same at the device level 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.400
 photo we have 16 megapixels with ayo us 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.950
 for the 6 and 8 megapixels for the iphone 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.920
 6 the front camera five media 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.140
 that seals for the galaxy ace 6 and 1,2 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.970
 for the iphone 6 good it's on the paper 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.680
 in fact we will really wait 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.040
 to be able to test them in depth 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.930
 face but globally the galaxy without 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.700
 maybe allow a little bit of 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.350
 on it's face and it's very light but it 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.970
 is really really good bass 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.470
 brightness including here tell us what 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.840
 that you want to know more in the 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.010
 comprehensive tests that we will have in 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.090
 compare to possible gaps we can 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.890
 update tell us all that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.570
 you think about these two smartphones so 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.700
 you think samsung outperform 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.700
 the iphone 6 or not hi to all
