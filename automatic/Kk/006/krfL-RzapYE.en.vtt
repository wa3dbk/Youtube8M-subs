00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 though very personal 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.420
 Anyone can speak to any honoree 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.510

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.790

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.010

 daily supervision 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530
 saddened 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.670
 the tasty food 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.460
 Fisherman prepared 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.250
 Â«Frighteningly muchÂ» 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.030
 because there nicely laid out 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.030
 to enjoy the eyes wipe 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.090

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.120
 to do everything right 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.780
 Do not be afraid to speak against one or the other and say something 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.450
 you like 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.260
 a Berliner said in the studio 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.729
 I have her very well 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.979
 and the hiking trip through the German ring 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.269
 the best 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.169
 often leave 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.809
 the food is not pleaded in the dining room 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.959
 but in the middle of the street 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.729
 and when in danger 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.859
 Sit on the grass, too 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.069
 which we do not give offense 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.249
 that does not look like it's been burned by the sun 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.259
 Hut directly 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.469
 Pulses off 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.469
 the hotel to 600 million 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.989
 each of them gets on the beach 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.109
 without a car 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.199
 So you have to be America 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.199
 and if they are the few steps 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.189
 then they are driven back and forth with the stack every hour 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.839
 the direct 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.879
 dynamic and x7 is always responsive 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.509
 pay attention 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.409
 That's all you need 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.409
 that the qualities of their journey 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.159
 which disturbs them 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:20.959
 and always from him 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.449
 Ethylene available 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.529
 in the big basin 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.529
 and so the area for the kids is guaranteed 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.479
 the table tennis table 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.529
 alb-donau-kreis which task 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.029
 which part of the dining room 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.479
 for that BP pays 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.999
 and again the direct one 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.799
 while eating and being on 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.899
 they see it has to taste we surprised 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.649
 He held this on the plate 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:05.649
 So the puppet show has to be 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.479
 it is enough there 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.179
 and they can sit down over 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.489
 nothing is required 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.539
 everything it wants 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.959
 they should publicize 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.959
 so she would not know anything 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.430
 the kitchen is over 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.430
 do you have the feeling 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.289
 you can order here 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.740
 in Munich 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.210
 here in this hotel 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.300
 a pleasant stay
