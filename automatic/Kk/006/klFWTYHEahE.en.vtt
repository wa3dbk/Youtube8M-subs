00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
damage of rookie meaning that if you if

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340

you're<00:00:44.430> using<00:00:44.670> stopping<00:00:45.180> power<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.170> hit

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
you're using stopping power and you hit

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.319 
you're using stopping power and you hit
the<00:00:46.500> full<00:00:46.770> burst<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.430> three<00:00:47.760> bullets<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> your

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the full burst all three bullets of your

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.959 
the full burst all three bullets of your
three<00:00:48.870> bullet<00:00:49.260> burst<00:00:49.610> you<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:50.760> kill

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
three bullet burst you will kill

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.010 
three bullet burst you will kill
somebody<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.600> any<00:00:51.899> range<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:53.129> burst<00:00:54.020> if

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
somebody at any range in one burst if

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.510 
somebody at any range in one burst if
your<00:00:55.199> close<00:00:55.379> range<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> only<00:00:55.949> takes<00:00:56.280> two

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
your close range it only takes two

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
your close range it only takes two
bullets<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:58.020> shouldn't<00:00:58.289> ever<00:00:58.590> be

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
bullets so you really shouldn't ever be

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740 
bullets so you really shouldn't ever be
getting<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.309> than<00:00:59.550> one<00:01:00.059> hit<00:01:00.270> marker<00:01:00.600> with

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
getting more than one hit marker with

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.990 
getting more than one hit marker with
this<00:01:00.960> gun<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:02.190> you're<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.430> long<00:01:02.609> range<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this gun if you're really long range you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640 
this gun if you're really long range you
can<00:01:03.059> occasionally<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.719> two<00:01:03.899> hit<00:01:04.080> markers<00:01:04.409> but

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
can occasionally get two hit markers but

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.780 
can occasionally get two hit markers but
um<00:01:05.309> yeah<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.720> very<00:01:07.170> effective<00:01:07.470> gun<00:01:07.920> the

um yeah it's a very effective gun the
perks<00:01:09.030> I'm<00:01:09.240> using<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:10.170> sleight<00:01:10.650> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
perks I'm using on this are sleight of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
perks I'm using on this are sleight of
hand<00:01:10.979> um<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.939> would<00:01:12.119> recommend<00:01:12.780> sleight<00:01:13.049> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
hand um I would recommend sleight of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380

hand<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.530> gun<00:01:13.710> always<00:01:14.189> since<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
hand on this gun always since it's a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
hand on this gun always since it's a
three<00:01:15.630> verse<00:01:15.810> gun<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.290> tend<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> waste<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
three verse gun you tend not to waste a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.590 
three verse gun you tend not to waste a
whole<00:01:17.400> lot<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.700> ammo<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:19.520> yeah<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> can

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
whole lot of ammo and yeah so you can

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.859 
whole lot of ammo and yeah so you can
aim<00:01:21.869> quickly<00:01:22.290> reload<00:01:22.799> quickly<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.869> very

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
aim quickly reload quickly it's very

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
aim quickly reload quickly it's very
effective<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:26.100> secondary<00:01:26.580> as

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
effective like that just secondary as

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 
effective like that just secondary as
you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.210> see<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> pp-2000<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> red<00:01:29.040> dot

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you can see is the pp-2000 the red dot

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.500 
you can see is the pp-2000 the red dot
since<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> gun<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> semi-automatic

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
since this gun is semi-automatic

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.930 
since this gun is semi-automatic
it's<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.500> little<00:01:32.800> lacking<00:01:33.310> in<00:01:33.430> close<00:01:33.700> range

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
it's a little lacking in close range

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.290 
it's a little lacking in close range
combat<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:35.500> would<00:01:35.740> recommend<00:01:35.980> you<00:01:36.430> put<00:01:37.120> on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
combat so I would recommend you put on

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.690 
combat so I would recommend you put on
something<00:01:37.660> like<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.900> pp-2000<00:01:38.830> since<00:01:39.430> it's<00:01:39.580> a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
something like the pp-2000 since it's a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.930 
something like the pp-2000 since it's a
very<00:01:40.120> good<00:01:40.530> close-range<00:01:41.530> weapon<00:01:41.940> automatic

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
very good close-range weapon automatic

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.350 
very good close-range weapon automatic
five<00:01:43.150> powers<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:45.010> it's<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.490> good<00:01:45.940> weapon<00:01:46.120> to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
five powers and it's a good weapon to

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.180 
five powers and it's a good weapon to
use<00:01:46.510> if<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.900> happen<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.320> run<00:01:47.560> out<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.710> ammo

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
use if you happen to run out of ammo

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.030 
use if you happen to run out of ammo
with<00:01:48.640> your<00:01:48.850> FAMAS<00:01:49.560> well<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.650> doesn't<00:01:50.890> happen

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
with your FAMAS well it doesn't happen

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.400 
with your FAMAS well it doesn't happen
hold<00:01:51.430> on<00:01:51.580> but<00:01:52.300> if<00:01:52.660> you<00:01:52.840> get<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.080> really<00:01:53.230> high

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
hold on but if you get the really high

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.480 
hold on but if you get the really high
streaks<00:01:53.830> like<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.190> do<00:01:54.250> this<00:01:54.460> game<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.680> can<00:01:56.980> run

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
streaks like I do this game you can run

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.240 
streaks like I do this game you can run
out<00:01:57.580> of<00:01:57.640> ammo

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
out of ammo

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.850 
out of ammo
yeah<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.790> my<00:02:01.660> killstreaks<00:02:02.110> setup<00:02:02.560> this<00:02:02.650> game

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
yeah so my killstreaks setup this game

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.800 
yeah so my killstreaks setup this game
is<00:02:03.040> better<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.370> Harrier<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:04.150> chopper<00:02:04.630> gunner

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
is better a Harrier in chopper gunner

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.720 
is better a Harrier in chopper gunner
and<00:02:05.320> I'm<00:02:05.590> actually<00:02:05.800> playing<00:02:06.310> team<00:02:06.700> deathmatch

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
and I'm actually playing team deathmatch

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.300 
and I'm actually playing team deathmatch
which<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.780> something<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.680> don't<00:02:08.740> see<00:02:08.890> me<00:02:09.190> do

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
which is something you don't see me do

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.160 
which is something you don't see me do
too<00:02:09.520> often<00:02:09.940> I'm<00:02:10.149> not<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.420> big<00:02:10.600> fan<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:10.869> team

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
too often I'm not a big fan of team

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.830 
too often I'm not a big fan of team
deathmatch<00:02:11.940> I've<00:02:12.940> stayed<00:02:13.210> before<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.690> don't

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
deathmatch I've stayed before I don't

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.550 
deathmatch I've stayed before I don't
like<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.380> spawns<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.520> here<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.790> don't<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
like the spawns in here I don't like the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.860 
like the spawns in here I don't like the
kill<00:02:17.560> limit<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.040> don't<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:19.360> time<00:02:19.660> limit

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
kill limit I don't like that time limit

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.310 
kill limit I don't like that time limit
I<00:02:20.260> don't<00:02:20.770> know<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:22.150> I've<00:02:22.480> been<00:02:22.630> trying<00:02:23.170> out

this<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.459> pretty<00:02:48.850> fun<00:02:49.180> game<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.390> me<00:02:50.070> as<00:02:51.070> you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
this is a pretty fun game to me as you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.550 
this is a pretty fun game to me as you
can<00:02:51.370> see<00:02:51.580> I'm<00:02:51.670> using<00:02:51.850> my<00:02:51.970> ppq<00:02:52.540> thousand<00:02:53.050> as<00:02:53.500> a

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
can see I'm using my ppq thousand as a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.270 
can see I'm using my ppq thousand as a
primary<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.959> it's<00:02:56.280> definitely

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
primary and it's a it's definitely

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.990 
primary and it's a it's definitely
better<00:02:57.489> than<00:02:57.610> most<00:02:57.850> smg's<00:02:58.390> I'd<00:02:58.600> say<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.840> FAMAS

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
better than most smg's I'd say the FAMAS

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.970 
better than most smg's I'd say the FAMAS
since<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.150> has<00:03:04.330> such<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.720> high<00:03:04.900> power<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.800> can

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
since it has such a high power you can

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.430 
since it has such a high power you can
use<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.459> with<00:03:06.760> without<00:03:07.510> stopping<00:03:07.930> power<00:03:08.080> and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
use it with without stopping power and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.949 
use it with without stopping power and
works<00:03:08.830> fairly<00:03:09.040> well<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.209> good<00:03:10.390> cold-blood

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
works fairly well it's a good cold-blood

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.000 
works fairly well it's a good cold-blood
class<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.310> enemy<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.700> just<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.480> know

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
class if the enemy is just you know

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.589 
class if the enemy is just you know
you<00:03:14.909> can<00:03:15.090> pull<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.230> cold-blooded<00:03:16.680> FAMAS

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
you can pull out the cold-blooded FAMAS

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.750 
you can pull out the cold-blooded FAMAS
using<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.659> with<00:03:18.750> hard<00:03:18.959> lines<00:03:19.170> okay<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.760> like

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
using it with hard lines okay I like

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.490 
using it with hard lines okay I like
using<00:03:21.060> stopping<00:03:21.540> power<00:03:21.659> most<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.170> my<00:03:22.260> guns

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
using stopping power most of my guns

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.610 
using stopping power most of my guns
just<00:03:22.890> because<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.989> getting<00:03:25.379> that<00:03:25.560> a

just because I like getting that a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.390 
just because I like getting that a
advantage<00:03:27.439> we<00:03:28.439> don't<00:03:28.650> like<00:03:28.769> being<00:03:28.950> outgunned

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
advantage we don't like being outgunned

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.390 
advantage we don't like being outgunned

I killed chopper gunner here anyways
when<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.620> use<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.920> FAMAS<00:03:50.250> wastelands<00:03:50.940> one<00:03:51.060> of

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
when to use the FAMAS wastelands one of

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.869 
when to use the FAMAS wastelands one of
the<00:03:51.239> maps<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.569> like<00:03:51.690> using<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.019> FAMAS<00:03:52.879> because

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
the maps I like using the FAMAS because

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.059 
the maps I like using the FAMAS because
it's<00:03:54.060> large<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.810> has<00:03:54.930> open<00:03:55.349> areas<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.889> don't

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
it's large it has open areas you don't

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.740 
it's large it has open areas you don't
want<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.280> get<00:03:56.400> close<00:03:56.609> with<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.090> FAMAS<00:03:57.450> you're

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
want to get close with the FAMAS you're

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.460 
want to get close with the FAMAS you're
usually<00:03:58.409> going<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:59.010> lose<00:03:59.329> if<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.930> hit<00:04:01.260> them

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
usually going to lose if you hit them

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.470 
usually going to lose if you hit them
you<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.829> you<00:04:02.190> can<00:04:02.340> kill<00:04:02.579> them<00:04:02.760> close<00:04:03.180> range

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
you can you can kill them close range

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.520 
you can you can kill them close range
but<00:04:03.980> ATAR<00:04:04.980> or<00:04:05.340> an<00:04:05.670> aka<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.329> usually<00:04:07.230> going<00:04:07.409> to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
but ATAR or an aka is usually going to

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.879 
but ATAR or an aka is usually going to
be<00:04:07.620> better<00:04:08.010> at<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.519> close<00:04:08.970> range<00:04:09.500> Hamas<00:04:10.500> but

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
be better at a close range Hamas but

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.339 
be better at a close range Hamas but
it's<00:04:11.489> very<00:04:11.760> effective<00:04:12.060> long<00:04:12.450> range<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.930> saw

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
it's very effective long range you saw

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.289 
it's very effective long range you saw
me<00:04:13.500> take<00:04:13.680> out<00:04:13.889> some<00:04:14.159> snipers<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.940> cost<00:04:15.150> me<00:04:17.299> so

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
me take out some snipers it cost me so

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.909 
me take out some snipers it cost me so
it's<00:04:18.449> good<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.750> maps<00:04:19.049> like<00:04:20.660> wasteland<00:04:21.919> Afghan

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
it's good on maps like wasteland Afghan

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.279 
it's good on maps like wasteland Afghan
is<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.250> good<00:04:23.490> map<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.849> use<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.840> using<00:04:25.050> it

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
is a good map to use it I like using it

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.250 
is a good map to use it I like using it
sometimes<00:04:25.979> on<00:04:26.840> terminal<00:04:27.840> because<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.139> have

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
sometimes on terminal because you have

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
getting a lot of hit markers which is a

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.560 
getting a lot of hit markers which is a
fun<00:05:27.200> with<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.590> moss<00:05:28.240> that's<00:05:29.240> one<00:05:29.419> of<00:05:29.479> the

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
fun with the moss that's one of the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.719 
fun with the moss that's one of the
reasons<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:29.960> don't<00:05:30.020> use<00:05:30.350> it<00:05:30.470> too<00:05:30.620> often<00:05:30.830> as<00:05:31.400> I'm

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
reasons I don't use it too often as I'm

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.390 
reasons I don't use it too often as I'm
I'm<00:05:32.300> not<00:05:32.479> the<00:05:32.600> greatest<00:05:32.960> with<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.260> because<00:05:34.100> I

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
I'm not the greatest with it because I

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.420 
I'm not the greatest with it because I
don't<00:05:34.580> use<00:05:34.760> it<00:05:34.790> -<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.120> often<00:05:35.510> boat

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
don't use it - it often boat

don't use it - it often boat
not<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.520> greatest<00:05:37.639> with<00:05:37.940> it<00:05:38.060> so<00:05:38.180> I<00:05:38.210> get<00:05:38.419> a<00:05:38.450> lot

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
not the greatest with it so I get a lot

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.350 
not the greatest with it so I get a lot
of<00:05:38.690> hit<00:05:38.810> markers<00:05:39.169> when<00:05:39.800> using<00:05:40.190> it<00:05:40.280> but<00:05:40.460> if<00:05:41.060> you

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
of hit markers when using it but if you

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.650 
of hit markers when using it but if you
if<00:05:41.990> your<00:05:42.229> host<00:05:42.560> or<00:05:43.070> you're<00:05:43.430> really<00:05:43.910> really

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
if your host or you're really really

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.080 
if your host or you're really really
good<00:05:44.840> at<00:05:44.990> aiming<00:05:45.400> it's<00:05:46.400> definitely<00:05:46.940> a<00:05:46.970> good

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
good at aiming it's definitely a good

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.630 
good at aiming it's definitely a good
gun<00:05:47.330> to<00:05:47.510> use<00:05:47.750> you<00:05:48.470> see<00:05:48.740> it<00:05:48.860> a<00:05:48.950> lot<00:05:49.190> in<00:05:49.220> game

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
gun to use you see it a lot in game

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.159 
gun to use you see it a lot in game
battles<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.180> lot<00:05:50.330> of<00:05:50.390> people<00:05:50.570> use<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.840> FAMAS

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
battles a lot of people use the FAMAS

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.700 
battles a lot of people use the FAMAS
their<00:05:51.590> Slayers<00:05:52.810> defense<00:05:53.810> usually<00:05:54.380> it's<00:05:54.590> a

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
their Slayers defense usually it's a

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.779 
their Slayers defense usually it's a
good<00:05:54.860> defensive<00:05:55.280> weapon<00:05:55.640> but<00:05:57.490> yeah<00:05:58.490> I<00:05:58.669> think

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
good defensive weapon but yeah I think

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.960 
good defensive weapon but yeah I think
the<00:05:59.240> best<00:05:59.690> game<00:06:00.050> battles<00:06:00.380> guns<00:06:00.620> is<00:06:00.890> the<00:06:00.970> ACR
