00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

okay<00:00:00.719> on<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:00.960> one<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.530> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.829> actually

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
okay on this one we're going to actually

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.329 
okay on this one we're going to actually
talk<00:00:02.700> about<00:00:02.850> shadows<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.780> light<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.440> just

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
talk about shadows and light and just

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.950 
talk about shadows and light and just
the<00:00:05.460> basics<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.210> fundamentals<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.720> how

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the basics of the fundamentals of how

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.049 
the basics of the fundamentals of how
light<00:00:07.799> actually<00:00:08.160> works<00:00:08.370> how<00:00:08.519> bounces<00:00:08.940> off

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
light actually works how bounces off

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.150 
light actually works how bounces off
objects<00:00:09.570> some<00:00:09.780> reflected<00:00:10.469> light<00:00:10.620> reflected

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
objects some reflected light reflected

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.459 
objects some reflected light reflected
light<00:00:11.280> things<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.570> I'm<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.380> to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
light things like that so I'm going to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.110 
light things like that so I'm going to
draw<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:14.070> your<00:00:14.309> also<00:00:14.549> learn<00:00:14.790> how<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> draw<00:00:15.059> an

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
draw on your also learn how to draw an

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.120 
draw on your also learn how to draw an
asymmetric<00:00:15.690> box<00:00:15.870> at<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.109> same<00:00:16.289> time<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.920> it's

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
asymmetric box at the same time so it's

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970 
asymmetric box at the same time so it's
a<00:00:17.220> two<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.910> one<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.720> let's<00:00:19.590> start

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
a two for one on this one so let's start

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.550 
a two for one on this one so let's start
with<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.250> okay<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.560> reflected

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
with that okay so we have reflected

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:33.470 
with that okay so we have reflected
light<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.210> where

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
light and so we have here is where

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.850 
light and so we have here is where
the<00:00:33.540> starting<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> shadow<00:00:34.320> starts<00:00:34.680> so

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the starting of the shadow starts so

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.260 
the starting of the shadow starts so
it's<00:00:35.130> easy<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.030> assume<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.260> where

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
it's easy to assume that here is where

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
it's easy to assume that here is where
darkest<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> darkest<00:00:39.899> parts<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
darkest one of the darkest parts on the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.150 
darkest one of the darkest parts on the
box<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.649> would<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.920> from

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
box is going to be so it would go from

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.720 
box is going to be so it would go from
dark<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.120> Malta<00:00:46.110> more<00:00:46.289> light<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.460> such<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
dark to Malta more light not not such a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
dark to Malta more light not not such a
big<00:00:48.300> change<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.719> also<00:00:49.379> same<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:51.410> but

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
big change but also same with here but

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.779 
big change but also same with here but
when<00:00:52.559> drawing<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.660> box<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:55.920> shet

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
when drawing a box in you know shet

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.229 
when drawing a box in you know shet
shades<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:58.020> important<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> pick<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.239> side

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
shades it's important to pick out a side

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
shades it's important to pick out a side
that<00:01:00.420> will<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.719> darker<00:01:00.989> than<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> other<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
that will be darker than the other and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160 
that will be darker than the other and
since<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.340> part<00:01:02.670> looks<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.809> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
since this part looks like to be more of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
since this part looks like to be more of
in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.830> dark<00:01:05.070> area<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.700> would<00:01:06.000> make<00:01:06.180> this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
in the dark area what we would make this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.830 
in the dark area what we would make this
one<00:01:06.600> darker<00:01:07.290> than<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.560> side<00:01:08.420> as<00:01:09.420> far<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
one darker than this side as far as the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440 
one darker than this side as far as the
light<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.140> concerned<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> top<00:01:11.299> we<00:01:12.299> have

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
light is concerned on the top we have

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.780 
light is concerned on the top we have
light<00:01:13.229> coming<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> top<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.310> box<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
light coming on the top of the box and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.370 
light coming on the top of the box and
since<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.390> coming<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.689> behind<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.170> box

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
since it's coming from behind the box

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
since it's coming from behind the box
this<00:01:16.979> part<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.150> corner<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:19.250> might<00:01:20.250> even

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
this part of this corner here might even

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.190 
this part of this corner here might even
be<00:01:20.610> highlighted<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.750> easy<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
be highlighted so it's not easy to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
be highlighted so it's not easy to
assume<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
assume that this is going to be the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
assume that this is going to be the
brightest<00:01:30.420> part<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> box<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:32.430> going

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
brightest part in the box and it's going

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.749 
brightest part in the box and it's going
to<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.740> become<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.310> bright<00:01:35.579> but

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to kind of become not as bright but

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.179 
to kind of become not as bright but
still<00:01:36.030> bright<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:36.900> bright<00:01:37.590> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
still bright but just not as bright so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.710 
still bright but just not as bright so
if<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> brightness<00:01:41.180> from<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
if we have the brightness from here and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.260 
if we have the brightness from here and
we'll<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.110> kind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.700> dissipate<00:01:44.700> slightly

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
we'll just kind of dissipate slightly

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.539 
we'll just kind of dissipate slightly
just<00:01:45.990> ever<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.619> slightly<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.520> this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
just ever so slightly to this to this

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.620 
just ever so slightly to this to this
part<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:49.920> basically<00:01:50.130> how<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.820> share<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
part and that's basically how I share a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.410 
part and that's basically how I share a
shadow<00:01:51.960> box<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.439> work<00:01:52.729> but<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.149> remember

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
shadow box would work but just remember

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
shadow box would work but just remember
to<00:01:54.689> instead<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> drawing<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.130> solid

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to instead of drawing you know solid

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.530 
to instead of drawing you know solid
colors<00:01:57.860> or<00:01:58.860> solid<00:01:59.219> shades<00:01:59.490> that<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
colors or solid shades that you have to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.090 
colors or solid shades that you have to
keep<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.869> keep<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.259> mind<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.619> such<00:02:01.860> things

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
keep and keep in mind with such things

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.280 
keep and keep in mind with such things

light and you know other things that if

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.540 
light and you know other things that if
you<00:02:07.350> wanted<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.860> actually<00:02:08.069> shinier

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you wanted this to be actually shinier

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.499 
you wanted this to be actually shinier
than<00:02:08.580> actually<00:02:09.030> have

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
than actually have

than actually have
actions<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.019> these<00:02:10.280> okay<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.819> far<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
actions in these okay but as far as the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.809 
actions in these okay but as far as the
shadow<00:02:12.659> goes<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.739> ground<00:02:13.950> itself<00:02:14.310> there

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
shadow goes on the ground itself there

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.940 
shadow goes on the ground itself there
are<00:02:14.849> there<00:02:15.450> are<00:02:15.569> other<00:02:15.720> parts<00:02:16.079> that<00:02:16.290> are<00:02:16.590> going

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
are there are other parts that are going

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.710 
are there are other parts that are going
to<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.129> darker<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.610> lighter<00:02:17.849> around<00:02:18.659> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
to be darker and lighter around the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.920 
to be darker and lighter around the
shadow<00:02:18.959> if<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.590> actually<00:02:19.769> look<00:02:19.950> at<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> shadow

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
shadow if you actually look at a shadow

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.229 
shadow if you actually look at a shadow
it's<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.049> always<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.829> same<00:02:22.860> color<00:02:23.730> are<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
it's not always the same color are the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.960 
it's not always the same color are the
same<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.870> know<00:02:24.950> shade<00:02:25.950> all<00:02:26.159> throughout<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
same you know shade all throughout the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.750 
same you know shade all throughout the
darkest<00:02:27.360> parts<00:02:27.629> since<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.640> showing<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
darkest parts since all showing the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.369 
darkest parts since all showing the
least<00:02:29.940> amount<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.329> light<00:02:30.540> towards<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.290> is

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
least amount of light towards it is

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.399 
least amount of light towards it is
going<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> be<00:02:31.879> actually<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:32.909> bottom<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
going to be actually the bottom of the

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.649 
going to be actually the bottom of the
box<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.950> here<00:02:35.940> these<00:02:36.450> points<00:02:37.909> all<00:02:38.909> around<00:02:38.970> this

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
box so here these points all around this

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.899 
box so here these points all around this
part<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.109> box<00:02:40.290> or<00:02:40.950> are<00:02:41.340> actually<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
part of the box or are actually going to

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.770 
part of the box or are actually going to
be<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.209> darkest<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.920> from<00:02:44.579> there<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.120> kind

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
be the darkest so from there it's kind

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.050 
be the darkest so from there it's kind
of<00:02:45.900> less<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.819> shadow<00:02:49.370> becomes<00:02:50.370> brighter<00:02:50.879> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
of less of a shadow becomes brighter and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.180 
of less of a shadow becomes brighter and
brighter<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.540> brighter<00:02:51.659> but<00:02:52.349> still<00:02:52.650> within

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
brighter and brighter but still within

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.479 
brighter and brighter but still within
the<00:02:53.340> darkness<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:55.049> that's<00:02:55.620> your<00:02:55.920> basics<00:02:56.340> on

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
the darkness so that's your basics on

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.569 
the darkness so that's your basics on
how<00:02:56.519> light<00:02:57.329> works<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:58.680> shadows<00:02:59.069> work<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.519> a

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
how light works in shadows work on a

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.629 
how light works in shadows work on a
basic<00:03:00.389> square
