I<00:01:15.659> thought<00:01:15.899> that<00:01:16.229> grapes<00:01:16.710> were<00:01:17.310> gonna<00:01:17.670> be

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
I thought that grapes were gonna be

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
I thought that grapes were gonna be
really<00:01:18.149> pretty<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.600> easy<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> thread<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.470> here

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
really pretty and easy to thread on here

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.399 
really pretty and easy to thread on here
just<00:01:20.039> like<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.459> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.420> cut<00:01:21.690> my<00:01:21.990> bamboo

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
just like this and I cut my bamboo

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
just like this and I cut my bamboo
skewers<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.100> different<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.759> varying

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
skewers and different and varying

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
skewers and different and varying
lengths<00:01:24.569> just<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.289> you<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> difference<00:01:26.039> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
lengths just so you have a difference of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.649 
lengths just so you have a difference of
like<00:01:26.459> height<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:27.240> makes<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> more

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
like height just makes it more

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.570 
like height just makes it more
interesting<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.170> look<00:01:28.409> at<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.429> just

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
interesting to look at and I'm just

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.850 
interesting to look at and I'm just
going<00:01:29.789> to<00:01:29.850> thread<00:01:30.149> them<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.539> this<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.110> for

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
going to thread them like this and for

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
going to thread them like this and for
my<00:01:32.340> pineapple<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.179> thought<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.539> would<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
my pineapple I thought it would be a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.779 
my pineapple I thought it would be a
really<00:01:34.080> substantial<00:01:34.409> sturdy<00:01:35.310> fruit<00:01:35.640> that

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
really substantial sturdy fruit that

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.460 
really substantial sturdy fruit that
would<00:01:35.940> be<00:01:36.090> able<00:01:36.209> to<00:01:36.390> withstand<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:37.080> cutters

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
would be able to withstand my cutters

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.590 
would be able to withstand my cutters
and<00:01:37.679> I<00:01:37.740> got<00:01:37.920> varying<00:01:38.459> sizes<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.569> I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and I got varying sizes just so that I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.449 
and I got varying sizes just so that I
can<00:01:39.810> ensure<00:01:39.959> that<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.770> get<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.310> will

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
can ensure that I get one that will

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.029 
can ensure that I get one that will

and I've got a fluted edge as well as a
sharp<00:02:00.929> edge<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.289> gonna<00:02:01.440> start<00:02:01.679> with<00:02:01.769> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
sharp edge I'm gonna start with the

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
sharp edge first and actually because

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.529 
sharp edge first and actually because

these if I wanted to so just press it
down<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.709> after<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:12.110> muscle<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:14.580> get<00:02:14.879> a

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
down and after some muscle you get a

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.899 
down and after some muscle you get a
little<00:02:15.599> heart-shaped<00:02:16.159> pineapple<00:02:17.159> that<00:02:17.670> you
