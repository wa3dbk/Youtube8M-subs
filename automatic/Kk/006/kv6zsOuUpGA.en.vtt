about the different lenses both Nick on
and<00:00:13.320> Canon<00:00:13.980> lenses<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.549> what<00:00:15.240> I'm<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.449> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
and Canon lenses and what I'm going to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.349 
and Canon lenses and what I'm going to
do<00:00:15.600> first<00:00:15.930> off<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.379> sharpness<00:00:17.310> test<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.180> of

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
do first off is sharpness test on all of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
do first off is sharpness test on all of
the<00:00:18.449> lanes<00:00:18.600> I'm<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> use<00:00:19.680> Kim<00:00:19.949> as<00:00:20.189> my

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the lanes I'm going to use Kim as my

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.880 
the lanes I'm going to use Kim as my
model<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:20.910> we're<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.050> focus<00:00:22.349> on<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
model and we're going to focus on the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.560 
model and we're going to focus on the
eyeballs<00:00:23.429> because<00:00:23.609> that's<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.029> good<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.359> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
eyeballs because that's a good bit to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.839 
eyeballs because that's a good bit to
check<00:00:25.169> the<00:00:25.470> sharpness<00:00:25.769> off<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.490> also<00:00:26.609> if<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
check the sharpness off and also if you

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.460 
check the sharpness off and also if you
ever<00:00:26.970> done<00:00:27.179> any<00:00:27.329> portraits<00:00:27.839> that<00:00:27.989> eyeball<00:00:28.349> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
ever done any portraits that eyeball is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.529 
ever done any portraits that eyeball is
the<00:00:28.560> most<00:00:28.739> important<00:00:29.189> thing<00:00:29.339> to<00:00:29.519> get<00:00:29.669> in<00:00:29.939> focus

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the most important thing to get in focus

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.569 
the most important thing to get in focus
I've<00:00:31.409> got<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> bunch<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.980> different<00:00:32.220> lenses<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
I've got a bunch of different lenses and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.950 
I've got a bunch of different lenses and
ones<00:00:32.970> that<00:00:33.150> really<00:00:33.450> aren't<00:00:33.690> made<00:00:33.930> for

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
ones that really aren't made for

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.319 
ones that really aren't made for
portrait<00:00:34.500> stuff<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.520> check<00:00:35.820> their

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
portrait stuff to just check their

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.560 
portrait stuff to just check their
sharpness<00:00:36.750> levels<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.860> first<00:00:38.490> lens<00:00:38.730> will<00:00:39.330> use

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
sharpness levels so first lens will use

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.320 
sharpness levels so first lens will use
the<00:00:39.780> Mikan<00:00:40.440> 50<00:00:40.950> mil<00:00:41.100> f<00:00:41.280> 1.4<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.030> we'll<00:00:42.180> go

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
the Mikan 50 mil f 1.4 and we'll go

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.370 
the Mikan 50 mil f 1.4 and we'll go
through<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.600> couple<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> different

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
through a couple of the different

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.900 
through a couple of the different
apertures<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.130> we'll<00:00:44.430> try<00:00:44.580> and<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
apertures and we'll try and have the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.390 
apertures and we'll try and have the
lanes<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.270> close<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:45.600> possible<00:00:45.630> to<00:00:46.080> Kim<00:00:46.400> dollar

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
lanes as close as possible to Kim dollar

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
on 28 to 75 millimeter F 2.8 so again

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.180 
on 28 to 75 millimeter F 2.8 so again
we'll<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.030> using<00:00:54.150> this<00:00:54.450> on<00:00:54.720> Kim<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.040> as

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
we'll be using this on Kim to get as

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.950 
we'll be using this on Kim to get as
close<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.490> possible<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.970> flash<00:00:57.270> next<00:00:57.690> lens

close as possible with flash next lens
the<00:00:58.470> really<00:00:58.800> old-school<00:00:59.070> Nick<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.090> 20

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the really old-school Nick on 20

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
the really old-school Nick on 20
millimeter<00:01:00.990> a<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:02.010> lens<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:02.850> means<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
millimeter a is lens which means it's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.810 
millimeter a is lens which means it's
really<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.690> old<00:01:04.140> old<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.680> which<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.280> manual

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
really all old old and which is manual

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.060 
really all old old and which is manual
focus<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.360> manual<00:01:06.750> aperture<00:01:07.110> everything<00:01:07.680> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
focus and manual aperture everything so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.340 
focus and manual aperture everything so
this<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.300> if<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.200> focus

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this will be one which if it's in focus

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.130 
this will be one which if it's in focus
then<00:01:10.800> who<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.520> greatly<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.810> then

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
then who we greatly but if it's not then

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.120 
then who we greatly but if it's not then
I'll<00:01:13.290> probably<00:01:13.440> say<00:01:13.710> sir

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I'll probably say sir

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
I'll probably say sir

they will look to the Canon lenses and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.149 
they will look to the Canon lenses and
we've<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.440> a<00:01:16.470> whole<00:01:16.680> bunch<00:01:16.980> of<00:01:17.070> different

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
we've got a whole bunch of different

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.680 
we've got a whole bunch of different
Canon<00:01:17.610> lenses<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.000> I'll<00:01:18.120> be<00:01:18.210> using<00:01:18.240> with

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
Canon lenses which I'll be using with

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.620 
Canon lenses which I'll be using with
both<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> Nick<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> Canon<00:01:20.430> 550d<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
both the Nick with the Canon 550d and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.830 
both the Nick with the Canon 550d and
also<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.440> Canon<00:01:22.860> 5d<00:01:23.400> Mark<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.720> I'm

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
also with the Canon 5d Mark one so I'm

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.540 
also with the Canon 5d Mark one so I'm
going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.140> using<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> couple<00:01:26.340> of

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
going to be using this for a couple of

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.500 
going to be using this for a couple of
the<00:01:26.840> fill<00:01:27.840> frame<00:01:28.260> lens<00:01:28.909> sharpness<00:01:29.909> tests<00:01:30.300> well

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
the fill frame lens sharpness tests well

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.420 
the fill frame lens sharpness tests well
this<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> thirty<00:01:31.110> five<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> hundred<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
this is a thirty five to a hundred and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.130 
this is a thirty five to a hundred and
thirty<00:01:32.610> five<00:01:32.820> millimeter<00:01:33.090> lens<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
thirty five millimeter lens then a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
thirty five millimeter lens then a
massive<00:01:34.620> telephoto<00:01:35.159> lens<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.580> I'm<00:01:35.700> probably

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
massive telephoto lens so I'm probably

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.130 
massive telephoto lens so I'm probably
going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> room<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
going to have to be out of the room to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
going to have to be out of the room to
shoot<00:01:37.320> come<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.620> this<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.490> 75<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
shoot come with this this is the 75 to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600 
shoot come with this this is the 75 to
300<00:01:40.260> millimeter<00:01:40.620> lens<00:01:40.890> will<00:01:41.280> also<00:01:41.490> do

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
300 millimeter lens will also do

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.510 
300 millimeter lens will also do
ridiculous<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.630> Nick<00:01:42.900> on<00:01:43.159> ten<00:01:44.159> point
