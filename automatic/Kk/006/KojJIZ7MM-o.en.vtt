00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.139 

the<00:00:38.960> work<00:00:39.199> RAM<00:00:39.559> also<00:00:40.129> appears<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:40.640> be<00:00:40.730> working

perfectly

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.340 

now<00:00:44.650> let's<00:00:44.980> test<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.340> controllers<00:00:46.350> up

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350

and start work fine too

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.369 
and start work fine too
that's<00:00:59.739> just<00:00:59.980> being<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:02.399> doo-doo-doo-doo

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
so we'll just press a and B together to

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.210 
so we'll just press a and B together to
step<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:08.890> next<00:01:09.250> test

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
step to the next test

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.180 
step to the next test
yay<00:01:12.220> we<00:01:12.580> can<00:01:12.729> move<00:01:12.909> this<00:01:13.149> little<00:01:13.540> thing<00:01:13.810> around

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
yay we can move this little thing around

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.760 
yay we can move this little thing around
move<00:01:15.190> that<00:01:15.490> cursor<00:01:15.759> oh<00:01:16.240> let's<00:01:16.930> try<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.229> spell

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
move that cursor oh let's try to spell

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.230 
move that cursor oh let's try to spell
my<00:01:18.220> name<00:01:18.390> F<00:01:19.390> oh<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.920> can't<00:01:21.430> quite<00:01:21.640> do<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:21.880> oh<00:01:22.119> I

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
my name F oh I can't quite do it oh I

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.980 
my name F oh I can't quite do it oh I
guess<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.320> could<00:01:23.380> do<00:01:23.649> it<00:01:23.770> if<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:24.009> was<00:01:24.990> handwriting

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
guess I could do it if I was handwriting

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.350 
guess I could do it if I was handwriting
but<00:01:26.110> it's<00:01:26.439> difficult<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:27.039> do<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.939> let's<00:01:28.119> just

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
but it's difficult to do so let's just

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.850 
but it's difficult to do so let's just
skip<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.720> next<00:01:29.049> test

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
skip to the next test

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.750 
skip to the next test
we're<00:01:31.400> testing<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.000> color<00:01:32.240> palette<00:01:33.760> brighter

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
we're testing the color palette brighter

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.380 
we're testing the color palette brighter
and<00:01:34.970> brighter<00:01:35.560> even<00:01:36.560> brighter

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
and brighter even brighter

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.140
