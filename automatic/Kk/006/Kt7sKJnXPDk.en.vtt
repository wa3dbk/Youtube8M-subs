00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.110
 Hello everyone on the eve of Easter wanted 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.389
 to share with you one work 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.650
 which I made this testicle recently 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:22.300
 woven beads I wove it in the technique 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.769
 grids like this 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.749
 if you also want to get one 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.929
 shoot write me his mapri and 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:32.119
 I will definitely send it today but I 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.110
 I would like to show how you can do 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.810
 is a testicle on just a different pattern 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.740
 friend shooting if you're interested 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.740
 stay with me 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.079
 and so to perform such a testicle to us 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:52.129
 required first 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:56.120
 Needle with fishing line fishing line should be 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:00.829
 pretty thin i have it 0 1 and 5 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.379
 millimeters scissors and color of beads 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.570
 i will be golden 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.659
 white as main and green at all 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.670
 I need a little bit 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:17.000
 also I have already developed a scheme for 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:19.009
 which I will sheat testicles each 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.950
 point or here is such a circle or 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.289
 a hatched square represents one 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.450
 bead 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:29.810
 the numbers indicate the number of beads in 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.750
 the row that is in length, first we will do 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.229
 Here is a headband that we put on 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:41.300
 eggshell further pattern I'll 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:44.300
 start shooting here and on 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.920
 everything goes like this up the chain and 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.959
 top then down these are intersection points 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.289
 That is, I should have a mesh 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:56.959
 if you look closely you can see the places where 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:01.629
 no beads because the basis of such 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:05.770
 mesh top I'm all a matter of technology 

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:09.950
 bricks that is bead beads 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.810
 here I did not close completely 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.680
 because if not close completely 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.780
 putting an egg she stands and does not fall in 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.440
 otherwise, if you close all 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.870
 completely then the testicle will roll like 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.319
 ordinary but i think we can proceed 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.750
 at first I pass a tick cubicle forest and 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.160
 I tied 2 knots because so she 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.300
 will never fall out 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.400
 on the other side of the line I fixed one 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.129
 a bead that will do everything 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.230
 what will I do next 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.530
 working maw 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.330
 I suppose I know this is my circle 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.250
 green beads . it's white and 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:59.220
 the shaded box is gold 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.930
 beads and i stick sample and 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.549
 I collect the beads in that order in 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.549
 how are they represented here 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.670
 all that I have now won it on a thread 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.870
 I repeat once more to make it clearer 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.709
 here it is stripes yes that is these here and 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.849
 zigzags 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:58.049
 I got to these pores further I type more 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:01.609
 2 times and white and pass into this bead 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.609
 which is in the middle 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.930
 then again i take one white two 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.930
 gold and fall into gold 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.040
 we start weaving a net and every link 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.210
 mesh consists of three beads and 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:43.760
 someone not 3 1 2 gold and then three white 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:46.520
 this is just to be more convenient to follow 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.880
 pattern you can always compare 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.300
 how many 33 denote wrong we go 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.300
 farther 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:40.430
 when i'm already here down here i'm 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:43.219
 I type two times three three 5 5 and return to 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.259
 this bead to start to make you 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.479
 easier to take a ticker or sheet 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.599
 paper and close each row which 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.960
 you've already made it so much easier 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.960
 to navigate 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.570
 now you just have to watch that 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.250
 in order by rows 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.190
 which you first did not 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.810
 twisted because it is not very easy 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.690
 twisted but these are just these 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.580
 first 2 rows and then you later 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:33.310
 always thread you type always 3 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:36.350
 beads and threading a needle in 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.620
 the middle, that is , the second is always in 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.810
 second to second and so on further not 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.300
 it will be difficult to work just 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.740
 follow carefully the drawing so as not to 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.370
 be wrong in the beads 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:55.990
 I will do next they will show you already 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.990
 the middle of my work and the next steps
