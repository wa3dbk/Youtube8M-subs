00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.510
 good afternoon again I promised to show 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.000
 your scissor sharpener 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.910
 here finally came back to him do you want 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.800
 show you 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.039
 In principle, the price is not different from 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 press capturing for from fixture for 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:29.119
 sharpening kitchen knives here see for yourself 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 i.e. the mechanism is the same 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.510
 only slightly longer than this 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.719
 setting and table 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.469
 vertical table vertical here 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.710
 added a spring for the goods top create 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:50.010
 effort regulated height usually testicles 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.620
 nothing added spring enough 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 tough in order during work 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.079
 by no means there was a glitch and the table is not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.589
 left neither right nor left also added 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.350
 here and three magnets 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.470
 neodymium flat every fashionista 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.600
 effort 7 kilograms I mean that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.290
 additional reinforcement for scissors 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 no more let's say so I'll show you 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.360
 you yourself can make sure need vata 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.189
 I need time why my delivery 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.909
 still worth the bottom of the stand 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:32.220
 First, let's start by working on 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.890
 the edge of the table and the edges of the table and the edges of the fixing 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.119
 small scissors are great 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.369
 you understand the form 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.470
 literally not enough 10 millimeters 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.799
 there is in principle possible to make it 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.610
 using a little bit the very bottom i'm not 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.700
 that this is some kind of defect therefore 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.940
 I leave since I'm working on it sharpened 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.360
 already scissors 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.250
 and large and small that you can 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.390
 say more well again using your 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.119
 guide 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.540
 your glass blanks are nothing new 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:20.040
 there is nothing here to say about 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.710
 scissors point sharpen scissors i don't think 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.740
 harder than knives because basically 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.290
 the appointment is the same to 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.650
 there were good scissors 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.530
 it is necessary that they are well cut that is there 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.310
 her day apply if tailor s 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.080
 our fabrics 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.240
 if manicure snatch manicure with 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.150
 help 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:49.140
 In principle, all quality control which 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:54.060
 she's the same point on cutting 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.740
 edge hold marker i mean 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.520
 marker and then control 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:06.060
 sharpening basically nothing here 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.900
 no secret why I did for the point 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.650
 for scissors 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.820
 well, because when I started sharpening knives 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.800
 people come and you want to want 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.560
 I will sharpen the time you'll need to insert 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.540
 you and scissors. 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.040
 so I made such a device 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.870
 I think that there is an additional 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.920
 there is no mount but because 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.910
 removed pretty hard at the expense of 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.890
 of these magnets are therefore the only one with 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.560
 I use a household key when I clamp 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:45.319
 screws expose the guides exposing 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.819
 emphasis here can also be shown 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.480
 which is not very good right here 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.620
 a lot of holes they all perform 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.120
 certain 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.659
 that is, the publishing house scissors are big, I 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.409
 I run closer wide scissors 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:04.930
 puts it further, that is, whatever you want 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:07.549
 it works well after done 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.790
 fit for big scissors themselves 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.639
 do you understand that the moment has come when people 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.729
 come and burn a little scissors you 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.440
 sharpen well I can say I had to 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.039
 make another fit for 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.560
 small scissors it looks like 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:28.759
 about like this because it 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.759
 it looks like a natural table for 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:36.919
 scissors i made more miniature 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:40.220
 here are your these lamb 12 why I 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.910
 decide uncomfortable shesterochka work here 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.740
 the table goes without spring and therefore you need 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.020
 make maximum efforts in order 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:54.139
 to clamp well clamp what is needed for 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:59.000
 my position here everything remains the same 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.740
 most in turn expose using 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.930
 expose scissors one side 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.849
 the other is the same here is neodymium 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.280
 magnet so basically the same form 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.949
 that's why I'm in the first video 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.590
 showed little narrow me 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.340
 counted on a small narrow sharpen 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.639
 just such small scissors 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.190
 because in principle it is possible and so 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.090
 I speak large with a form to produce 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.460
 sharpening but you can see for yourself what the form 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.270
 practically is on the whole 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.810
 blade width in small scissors 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:45.770
 let's say it is not quite good because 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:47.840
 that sometimes scissors happens to bend if 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.270
 you will sharpen such a wide form 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.520
 then you are fit to do and 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:59.200
 big mistake because it will be necessary 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.060
 sharpen small little form i 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.200
 specially made if I already have 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.260
 cachets even 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.560
 rather not melting special mounts 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.620
 made a diamond found a few 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.620
 diamond Soviet bars 150 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.490
 millimeters 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:21.070
 so about me I as needed 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.440
 let's say so if the process goes 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.730
 let's say it will bring me 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.580
 additional income 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:32.080
 it is quite possible that with time I 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.340
 go to the japanese water stones for 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.830
 knife sharpening 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:42.190
 whether g.na diamond bars 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.820
 especially for sharpening scissors let's say 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.450
 on this i would like to roll this 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.980
 topic 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:54.850
 although honestly in perspective why in 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:07:02.100
 prospect Iâ€™m already saying so finish 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:06.060
 Now work on another adapt 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.060
 o'clock we show
