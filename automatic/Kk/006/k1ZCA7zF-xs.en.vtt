00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
Neil Peart plays in the song why I said

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.320 
Neil Peart plays in the song why I said
by<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.020> band<00:00:29.290> rush<00:00:29.730> I've<00:00:30.730> had<00:00:30.850> a<00:00:30.880> few<00:00:31.029> distance

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
by the band rush I've had a few distance

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.910 
by the band rush I've had a few distance
to<00:00:31.419> it<00:00:31.570> I<00:00:31.840> think<00:00:32.110> this<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.349> pretty<00:00:32.470> much<00:00:32.590> what

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
to it I think this is pretty much what

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.400 
to it I think this is pretty much what
it<00:00:33.010> is<00:00:33.040> if<00:00:33.670> I<00:00:33.790> get<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.060> wrong<00:00:34.240> you<00:00:34.870> know<00:00:34.960> set<00:00:35.290> me

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
it is if I get it wrong you know set me

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.890 
it is if I get it wrong you know set me
straight<00:00:35.440> in<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.860> comments<00:00:36.220> below<00:00:36.460> but<00:00:37.120> go

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
straight in the comments below but go

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.140 
straight in the comments below but go
easy<00:00:37.930> be<00:00:38.620> polite<00:00:39.040> we're<00:00:39.460> all<00:00:39.579> friends<00:00:39.970> here

easy be polite we're all friends here
so<00:00:40.420> I<00:00:40.480> wear<00:00:40.720> no<00:00:41.110> nasty<00:00:41.320> messages<00:00:41.829> but<00:00:42.460> anyway

so I wear no nasty messages but anyway
let's<00:00:43.030> give<00:00:43.150> it<00:00:43.180> a<00:00:43.270> go<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.660> see<00:00:43.780> what<00:00:44.140> it

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
let's give it a go and see what it

00:00:44.230 --> 00:01:02.790 
let's give it a go and see what it
sounds<00:00:44.350> like

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.130 

and<00:01:03.800> if<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.160> is<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.520> brilliant<00:01:05.210> okay<00:01:05.840> so

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
and if it is that brilliant okay so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.230 
and if it is that brilliant okay so
let's<00:01:06.830> just<00:01:06.860> break<00:01:07.160> down<00:01:07.190> what<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:07.700> think<00:01:08.000> is

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
let's just break down what I think is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.480 
let's just break down what I think is
now<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.080> easiest<00:01:09.590> way<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.740> do<00:01:09.980> this<00:01:10.010> is<00:01:10.340> to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
now the easiest way to do this is to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.270 
now the easiest way to do this is to
split<00:01:10.910> up<00:01:11.180> bits<00:01:11.510> 1<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.870> 2<00:01:12.050> from<00:01:12.350> beats<00:01:12.650> 3<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.010> 4

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
split up bits 1 and 2 from beats 3 and 4

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.760 
split up bits 1 and 2 from beats 3 and 4
so<00:01:13.910> we'll<00:01:14.210> concentrate<00:01:14.720> on<00:01:15.200> beats<00:01:15.530> one<00:01:15.740> and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
so we'll concentrate on beats one and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.250 
so we'll concentrate on beats one and
two<00:01:15.890> first<00:01:16.340> explore<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.630> hand<00:01:17.870> patterns

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
two first explore the the hand patterns

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.540 
two first explore the the hand patterns
and<00:01:18.440> then<00:01:18.530> we'll<00:01:18.650> do<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.860> same<00:01:19.040> if<00:01:19.190> it's<00:01:19.340> three

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
and then we'll do the same if it's three

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.510 
and then we'll do the same if it's three
and<00:01:19.580> four<00:01:19.880> then<00:01:20.060> sticking<00:01:20.810> together<00:01:21.520> actually

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
and four then sticking together actually

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.170 
and four then sticking together actually
makes<00:01:22.729> some<00:01:22.790> sense

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
makes some sense

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.969 
makes some sense
so<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:23.960> first<00:01:24.200> pitch<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.500> going<00:01:24.620> to<00:01:24.680> get<00:01:24.770> down

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
so the first pitch is going to get down

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.670 
so the first pitch is going to get down
is<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.700> hand<00:01:25.940> pad<00:01:26.180> okay<00:01:26.450> now<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:27.050> starts<00:01:27.110> off

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
is the hand pad okay now it starts off

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.380 
is the hand pad okay now it starts off
with<00:01:28.190> like<00:01:28.370> your<00:01:28.490> standard<00:01:28.729> crowding<00:01:29.270> once

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
with like your standard crowding once

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.969 
with like your standard crowding once
we've<00:01:29.540> got<00:01:31.990> after<00:01:32.990> that<00:01:33.170> because<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.830> takes

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
we've got after that because that takes

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.650 
we've got after that because that takes
up<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.220> beat<00:01:34.369> one<00:01:34.610> set<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.920> then<00:01:37.640> beat<00:01:37.910> -<00:01:38.240> I've

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
up a beat one set and then beat - I've

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:47.800 
up a beat one set and then beat - I've
got<00:01:38.930> banners<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:42.590> be<00:01:42.710> going<00:01:46.600> we've<00:01:47.600> got<00:01:47.630> to

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
got banners so to be going we've got to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.900 
got banners so to be going we've got to
do<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:47.990> add<00:01:48.290> some<00:01:48.320> bass<00:01:48.619> drums<00:01:48.950> in<00:01:49.130> there<00:01:49.340> now

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
do is add some bass drums in there now

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.999 
do is add some bass drums in there now
the<00:01:49.940> bass<00:01:50.360> drum<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.840> always<00:01:51.259> gonna<00:01:51.530> land<00:01:51.740> with

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
the bass drum is always gonna land with

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.469 
the bass drum is always gonna land with
your<00:01:52.130> right<00:01:52.310> hand<00:01:52.520> which<00:01:52.910> makes<00:01:53.119> things<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.450> bit

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
your right hand which makes things a bit

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.210 
your right hand which makes things a bit
nicer<00:01:53.810> but<00:01:54.410> there's<00:01:54.530> still<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.710> tricky<00:01:55.190> thing

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
nicer but there's still a tricky thing

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.800 
nicer but there's still a tricky thing
you're<00:01:55.399> going<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.550> get<00:01:55.700> here<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.180> then<00:01:56.630> if<00:01:56.720> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
you're going to get here and then if the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.139 
you're going to get here and then if the
bass<00:01:56.990> drum<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.290> on<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> one<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.520> other<00:01:58.550> one

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
bass drum is on the one the other one

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:32.770 
bass drum is on the one the other one
and<00:01:59.360> then<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.720> end<00:01:59.899> of<00:02:00.170> -<00:02:00.440> okay<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:32.360> second

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
and then the end of - okay the second

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.780 
and then the end of - okay the second
half<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.230> another<00:02:33.830> little<00:02:34.070> pattern<00:02:34.400> again

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
half is another little pattern again

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.180 
half is another little pattern again
one<00:02:35.480> based<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:36.590> not<00:02:36.650> too<00:02:36.980> bad

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
one based on to this so it's not too bad

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.830 
one based on to this so it's not too bad
we're<00:02:37.790> gonna<00:02:37.940> get<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.120> little<00:02:38.299> pattern<00:02:38.570> down

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
we're gonna get this little pattern down

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.680 
we're gonna get this little pattern down
again<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.799> starts<00:02:40.250> off<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.700> little

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
again it starts off with that little

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.640 
again it starts off with that little
pattern<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.910> right<00:02:43.910> but<00:02:44.840> then<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.260> second

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
pattern of right but then the second

00:02:45.650 --> 00:04:40.850 
pattern of right but then the second
half<00:02:45.799> it's<00:02:46.040> gonna<00:02:46.160> go

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.320 

okay<00:04:44.099> so<00:04:45.099> again<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.669> thought<00:04:45.910> I'd<00:04:46.030> keep<00:04:46.180> that

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
okay so again I thought I'd keep that

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.360
