00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
Curtis Breslau XTS he's quite average I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
the undercard on this I think is very

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.250 
the undercard on this I think is very
very<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:41.670> lacking<00:02:42.269> something<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.140> know

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
very you know lacking something you know

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.750 
very you know lacking something you know
it's<00:02:43.380> lacking<00:02:43.620> some<00:02:44.130> care<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.670> it's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it's lacking some care you know it's

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.100 
it's lacking some care you know it's
like<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:44.970> creative<00:02:45.300> team<00:02:45.420> only<00:02:45.690> cares<00:02:45.930> about

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
like the creative team only cares about

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.479 
like the creative team only cares about
three<00:02:46.140> matches<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.860> everything<00:02:47.190> else<00:02:47.340> is

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
three matches and everything else is

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.340 
three matches and everything else is
just<00:02:47.519> there<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.510> know<00:02:48.540> fill<00:02:48.840> up<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.140> three
