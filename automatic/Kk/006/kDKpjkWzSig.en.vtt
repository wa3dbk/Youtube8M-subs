of the areas of interest and so here is
the<00:00:26.460> first<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> picture<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the first one so this is a picture of

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.269 
the first one so this is a picture of
what<00:00:28.199> appears<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.619> Michael<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
what appears to be Michael on a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
what appears to be Michael on a
speedboat<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:30.119> down<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.480> little<00:00:30.720> river<00:00:31.109> /

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
speedboat going down the little river /

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.889 
speedboat going down the little river /
canal<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.460> why<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> included<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.719> for

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
canal in why I included this one was for

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
canal in why I included this one was for
one<00:00:34.110> simple<00:00:34.350> reason<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.250> water<00:00:35.520> effects<00:00:35.940> now

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
one simple reason the water effects now

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.030 
one simple reason the water effects now
the<00:00:36.329> foam<00:00:36.750> /<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.469> know<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> white<00:00:37.860> water

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the foam / you know the white water

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.380 
the foam / you know the white water
behind<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> boat<00:00:38.640> doesn't<00:00:38.790> look<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
behind the boat doesn't look the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660 
behind the boat doesn't look the
greatest<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.320> overall<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> reflection

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
greatest but overall for the reflection

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.709 
greatest but overall for the reflection
and<00:00:41.760> everything<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> ripples<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.660> water

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and everything the ripples in the water

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.600 
and everything the ripples in the water
over<00:00:42.989> there<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.190> left<00:00:44.399> side

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
over there to the the left side

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.340 
over there to the the left side
everything<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:45.840> good<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
everything looks really good and it

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
everything looks really good and it
clearly<00:00:46.590> did<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:46.950> look<00:00:47.280> quite<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.850> good<00:00:47.879> on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
clearly did not look quite that good on

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.029 
clearly did not look quite that good on
previous<00:00:48.629> gen<00:00:48.870> however<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.649> white<00:00:49.829> water

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
previous gen however that white water

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
previous gen however that white water
behind<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> boat<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.910> also<00:00:51.360> proof<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
behind the boat is also proof that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.119 
behind the boat is also proof that
there's<00:00:52.079> still<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> room<00:00:52.949> for

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
there's still a lot of room for

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.439 
there's still a lot of room for
improvement<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.730> far<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.000> video<00:00:54.239> game

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
improvement as far as video game

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
improvement as far as video game
graphics<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.860> next<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.250> here

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
graphics go so for this next one here

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.010 
graphics go so for this next one here
the<00:00:56.699> reason<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.030> chose<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the reason I chose this one was for the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.229 
the reason I chose this one was for the
cactuses<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.340> foliage<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> ground

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cactuses and the foliage on the ground

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
cactuses and the foliage on the ground
in<00:01:00.480> previous<00:01:01.109> gen<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.590> couldn't<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
in previous gen you couldn't see the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.729 
in previous gen you couldn't see the
individual<00:01:02.820> needles<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.359> cactuses<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.199> cacti

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
individual needles on cactuses or cacti

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.770 
individual needles on cactuses or cacti
rather<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.700> knew<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:05.939> were<00:01:06.000> cacti<00:01:06.420> because

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
rather you knew they were cacti because

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.179 
rather you knew they were cacti because
while<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.320> shaped<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.680> them<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
while they are shaped like them but you

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.469 
while they are shaped like them but you
were<00:01:08.280> never<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.640> able<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
were never actually able to see the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.570 
were never actually able to see the
individual<00:01:09.990> needles<00:01:10.350> until<00:01:10.590> now<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.460> then

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
individual needles until now and then

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.920 
individual needles until now and then
shifting<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.000> focus<00:01:12.030> down<00:01:12.479> there<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
shifting your focus down there to the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.600 
shifting your focus down there to the
ground<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.590> look<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> new<00:01:14.310> foliage

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
ground just look at all the new foliage

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.280 
ground just look at all the new foliage
and<00:01:14.909> everything<00:01:15.330> when<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> compare<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and everything when you compare this to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
and everything when you compare this to
previous<00:01:16.680> gen<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.400> ground<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.820> looks<00:01:18.030> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
previous gen the ground just looks so

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.940 
previous gen the ground just looks so
barren<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.869> plain<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.830> many

here<00:05:05.669> the<00:05:05.880> reason<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.270> chose<00:05:06.449> this<00:05:06.509> one<00:05:06.780> is

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
here the reason that I chose this one is

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.810 
here the reason that I chose this one is
because<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.349> was<00:05:07.440> only<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:07.740> one<00:05:08.099> frame<00:05:08.460> of<00:05:08.490> the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
because it was only in one frame of the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.820 
because it was only in one frame of the
entire<00:05:09.060> trailer<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:10.050> it<00:05:10.169> actually<00:05:10.349> happens

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
entire trailer and it actually happens

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.350 
entire trailer and it actually happens
really<00:05:11.070> fast<00:05:11.190> there<00:05:11.610> at<00:05:11.699> the<00:05:11.759> end<00:05:11.910> but<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.150> just

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
really fast there at the end but I just

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.879 
really fast there at the end but I just
kind<00:05:12.570> of<00:05:12.599> like<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.870> overall<00:05:13.020> look<00:05:13.289> of<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:13.710> all

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
kind of like the overall look of it all

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.950 
kind of like the overall look of it all
the<00:05:14.070> reflections<00:05:14.280> going<00:05:14.820> on<00:05:14.970> on<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.690> left

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
the reflections going on on the left

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.839 
the reflections going on on the left
side<00:05:16.110> there<00:05:16.320> on<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.650> actual<00:05:16.919> car<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.550> can<00:05:17.699> see

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
side there on the actual car you can see
