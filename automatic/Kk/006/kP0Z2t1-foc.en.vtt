both dropping in the same year however
this<00:03:06.680> kind<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:07.070> gave<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.850> lot<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.390> what<00:03:08.720> you

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
this kind of gave you a lot of what you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.780 
this kind of gave you a lot of what you
were<00:03:08.989> gonna<00:03:09.110> see<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.860> next<00:03:10.100> shoe<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.700> you

were gonna see in the next shoe and you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.580 
were gonna see in the next shoe and you
can<00:03:10.970> kind<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.269> see<00:03:11.630> where<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.200> lineage

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
can kind of see where the lineage

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.800 
can kind of see where the lineage
between<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.160> two<00:03:13.370> starts<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.330> ends

obviously<00:03:15.320> you<00:03:15.440> had<00:03:15.620> more<00:03:15.890> air<00:03:16.190> going<00:03:16.550> through

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
obviously you had more air going through

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.090 
obviously you had more air going through
on<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.870> latter<00:03:18.140> version<00:03:18.680> than<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:18.920> did<00:03:19.070> in

on the latter version than you did in
the<00:03:19.310> former<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.900> perhaps<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.470> more<00:03:21.500> subtle

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
the former and perhaps a more subtle

the former and perhaps a more subtle
colorway<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:22.910> time<00:03:23.120> around<00:03:23.420> but<00:03:24.019> beautiful

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
colorway this time around but beautiful

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.500 
colorway this time around but beautiful
shoe<00:03:24.709> nevertheless<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.670> just<00:03:26.120> before<00:03:26.390> we

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
shoe nevertheless and just before we

shoe nevertheless and just before we
take<00:03:26.750> off<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.140> want<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.500> show<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.739> where

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
take off I want to show you where

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.440 
take off I want to show you where
inspiration<00:03:28.400> carried<00:03:29.030> over<00:03:29.150> from<00:03:29.360> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
inspiration carried over from the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.130 
inspiration carried over from the
up-tempo<00:03:29.989> with<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.860> cd34<00:03:31.670> as<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.870> see

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
up-tempo with the cd34 as you can see

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.430 
up-tempo with the cd34 as you can see
here<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.920> have<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.250> exact<00:03:34.940> same<00:03:35.200> midsole<00:03:36.200> and

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
here you have the exact same midsole and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.770 
here you have the exact same midsole and
outsole<00:03:36.799> running<00:03:37.640> right<00:03:37.820> up<00:03:37.850> to<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.180> forefoot

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
outsole running right up to the forefoot

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.470 
outsole running right up to the forefoot
as<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:40.489> do<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.600> up-tempo

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
as you do in the up-tempo

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.140 
as you do in the up-tempo
so<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.140> can<00:03:44.410> see<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.770> this<00:03:44.920> shoe<00:03:45.250> not<00:03:45.790> only

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
so you can see that this shoe not only

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.300 
so you can see that this shoe not only
was<00:03:46.360> great<00:03:46.720> for<00:03:46.989> its<00:03:47.170> time<00:03:47.410> but<00:03:47.650> even<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.069> year

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
was great for its time but even a year

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.160 
was great for its time but even a year
later<00:03:48.370> they<00:03:49.120> want<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.480> carry<00:03:49.750> over<00:03:49.900> that

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
later they want to carry over that

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.199 
later they want to carry over that
technology<00:03:50.920> they<00:03:51.550> got<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.819> come<00:03:51.940> check<00:03:52.090> this

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
technology they got to come check this

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.910 
technology they got to come check this
out<00:03:52.390> of<00:03:52.540> neo<00:03:52.690> 39<00:03:53.230> because<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.590> shoe<00:03:53.769> is
