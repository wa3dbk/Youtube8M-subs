fishing basically I got involved with
chatter<00:00:14.530> baits<00:00:14.860> about<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:15.760> time<00:00:16.000> that<00:00:16.269> it<00:00:16.390> was

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
chatter baits about the time that it was

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.540 
chatter baits about the time that it was
just<00:00:16.960> starting<00:00:17.289> to<00:00:17.500> take<00:00:17.680> off<00:00:18.100> a<00:00:18.130> little

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
just starting to take off a little

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.160 
just starting to take off a little
probably<00:00:18.789> before<00:00:19.000> the<00:00:19.210> Bassmaster<00:00:19.990> Classic

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.350 

had<00:00:23.170> moderate<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:24.279> very<00:00:24.490> good<00:00:24.730> success<00:00:24.970> with

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
had moderate to very good success with

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.019 
had moderate to very good success with
them<00:00:25.720> it<00:00:25.990> definitely<00:00:26.920> is<00:00:27.039> a<00:00:27.070> big<00:00:27.369> fish<00:00:27.670> bait

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
them it definitely is a big fish bait

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.040 
them it definitely is a big fish bait
and<00:00:28.359> for<00:00:28.990> myself<00:00:29.529> personally<00:00:29.890> has<00:00:31.050> probably

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
and for myself personally has probably

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.259 
and for myself personally has probably
taken<00:00:32.379> the<00:00:32.710> place<00:00:32.949> of<00:00:32.980> spinner<00:00:33.640> baits<00:00:33.999> and

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
taken the place of spinner baits and

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.419 
taken the place of spinner baits and
about<00:00:34.690> 80<00:00:35.229> to<00:00:35.890> 90%<00:00:36.550> of<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.569> fishing<00:00:38.289> I<00:00:38.409> do<00:00:38.469> with

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
about 80 to 90% of the fishing I do with

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.259 
about 80 to 90% of the fishing I do with
spinner<00:00:40.269> baits<00:00:40.539> or<00:00:40.690> chatter<00:00:40.989> baits<00:00:41.319> um

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
spinner baits or chatter baits um

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.439 
spinner baits or chatter baits um
ideally<00:00:43.269> what<00:00:43.719> I<00:00:43.749> like<00:00:44.079> to<00:00:44.289> look<00:00:44.499> for<00:00:44.559> in<00:00:45.449> say

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
ideally what I like to look for in say

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.919 
ideally what I like to look for in say
tidal<00:00:47.049> fishery<00:00:47.710> would<00:00:48.219> be<00:00:48.489> a<00:00:48.850> lower<00:00:49.510> tide

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
tidal fishery would be a lower tide

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.509 
tidal fishery would be a lower tide
working<00:00:50.589> the<00:00:50.710> outside<00:00:51.159> edge<00:00:51.399> of<00:00:51.429> weed<00:00:51.940> lines<00:00:52.350> I

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
working the outside edge of weed lines I

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.340 
working the outside edge of weed lines I
like<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.850> little<00:00:55.329> bit<00:00:55.479> of<00:00:55.629> clarity<00:00:56.049> to<00:00:56.229> the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
like a little bit of clarity to the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.020 
like a little bit of clarity to the
