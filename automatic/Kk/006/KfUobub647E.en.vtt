00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello together today I have for you 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.490
 the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.960
 pkb 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.820
 and that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.110
 model f 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.770
 8 mg of this notebook has a display 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.360
 of 17 3 inches in the diagonal 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:32.460
 which dissolves with 1600 x 900 pixels 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:37.440
 so gone gaa or hd plus inside 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.190
 you will find a core i5 cpu of the type 5200 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.870
 which clocked at 22 to 27 gigahertz 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 becomes 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.270
 In addition, there is still a deep house 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.120
 built and type 830 m with 2 gb 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.120
 video store 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.850
 then in the pavilion 17 8 gb 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.059
 RAM and a hard disk with 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 1000 gigabytes installed so there is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.770
 eight gigabyte flash memory 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.039
 that means the file will be here 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.360
 Loaded often are outsourced 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.460
 You see I have on the background 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.330
 a few pictures because on the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.060
 pavilion 17 in the version 11 208 lg 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.250
 no operating system is preinstalled 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 but that does not matter you can windows 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.490
 8 or already install windows 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.250
 10 the preview she was running now or was 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.119
 If you want, you can also go around and you 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.189
 So install a linux version 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.229
 the drivers for windows 8 you have to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.439
 Download at hp 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.810
 and if you update to windows 10 who 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.970
 the drivers taken from windows 8 ago 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.960
 and there I had no problems with the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.619
 installation 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.270
 Everything was automatically detected here 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.750
 let's get that off of now 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.009
 all sides 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.390
 Let's start on the left 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.950
 Here we have the socket for that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:07.590
 power adapter then the kensington lock then 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:10.280
 rj45 jack hdmi twice usb 3.0 and the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.280
 card reader 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.720
 on the opposite side 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.390
 we combined a few leds here 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.930
 headset connection a usb 2.0 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.930
 interface and here a dvd burner 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.600
 on the front as well as on the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.960
 There is no connection socket on the back 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.430
 at hp pavilion 17 comes a chiclet 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.560
 keyboard for use 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.710
 with additional numeric 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.510
 Numeric keypad here a big touchpad 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.700
 which probably supports the gestures of the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.380
 17 inches from hp has a weight of 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.660
 almost three kilograms 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.640
 to be exact 2008 120 grams 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.210
 that was my hands on video to the car around 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.490
 17 model f 208 g 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.060
 I hope you enjoyed it until the 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.060
