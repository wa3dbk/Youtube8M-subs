meet<00:01:34.290> some<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.619> nice<00:01:34.829> over<00:01:35.070> classmen<00:01:35.549> most

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
meet some really nice over classmen most

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
meet some really nice over classmen most
likely<00:01:36.600> they're<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:36.960> gonna<00:01:37.170> treat<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.740> very

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
likely they're not gonna treat you very

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.190 
likely they're not gonna treat you very
nicely<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
nicely I don't know it is I think it's a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.220 
nicely I don't know it is I think it's a
fact<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
fact that

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.840 
fact that
classmen<00:01:41.530> are<00:01:41.560> like<00:01:41.770> older<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.730> they're

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
classmen are like older and they're

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.420 
classmen are like older and they're
pretty<00:01:43.180> much<00:01:43.270> adults<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:44.160> freshmen<00:01:45.160> are<00:01:45.340> you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
pretty much adults and freshmen are you

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.180 
pretty much adults and freshmen are you
younger<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:45.910> mean<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.510> was<00:01:46.750> 15<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.290> was<00:01:47.410> freshmen

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
younger I mean I was 15 I was freshmen

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.280 
younger I mean I was 15 I was freshmen
so<00:01:48.370> number<00:01:49.090> four<00:01:49.390> try<00:01:49.750> not<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.050> procrastinate

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
so number four try not to procrastinate

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.320 
so number four try not to procrastinate
and<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:51.190> really<00:01:51.490> mean<00:01:51.670> when<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:51.850> say<00:01:52.120> that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
and I really mean when I say that

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.120 
and I really mean when I say that
because<00:01:52.750> if<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.590> end<00:01:53.710> up<00:01:53.770> doing<00:01:53.920> your

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
much in my geometry class I didn't

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.990 
much in my geometry class I didn't
really<00:02:26.080> know<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.440> material<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.280> passed<00:02:27.790> cause

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.360 
really know the material I passed cause
with<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.270> B<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:29.650> really<00:02:29.950> shouldn't<00:02:30.280> have

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
with the B and I really shouldn't have

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.250 
with the B and I really shouldn't have
gotten<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.120> considering<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.990> didn't
