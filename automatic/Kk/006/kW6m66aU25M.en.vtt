00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
fluidic sculpture and just think about

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.820 
fluidic sculpture and just think about
the<00:00:23.730> cars<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.300> followed<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.289> Ford

now<00:00:28.349> even<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> Camry<00:00:29.670> looks<00:00:29.910> better<00:00:30.150> than<00:00:30.420> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
now even the Camry looks better than it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
now even the Camry looks better than it
ever<00:00:30.570> has<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.289> Honda<00:00:31.949> Accord<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.759> even<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
ever has the Honda Accord and even the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.420 
ever has the Honda Accord and even the
Optima<00:00:33.840> from<00:00:33.989> Kia<00:00:34.320> much<00:00:34.980> better-looking

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.760 
Optima from Kia much better-looking
vehicles<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> lot<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.620> be

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
vehicles and I think a lot of it can be

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.680 
vehicles and I think a lot of it can be
traced<00:00:37.980> back<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.910> Hyundai<00:00:39.450> Sonata

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
traced back to when that Hyundai Sonata

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.260 
traced back to when that Hyundai Sonata
was<00:00:40.079> introduced<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.640> are<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
was introduced so here we are with the

was introduced so here we are with the
all-new<00:00:42.750> version<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.800> looks<00:00:44.010> much<00:00:44.280> more

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
grown-up the only problem with that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.979 
grown-up the only problem with that
previous<00:00:46.950> design<00:00:47.550> was<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.660> real

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
previous design was that that real

safety<00:03:18.979> features<00:03:19.340> as<00:03:19.519> well<00:03:19.699> so<00:03:20.239> let's<00:03:20.750> get

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
safety features as well so let's get

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.839 
safety features as well so let's get
into<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.259> because<00:03:21.409> the<00:03:21.709> changes<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.579> car

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
into it because the changes to this car

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.420 
into it because the changes to this car
not<00:03:23.479> only<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.989> inside<00:03:24.169> not<00:03:24.949> only<00:03:25.009> on<00:03:25.340> the

this<00:04:06.259> new<00:04:06.709> model<00:04:07.189> is<00:04:07.310> they've<00:04:07.759> actually

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
this new model is they've actually

this new model is they've actually
dialed<00:04:08.780> down<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.319> horsepower<00:04:09.829> but<00:04:10.400> dialed<00:04:10.909> up

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
dialed down the horsepower but dialed up

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.270 
dialed down the horsepower but dialed up
the<00:04:11.359> torque<00:04:11.719> so<00:04:12.409> what<00:04:12.590> they've<00:04:12.739> done<00:04:12.769> with<00:04:13.159> the

the torque so what they've done with the
2.4<00:04:13.939> liter<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.419> dropped<00:04:14.719> the<00:04:14.930> horsepower<00:04:15.349> from

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
2.4 liter is dropped the horsepower from

but improve the bottom end torque and on

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.740 
but improve the bottom end torque and on
this<00:04:19.219> turbo<00:04:19.759> they've<00:04:20.299> dropped<00:04:20.570> the

with in day to day city conditions you

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.260 
with in day to day city conditions you
get<00:04:38.560> all<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:38.950> torque<00:04:39.310> pretty<00:04:39.580> much<00:04:39.760> when<00:04:40.180> you

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
get all that torque pretty much when you

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.850 
get all that torque pretty much when you
take<00:04:40.480> off<00:04:40.690> from<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.020> line<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.680> definitely

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
take off from the line and it definitely

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.880 
take off from the line and it definitely
gives<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.640> very<00:04:43.150> dynamic<00:04:43.420> ride<00:04:44.020> now<00:04:44.620> what

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
gives you a very dynamic ride now what

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.200 
gives you a very dynamic ride now what
they<00:04:45.040> did<00:04:45.220> with<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.550> body<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.150> the

they did with the body and the
suspension<00:04:46.930> they<00:04:47.140> improve<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> rigidity<00:04:48.160> of
