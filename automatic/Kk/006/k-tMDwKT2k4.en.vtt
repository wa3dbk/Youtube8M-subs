over<00:01:16.380> i'm<00:01:16.500> probably<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> wear<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
over i'm probably have to wear it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
over i'm probably have to wear it
straight<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:17.880> keep<00:01:18.090> curling<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.900> no<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
straight or keep curling it but no the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
straight or keep curling it but no the
curl<00:01:19.799> pattern<00:01:20.040> came<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.330> only

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
curl pattern came right back the only

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
curl pattern came right back the only
reason<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.960> even<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> little<00:01:22.590> flat<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:23.070> now

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
reason is even a little flat right now

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.179 
reason is even a little flat right now
is<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.670> i<00:01:24.259> just<00:01:25.259> washed<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.009> why

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
is because i just washed it that's why

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.920 
is because i just washed it that's why
it's<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.909> usually<00:01:27.689> when<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it's like this like usually when it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's like this like usually when it
dries<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.229> dries<00:01:28.560> away<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.240> every<00:01:30.240> curly

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
dries it dries away because every curly

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.840 
dries it dries away because every curly
hair<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.960> i've<00:01:31.049> had<00:01:31.290> any<00:01:32.189> time<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.490> bleach<00:01:32.820> it
