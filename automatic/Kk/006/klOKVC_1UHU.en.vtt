mode in the portrait mode now if I click
over<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.129> happen

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
over here see what will happen

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
over here see what will happen
observe<00:01:05.850> these<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.210> lines<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.110> as

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
observe these two lines this is on I as

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.630 
observe these two lines this is on I as
of<00:01:07.500> my<00:01:07.619> right<00:01:09.049> it<00:01:10.049> has<00:01:10.260> shifted<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> M<00:01:10.950> correct

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of my right it has shifted to M correct

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390 
of my right it has shifted to M correct
so<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.869> moved<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> landscape<00:01:14.070> mode

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
this I did with the use of AA VBA code

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.620 
this I did with the use of AA VBA code
which<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.500> very<00:01:19.890> simple<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.369> write<00:01:20.520> I'll<00:01:21.390> tell

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.460 
named because I have named it macro one
you<00:02:15.280> can<00:02:15.430> name<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.610> anything<00:02:15.820> else<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.540> then

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
you can name it anything else and then

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.760 
you can name it anything else and then
the<00:02:17.890> actual<00:02:18.550> formula<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.600> actual<00:02:19.900> code<00:02:20.110> it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.560 
sheet you want Excel to run the paste
setup<00:02:30.100> option<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.700> change<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.450> orientation

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
setup option and change the orientation

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.890 
setup option and change the orientation
to<00:02:32.580> landscape<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.630> code<00:02:34.870> for

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
to landscape so this is the code for

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.440 
to landscape so this is the code for
that<00:02:35.290> orientation<00:02:35.980> space<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:37.030> equal<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.360> space

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
that orientation space is equal to space

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.610 
that orientation space is equal to space
x<00:02:38.020> one<00:02:38.410> landscape<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.280> some<00:02:40.240> alright<00:02:41.050> we<00:02:41.410> can

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
x one landscape and some alright we can

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.280 
x one landscape and some alright we can
test<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.190> also<00:02:42.760> as<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.660> now<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.870> see<00:02:44.110> it's

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
test this also as of now you see it's

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.980 
test this also as of now you see it's
here<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:44.800> M<00:02:45.220> let<00:02:45.550> me<00:02:45.700> change<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.150> back<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:47.130> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
here on M let me change it back to the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.780 
here on M let me change it back to the
normal<00:02:49.990> mode<00:02:50.020> which<00:02:50.830> would<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.310> landscape

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790

has moved from I to GM this line so that

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.430 
has moved from I to GM this line so that
means<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.490> working<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.080> is<00:03:20.230> how<00:03:20.380> we

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
means it's working so that is how we

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.480 
means it's working so that is how we
have<00:03:20.680> done<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:23.380> press<00:03:23.680> ctrl<00:03:24.130> s<00:03:24.280> that

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.350 
activated and asks Excel jumps in and
asks<00:03:48.070> you<00:03:48.250> key<00:03:48.820> ok

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
asks you key ok

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.320 
asks you key ok
ok<00:03:49.930> assign<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.530> macro<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.120> our

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
ok assign it a macro so I this is our

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.480 
ok assign it a macro so I this is our
macro<00:03:52.750> which<00:03:52.990> we<00:03:53.200> have<00:03:53.380> created<00:03:54.190> we<00:03:54.460> have

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
macro which we have created we have

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.610 
macro which we have created we have
named<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.820> macro<00:03:55.210> one<00:03:55.360> right<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:56.200> we<00:03:56.470> will

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
named it macro one right so we will

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.130 
named it macro one right so we will
assign<00:03:56.830> it<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.370> press<00:03:57.760> on<00:03:57.940> OK<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.540> if<00:03:59.020> I

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
assign it to it and press on OK and if I

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.450 
assign it to it and press on OK and if I
want<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.410> rename<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.860> I'll<00:04:00.010> just<00:04:00.220> right-click

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
want to rename it I'll just right-click

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.720 
want to rename it I'll just right-click
it<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:00.880> it<00:04:01.480> text<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.560> will<00:04:02.650> type<00:04:02.830> in<00:04:02.980> LA<00:04:03.550> and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
it and it text and I will type in LA and

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.720 
it and it text and I will type in LA and
D<00:04:03.910> that's<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:05.460> now<00:04:06.460> let<00:04:06.760> me<00:04:06.910> change<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:08.730> mode

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
D that's it now let me change the mode

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.900 
D that's it now let me change the mode
to<00:04:10.320> page<00:04:11.320> setup<00:04:11.530> mode<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:12.040> portrait<00:04:12.490> so<00:04:12.730> that

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
to page setup mode to portrait so that

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.050 
to page setup mode to portrait so that
