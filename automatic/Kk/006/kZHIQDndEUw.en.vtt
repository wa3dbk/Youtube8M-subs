let's do a quick little 360 of the
skates

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.810 

what<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.740> thought<00:01:59.980> was<00:02:00.100> kind<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.400> weird<00:02:00.610> was<00:02:00.790> uh

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
what I thought was kind of weird was uh

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.050 
what I thought was kind of weird was uh
how<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.360> front<00:02:01.810> part<00:02:02.110> on<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.470> blade<00:02:02.680> is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
how the front part on the blade is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.420 
how the front part on the blade is
really<00:02:04.060> long<00:02:04.300> compared<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.560> back<00:02:05.770> guess

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
really long compared to the back guess

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.600 
really long compared to the back guess
that's<00:02:06.640> normal<00:02:06.850> but<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.390> just<00:02:07.540> struck<00:02:08.259> me<00:02:08.610> as

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
that's normal but it just struck me as

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.360 
that's normal but it just struck me as
kind<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.910> strange<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.980> so<00:02:11.980> yeah<00:02:12.190> it's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
kind of strange and so yeah it's

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.140 
kind of strange and so yeah it's
basically<00:02:12.730> my<00:02:12.940> stuff<00:02:13.800> reebok<00:02:14.800> 8k<00:02:15.310> helmet<00:02:15.760> some
