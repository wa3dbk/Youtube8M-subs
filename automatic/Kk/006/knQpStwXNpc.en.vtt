00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
at the Institute for Global features we

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.200 
at the Institute for Global features we
have<00:00:06.810> had<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> long<00:00:08.010> practice<00:00:08.280> over<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> past

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
have had a long practice over the past

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.020 
have had a long practice over the past
20<00:00:09.570> years<00:00:09.690> looking<00:00:10.170> at<00:00:10.320> they<00:00:10.769> transition<00:00:11.639> from

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
20 years looking at they transition from

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.550 
20 years looking at they transition from
traditional<00:00:12.889> monetary<00:00:13.889> instruments<00:00:14.219> such<00:00:14.700> as

traditional monetary instruments such as

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.740 
traditional monetary instruments such as
currencies<00:00:16.560> if<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.890> will<00:00:17.130> into<00:00:17.400> more<00:00:18.119> digital

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
currencies if you will into more digital

currencies if you will into more digital
platforms<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.369> tracked<00:00:20.730> some<00:00:21.029> of

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
platforms and we have tracked some of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.660 
platforms and we have tracked some of
the<00:00:21.240> evolution<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.869> these<00:00:22.670> transformations

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the evolution of these transformations

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.310 
the evolution of these transformations
probably<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.180> most<00:00:24.300> ambitious<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:25.109> is

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
probably the most ambitious one is

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
probably the most ambitious one is

kind<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.940> card<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:37.350> are<00:00:37.440> issues<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
kind of card there are issues of

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
kind of card there are issues of
identification<00:00:39.570> authentication<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:41.040> are

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
identification authentication that are

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.940

emerging<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.780> carry<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.930> clear<00:00:43.320> card<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.800> me

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
emerging I carry a clear card with me

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.000 
emerging I carry a clear card with me
which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.510> biometric<00:00:45.510> card<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.890> could

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
which is a biometric card that could

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.010 
which is a biometric card that could
easily<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> transaction<00:00:48.360> portal<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.840> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
easily have a transaction portal on it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.700 
easily have a transaction portal on it
there<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.500> no<00:00:49.620> lack<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:51.230> innovative<00:00:52.230> ideas

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
there are no lack of innovative ideas

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.430 
there are no lack of innovative ideas
again<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.730> there's<00:00:54.180> even<00:00:54.239> some<00:00:54.750> technologies

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
again and there's even some technologies

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.610 
again and there's even some technologies
that<00:00:55.739> represent<00:00:57.050> innovations<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.350> used

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that represent innovations that are used

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
that represent innovations that are used
for<00:00:58.859> selective<00:00:59.340> areas<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.969> here's<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.180> clear

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
for selective areas so here's my clear

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.770 
for selective areas so here's my clear
card<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.190> I've<00:01:02.340> got<00:01:02.370> its<00:01:03.149> got<00:01:03.239> my

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
card and you know I've got its got my

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
card and you know I've got its got my

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
picture is on the back of it notice

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.090 
picture is on the back of it notice
there's<00:01:05.700> there's<00:01:06.360> no<00:01:06.720> numbers<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.860> or

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
there's there's no numbers on it or

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.460 
there's there's no numbers on it or
anything<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> does<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.390> smart<00:01:10.229> chip

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
anything but it does have a smart chip

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.880 
anything but it does have a smart chip
on<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.070> smart<00:01:11.400> chip<00:01:11.640> has<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.540> my

everything except my purchasing
information<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.360> room<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.900> this

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
information now is there room on this

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.460 
information now is there room on this
existing<00:01:19.920> platform<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.970> put<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.780> payment

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
existing platform to put my payment

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.140 
existing platform to put my payment
information<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> answer<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.549> yes<00:01:23.700> there

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
information and the answer is yes there

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.420 
information and the answer is yes there
is<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.049> other<00:01:25.140> words<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.860> an<00:01:26.070> example

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
is so in other words this as an example

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.940 
is so in other words this as an example
of<00:01:26.610> an<00:01:26.729> innovation<00:01:27.299> already<00:01:27.600> exists<00:01:28.170> in

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
of an innovation already exists in

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.200 
of an innovation already exists in
Europe<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.549> Asia<00:01:29.670> they've<00:01:30.060> been<00:01:30.180> using

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
Europe and Asia they've been using

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.890 
Europe and Asia they've been using
digital<00:01:31.939> currency<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.210> will<00:01:33.390> tied<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
digital currency if you will tied to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.160 
digital currency if you will tied to
cards<00:01:34.909> for<00:01:35.909> quite<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.240> while<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> big
