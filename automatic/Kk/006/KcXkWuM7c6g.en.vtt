00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.139
 Y 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 We continue at home and give a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.920
 important focus and is 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.719
 the advantages of living on the outskirts of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.340
 the city for this is accompanied by a 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.830
 expert on the subject and it's about the lord 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.850
 Victor Mori Don Victor Good afternoon and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.949
 Welcome to your ideal home 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.420
 don víctor as we all know now the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.880
 housing construction has 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.710
 emphasized more in rural sites or 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.670
 outside of the city because he does not speak to us 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.670
 a little about this 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.040
 in all the big groups the people 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.070
 tired of vehicular congestion 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.270
 environmental pollution the high index 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.460
 of criminality 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.490
 the tendency to move or move toward 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.070
 the outskirts of the city where it is offered 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.320
 a much calmer environment more calm 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.960
 in constant contact with nature 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.400
 It is precisely why the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.830
 corregimiento de rosso that is 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.620
 only 15 miles away from the 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.090
 cali city offers the best of the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.230
 two worlds 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.690
 live in the countryside without leaving the city 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.270
 Don Vctor, since you have just named 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.460
 rice or tell us what advantages it has 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.940
 live in this village the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.400
 advantages are innumerable among others is 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.710
 the proximity to the city as I said 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.260
 previously they are only 15 18 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.270
 kilometers from the city of Cali but 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.000
 also its location is very privileged 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.940
 is in the best road network of all 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.180
 Department of the Cauca Valley 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.940
 9 kilometers from the large airport 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.250
 executives of banks and 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.800
 and financials have told me that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.590
 many times they take much longer 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.470
 traveling from the airport to your residence 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.800
 in the south of the city that of Bogota 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.320
 cali 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.730
 and they travel 34 times a week 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.250
 that is that rosso 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.250
 the investment so enjoyable and 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.460
 and logical because its proximity to all 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.290
 the events to all free zones 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.920
 from the center of commerce center wit 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.870
 commercial etcetera plus the highest 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.959
 valorization that the corregimiento has 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.790
 for a person who wants a home 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.890
 on the outskirts of the city in which 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.400
 must fix or as it should do to 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.409
 choose memory mind a very important factor 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.069
 important to consider are the avenues of 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:36.110
 access I repeat rosso are the best mesh 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.250
 vial of the valley department of 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.470
 cauca its proximity to all all 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.599
 free zones and now we are in the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.760
 threshold of the double carriageway to 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.069
 which are important for 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.140
 the arrival of the different tlc is 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.850
 comfortable 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.480
 with the countless countries that we are 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.230
 signing free trade agreements usa 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.690
 japan korea china 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.489
 magical now we see that the design of the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.170
 homes built on the outskirts of the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.569
 city is very different from those 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.299
 we find inside it we see that 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.459
 now houses more modern houses 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.840
 country because we do not tell 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.970
 our viewers on these 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.970
 advantages of course it has to be 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.610
 different to the design the design has to 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.350
 take into account the use of 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.090
 maximum living in the countryside 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.090
 subtract any comfort 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:36.440
 hence, the height of the roofs of 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.810
 5 meters with 40 minimize the use of 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.819
 air conditioning orientation 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.310
 geographic of the housing for 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.100
 take advantage of the existing microclimate and 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.120
 existing sunlight in the area is very 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.940
 important too 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.709
 besides that the wide spaces that 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.810
 they have housing to be in 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.120
 constant eye contact with the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.020
 nature because otherwise I would not 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.270
 apara sense 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.580
 to have a confinement 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.980
 in the house 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.870
 I moved to an apartment in the city and 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.390
 is what I 'm trying to do 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.400
 avoid good don víctor and to finalize 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.709
 other recommendations can give 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.110
 our viewers to choose this 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.430
 type of housing the recommendations that 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.360
 there is 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.810
 the immediate ones would be to look in an area 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.060
 like the one we are discussing that 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.060
 let's be sure you have 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.990
 a cost / benefit ratio that the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.110
 investment is the one with the highest valuation and 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.750
 the fastest valuation in addition to that 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.139
 the taxes that are paid in the area 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.510
 rural for being such is a lot much 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.820
 much smaller than the one paid in 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.970
 the city 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.790
 the recommendations would be to have in 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.060
 account not only the design of the tracks 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.690
 the service availability of all 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.950
 public services and safety 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.960
 all the all the houses in the area 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.590
 they have much lower exposure to high 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.640
 criminality that exists in the city 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.050
 where are many thanks for having 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.050

 city ​​but also in the 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.540
 different rural sites or the outskirts 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.770
 of our city 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.570
