00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.849
 beating in close stove fire on log 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.059
 with a little hello everyone today I will do 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.930
 first wood stove shirker for this 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.150
 we will need 2 cans with 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:27.660
 so that one bank was 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:35.790
 more than 2 to have a gap 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:40.129
 you install one can other between 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.500
 the side walls and the bottom wall of the can 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:50.539
 in days big cans tracing 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.539
 configuration less and cans with marker 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.909
 so that the hole 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:14.100
 after removing the excess metal was a little 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:18.040
 less than the diameter of this jar 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.800
 so that after installation there are no gaps 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.060
 the bank did not hang out and did not spread 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.409
 now delete 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.440
 excess metal on the drawn line 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.190
 cut out but contoured contour now 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.830
 the second smaller bank is inserted with difficulty 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.070
 into the hole 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.340
 more banks and schedule 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.780
 hole in both cans for under up 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:52.420
 small can need to make a hole 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:56.700
 around the top perimeter of the jar for 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.700
 I use this circle 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.810
 to make the holes through equal 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.810
 gaps and neat 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.040
 the hole will need to be made and the bottom 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.870
 parts of a small can in a large can 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.330
 also around the perimeter 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.299
 cans need to make a hole only in 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.299
 the bottom of where we did not have 1 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:43.230
 hole marked now proceed to 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.010
 Drilling holes in both cans 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:53.970
 ready you can proceed to the final 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:56.099
 furnace assembly for this insert small 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.040
 tin can in big 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.940
 so that in a small hole 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:10.340
 the upper ones were on top and more 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:14.359
 Bottom pyrolysis furnace schepochnitsa collected 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.359
 it looks like this 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.360
 pyrolysis comes from the Greek fire and 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.340
 decomposition is thermal decomposition 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.420
 organic and inorganic natural 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.920
 compounds with a lack of oxygen 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.310
 chest with this is the first stage of burning 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.570
 wood it occurs at a temperature 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.300
 450 to 500 degrees Celsius is formed 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.960
 many different substances gaseous 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.230
 products 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.140
 this process takes place at boot 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.720
 space under the influence of high 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.940
 temperature and with limited access 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.520
 of air 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:06.190
 the resulting gases pass 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:09.790
 through the zone of high temperatures reach 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.050
 output device and mix there with 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.050
 secondary air 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.260
 after which it re-enters the chamber 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.260
 combustion 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.100
 Now let's proceed to the tests and so that is 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.100
 30 and you know what 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.090
 I will use the coffin 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.090
 birch twigs 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.640
 burns very well I would feel 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.640
 good ones 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:12.060
 subscribe to my channel go to 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.060
 bye everyone bye
