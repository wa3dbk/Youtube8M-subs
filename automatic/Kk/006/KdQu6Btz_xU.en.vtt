is<00:01:08.330> drag<00:01:08.570> over<00:01:08.929> our<00:01:09.050> top<00:01:09.320> reload<00:01:10.000> get<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:11.090> in<00:01:11.179> a

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
is drag over our top reload get it in a

is drag over our top reload get it in a
similar<00:01:11.630> position<00:01:12.220> this<00:01:13.220> is<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.429> lot<00:01:13.670> easier<00:01:13.700> if

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
similar position this is a lot easier if

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.609 
similar position this is a lot easier if
you<00:01:14.570> lower<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.929> opacity<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.619> top<00:01:15.800> level

bottom layer split at the same point and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.200 
bottom layer split at the same point and
split<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.200> at<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.830> same<00:03:03.040> point<00:03:03.370> as<00:03:03.760> we<00:03:03.970> split

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
split it at the same point as we split

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.000 
split it at the same point as we split
the<00:03:04.300> last<00:03:04.480> clip

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010

that's<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.600> kind<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:54.900> position<00:04:55.290> you're

similar<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:58.860> let's<00:04:59.010> split<00:04:59.340> that

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
similar to that so let's split that

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.150 
similar to that so let's split that
layer<00:04:59.790> there<00:05:02.720> cut<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.840> excess<00:05:04.140> off<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:04.680> drag

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
layer there cut the excess off and drag

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.970 
layer there cut the excess off and drag
it<00:05:05.310> back<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:06.780> our<00:05:06.900> on<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.140> file<00:05:07.380> scroll<00:05:07.770> down

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
it back to our on the file scroll down

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.670 
it back to our on the file scroll down
it<00:05:08.010> will<00:05:08.250> move<00:05:08.400> in<00:05:08.610> straight<00:05:08.850> away<00:05:09.470> now<00:05:10.470> what

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
it will move in straight away now what

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.320 
it will move in straight away now what
we<00:05:10.800> need<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:11.010> do<00:05:13.010> has<00:05:14.010> before<00:05:14.430> lower<00:05:15.150> the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
we need to do has before lower the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.510 
we need to do has before lower the
opacity<00:05:15.390> on<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.900> top<00:05:16.080> layer<00:05:16.290> drag<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:17.070> over<00:05:17.160> to

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
opacity on the top layer drag it over to

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.730 
opacity on the top layer drag it over to
the<00:05:17.610> bottom<00:05:17.910> layer<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.510> that<00:05:19.290> was<00:05:19.410> just<00:05:19.560> a

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
the bottom layer and that was just a

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.780 
the bottom layer and that was just a
little<00:05:20.160> bit<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:21.170> lining<00:05:22.170> off<00:05:22.320> bit<00:05:22.980> time<00:05:23.310> but

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
little bit of lining off bit time but

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.000 
little bit of lining off bit time but
again<00:05:24.210> I'm<00:05:24.420> going<00:05:24.600> to<00:05:24.660> be<00:05:24.780> doing<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.110> quickly

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.210

turn your top light on and off we're

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.130 
turn your top light on and off we're
good<00:05:32.460> in<00:05:32.490> that<00:05:32.700> position<00:05:32.910> we've<00:05:33.570> got<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.750> gun<00:05:33.990> in

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
good in that position we've got a gun in

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.040 
good in that position we've got a gun in
that<00:05:34.260> position<00:05:34.760> doesn't<00:05:35.760> matter<00:05:36.060> up

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.790 

of<00:05:40.770> a<00:05:40.800> little<00:05:41.129> fiddle<00:05:42.020> it's<00:05:43.020> only<00:05:43.289> a<00:05:43.470> slight

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
of a little fiddle it's only a slight

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.210 
of a little fiddle it's only a slight
bit<00:05:44.069> out

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.750 

so<00:05:49.910> you<00:05:50.300> need<00:05:50.480> to<00:05:50.600> roughly<00:05:51.110> do<00:05:51.350> it<00:05:51.440> again<00:05:51.760> where

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
so you need to roughly do it again where

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.850 
so you need to roughly do it again where
the<00:05:52.910> top<00:05:53.150> is<00:05:53.180> again<00:05:53.900> you<00:05:54.110> can<00:05:54.260> see<00:05:54.470> it's<00:05:54.620> one

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
the top is again you can see it's one

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.640 
the top is again you can see it's one
clip<00:05:55.160> one<00:05:55.580> frame<00:05:55.880> next<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.450> nothing<00:05:56.840> so<00:05:57.470> let's

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
clip one frame next to nothing so let's

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.350 
clip one frame next to nothing so let's
just<00:05:57.740> split<00:05:58.130> that<00:05:58.340> there<00:05:58.610> for<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:58.940> benefit<00:05:59.330> of

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
just split that there for the benefit of

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.860 
just split that there for the benefit of
the<00:05:59.420> tape<00:06:00.490> split<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.610> top<00:06:01.850> play<00:06:02.030> it<00:06:04.870> again

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
the tape split the top play it again

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:21.930 
the tape split the top play it again
