when<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.060> set<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.310> Skeletron

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
when I look to set up this Skeletron

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.570 
when I look to set up this Skeletron
prime<00:00:26.340> trap<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.390> thought<00:00:27.960> about<00:00:28.279> just<00:00:29.279> put<00:00:29.490> my

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
prime trap I thought about just put my

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.320 
prime trap I thought about just put my
ice<00:00:29.760> boots<00:00:30.000> on

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
ice boots on

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.380 
ice boots on
I<00:00:30.359> thought<00:00:31.109> about<00:00:31.380> I'll<00:00:31.800> destroy<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> trap

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
I thought about I'll destroy a trap

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.870 
I thought about I'll destroy a trap
and<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:34.200> knew<00:00:34.440> I'd<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> enclose<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.850> area

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and I knew I'd have to enclose the area

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.600 
and I knew I'd have to enclose the area
because<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> Skeletron<00:00:37.260> prime<00:00:37.290> tends<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.370> fly

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
because the Skeletron prime tends to fly

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.150 
because the Skeletron prime tends to fly
around<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.000> bit<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.320> some<00:00:40.590> source<00:00:41.010> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
around a bit when there's some source of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.350 
around a bit when there's some source of
-<00:00:41.489> beautiful

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
- beautiful

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
- beautiful
ARF<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.500> might<00:00:43.770> might<00:00:44.430> comes<00:00:44.730> from

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
ARF right not might might comes from

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.830 
ARF right not might might comes from
destroyer<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.550> I've<00:00:47.700> done<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.000> taken<00:00:48.719> our

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
destroyer so all I've done is taken our

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.709 
destroyer so all I've done is taken our
old<00:00:49.079> arena<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.860> enclose<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
old arena and enclose it a bit that you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.319 
old arena and enclose it a bit that you
can<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:51.989> from<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> map<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.910> spiky

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
can see from the map here so the spiky

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
can see from the map here so the spiky
balls<00:00:54.539> bounce<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.140> higher<00:00:55.410> which<00:00:55.710> means

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
balls bounce a bit higher which means

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
balls bounce a bit higher which means
you<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.280> hits<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.090> appendages<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you get more hits on the appendages of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.560 
you get more hits on the appendages of
Skeletron<00:00:58.500> prime<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> we've<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> same

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
Skeletron prime so we've got the same

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
Skeletron prime so we've got the same
wire<00:01:01.469> system<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> destroyer<00:01:02.730> which<00:01:03.030> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
wire system for the destroyer which is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
wire system for the destroyer which is
dropping<00:01:03.539> spiky<00:01:03.840> balls<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:05.460> I've<00:01:05.700> added

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
dropping spiky balls and all I've added

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.030 
dropping spiky balls and all I've added
because<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> spends<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> time<00:01:07.650> flying

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
because it spends a bit of time flying

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.390 
because it spends a bit of time flying
higher<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.970> we've<00:01:09.689> got<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> few<00:01:10.110> rows<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.770> spear

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
higher is we've got a few rows of spear

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880 
higher is we've got a few rows of spear
traps<00:01:11.729> now<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.200> I've<00:01:13.320> run<00:01:13.500> short

lava<00:02:00.490> underneath<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.360> whole<00:02:01.540> trap<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:03.130> get

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
lava underneath the whole trap and get

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.900 
lava underneath the whole trap and get
hit<00:02:03.610> by<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.869> basically<00:02:05.350> any<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:06.430> know<00:02:06.580> weak

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
hit by it so basically any you know weak

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.870 
hit by it so basically any you know weak
monsters<00:02:07.630> like<00:02:07.840> slimes<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.100> zombies<00:02:09.520> will

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
monsters like slimes and zombies will

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.050 
monsters like slimes and zombies will
die<00:02:10.709> before<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:12.040> start<00:02:12.310> fighting<00:02:12.670> Skeletron

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
die before you start fighting Skeletron

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.720 
die before you start fighting Skeletron
prime<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.830> we're<00:02:15.130> turning<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.910> chat<00:02:16.150> back<00:02:16.360> on

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
prime so we're turning the chat back on

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.940 
prime so we're turning the chat back on
killing<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.790> few<00:02:18.970> slimes<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.900> get<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.260> rank<00:02:20.590> of

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
killing a few slimes to get the rank of

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.330 
killing a few slimes to get the rank of
the<00:02:21.340> slimes<00:02:21.640> up<00:02:22.680> there's<00:02:23.680> no<00:02:23.860> documentation

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the slimes up there's no documentation

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.480 
the slimes up there's no documentation
of<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.000> anywhere<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.260> works<00:02:26.500> as<00:02:26.890> I've

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
of this anywhere but it works as I've

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.190 
of this anywhere but it works as I've
said<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.790> all<00:02:27.910> my<00:02:28.030> videos<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.660> don't<00:02:28.720> know<00:02:28.930> how

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
said in all my videos I don't know how

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.910 
said in all my videos I don't know how
it<00:02:29.380> works<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.850> works<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.380> kill<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> few

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
it works but it works so kill a few

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.310 
it works but it works so kill a few
slimes<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:36.370> means<00:02:36.810> after<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:38.110> while

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
slimes and that means after a while

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.500 
slimes and that means after a while
you've<00:02:38.590> got<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.800> high<00:02:39.160> rank<00:02:39.430> slime<00:02:39.820> hitting<00:02:40.330> you

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
you've got a high rank slime hitting you

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.540 
you've got a high rank slime hitting you
which<00:02:40.930> means<00:02:41.170> Skeletron<00:02:41.680> prime<00:02:41.709> can't<00:02:42.370> get<00:02:42.519> a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
which means Skeletron prime can't get a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.720 
which means Skeletron prime can't get a
hit<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.880> ah<00:02:44.190> with<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.370> trap<00:02:45.580> especially

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
hit in ah with this trap especially

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.570 
hit in ah with this trap especially
listening<00:02:46.540> out<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:46.690> mobs<00:02:47.140> getting<00:02:47.400> dying<00:02:48.400> in

listening out for mobs getting dying in

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
listening out for mobs getting dying in
the<00:02:48.640> lava<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:53.230> want<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.530> where<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:54.600> might

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
the lava and you want it where I might

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.229 
the lava and you want it where I might
summon<00:02:55.959> one<00:02:56.290> raven<00:02:56.739> down<00:02:57.010> there<00:02:57.310> now<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.120> not

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
summon one raven down there now it's not

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.289 
summon one raven down there now it's not
flying<00:02:58.510> after<00:02:58.840> anything<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.440> should<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.680> good

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
flying after anything we should be good

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.630 
flying after anything we should be good
okay<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.570> let's<00:03:01.720> summon<00:03:02.019> Skeletron<00:03:02.530> prime

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
okay and let's summon Skeletron prime

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.090 
okay and let's summon Skeletron prime
and<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:04.810> everything's<00:03:05.230> going<00:03:05.320> well<00:03:05.739> we

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
and if everything's going well we

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.720 
and if everything's going well we
shouldn't<00:03:06.930> shouldn't<00:03:07.930> take<00:03:08.680> any<00:03:08.950> damage<00:03:09.459> from

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
shouldn't shouldn't take any damage from

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.870 
shouldn't shouldn't take any damage from
Skeletron<00:03:10.480> prime

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.730 

now<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.950> chap<00:03:15.280> could<00:03:15.610> be<00:03:15.790> optimized<00:03:16.740> you

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
now this chap could be optimized you

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.260 
now this chap could be optimized you
could<00:03:17.950> have<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> lot<00:03:18.370> more<00:03:18.400> spear<00:03:18.850> traps

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
could have a lot more spear traps

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.590 
could have a lot more spear traps
hitting<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.720> middle<00:03:19.930> here<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:21.640> maximum<00:03:22.150> you

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
hitting the middle here the maximum you

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.440 
hitting the middle here the maximum you
can<00:03:22.720> stack<00:03:23.050> is<00:03:23.260> six<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:23.710> a<00:03:23.800> row

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
can stack is six in a row

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.420 
can stack is six in a row
so<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.540> could<00:03:25.870> get<00:03:26.140> most<00:03:26.530> damaging<00:03:27.160> on<00:03:27.280> his

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
so you could get most damaging on his

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.660 
so you could get most damaging on his
head<00:03:27.900> but<00:03:28.900> if<00:03:29.110> you're<00:03:29.290> farming<00:03:29.670> mechanical

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
head but if you're farming mechanical

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.640 
head but if you're farming mechanical
bosses<00:03:31.030> for<00:03:31.270> hallowed<00:03:31.630> bars<00:03:31.900> I'd<00:03:32.230> recommend

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
bosses for hallowed bars I'd recommend

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.450 
bosses for hallowed bars I'd recommend
the<00:03:32.740> destroyer<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.550> dies<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:34.600> much<00:03:34.810> quicker

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
the destroyer it dies so much quicker

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.250 
the destroyer it dies so much quicker
but<00:03:36.460> this<00:03:36.670> is<00:03:36.850> more<00:03:37.180> just<00:03:37.570> if<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.900> want<00:03:38.170> to

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
but this is more just if you want to

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.410 
but this is more just if you want to
farm<00:03:38.590> Skeletron<00:03:39.100> prime<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:40.120> know<00:03:40.150> you're

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
farm Skeletron prime you know you're

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.570 
farm Skeletron prime you know you're
getting<00:03:40.660> souls<00:03:40.990> of<00:03:41.290> fright<00:03:41.920> for<00:03:42.220> something

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
getting souls of fright for something

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.170 
getting souls of fright for something
then<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.330> is<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.600> way<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:43.990> it<00:03:44.550> okay<00:03:45.550> so<00:03:45.820> as

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
then this is the way to do it okay so as

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180 
then this is the way to do it okay so as
you<00:03:46.210> can<00:03:46.330> see<00:03:46.450> he<00:03:47.050> takes<00:03:47.710> a<00:03:47.800> lot<00:03:47.920> of<00:03:47.980> damage

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
you can see he takes a lot of damage

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.970 
you can see he takes a lot of damage
fairly<00:03:48.610> quickly<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.660> spiky<00:03:50.140> balls<00:03:50.350> get<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.650> lot

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
fairly quickly the spiky balls get a lot

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.460 
fairly quickly the spiky balls get a lot
of<00:03:51.100> hits<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:52.030> appendages<00:03:52.570> so<00:03:53.050> there's

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
of hits on the appendages so there's

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.300 
of hits on the appendages so there's
only<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.860> prime<00:03:54.250> saw<00:03:54.610> left<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.920> looks

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
only the prime saw left and it looks

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.160 
only the prime saw left and it looks
like<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.670> head<00:03:57.880> is<00:03:58.000> going<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.480> die<00:03:58.630> well

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
like the head is going to die well

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.550 
like the head is going to die well
before<00:03:59.650> the<00:04:00.520> our<00:04:00.910> last<00:04:01.270> appendage<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.350> prime

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
before the our last appendage the prime

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.120 
before the our last appendage the prime
saw<00:04:02.830> dies<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.840> this<00:04:05.020> is<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.200> super<00:04:05.500> quick<00:04:05.950> and

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
saw dies so this is a super quick and

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.090 
saw dies so this is a super quick and
easy<00:04:06.400> trap<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:07.710> just<00:04:08.710> want<00:04:08.860> to<00:04:08.920> take<00:04:09.010> this

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
easy trap I just want to take this

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.890 
easy trap I just want to take this
opportunity<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.610> say<00:04:09.880> tune<00:04:10.180> into<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.690> weekly

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
opportunity to say tune into the weekly

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.080 
opportunity to say tune into the weekly
why<00:04:11.140> this<00:04:11.470> week<00:04:11.680> I'm<00:04:11.980> going<00:04:12.520> to<00:04:12.670> show<00:04:12.820> you<00:04:12.910> how

why this week I'm going to show you how

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.020 
why this week I'm going to show you how
to<00:04:13.120> construct<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:14.110> cascading<00:04:14.920> bat<00:04:15.340> timer<00:04:15.670> and
