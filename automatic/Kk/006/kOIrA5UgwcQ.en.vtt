00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.150 
presented
interesting<00:04:23.270> problem<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:24.590> front<00:04:24.860> of<00:04:24.950> it<00:04:25.040> is

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
interesting problem the front of it is

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.280 
interesting problem the front of it is
not<00:04:25.310> exactly<00:04:25.730> flat<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.570> it's<00:04:26.870> not<00:04:26.990> exactly

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
not exactly flat and it's not exactly

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.600 
not exactly flat and it's not exactly
curved<00:04:27.680> so<00:04:27.920> neither<00:04:28.130> where<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.370> mounts

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
curved so neither where the mounts

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.360 
curved so neither where the mounts
really<00:04:28.910> worked<00:04:29.180> well<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.830> direct<00:04:31.130> center

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
really worked well in the direct center

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.460 
really worked well in the direct center
so<00:04:31.670> what<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.820> did<00:04:31.880> was<00:04:32.090> as<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:33.020> can<00:04:33.140> see<00:04:33.290> I<00:04:33.320> took

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
so what I did was as you can see I took

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.670 
so what I did was as you can see I took
the<00:04:34.420> curved<00:04:35.420> mount<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.080> I<00:04:36.140> mounted<00:04:36.590> it

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
the curved mount and I mounted it

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.650 
the curved mount and I mounted it
off-center<00:04:37.310> okay<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.360> then<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.480> needed

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
off-center okay and then I needed

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.120 
off-center okay and then I needed
something<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.020> put<00:04:39.260> it<00:04:39.350> back<00:04:39.530> towards<00:04:40.040> the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
something to put it back towards the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.070 
something to put it back towards the
center<00:04:40.250> at<00:04:40.490> best<00:04:40.670> they<00:04:40.790> can<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.300> here's<00:04:41.900> what

quickly let me show you what that looks

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.730 
quickly let me show you what that looks
like<00:05:16.730> on<00:05:17.000> there<00:05:17.210> my<00:05:18.250> Hero<00:05:19.250> 3<00:05:19.520> plus<00:05:19.820> is<00:05:19.850> now

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
like on there my Hero 3 plus is now

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.680 
like on there my Hero 3 plus is now
mounted<00:05:21.740> in<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.250> waterproof<00:05:22.640> case<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.240> by

mounted in the waterproof case and by
flipping<00:05:23.960> it<00:05:24.140> down<00:05:24.290> like<00:05:24.530> that<00:05:24.560> even<00:05:24.980> with

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
flipping it down like that even with

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.310 
flipping it down like that even with
gloves<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:25.640> can<00:05:25.820> turn<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.270> GP<00:05:26.690> 10<00:05:26.870> on<00:05:27.020> or<00:05:27.170> off

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
then quickly flip it up and by flipping

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.750 
then quickly flip it up and by flipping
it<00:05:32.060> up<00:05:32.440> it's<00:05:33.440> got<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.740> perfect<00:05:34.040> position<00:05:34.730> for

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
it up it's got the perfect position for

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.330 
it up it's got the perfect position for
riding<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.660> get<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.870> perfect<00:05:36.230> angle<00:05:36.350> there

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
riding to get the perfect angle there

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.280 
riding to get the perfect angle there
was<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.490> lot<00:05:37.670> more<00:05:37.700> adjustability<00:05:38.330> I<00:05:38.780> don't

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
was a lot more adjustability I don't

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.870 
was a lot more adjustability I don't
think<00:05:39.410> this<00:05:39.500> is<00:05:39.680> completely<00:05:39.860> now<00:05:40.520> saying<00:05:40.760> it's

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
think this is completely now saying it's

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.160 
think this is completely now saying it's
not<00:05:40.970> I<00:05:41.030> didn't<00:05:41.330> super<00:05:41.600> tighten<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:41.900> now<00:05:41.990> but

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
not I didn't super tighten it now but

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.960 
not I didn't super tighten it now but
you<00:05:42.230> can<00:05:42.380> still<00:05:42.590> adjust<00:05:42.680> it<00:05:43.010> you<00:05:43.280> know<00:05:43.370> left

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
you can still adjust it you know left

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.580 
you can still adjust it you know left
and<00:05:44.180> right<00:05:44.300> that's<00:05:44.540> actually<00:05:44.810> perfect<00:05:45.410> right

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
and right that's actually perfect right

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.610 
and right that's actually perfect right
now<00:05:46.150> but<00:05:47.150> it's<00:05:47.270> really<00:05:47.510> good<00:05:47.660> I<00:05:47.690> like<00:05:48.200> it<00:05:48.260> a<00:05:48.440> lot

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
now but it's really good I like it a lot

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.340 
now but it's really good I like it a lot
it's<00:05:49.310> super<00:05:49.760> strong<00:05:50.090> it's<00:05:50.720> really<00:05:51.170> not<00:05:51.290> that

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
it's super strong it's really not that

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.580 
it's super strong it's really not that
expensive<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:52.550> does<00:05:52.790> a<00:05:52.820> better<00:05:53.060> job<00:05:53.180> than<00:05:53.590> you

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
expensive it does a better job than you

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.050 
expensive it does a better job than you
know<00:05:54.710> putting<00:05:54.980> all<00:05:55.160> these<00:05:55.400> things<00:05:55.460> together

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
know putting all these things together

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.180 
know putting all these things together
it's<00:05:56.540> a<00:05:56.570> lot<00:05:56.780> cleaner<00:05:57.080> -<00:05:57.410> without<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.950> thumb

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
it's a lot cleaner - without the thumb

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.070 
it's a lot cleaner - without the thumb
screws<00:05:58.610> it<00:05:59.060> except<00:05:59.390> the<00:05:59.480> one<00:05:59.630> thumb<00:05:59.870> screw

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
screws it except the one thumb screw

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.910 
screws it except the one thumb screw
right<00:06:00.260> there<00:06:00.430> overall<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.550> really<00:06:01.910> liked<00:06:02.240> it<00:06:02.920> it

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
right there overall I really liked it it

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.330 
right there overall I really liked it it
offers<00:06:04.250> a<00:06:04.310> lot<00:06:04.730> of<00:06:05.140> adjustability<00:06:06.140> and<00:06:06.800> and

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
offers a lot of adjustability and and

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.000 
offers a lot of adjustability and and
custom<00:06:07.790> become<00:06:08.060> as<00:06:08.180> customization<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.140> I

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
custom become as customization and I

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.830 
custom become as customization and I
mean<00:06:10.160> I<00:06:10.250> can<00:06:10.370> even<00:06:10.460> have<00:06:10.700> if<00:06:11.150> I<00:06:11.300> really<00:06:11.630> wanted

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
mean I can even have if I really wanted

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.840 
mean I can even have if I really wanted
to<00:06:11.900> be<00:06:12.020> crazy<00:06:12.290> I<00:06:12.410> could<00:06:12.560> put<00:06:12.710> two<00:06:12.860> cameras<00:06:13.610> if<00:06:13.790> I

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
to be crazy I could put two cameras if I

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.320 
to be crazy I could put two cameras if I
had<00:06:14.030> them<00:06:14.210> one<00:06:15.170> there<00:06:15.380> and<00:06:15.470> one<00:06:15.530> there<00:06:15.700> but<00:06:16.700> I

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
had them one there and one there but I

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.270 
had them one there and one there but I
just<00:06:18.140> really<00:06:18.380> liked<00:06:18.560> it<00:06:18.710> and<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:19.070> good<00:06:19.130> thing

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
just really liked it and the good thing

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.320 
just really liked it and the good thing
about<00:06:19.310> it<00:06:19.460> is<00:06:19.520> that<00:06:19.640> once<00:06:19.820> you<00:06:19.910> find<00:06:20.150> something

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
about it is that once you find something

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.510 
about it is that once you find something
that<00:06:20.450> works<00:06:20.660> you<00:06:21.260> just<00:06:21.500> tighten<00:06:22.130> it<00:06:22.160> up<00:06:22.340> and

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
that works you just tighten it up and

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.160 
that works you just tighten it up and
you<00:06:22.580> never<00:06:22.850> touch<00:06:23.090> it<00:06:23.120> again<00:06:23.300> it<00:06:23.600> always<00:06:23.870> gives

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
you never touch it again it always gives

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.930 
you never touch it again it always gives
you<00:06:24.320> a<00:06:24.380> right<00:06:24.560> angle<00:06:24.890> and<00:06:25.040> if<00:06:25.490> you<00:06:25.580> have<00:06:25.670> a<00:06:25.730> like

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
you a right angle and if you have a like

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.730 
you a right angle and if you have a like
a<00:06:26.120> helmet<00:06:26.780> that's<00:06:26.900> very<00:06:27.140> difficult<00:06:27.590> to<00:06:27.650> get

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
a helmet that's very difficult to get

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.990 
a helmet that's very difficult to get
the<00:06:27.860> correct<00:06:28.130> angle<00:06:28.250> like<00:06:28.490> this<00:06:28.520> one<00:06:28.790> kind<00:06:28.970> of

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
the correct angle like this one kind of

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.190 
the correct angle like this one kind of
goes<00:06:29.150> in<00:06:29.390> it's<00:06:29.540> not<00:06:29.660> straight<00:06:29.960> on<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.170> sides

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
goes in it's not straight on the sides

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.950 
goes in it's not straight on the sides
you<00:06:30.650> can<00:06:31.250> probably<00:06:32.030> accommodate<00:06:32.479> any

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
you can probably accommodate any

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.270 
you can probably accommodate any
