so boring take the diamond to go we need

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.470 
so boring take the diamond to go we need
this<00:02:23.530> yes<00:02:24.530> look<00:02:25.459> guys<00:02:25.610> I've<00:02:25.760> got<00:02:25.910> two<00:02:26.060> stars<00:02:26.300> in

let's use the rock I should use the
branch<00:02:38.360> another<00:02:38.750> branch<00:02:39.430> okay<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.610> works

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
branch another branch okay that works

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.030 
branch another branch okay that works
that<00:02:41.269> works<00:02:41.330> that's<00:02:41.660> fine<00:02:41.989> three<00:02:42.530> stars<00:02:42.799> now

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
that works that's fine three stars now

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
bubble would work right little bubble

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.770 
bubble would work right little bubble
yeah<00:03:09.130> straight<00:03:10.130> up<00:03:10.160> under<00:03:11.120> keep<00:03:11.329> up<00:03:11.510> with<00:03:11.660> my

yeah straight up under keep up with my

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.840 
yeah straight up under keep up with my
bubble<00:03:12.140> here<00:03:12.350> there<00:03:13.070> we<00:03:13.160> go

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
bubble here there we go

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.220 
bubble here there we go
it<00:03:14.720> works<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.500> with<00:03:15.709> Pruit<00:03:15.920> tunnel<00:03:16.400> perfect

here<00:04:00.109> we<00:04:00.200> go<00:04:00.350> there<00:04:01.340> we<00:04:01.400> go<00:04:01.630> above<00:04:02.630> Oh

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
here we go there we go above Oh

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.199 
here we go there we go above Oh
oh<00:04:03.590> no<00:04:03.920> oh<00:04:04.160> no<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.370> knew<00:04:04.639> this<00:04:04.790> was<00:04:04.970> gonna<00:04:05.090> happen

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
oh no oh no I knew this was gonna happen

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.689 
oh no oh no I knew this was gonna happen
I<00:04:05.900> knew<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.440> was<00:04:06.590> gonna<00:04:06.799> happen<00:04:06.980> go<00:04:07.400> straight

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
I knew that was gonna happen go straight

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:11.199 
I knew that was gonna happen go straight
to<00:04:07.850> space<00:04:08.290> my<00:04:09.290> guess<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.799> use<00:04:10.010> these<00:04:10.220> surely

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
to space my guess is use these surely

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.610 
to space my guess is use these surely
going<00:04:11.359> above<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:11.900> better<00:04:12.139> right

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.100 
what a game I think there's more ways to
win<00:06:40.190> than<00:06:40.370> that<00:06:40.550> so<00:06:40.820> definitely<00:06:41.389> try<00:06:41.750> it<00:06:41.780> it's

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
win than that so definitely try it it's

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.600 
win than that so definitely try it it's
busting<00:06:42.560> in<00:06:42.680> it's<00:06:42.860> sneaking<00:06:43.220> in<00:06:43.340> and<00:06:43.490> then

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
busting in it's sneaking in and then

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.159 
busting in it's sneaking in and then
there's<00:06:43.790> more<00:06:44.000> branches<00:06:44.540> off<00:06:44.690> that<00:06:44.900> as<00:06:45.020> well

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
there's more branches off that as well

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.540 
there's more branches off that as well
so<00:06:45.290> definitely<00:06:45.410> go<00:06:45.710> check<00:06:45.950> it<00:06:46.070> out<00:06:46.130> if<00:06:46.460> you
