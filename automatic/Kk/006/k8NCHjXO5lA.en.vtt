00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.240
 hello, modest Flavors from the kitchen armful loves 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 In this section, we reach our beautiful city, Ankara 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
 and share the description of "Entekke Pie" 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.200
 But let's take a look at the list of materials before you want 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.360
 1 pack of quick yeast 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.840
 1 pc of sugar cubes 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.040
 1 tea cup of warm water 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.320
 1 tea cup warm milk 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.760
 1 piece of egg 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.040
 2 tablespoons yogurt 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.680
 and as much flour as possible 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.480
 for inside; 200 grams of ground meat 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.480
 3 tablespoons oil 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.840
 half bunch of parsley 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.280
 1 teaspoon black pepper 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.720
 and to fry; liquid oil 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 now we can go into the construction of entekke pastry 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.120
 first 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 add warm water 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 crush my fingertips 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.320
 milk, yogurt ... 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.880
 Adding 1 egg 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 and flutter 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.520
 now we add some salt 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.280
 we mix our quick yeast with a little flour 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:16.560
 and we begin to knead by adding flour to a medium hardness. 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.240
 we made a dough that wasn't as hard as you noticed 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.400
 Let's leave some flour now 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.440
 close 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.560
 and let it stand for at least 45 minutes in warm atmosphere 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.880
 Let's prepare this beautiful recipe of our beautiful Ankara 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.680
 plenty of parsley being used 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.680
 this is the most important feature of this pie 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.320
 let's start by chopping parsley 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 we can go next to the hearth 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.320
 we put the pan in the fire 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.800
 If you remember we had 3 tablespoons of oil, we add 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:23.000
 after a little warming we add 200 grams of ground beef 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.320
 and one by one, we're frying until we leave 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.680
 now a little salt ... 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.440
 and added 1 teaspoon of black pepper 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 let's mix some more 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.160
 and finally add parsley 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.480
 and let the fire shut and mix 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.480
 let us cool down 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 45 minutes later 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.200
 dough rested, drenched 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.200
 time to meet now 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.640
 It was a nice dough, let's say the bottom-top 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.400
 we will cut half a lemon from the dough and make it to the cloth 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 then I'm gonna give it a donut shape 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.880
 We have prepared the peas, now we are opening up the tea plate with fingertips 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.920
 we use our fingertips to be fluffy 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.240
 You know, the rolling pin or roller causes it to be more pincushed 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.560
 so much 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.760
 leave enough 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.760
 in the meantime we put our oil in the pan began to get angry 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.640
 pushing the edges 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.200
 if we want it to be uniform we cut it with the help of a roulette 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.360
 we continue to make other dough pieces in the same way 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.880
 now we can fry our entekke donuts 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.240
 warming 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.480
 our pies are very nice blush 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.480
 we are now taking our last pies 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.600
 No more service time 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.600
 let us transfer our pies to the serving plate 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.320
 Let's share with our loved ones with a tea or a nice buttermilk 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.360
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.920
 green Ankara and we shared the description of "Entekke Pie" 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.800
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.600
 Goodbye sir ...
