think on the ropes Mayweather could have

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.340 
think on the ropes Mayweather could have
difficulty<00:01:14.610> he<00:01:15.390> could<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.720> difficulty<00:01:16.320> with

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
difficulty he could have difficulty with

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.780 
difficulty he could have difficulty with
someone<00:01:16.770> that's<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> body

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
someone that's going to go to the body

someone that's going to go to the body
and<00:01:18.650> look<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.890> an<00:01:19.979> opening<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> head<00:01:21.210> um

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
and look for an opening to the head um

if<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.079> fight<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.890> fought<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> middle<00:02:05.640> of

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
if this fight is fought in the middle of

if this fight is fought in the middle of
the<00:02:05.759> Ring<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:06.930> we're<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.619> of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the Ring I don't think we're as much of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.390 
the Ring I don't think we're as much of
a<00:02:07.799> chance<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:09.300> row<00:02:09.509> needs<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.950> find<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.370> way

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
a chance I think row needs to find a way

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.880 
a chance I think row needs to find a way
to<00:02:11.580> smother<00:02:12.170> push<00:02:13.170> my

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to smother push my
