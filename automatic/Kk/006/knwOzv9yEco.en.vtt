assassins creed 4 I called this the Ezio

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.960 
assassins creed 4 I called this the Ezio
length<00:00:25.470> because<00:00:25.770> Ezio's<00:00:26.220> blaze<00:00:26.610> actually

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
length because Ezio's blaze actually

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.310 
length because Ezio's blaze actually
shorter<00:00:27.300> because<00:00:27.419> he<00:00:27.599> has<00:00:27.689> more<00:00:27.810> mechanics

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
shorter because he has more mechanics

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.159 
shorter because he has more mechanics
then<00:00:28.470> I'll<00:00:28.649> tie<00:00:28.829> your<00:00:29.009> did<00:00:29.250> altai<00:00:30.119> years<00:00:30.360> would

be<00:00:31.460> about<00:00:32.460> four<00:00:33.149> inches<00:00:33.390> longer<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
be about four inches longer so this is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.940 
be about four inches longer so this is
the<00:00:34.980> SEO<00:00:35.309> length<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:37.579> connor<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.559> ezio<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the SEO length the connor and ezio is

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.130 
the SEO length the connor and ezio is
the<00:00:41.040> same<00:00:41.219> length<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.420> edward<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the same length but the edward is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.979 
the same length but the edward is
actually<00:00:43.440> smaller<00:00:44.059> Edwards<00:00:45.059> actually<00:00:45.690> comes

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
actually smaller Edwards actually comes

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.250 
actually smaller Edwards actually comes
out<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:47.399> same<00:00:47.429> length<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.120> haitham<00:00:48.960> does

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
out the same length as haitham does

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.110 
out the same length as haitham does
which<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> fingertips

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
which is actually just to the fingertips

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.430 
which is actually just to the fingertips
this<00:00:51.269> will<00:00:51.390> come<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.600> past<00:00:51.929> the<00:00:52.019> fingertips

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
this will come out past the fingertips

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.939 
this will come out past the fingertips
quite<00:00:53.190> considerably<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.659> as<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.710> see

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
quite considerably so as you can see

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.239 
quite considerably so as you can see
comes<00:00:56.489> at<00:00:56.640> least<00:00:56.909> three<00:00:57.269> inches<00:00:57.390> past<00:00:58.249> Edwards

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
comes at least three inches past Edwards

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.369 
comes at least three inches past Edwards
and<00:00:59.609> hey<00:01:00.179> thumbs<00:01:00.480> come<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and hey thumbs come out to the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.020 
and hey thumbs come out to the
fingertips<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.429> about<00:01:02.609> three<00:01:02.909> inch

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
fingertips which is about three inch

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
blade ok now you see this is a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.140 
blade ok now you see this is a
replication<00:01:09.260> it's<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.380> spring<00:01:10.650> loaded<00:01:11.150> just

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
a fun little toy ok I'm a paint it to do

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.209 
a fun little toy ok I'm a paint it to do
that<00:01:20.540> that's<00:01:21.540> great<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:21.960> look<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.409> whatever

you do this be sure not to push this
past<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> locking<00:01:26.100> mechanism<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.549> locking

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
past the locking mechanism the locking

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.340 
past the locking mechanism the locking
mechanism<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.210> pretty<00:01:27.390> strong<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:30.289> be<00:01:31.289> sure

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
mechanism is pretty strong but be sure

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.100 
mechanism is pretty strong but be sure
you<00:01:31.530> don't<00:01:31.740> fly<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:31.950> too<00:01:32.159> hard<00:01:32.869> do<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> see

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you don't fly out too hard do you see

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.630 
you don't fly out too hard do you see
locking<00:01:34.710> mechanism<00:01:35.070> works

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.180 

like

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.800 

you<00:01:45.730> only<00:01:45.850> get<00:01:46.030> out<00:01:46.150> for<00:01:46.300> anything<00:01:46.450> until<00:01:46.750> you

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
you only get out for anything until you

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.920 
you only get out for anything until you
push<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:49.270> pretty<00:01:49.450> nice<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.750> Lights

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
push it that's pretty nice the Lights

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.820 
push it that's pretty nice the Lights
right<00:01:50.020> there<00:01:50.080> shine<00:01:50.620> that<00:01:50.800> shit<00:01:52.530> easy<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.710> do

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
right there shine that shit easy to do

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.390 
right there shine that shit easy to do
close<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.730> back<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.320> we'll<00:01:56.380> come<00:01:56.560> back<00:01:56.680> out<00:01:56.860> do

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
close it back so we'll come back out do

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.970 
close it back so we'll come back out do
is<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:58.800> rink<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.450> now<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.350> locking

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
is this rink is that now the locking

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.300 
is this rink is that now the locking
mechanism<00:02:03.010> is<00:02:03.550> on<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.760> bottom<00:02:03.970> here<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
mechanism is on the bottom here so you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.420 
mechanism is on the bottom here so you
