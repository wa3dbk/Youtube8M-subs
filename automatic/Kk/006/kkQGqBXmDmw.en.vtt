00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.120
 so to put their noses put the army 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.560
 we take the years but astride 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:20.150
 on it we first pass the big collar and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.230
 the little collar that will come around the neck 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.189
 so not that at the level of the head 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 we go back we have the best 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.960
 harnesses there that was a fund of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.829
 returns to first pass a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.890
 paste a second paste 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:42.989
 we just have the necklace here and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.789
 were weapons and that is asked is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.969
 see that the the line arrives until 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.329
 tail end and we attach here the army 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.780
 the sheikh to be able to shoot and it takes 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.780
 well any body 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.580
 withdraw the relay at the trial of the same 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.170
 way we remove a second pass leg 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.990
 and here we'll do a little trick 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.660
 we will return the collar for +1 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.420
 gets off more easily and you can 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.170
 also rotate and then voted the collar for that 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.690
 once again it gets off more 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.360
 easily because it's wider 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.270
 here on the side and that u6 have a 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.670
 head shape who is who and who is 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.410
 wider just on the side and so 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.490
 so that's going to take it off and we can 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.350
 do the same thing by the way 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.030
 I put off putting a little 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.520
 stuff too so if the dogs want 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.979
 not too much where are not comfortable what we 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.680
 can do it's not hesitate to do some 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.540
 kisses to encourage them to put the head 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.300
 in 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.640
 so that means we're going 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:03.580
 since the 2nd survive and here they have 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.580
 read but that's it
