00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
welcome back this is part three here's

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:34.840 
welcome back this is part three here's
the<00:00:05.160> sprocket<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.759> on<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:05.970> wheel

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.720 

by<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> way<00:00:36.470> this<00:00:37.470> bit<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.220> ineffective<00:00:40.730> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
by the way this bit was ineffective the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.860 
by the way this bit was ineffective the
completed<00:00:42.239> wheel<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> truck<00:00:50.870> it's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
completed wheel going on the truck it's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.420 
completed wheel going on the truck it's
hard<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> film<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.890> stuff<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.280> same

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
hard to film and do stuff at the same

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.990 
hard to film and do stuff at the same
time<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.410> idea<00:00:55.829> boom<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:59.000> okay

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
time you get the idea boom on there okay

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.319 
time you get the idea boom on there okay
so<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.390> wheels<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> good<00:01:03.090> look

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
so the wheels on and we have a good look

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.520 
so the wheels on and we have a good look
at<00:01:03.510> our<00:01:03.690> sprocket<00:01:04.460> next<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.520> our<00:01:05.610> engine<00:01:05.910> mount

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
at our sprocket next to our engine mount

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.410 
at our sprocket next to our engine mount
and<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.860> where<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.369> engine<00:01:08.940> needs<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> go

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and this is where the engine needs to go

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.570 
and this is where the engine needs to go
right<00:01:09.660> there

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.620 

trick<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.940> be<00:01:15.060> finding<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> right

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
trick is going to be finding the right

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.749 
trick is going to be finding the right
amount<00:01:15.929> of<00:01:15.990> tension<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> motor<00:01:16.800> and<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
amount of tension for the motor and the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.350 
amount of tension for the motor and the
right<00:01:17.940> distance<00:01:22.729> here's<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.789> quick<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.179> at

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
right distance here's a quick look at

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.230 
right distance here's a quick look at
the<00:01:25.970> basic<00:01:26.970> structure<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:28.580> rear<00:01:29.580> engine

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240

significant amount of metal that I bent

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.720 
significant amount of metal that I bent
to<00:03:41.030> get<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.510> right<00:03:41.689> place<00:03:42.579> one<00:03:43.579> of<00:03:43.639> the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
to get it to the right place one of the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.309 
to get it to the right place one of the
hardest<00:03:44.060> things<00:03:44.269> was<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.599> alignment<00:03:45.049> of<00:03:45.109> this

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
hardest things was the alignment of this

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.949 
hardest things was the alignment of this
right<00:03:45.650> here<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.420> lot<00:03:47.420> of<00:03:47.540> bending<00:03:47.810> and

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
right here a lot of bending and

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.420 
right here a lot of bending and
hammering<00:03:51.069> just<00:03:52.069> about<00:03:52.310> complete<00:03:54.189> it<00:03:55.189> looks

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
hammering just about complete it looks

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.289 
hammering just about complete it looks
like<00:03:55.639> this<00:03:55.909> thing<00:03:56.180> on<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.629> bottom<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:57.319> not<00:03:57.560> too

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299

deep<00:03:59.439> when<00:04:00.439> I<00:04:00.469> stand<00:04:00.799> on<00:04:00.919> it<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.129> does<00:04:01.370> have

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
deep when I stand on it it does have

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.839 
deep when I stand on it it does have
some<00:04:01.669> flex<00:04:02.500> like<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.620> talked<00:04:03.919> about<00:04:04.010> before<00:04:04.189> but

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
some flex like I talked about before but

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.300 
some flex like I talked about before but
it's<00:04:04.969> it<00:04:05.870> doesn't<00:04:06.169> seem<00:04:06.379> to<00:04:06.469> interfere<00:04:06.709> which

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
it's it doesn't seem to interfere which

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.580

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
is good so I'm gonna hook up the on/off

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.789 
is good so I'm gonna hook up the on/off
switch<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.669> throttle<00:04:11.209> switch<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:15.650> is

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
switch and the throttle switch this is

the<00:04:17.690> wall<00:04:17.840> like<00:04:18.019> this<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.759> I<00:04:19.759> cut<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:20.449> in<00:04:20.599> half

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.189 
and you can see this half right here and
I<00:04:24.530> cut<00:04:24.740> some<00:04:24.860> holes<00:04:25.130> in<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.729> put<00:04:25.940> the

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
I cut some holes in it and I put the

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.779 
I cut some holes in it and I put the
on/off<00:04:27.199> switch<00:04:27.229> I<00:04:27.590> mounted<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.009> and<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.550> and

the leftover hole where the where the
the<00:04:57.889> binding<00:04:58.280> was<00:04:59.349> go<00:05:00.820> just<00:05:01.820> like<00:05:01.970> that

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
the binding was go just like that

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.950 
the binding was go just like that
through<00:05:02.449> there<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.830> I'll<00:05:04.759> adjust<00:05:05.360> this<00:05:05.780> screw

through there and I'll adjust this screw

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.080 
through there and I'll adjust this screw
just<00:05:06.229> enough<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:07.219> poke<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.460> little<00:05:07.550> bit<00:05:07.849> of<00:05:07.969> the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
just enough to poke a little bit of the

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.270 
just enough to poke a little bit of the
threads<00:05:08.389> through<00:05:08.719> and<00:05:08.930> then<00:05:09.139> I'll<00:05:09.289> put

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
threads through and then I'll put

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.580 
threads through and then I'll put
another<00:05:10.479> nut<00:05:11.479> on<00:05:11.630> top<00:05:11.659> of<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.199> that'll<00:05:12.469> be

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
another nut on top of it and that'll be

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.640 
another nut on top of it and that'll be
a<00:05:12.620> nice<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.610> this<00:05:13.729> would<00:05:13.849> be<00:05:13.940> a<00:05:13.969> nice<00:05:14.380> lever<00:05:15.380> to

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
a nice and this would be a nice lever to

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.089 
a nice and this would be a nice lever to
or<00:05:16.009> you<00:05:16.340> know<00:05:16.430> don't<00:05:16.849> need<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.030> attach<00:05:17.300> these

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
or you know don't need to attach these
