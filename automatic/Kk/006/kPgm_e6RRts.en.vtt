00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
it's got the normal unlock screen so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.229 
it's got the normal unlock screen so
we've<00:00:53.570> unlocked<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.350> this<00:00:55.340> is<00:00:55.520> running<00:00:55.910> Froyo

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
2.2 so it's androids latest operating

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.729 
2.2 so it's androids latest operating
system<00:00:59.150> although<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.870> newer<00:01:00.019> system<00:01:00.530> should

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
system although the newer system should

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:01.570 
system although the newer system should
be<00:01:00.769> coming<00:01:01.070> out<00:01:01.100> soon

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
be coming out soon

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.240 
be coming out soon
this<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.180> not<00:01:02.360> yet<00:01:02.570> optimized<00:01:03.140> for<00:01:03.589> tablets<00:01:03.860> so

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
this is not yet optimized for tablets so

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.620 
this is not yet optimized for tablets so
it<00:01:04.370> does<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.550> pretty<00:01:04.730> good<00:01:04.820> job<00:01:04.940> even<00:01:05.510> though

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
it does a pretty good job even though

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.690 
it does a pretty good job even though
this<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:06.050> not<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.530> tablet<00:01:07.010> release<00:01:07.460> that

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
this is not the tablet release that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.730 
this is not the tablet release that
Google<00:01:08.060> has<00:01:08.210> said<00:01:08.480> will<00:01:09.200> be<00:01:09.230> coming<00:01:09.590> in<00:01:09.680> a

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
next release or probably the one after

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.490 
next release or probably the one after
that<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:16.490> said<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.330> run<00:01:17.540> such<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:17.960> device<00:01:18.290> like

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
that that said to run such a device like

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.470 
that that said to run such a device like
this<00:01:18.620> you<00:01:18.770> need<00:01:18.920> some<00:01:19.130> good<00:01:19.310> speed<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:19.940> this

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
this you need some good speed and this

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.620 
this you need some good speed and this
incorporates<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.440> one<00:01:21.650> gigahertz<00:01:22.570> cortex<00:01:23.570> a8

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
incorporates a one gigahertz cortex a8

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.060 
incorporates a one gigahertz cortex a8
hummingbird<00:01:26.630> processor<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.920> actually

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
hummingbird processor and it actually

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.190 
hummingbird processor and it actually
has<00:01:28.430> 512<00:01:29.120> for<00:01:29.390> RAM<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.750> help<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.170> along

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
has 512 for RAM to help that along

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.620 
has 512 for RAM to help that along
that's<00:01:31.040> actually<00:01:31.460> double<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.000> RAM<00:01:32.180> that<00:01:32.210> an

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
that's actually double the RAM that an

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.770 
that's actually double the RAM that an
iPad<00:01:32.990> has<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:33.470> give<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.710> an<00:01:33.800> idea<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:35.630> think

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
iPad has to give you an idea so I think

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.870

you'll<00:01:36.050> be<00:01:36.140> pretty<00:01:36.380> pleased<00:01:37.070> at<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> speed<00:01:37.670> of

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
you'll be pretty pleased at the speed of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.940 
you'll be pretty pleased at the speed of
of<00:01:38.060> which<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:38.870> operates<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.560> can<00:01:39.710> see<00:01:39.860> it

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
of which this operates you can see it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.340 
of which this operates you can see it
zipping<00:01:40.310> along<00:01:40.550> pretty<00:01:41.390> nicely<00:01:41.480> the

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
devices are lacking are the forward

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.629 
devices are lacking are the forward
facing<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.260> rear<00:03:21.590> facing<00:03:21.859> camera

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
facing and rear facing camera

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.149 
facing and rear facing camera
it's<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.060> 3.2<00:03:23.629> megapixel<00:03:23.780> camera<00:03:24.319> with<00:03:25.129> flash

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
it's a 3.2 megapixel camera with flash

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.379 
it's a 3.2 megapixel camera with flash
and<00:03:25.760> we<00:03:25.849> also<00:03:26.000> have<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.329> lower<00:03:26.629> resolution<00:03:28.389> 1.3

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
and we also have a lower resolution 1.3

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.479 
and we also have a lower resolution 1.3
megapixel<00:03:29.510> camera<00:03:30.290> up<00:03:30.439> front<00:03:30.889> now<00:03:31.370> there

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
megapixel camera up front now there

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.589 
megapixel camera up front now there
aren't<00:03:31.639> a<00:03:31.670> whole<00:03:31.700> lot<00:03:31.939> of<00:03:31.970> applications<00:03:32.540> that

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
aren't a whole lot of applications that

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.210 
aren't a whole lot of applications that
support<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:33.109> yet<00:03:33.409> but<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.739> think<00:03:33.859> there'll<00:03:34.189> be

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
support that yet but I think there'll be

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.330 
support that yet but I think there'll be
quite<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.489> few<00:03:34.730> along<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.150> way<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.950> if<00:03:36.950> someone

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
quite a few along the way and if someone

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.280 
quite a few along the way and if someone
else<00:03:37.430> has<00:03:37.730> an<00:03:38.060> Android<00:03:38.510> phone<00:03:38.569> with<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.959> forward

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
else has an Android phone with a forward

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.270 
else has an Android phone with a forward
facing<00:03:39.500> camera<00:03:40.120> such<00:03:41.120> as<00:03:41.150> those<00:03:41.540> on<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.780> sprint

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
facing camera such as those on a sprint

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.349 
facing camera such as those on a sprint
you'll<00:03:43.280> be<00:03:43.400> able<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.639> use<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.030> with<00:03:44.209> those

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
you'll be able to use that with those

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.860 
you'll be able to use that with those
people<00:03:44.660> if<00:03:44.930> they<00:03:45.049> have<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.410> application<00:03:46.870> the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
people if they have the application the

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.500 
people if they have the application the
top<00:03:48.440> includes<00:03:48.919> a<00:03:49.040> 3.5<00:03:49.579> millimeter<00:03:50.030> jack<00:03:50.120> and

top includes a 3.5 millimeter jack and

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.939 
top includes a 3.5 millimeter jack and
that's<00:03:50.569> great<00:03:50.870> for<00:03:51.109> listening<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.560> music

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
that's great for listening to music

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.610 
that's great for listening to music

video for that other than that that's

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.659 
video for that other than that that's
pretty<00:06:17.840> much<00:06:18.020> it<00:06:18.290> I<00:06:18.560> would<00:06:19.010> say<00:06:19.220> it's<00:06:19.340> a<00:06:19.430> great

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
pretty much it I would say it's a great

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.159 
pretty much it I would say it's a great
device<00:06:20.030> and<00:06:22.060> maybe<00:06:23.060> one<00:06:23.300> downside<00:06:23.840> on<00:06:23.900> the

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
device and maybe one downside on the

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.930 
device and maybe one downside on the
device<00:06:24.410> would<00:06:24.560> be<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.740> price<00:06:25.010> I'm<00:06:25.280> Verizon

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
device would be the price I'm Verizon

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.150 
device would be the price I'm Verizon
it's<00:06:26.090> $600<00:06:26.870> and<00:06:27.020> this<00:06:27.110> is<00:06:27.260> actually<00:06:27.620> a<00:06:27.650> Verizon

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
it's $600 and this is actually a Verizon

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.010 
it's $600 and this is actually a Verizon
device<00:06:28.490> I<00:06:28.700> know<00:06:29.060> it's<00:06:29.330> cheaper<00:06:29.690> on<00:06:29.780> others

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020

device I know it's cheaper on others
with<00:06:30.229> contract<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.280> overall<00:06:32.210> I<00:06:32.360> think<00:06:32.630> it's

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
with contract so overall I think it's

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.420 
with contract so overall I think it's
nice<00:06:32.990> but<00:06:33.290> like<00:06:33.560> I<00:06:33.680> said<00:06:33.890> it<00:06:34.040> may<00:06:34.130> be<00:06:34.190> out<00:06:34.400> of

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
nice but like I said it may be out of

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.180 
nice but like I said it may be out of
your<00:06:34.550> price<00:06:34.790> range<00:06:34.940> for<00:06:35.390> that<00:06:35.750> reason<00:06:36.229> if<00:06:36.950> you

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
your price range for that reason if you

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.850 
your price range for that reason if you
want<00:06:37.400> an<00:06:37.520> alternative<00:06:38.030> to<00:06:38.479> an<00:06:38.570> iPad<00:06:38.960> or<00:06:39.200> you

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
want an alternative to an iPad or you

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.830 
want an alternative to an iPad or you
like<00:06:40.280> Android<00:06:40.729> in<00:06:40.850> general<00:06:41.180> this<00:06:41.300> is<00:06:41.450> a<00:06:41.479> great

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
like Android in general this is a great

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.290 
like Android in general this is a great
alternative<00:06:42.020> and<00:06:42.620> I<00:06:42.820> think<00:06:43.820> it's<00:06:44.000> really

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
alternative and I think it's really

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.540 
alternative and I think it's really
worth<00:06:44.540> looking<00:06:44.960> into<00:06:45.050> this<00:06:45.860> is<00:06:46.070> Aaron<00:06:46.370> I'll

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
worth looking into this is Aaron I'll

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.450 
worth looking into this is Aaron I'll
see<00:06:47.000> you<00:06:47.060> next<00:06:47.120> time
