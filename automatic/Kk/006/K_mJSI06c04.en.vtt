00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:05.769
 good to the new mind with you david de leÃ³n on this occasion let's move on 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.820
 to see what is a little about feeding 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.770
 which is also known elsewhere as piet operate 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.149
 this does not mean 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:18.240
 that we are going to propose a diet to lose weight but a diet 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.989
 of the people we have as a patient according to disease 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.980
 feeding 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.949
 let your food be your medicine 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.090
 and that your medicine is acting as a doctor 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.030
 a phrase 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.399
 but very famous 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.160
 d shortly after 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 and it really is very, very true 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.749
 undoubtedly 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.749
 the neglect of our food 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.860
 has been 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.780
 the biggest cause of diseases worldwide 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.340
 the amounts of deaths 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.000
 because of heart problems 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.360
 of cancer 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.789
 of diabetes and other deadly diseases would be much less 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.070
 if we had a feeding 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.070
 Valencia 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.010
 countries 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.180
 where there are more fast food restaurants 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.009
 in 2d adn major cases of these 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.420
 above mentioned diseases 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.930
 and the countries 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.030
 where there is less consumption of fast food 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.030
 where there is more time 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.510
 this is not a 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.499
 consider yes no 1 result of the feeding class 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.270
 which each person chooses 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.120
 every 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.120
 culture 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.180
 the correct feed 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.180
 not only consists of eating healthy things 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.750
 if not also know how to make the correct coordinations 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.079
 since both the vegetables fruits grains and seeds that are healthy foods are 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.229
 divided into different groups and can not be combined 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.460
 certain 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.460
 group classes 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.549
 let's look at a relationship that supports a proper diet 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.789
 when the first point I can not drink pure water 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.789
 john the meal times 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:55.689
 wait so minutes before eye one may after each meal time 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.479
 if the person manages to endure two hours after cathetus food would be better 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:07.339
 aside we also want refreshments like lemonade at 8 o'clock and even if all this 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.479
 that are of lives 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:14.139
 that most people live with food however these also 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.599
 those that help in digestion but quite the opposite 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.290
 Ideally, we would like people to have three times of 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.049
 food 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.279
 without drinks 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:29.529
 I know that this is quite difficult and it can be done little by little yum 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.200
 decreasing the dra 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.699
 amounts 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.440
 so it will get used to 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.109
 by not needing 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.909
 this liquid 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.010
 a good observation and that is when people start their food 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.609
 start 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.069
 depending on whether it is breakfast on the side of the fruit of the lunch 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.069
 they were going to eat a salad they start they put room 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.629
 start with the food that is curl 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.579
 whether in the fruit the vegetable in his case failed us to scratch 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.479
 to edit 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.279
 drink liquid 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:08.639
 the people who are used to a lot of liquid in the 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.329
 foods 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.400
 will benefit from this 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.489
 simple advice 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.139
 since you start 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.590
 with the meals that are raw we lacked a tarasca to eliminate that craving that 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.620
 need 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.450
 what to take 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.169
 li 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.910
 if we start on the other side for the soup for a pasty meal the kitchen 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.689
 surely our organism 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.919
 they will ask for liquid quickly 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.919
 but to get used to it you have to reduce the amount and start with the 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.229
 meals that are 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.360
 cross 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.360
 of preferences and a person 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.659
 the mitch and a person to 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:52.259
 to drink pure water and another is going to take an alms so to speak we have insurance 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.049
 the one who is going to drink pure water while doing more damage to his body 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.800
 because if the saving can be an act in the first place because the water a pure 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.620
 2 fashion all digestive fluids 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.380
 However, almsgiving is also done, but for taking days a little 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.759
 of the suterm little the world will realize 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.389
 in entity 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.800
 but neither of the two forms 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.879
 life 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.879
 consume before or after it is qom time 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.020
 cc oo little more 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.750
 I have lost everything on the basis of the rural entity 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.969
 know some 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.680
 pearl is 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.830
 inside and other than that of encouragement
