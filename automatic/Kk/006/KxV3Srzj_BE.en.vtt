00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 like it's okay it's jean calvin what are you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.620
 had me by kbc cost to say bah I 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.030
 already knew on the ground cabat I close the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.469
 trawler gaming so it's a chain 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.780
 community that I created for the purpose 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.190
 to help others youtuber etc 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 I thought I would have a lot of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 time to go for making good 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.340
 stuff on it and that's the end of it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.330
 reveals to be completely wrong and not 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.730
 the time to watch all the videos 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.420
 I have no time to analyze 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.670
 precise choices and so so suddenly 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 here I close this scene because 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.020
 rather than knowing me instead of me 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.770
 take the lead with something like that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.000
 I have other sources that happens so the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.070
 first reason is the time the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.180
 second reason is that despite 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 all the posts I may have you 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.960
 not so explained it's a string 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.160
 Community a chain 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.000
 it is to help the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 small tumors 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.289
 so the project was not to have any 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500
 videos with music effects 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.539
 specials everywhere from super guy advancing the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.879
 project was to help guys who 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.789
 starts like me when I started there 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.530
 almost two years now with my 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.450
 camera for huge have rotten but 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 it's rotten and then that's it if you 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.830
 leave no opportunity for the little ones 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.290
 little idea to grow it will happen 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.200
 never agree anything the problem it's 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.420
 that suddenly when sometimes when I put 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.640
 10 guys in front bah yeah draws and the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 little young people he makes youtube there 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.729
 is too young 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.740
 amex and the project is a beginner there 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.270
 is too young but you have to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.500
 start a day but hey it's not 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.960
 so serious because people 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.020
 are expecting too much ultratop content 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.579
 quality on the low gaming canvas and that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 despite everything I can look at 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.049
 videos of these games me there are some stuff 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.970
 that make me laugh and it's filmed with a 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.759
 rotten camera but after people it does not 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.380
 not go in the criteria so here is so 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.020
 So I decided to go from 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 time on I already had no 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.640
 much I have not at all 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.890
 knowing that in addition my videos on the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.049
 chain jean kevin so it's constantly 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.869
 to improve them at the scenario level 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.100
 mounting etc 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.799
 this is also taking me more and more 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 of time in summary we are when 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.979
 even 3 work on this chain ya marrow 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.259
 so I do everything that is 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.670
 chewed aaa it's me 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.489
 there is dylan who does all the editing 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.739
 videos of the valves that work hard for 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.189
 that and there is mister x who does the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.110
 music 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.269
 so do not forget that there is when 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.650
 even there is still a job one is 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.239
 we are not very proud of 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.159
 daisies guys so she has it true 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.010
 games inc it was a bit too good 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.200
 news they tell us is that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.569
 the common cx sent me a message there 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.349
 told me he would perhaps it is 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.989
 very little to green his music channel 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.299
 to introduce this music here 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.549
 it's his patience and music and was 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.049
 so I think there are some who are going to be 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.340
 quite happy if little cocktail 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.530
 so little courgain it's really a 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.700
 little hangover it even concerns 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.470
 not 90 90 % of people who watch the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.480
 videos you can leave but otherwise the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.340
 guys on facebook there are some who 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.620
 send me messages by insulting me 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.180
 getting excited his anything so 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.069
 know that to make you hear 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.780
 insults with me it does not work 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.060
 everything just because I'm 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.190
 immunized by dint of doing trolls I 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.190
 make me insult all day so 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.900
 now when we insult that same 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.790
 maybe less impact than if you 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.699
 say that the color of my t-shirt and 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.989
 a little too pale so you see 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.480
 blow if you really want to do yourself 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.319
 hear 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.829
 if you really want to spend a 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.810
 message 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.370
 avoid insults me when I you 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.780
 say things I do not insult you so 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.569
 if you are on my page and you 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.069
 like pretty much but video thank you for not 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.129
 not to say stuff like that 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.540
 like marion sir there so I 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.370
 until announcing the closure of 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.319
 gaming timeline is right now 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.019
 but what were you excited about ? 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.120
 yeah yeah you shut up everything is a scammer 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.650
 your military service it is rotten of 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.599
 maple me I do not understand the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.579
 messages like that because I have on my 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.209
 facebook page is a minimum that you 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.069
 love my videos 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.349
 here you tell me that by and large but video 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.489
 do not like them and the old games atr 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.389
 awesome so everyone says that 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.519
 i was sooooo 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.069
 so this is it really 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.139
 weird and after to call me scammers 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.120
 it was a guy it's really not nice 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.440
 I tell you live if I had possibility 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.530
 to block my videos for easter you the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.820
 look it would do it there are no worries 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.829
 what I do not see why me 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.940
 do not work do not do I do not want 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.500
 to make people laugh that want me 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.810
 to rot 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.400
 you want to hurt me you see it's 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.320
 true that when we are more or less 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.090
 immunized art a screen when we get 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.560
 take insults but good when it's 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.210
 for free and that it is people who 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.730
 claim to love your videos 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.530
 insult you like that here it's not me 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.690
 for example I'm a fan of a lot of 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.430
 youtube hours on jean fan ever I 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.980
 would allow me to go to go the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.390
 insult because such album is not 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.360
 out quickly enough or such structure 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.440
 farm in short it does not matter after you 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.330
 do what you want do not take me 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.590
 will amaze you if I block for them 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.820
 people who say anything good 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.340
 and here is the little shot of 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.390
 negative mouth otherwise maybe we 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.760
 would do a college 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.770
 a faq for bat for happy people 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.570
 in time to each fishing 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.210
 no but it is charged 100 miles this is 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.960
 true that I did not do it so why 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.390
 not during 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.970
 why not this summer so if that you 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.350
 heats say the year comment the job 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.450
 Green thumbs under someone saying 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.330
 yes it warms me if it suffers you max 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.570
 and then and then we'll see on facebook 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.190

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.229

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.630
 pleasures and otherwise m guys like me 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.760
 I always decided despite everything 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.380
 true that it costs me 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.940
 always decided to be super gets away 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.200
 so if you have questions that 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.690
