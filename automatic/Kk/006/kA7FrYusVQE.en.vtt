00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
the resonance okay just on the make sure

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.340

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
you see design and then you drop it that

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:58.350 
you see design and then you drop it that
is<00:05:48.150> okay<00:05:53.430> nothing<00:05:54.430> as<00:05:54.580> many<00:05:54.970> clothes<00:05:55.390> I<00:05:57.360> think
