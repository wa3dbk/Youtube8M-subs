can<00:01:50.649> see<00:01:50.829> there<00:01:51.039> it<00:01:51.759> gives<00:01:52.029> it<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.239> decent<00:01:52.689> sound

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
can see there it gives it a decent sound

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.669 
can see there it gives it a decent sound
before<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.859> sounded<00:01:54.369> like<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:55.929> toy<00:01:56.229> it<00:01:56.590> was

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
before it sounded like like a toy it was

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.199 
before it sounded like like a toy it was
weirdly<00:01:56.950> silent<00:01:57.219> but<00:01:57.909> now<00:01:58.029> it<00:01:58.179> actually

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
weirdly silent but now it actually

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.019 
weirdly silent but now it actually
sounds<00:01:58.869> like<00:01:58.929> a<00:01:59.609> motorcycle<00:02:00.609> I<00:02:00.669> don't<00:02:00.729> know

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:01.029 
sounds like a motorcycle I don't know

you'll<00:03:09.930> see<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.380> front<00:03:10.860> fender<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.400> not<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
you'll see the front fender is not the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.400 
you'll see the front fender is not the
humongous<00:03:12.120> one<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.720> comes<00:03:12.930> back<00:03:13.110> with<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
humongous one that comes back with the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.550 
humongous one that comes back with the
bike<00:03:13.590> but<00:03:14.220> uh<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.060> supermoto<00:03:15.510> fender<00:03:16.050> it's

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
bike but uh it's a supermoto fender it's

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.320 
bike but uh it's a supermoto fender it's
a<00:03:16.590> little<00:03:16.950> more<00:03:17.280> difficult<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.760> put<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.090> than<00:03:18.240> I

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
a little more difficult to put on than I

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.420 
a little more difficult to put on than I
expected<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.990> be<00:03:19.080> because<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:20.070> fender

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
expected it to be because the fender

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.260 
expected it to be because the fender
ties<00:03:20.820> into<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.709> headlight<00:03:22.709> assembly<00:03:23.430> some<00:03:24.180> of

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
ties into the headlight assembly some of

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.240 
ties into the headlight assembly some of
the<00:03:24.360> cables<00:03:24.810> are<00:03:25.020> connected<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:26.190> a

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the cables are connected to it so it's a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.870 
the cables are connected to it so it's a
little<00:03:26.490> bit<00:03:26.640> more<00:03:27.209> work<00:03:27.870> than<00:03:28.050> I<00:03:28.170> expected

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
little bit more work than I expected

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.210 
little bit more work than I expected
