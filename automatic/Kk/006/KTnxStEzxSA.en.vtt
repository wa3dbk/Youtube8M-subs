00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.359 
of our vision for reimagining tomb
raider<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.719> paper<00:02:01.379> it<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.709> all<00:02:01.860> about<00:02:01.979> single

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
raider on paper it was all about single

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.889 
raider on paper it was all about single
player<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.060> started<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.420> build<00:02:03.750> that

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
player and as we started to build that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.899 
player and as we started to build that
world<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.379> we<00:02:04.500> had<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.739> island<00:02:05.069> we<00:02:05.189> had<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
world that we had the island we had the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.669 
world that we had the island we had the
Solari<00:02:06.239> and<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> scavengers<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.409> started<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
Solari and the scavengers we started to

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.589 
Solari and the scavengers we started to
realize<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.250> had<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.640> canvas<00:02:09.030> great

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
realize that we had this canvas great

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.479 
realize that we had this canvas great
warring<00:02:09.869> factions<00:02:10.289> great<00:02:10.500> landscapes<00:02:11.039> yeah

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
warring factions great landscapes yeah

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.009 
warring factions great landscapes yeah
had<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:11.910> these<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:12.359> awesome<00:02:12.480> places

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
had all these really awesome places

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.360 
had all these really awesome places
where<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.379> was<00:02:13.500> all<00:02:13.620> about<00:02:13.799> traversal<00:02:14.310> and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
where it was all about traversal and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.770 
where it was all about traversal and
single<00:02:14.730> player<00:02:14.910> we<00:02:15.209> start<00:02:15.420> looking<00:02:15.480> at<00:02:15.660> that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
single player we start looking at that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.920 
single player we start looking at that
we<00:02:15.840> thought<00:02:16.140> wow<00:02:16.920> what<00:02:17.340> about<00:02:17.519> multiplayer

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
we thought wow what about multiplayer

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.900 
we thought wow what about multiplayer
part<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.140> genesis<00:02:19.739> of<00:02:19.769> that<00:02:20.099> was<00:02:20.519> lark

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
part of the genesis of that was lark

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.849 
part of the genesis of that was lark
rocks<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.480> guardian<00:02:22.079> of<00:02:22.139> light<00:02:22.230> that

that whilst you're building a big

as a result of that that led to was

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.990 
as a result of that that led to was
thinking<00:02:54.390> about<00:02:54.540> multiplayer<00:02:55.970> hopefully<00:02:56.970> our

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
thinking about multiplayer hopefully our

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.070 
thinking about multiplayer hopefully our
single<00:02:57.390> player<00:02:57.540> experience<00:02:57.570> we're

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
single player experience we're

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.810 
single player experience we're
delivering<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> very<00:02:58.950> sort<00:02:59.790> of

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
delivering is a very sort of

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.570 
delivering is a very sort of
single-player<00:03:00.600> solitary<00:03:01.500> immersive<00:03:02.130> type<00:03:02.430> of

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
single-player solitary immersive type of

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.980 
single-player solitary immersive type of
experience<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.330> at<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.480> same<00:03:03.630> time<00:03:03.810> we

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
experience but at the same time we

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.930 
experience but at the same time we
believed<00:03:04.350> tomb<00:03:04.950> raiding<00:03:05.190> together<00:03:05.670> with

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
believed tomb raiding together with

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.300 
believed tomb raiding together with
friends<00:03:06.180> would<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.660> fun<00:03:07.010> generating<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.130> think

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
friends would be fun generating I think

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.440 
friends would be fun generating I think
that's<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.460> first<00:03:08.670> time<00:03:08.760> I've<00:03:08.880> ever<00:03:08.910> heard<00:03:09.240> that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
that's a first time I've ever heard that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.660 
that's a first time I've ever heard that
Tara<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.110> it's<00:03:10.470> fun<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.310> axe

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
Tara like that it's fun you know axe

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.430 
Tara like that it's fun you know axe
climbing<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.420> zip<00:03:12.600> lining<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
climbing and zip lining and the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.990 
climbing and zip lining and the
traversal<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.280> get<00:03:14.460> in<00:03:14.610> there<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.820> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
traversal that we get in there and the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.300 
traversal that we get in there and the
traps<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:15.660> me<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.900> was<00:03:15.990> very<00:03:16.110> sad<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:17.160> have

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
traps for me it was very sad to have

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.640 
traps for me it was very sad to have
that<00:03:17.490> catch-22<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.900> would<00:03:19.020> be<00:03:19.110> great<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.350> do

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
that catch-22 of it would be great to do

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.530 
that catch-22 of it would be great to do
this<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:19.950> multiplayer<00:03:20.370> but<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.330> can't

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
this in multiplayer but we just can't

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.210 
this in multiplayer but we just can't
split<00:03:21.900> our<00:03:22.020> resources<00:03:22.440> like<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.100> that's

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
split our resources like that and that's

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.890 
split our resources like that and that's
how<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.370> dis<00:03:23.610> Montreal<00:03:24.000> came<00:03:24.240> about<00:03:24.420> we<00:03:24.780> hit

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
how I dis Montreal came about we hit

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.420 
how I dis Montreal came about we hit
staffed<00:03:25.200> up<00:03:25.350> our<00:03:25.500> teams<00:03:25.740> develop<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.160> single

player<00:03:26.580> everybody<00:03:26.940> was<00:03:27.030> gelling<00:03:27.360> together

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
player everybody was gelling together

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.940
