00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:09.760
I notice that I don't show the back of my
hair.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.030
There is kind of like a part right here because...

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:32.759
Just some soaps at Vitacost so thank you for
suggesting Vitacost I saved a lot of money

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.760
and it was actually time for me to buy soaps.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.760
I like to buy in bulk.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.879
It was perfect and everything that I purchased
was on sale and it was a lot cheaper than

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.010
what I normally um get them for so I am happy.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.510
Get free shipping and the shipping was like
next day so that was nice, like if you buy

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.760
over a certain amount you get free shipping.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:02.449
Kiss My Face the shampoo and this is sulfate
free this is natural there are no parabens

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.880
no artificial fragrances or anything like
that in it.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:20.329
Five, um I just like to have to have things
stocked, I don't like running out of stuff

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:21.329
you know.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.991
I usually use oils and butters and stuff for
my skin but I also like to use lotion sometimes,

00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:26.991
I also like aloe vera.

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:27.991
I haven't been able to find this like in the
stores um I used to be able to find it but

00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:30.799
I don't know what happened so it was nice
I was able to find this one.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.579
I like the MyChelle products and this is a
sampler and I actually got two of them.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.600
I have purchased these before, like twice
before this box.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.740
I do have like some of the larger...the pamphlet
um it's really important to follow because

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.509
some of these products need to be rinsed off
and some of them you just need to be careful

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.369
with because there are like peels and even
although um, it's a really gentle peel you

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.810
don't see skin coming off but still um, there
are things that were instructions are very

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.850
necessary and there are some that seem like
a cream but it's not it needs to be rinsed

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.000
off so there's..anyway.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.120
So there's an information booklet and there
are all kinds of things in here everything

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.360
from like creams to little mists and moisturizers,
night cream, um, masks, different kinds of

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.349
cleansers so there's a lot of things in here.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.680
These were like thirteen, a little over thirteen
dollars per box.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.220
I used to get them for about that much at
a local health food store but then all of

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.650
the sudden like the price jumped up to like
nineteen dollars so I was just like forget

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.549
it you know.

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.720
Um but thirteen dollars I think is a pretty
good deal, they're some serums in here too

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.720
like hylauronic acid like.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.110
yeah, anyway lots off good facial and neck
stuff.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.804
The pine tar, the grandpa's pine tar it's
basically pine tar and it does smell like

00:02:57.804 --> 00:02:58.804
tar, it smells like pine tar it's got a strong
smell to it.

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:09.790
I notice some people flinch at the smell and
not really um think that it smells good.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.430
I think that it smells good I think ti smells
like exactly like what it is and uh.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.260
It's supposed to be good for like sensitive
skin..More of the grandpa's the oatmeal, and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.020
there's a chlorophyll and green tea and witch
hazel.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.750
So these were all like $1.91 I think they
were on sale and this one, actually I normally

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.430
buy a smaller bar than this it's in a smaller
box and it's like I think $4.00 now the price

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.664
has been going up, almost $4.00 and I got
this for like two and some change so that

00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:42.664
wasn't bad and MSM soap this is the other
one and this one is normally over $5.00 I

00:03:42.664 --> 00:03:52.719
hadn't purchased it yet but I am familiar
with MSM I am familiar with MSM in lotions

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.859
in creams and it feel amazing on skin.

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:06.390
My favorite honey on the site and this is
from Organic bee farms raw honey.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.250
The royal jelly is still in it and um hasn't
been processed hasn't been heated, it's very

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.319
thick, it's not liquid it's not clear it just
a real thick..it's really really nice, amazing

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.319
so.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:26.170
And honey um in case um some of you or whoever
is watching um honey should never be given

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:33.690
to infants, to small children um even if it's
raw or cooked no matter what it should not

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.790
be given to children because honey contains
botulinum spores and although adolescents

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:47.370
and adults can handle the tiny quantities
of botulinum spores that are in honey, um

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:55.240
infants cannot and um and they can..botulism
is one of the most toxic toxins known to man

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.510
and it is extremely poisonous.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:03.610
It's actually the same toxin that is diluted
like tremendously tremendously diluted and

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:15.910
it is used for Botox and it causes paralysis
of the muscles so it can be dangerous to an

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.760
infant that does not have a developed immune
system so honey should never be given to children.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.450
i really enjoy this honey it is really good
and I don't have to worry about it going bad

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.630
since honey apparently doesn't go bad.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.190
I know over time sometimes if the liquid,
the heated honey that's clear and liquid,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.690
sometimes it will crystallize and change form
but it's actually still good, I know for the

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.690
most part.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.870
I know not too long ago reading a report about
some honey that was found in Egypt and it

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.430
was actually like two thousands years old
or something it was really really old honey

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.430
and it was still good so um..

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.520
I bought some more of the Dr. Woods castile
and I actually the pure black soap this time

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.270
these are 32 oz and less than seven dollars
a bottle and I am used to paying ten, like

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.940
over ten dollars per bottle for it so it was
nice and I like to give these away as gifts

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.190
too sometimes so um I bought like four, four
bottles, just to make sure I bought enough

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.190
and I like to buy in bulk.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.350
Quickly and everything was packaged really
nicely and all the products are really good

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.530
and all sealed and placed very carefully and
bagged and everything.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.930
Yeah so that is what I ended up getting at
Vitacost and there are actually a lot of products

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.600
on there that I like and use and stuff so
I am really glad that i now have that resource

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:35.550
and that it was recommended so thanks again.
