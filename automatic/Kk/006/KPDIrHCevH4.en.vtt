00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.680
 abandonment and need I was so close to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.680

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.110
 plants so I became a healer I learned to 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.510
 value life nature gave him a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.670
 race to all my children there is a phrase 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.160
 by víctor frankl could summarize life 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.610
 that this wonderful healer is 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.280
 of oaxaca which is in spite of everything if to the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.180
 life with everything against an adverse world 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.100
 since childhood 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.170
 this woman found meaning in her life 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.880
 how many of us claudicate for 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.369
 much less to our dreams and in addition 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.190
 we complain about everything ask for 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.040
 I live who I am from where I come from and to 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.110
 where I go is the only way to find 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.020
 answers about what our mission is 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.610
 the world's attitude is the key for 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.440
 the general attitude we have before 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.450
 different situations we learned it in 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.390
 the childhood of our master dads or 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.250
 friends that attitude we can modify it 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.410
 with the stage in which we live life 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.420
 it makes sense in any circumstance 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.760
 this gives us a positive vision and help 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.980
 to overcome the challenges that we face 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.930
 present we can feel that sometimes not 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.150
 you have it if our dreams or desires do not 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.770
 are made then we must go to the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.440
 will of sense of our interior 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.840
 what motivates me to live maybe are my 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.700
 children life itself what I contribute this 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.740
 this allows us to develop 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.739
 capabilities and endure setbacks 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.810
 to retake goals if we do not find 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.790
 meaning to our life we ​​become 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.650
 easy prey of false promises of 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.959
 happiness that will take us to a void 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.750
 for example inside the obsession 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.760
 physical beauty for power or money 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.330
 this of course satisfies us of 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.910
 But time does not help to 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.010
 transcend and grow from the inside 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.780
 the search for meaning is to our 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.660
 more scope is not necessary to perform 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.580
 great works can be found at 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.590
