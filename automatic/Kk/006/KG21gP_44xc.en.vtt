you like dropped in a Galaxy or
something<00:01:42.439> this<00:01:43.439> means<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.100> spend<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
something this means that you spend a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.230 
something this means that you spend a
lot<00:01:44.549> less<00:01:44.790> time<00:01:46.100> worrying<00:01:47.100> about<00:01:47.369> clearing<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
lot less time worrying about clearing a

lot less time worrying about clearing a
point<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> lot<00:01:48.840> more<00:01:48.960> time<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.380> flanking

because<00:01:50.490> flanking<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> important<00:01:51.570> job<00:01:51.750> of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
because flanking is the important job of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.230 
because flanking is the important job of
light<00:01:52.079> assault<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.880> windows

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
light assault and it's not just windows

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480 
light assault and it's not just windows
like<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.110> useful<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:55.619> you

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
reason that this is such an advantage is

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.490 
reason that this is such an advantage is
because<00:03:56.180> people<00:03:56.209> will<00:03:56.720> not<00:03:56.900> expect<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.380> to

up<00:04:00.019> here<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.410> such<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.709> tactical<00:04:01.220> advantage<00:04:01.280> it

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
up here is such a tactical advantage it

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.630 
up here is such a tactical advantage it
is<00:04:02.060> absolutely<00:04:02.720> unreal<00:04:03.340> being<00:04:04.340> able<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.579> just

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
is absolutely unreal being able to just

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.030 
is absolutely unreal being able to just
