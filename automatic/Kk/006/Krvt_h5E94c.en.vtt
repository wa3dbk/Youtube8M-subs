providing<00:01:35.280> traction<00:01:35.759> power<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.630> can

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
providing traction power just so we can

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.190 
providing traction power just so we can
test<00:01:37.049> everything<00:01:40.100> PC<00:01:41.360> set<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> can

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
test everything PC set up here so I can

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.249 
test everything PC set up here so I can
basically<00:01:46.460> set<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.610> some<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.259> parameters

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
basically set up some of the parameters

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.179 
basically set up some of the parameters
on<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> controller<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.770> say<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
on the controller and I have to say this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.260 
on the controller and I have to say this
little<00:01:53.549> barrier<00:01:54.030> strip<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> great

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
there's our crappy 12-volt battery I

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.830 
there's our crappy 12-volt battery I
just<00:02:12.370> got<00:02:12.550> some<00:02:14.730> got<00:02:15.730> some<00:02:15.760> cable<00:02:16.390> hooked<00:02:16.600> in

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
just got some got some cable hooked in

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.250 
just got some got some cable hooked in
there<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.530> main<00:02:17.680> contactor<00:02:18.510> I'd<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:20.080> to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
there to the main contactor I'd like to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.700 
there to the main contactor I'd like to
become<00:02:20.550> older<00:02:21.870> boss<00:02:22.870> bars<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.410> there<00:02:23.590> probably

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
become older boss bars in there probably

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.110 
become older boss bars in there probably
can't<00:02:24.010> see<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.310> too<00:02:24.700> well

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
can't see that too well

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.370 
can't see that too well
so<00:02:25.660> okay<00:02:26.550> how<00:02:27.550> do<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.750> turn<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.960> thing<00:02:29.020> on

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
so okay how do you turn this thing on

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.070 
so okay how do you turn this thing on
well<00:02:30.270> first<00:02:31.270> thing<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.510> want<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:31.960> when

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
well first thing you want to do is when

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.510 
well first thing you want to do is when
I<00:02:32.140> turn<00:02:32.350> on<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.800> B<00:02:33.340> key<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:36.010> see<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:37.410> that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
I turn on the B key so we see is that

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.790 
I turn on the B key so we see is that
brings<00:02:39.520> on<00:02:39.700> our<00:02:40.920> LED<00:02:41.920> headlamp<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.620> brings

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
brings on our LED headlamp and it brings

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.570 
brings on our LED headlamp and it brings
on<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:47.730> two<00:02:48.730> tails<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.640> dash

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
on the two tails and on the dash

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.750 
on the two tails and on the dash
we've<00:02:54.580> got<00:02:54.730> our<00:02:56.460> main<00:02:57.460> beam<00:02:57.870> indicator<00:02:58.870> on

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
we've got our main beam indicator on

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.310 
we've got our main beam indicator on
that's<00:03:00.760> due<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.360> fact<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.050> Chinese

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
that's due to the fact that the Chinese

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.080 
that's due to the fact that the Chinese
LED<00:03:03.160> headlight<00:03:03.850> bulb<00:03:05.430> basically<00:03:06.430> sharks<00:03:06.880> out

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
LED headlight bulb basically sharks out

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.090 
LED headlight bulb basically sharks out
the<00:03:07.450> two<00:03:07.980> filament<00:03:08.980> pins<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.620> lamp<00:03:11.620> so

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
the two filament pins on the lamp so

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.550 
the two filament pins on the lamp so
it's<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.430> basically<00:03:12.670> back<00:03:13.630> feeding<00:03:14.140> into

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
it's just basically back feeding into

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.050 
it's just basically back feeding into
that<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.240> can<00:03:16.240> put<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:17.160> diode<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.520> there<00:03:18.730> that'll

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
that I can put a diode in there that'll

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.040 
that I can put a diode in there that'll
fix<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:20.050> anyway<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.720> would<00:03:22.900> be

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
fix that but anyway so this would be

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.500 
fix that but anyway so this would be
kind<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.710> similar<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.340> having<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.880> key<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.330> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
kind of similar to having the key in the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.990 
kind of similar to having the key in the
ACC<00:03:26.350> on<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.670> car<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:28.000> would<00:03:28.930> see<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.200> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
ACC on a car I would see that the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.200 
ACC on a car I would see that the
neutral<00:03:32.070> we<00:03:33.070> can't<00:03:33.280> see<00:03:33.490> it<00:03:33.580> too<00:03:33.760> well<00:03:33.790> but

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
neutral we can't see it too well but

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.230 
neutral we can't see it too well but
that's<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.600> bikes<00:03:36.150> neutral<00:03:37.440> indicator<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.970> on

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
that's the bikes neutral indicator is on

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.550 
that's the bikes neutral indicator is on
there<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:42.420> that's<00:03:43.420> basically<00:03:43.960> telling<00:03:44.320> us

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
there so that's basically telling us

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.730 
there so that's basically telling us
here<00:03:44.770> that<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.100> traction<00:03:45.550> systems<00:03:46.030> are

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
here that the traction systems are

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.070 
here that the traction systems are
powered<00:03:47.740> off<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.190> after<00:03:48.580> main<00:03:48.880> contactor<00:03:49.750> is

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
powered off and after main contactor is

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.880 
powered off and after main contactor is
in<00:03:50.290> fact<00:03:50.590> off<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:53.110> perfectly<00:03:53.620> safe

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
in fact off so that it's perfectly safe

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.150 
in fact off so that it's perfectly safe
you<00:03:54.190> can<00:03:54.370> twist<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.030> trot<00:03:55.300> or<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.870> can<00:03:56.160> play

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
you can twist the trot or you can play

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.500 
you can twist the trot or you can play
about<00:03:58.530> it's<00:03:59.530> perfectly<00:03:59.950> safe<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.490> do<00:04:01.180> solve

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
about it's perfectly safe to do solve

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.320 
about it's perfectly safe to do solve
the<00:04:01.750> attraction<00:04:02.230> citizens<00:04:02.620> can't<00:04:02.940> come<00:04:03.940> on<00:04:04.150> so

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
the attraction citizens can't come on so

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.020 
the attraction citizens can't come on so
we<00:04:07.330> then<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:08.080> actually<00:04:08.680> start<00:04:09.190> hope<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.880> want

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
we then to actually start hope you want

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.400 
we then to actually start hope you want
to<00:04:10.150> turn<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:11.970> switch<00:04:12.970> here<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:13.540> it's<00:04:14.260> going

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
to turn on the switch here so it's going

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.880 
to turn on the switch here so it's going
to<00:04:14.470> flick<00:04:14.709> that<00:04:14.920> on<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:17.229> we'll<00:04:17.410> hear<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.680> fan

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
to flick that on so we'll hear the fan

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
to flick that on so we'll hear the fan
start<00:04:18.370> off

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
start off

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.910 
start off
for<00:04:20.910> about<00:04:20.970> six<00:04:21.510> or<00:04:22.230> seven<00:04:22.590> seconds<00:04:24.710> we<00:04:25.710> hear

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
for about six or seven seconds we hear

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.250 
for about six or seven seconds we hear
the<00:04:26.070> tone<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.880> main<00:04:27.030> contact<00:04:27.600> are<00:04:27.900> coming

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
the tone of the main contact are coming

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.030 
the tone of the main contact are coming
in<00:04:28.410> we<00:04:29.400> see<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:30.210> neutral<00:04:31.050> indicator<00:04:31.590> has

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
in we see that the neutral indicator has

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.730 
in we see that the neutral indicator has
gone<00:04:32.550> out<00:04:33.230> so<00:04:34.230> this<00:04:34.530> basically<00:04:35.370> tells<00:04:35.490> us<00:04:36.740> that

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
gone out so this basically tells us that

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.770 
gone out so this basically tells us that
our<00:04:37.920> attraction<00:04:38.370> systems<00:04:38.880> are<00:04:39.030> now<00:04:39.210> hot<00:04:41.780> and

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
our attraction systems are now hot and

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:50.240 
our attraction systems are now hot and
if<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.230> twist<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.040> throttle<00:04:44.250> here<00:04:49.070> we've<00:04:50.070> got

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
if I twist the throttle here we've got

00:04:50.250 --> 00:05:06.540 
if I twist the throttle here we've got
power

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.690 

okay<00:05:07.550> now<00:05:08.170> most<00:05:09.170> motorcycles<00:05:10.930> don't<00:05:11.930> allow

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
okay now most motorcycles don't allow

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.320 
okay now most motorcycles don't allow
the<00:05:13.700> engine<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.890> start<00:05:15.890> when<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.580> kickstand

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
the engine to start when the kickstand

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:25.710 
the engine to start when the kickstand
here<00:05:18.170> is<00:05:18.850> down<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.890> I've<00:05:22.010> basically

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.590 

implemented<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.840> similar<00:05:27.110> strategy<00:05:27.950> here<00:05:28.600> so

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
implemented a similar strategy here so

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.490 
implemented a similar strategy here so
if<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.290> put<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.740> kickstand<00:05:31.280> down<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:32.810> just<00:05:33.080> focus

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
if I put the kickstand down I just focus

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.370 
if I put the kickstand down I just focus
on<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.680> -<00:05:34.250> what<00:05:34.550> I<00:05:34.580> actually<00:05:34.850> do<00:05:35.570> that<00:05:37.930> so<00:05:38.930> we

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
on the - what I actually do that so we

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.310 
on the - what I actually do that so we
heard<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.860> main<00:05:40.040> contactor<00:05:41.710> drop<00:05:42.710> Oh<00:05:44.200> see<00:05:45.200> do

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
heard the main contactor drop Oh see do

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.520 
heard the main contactor drop Oh see do
we<00:05:45.380> have<00:05:45.440> us<00:05:45.710> we<00:05:45.980> have<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.430> side<00:05:47.000> stand

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
we have us we have a side stand

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.760 
we have us we have a side stand
indicator<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:48.890> a<00:05:49.250> neutral<00:05:49.760> in<00:05:50.000> D<00:05:50.600> K<00:05:51.290> her<00:05:51.500> back

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
indicator and a neutral in D K her back

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.440 
indicator and a neutral in D K her back
on<00:05:52.040> and<00:05:52.340> our<00:05:53.120> traction<00:05:53.420> systems<00:05:54.020> are<00:05:54.650> dead<00:05:55.450> so

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
on and our traction systems are dead so

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
on and our traction systems are dead so
if<00:05:56.960> I<00:05:57.140> bring<00:05:57.380> the<00:05:57.530> cake<00:05:57.740> stand<00:05:57.980> back<00:05:58.550> up<00:06:02.470> like

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
if I bring the cake stand back up like

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:12.409 
if I bring the cake stand back up like
stop

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:22.360 

traction<00:06:13.050> systems<00:06:13.620> back<00:06:13.860> on<00:06:18.949> our<00:06:19.949> always<00:06:20.280> gold

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
traction systems back on our always gold

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.369 
traction systems back on our always gold
so<00:06:23.370> that's<00:06:23.610> just<00:06:24.270> a<00:06:24.449> little<00:06:24.599> update<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:27.379> basic

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:28.379 
so that's just a little update and basic

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:34.730 
so that's just a little update and basic
force<00:06:28.770> tests<00:06:29.719> and<00:06:30.719> so<00:06:31.500> far<00:06:31.830> so<00:06:32.219> good<00:06:33.530> so<00:06:34.530> the

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
force tests and so far so good so the

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.200 
force tests and so far so good so the
next<00:06:35.689> really<00:06:36.689> part<00:06:36.960> of<00:06:37.050> the<00:06:37.169> plan<00:06:38.000> would<00:06:39.000> be<00:06:39.180> to

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
next really part of the plan would be to

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.100 
next really part of the plan would be to
tidy<00:06:39.719> all<00:06:39.960> this<00:06:40.229> stuff<00:06:40.500> up<00:06:43.460> get<00:06:44.460> the<00:06:44.610> tach

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
tidy all this stuff up get the tach

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.379 
tidy all this stuff up get the tach
functioning<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.819> then<00:06:47.819> I<00:06:47.909> need<00:06:48.060> to<00:06:48.150> start

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389 
functioning and then I need to start

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:53.080 
functioning and then I need to start
having<00:06:48.779> a<00:06:48.870> look<00:06:48.990> at<00:06:49.909> batteries<00:06:50.909> and<00:06:51.360> charger

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
having a look at batteries and charger

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409 
piece of piece of bar similar to this

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.290 
piece of piece of bar similar to this
this<00:07:01.740> isn't<00:07:02.009> a<00:07:02.250> piece<00:07:02.490> but<00:07:02.729> have<00:07:02.849> a<00:07:02.879> piece<00:07:03.120> of
