00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
a little more fluent some of the most

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.490 
a little more fluent some of the most
risky<00:03:48.330> times<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.050> mounting<00:03:49.380> and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
risky times are the mounting and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.290 
risky times are the mounting and
dismounting<00:03:49.530> times<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.670> right<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
dismounting times so right the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.810 
dismounting times so right the
instructors<00:03:51.930> are<00:03:52.410> solely<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.400> ones<00:03:53.580> who

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
instructors are solely the ones who

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.390 
instructors are solely the ones who
mount<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.270> dismount<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.560> then<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:55.950> guide<00:03:56.220> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
mount and dismount and then I guide the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.000 
mount and dismount and then I guide the
class<00:03:56.990> some<00:03:57.990> of<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.170> classes<00:03:58.590> have<00:03:58.620> very

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
class some of the classes have very

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.070 
class some of the classes have very
diverse<00:03:59.370> population<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.270> them<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.840> side

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
diverse population in them so the side

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.990 
diverse population in them so the side
walkers<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.740> leaders<00:04:02.040> are<00:04:02.220> very<00:04:02.430> important

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
walkers and leaders are very important

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.520 
walkers and leaders are very important
because<00:04:03.180> they're<00:04:03.540> often<00:04:03.870> different<00:04:04.260> things

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
because they're often different things

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.160 
because they're often different things
that<00:04:04.800> each<00:04:04.980> rider<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:06.000> doing<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:06.840> try<00:04:07.110> and

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
that each rider is doing so we try and

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.460 
that each rider is doing so we try and
cue<00:04:07.530> sometimes<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.480> side<00:04:09.480> walkers<00:04:09.960> more<00:04:10.260> than

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
cue sometimes the side walkers more than

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.340 
cue sometimes the side walkers more than
the<00:04:10.560> riders<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.280> some<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.000> our<00:04:12.090> riders<00:04:12.510> won't

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
the riders and some of our riders won't

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.870 
the riders and some of our riders won't
really<00:04:13.590> here<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.100> process<00:04:14.670> information

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
really here and process information

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.090 
really here and process information
being<00:04:15.810> shouted<00:04:16.110> from<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.620> center<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:16.980> the

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
being shouted from the center of the

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.760 
being shouted from the center of the
ring<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:17.640> they<00:04:17.820> really<00:04:18.030> need<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:19.500> about<00:04:19.710> a

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
ring so they really need a just about a

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.770 
ring so they really need a just about a
translator<00:04:20.460> to<00:04:20.580> get<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.970> information<00:04:21.239> really

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
translator to get the information really

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.980 
translator to get the information really
