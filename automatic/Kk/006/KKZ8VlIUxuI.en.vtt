00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello everyone is robert 87 minutes 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.029
 I'm happy to meet you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.280
 today we find ourselves for fabregat 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.540
 offs here I decided a little a 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.860
 new series or really I'm going to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.910
 concentrate for an hour on a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.860
 player obviously has to be he 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 interesting why I started 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.560
 on fabregas we go after 30 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.910
 seconds I find a first fabregas to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.010
 110 thousand hours knowing that they will 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.920
 wind without any difficulty at the highest 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.269
 of its price range to 120 miles 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 I'm a little scared at first on both 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.180
 first or jelly shop you will see 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 the second hat game also at 110000 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.109
 and I'm afraid that very quickly I'll be 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.460
 stuck in credit terms telling me 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.899
 in decline they do not leave very 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.700
 quickly as I put them to the most 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.649
 top of their price range I'm going 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.239
 to block in the end here I have not been 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.170
 blocked at all so that's more of a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.540
 good thing 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 a lot of mistakes on the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.180
 fabregas toth it's really enough 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.190
 impressive you will see as you go 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.719
 as a self-made video and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 who really fell I see 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.110
 already resold 1 and so that that was that 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.090
 a few minutes 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 obviously bella I really show you 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 the key moments at the moment I grabbed 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.800
 the players and at the price where I have them 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.969
 chopped that one to 100000 so that makes 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.739
 fifteen thousand vnf when I put the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.739
 resell I'm here 90000 ie 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.689
 25 at least 25,000 of the world's benef 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.549
 noticed what is pretty good 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.630
 knowing that Thursday an hour this not 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 actually an hour that is to say that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.189
 really what I filmed it lasts 52 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.310
 minutes and one I actually was active 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.509
 we will say about 27 28 minutes either 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.580
 After a moment spa force but 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.259
 already it sucks the eyes of well being 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.670
 concentrated because basically we set the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.220
 TV constantly so pretty much 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.659
 every five 5 6 minutes I ask the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.320
 joystick I rest for three minutes where 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.049
 he was a whore 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.520
 and so on to avoid anyway 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.619
 to bellow there you still see that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.360
 I come to the opera 60500 to say that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.730
 I alone could have done it 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960
 do 55 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.800
 1000 profit credits 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.550
 unfortunately I have not been enough 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.610
 fast do not know what happened 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.200
 this is the only real eat shit and at 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.340
 the only time I'm in China 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.160
 which is the most interesting 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.560
 kim could have brought me a lot of 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.090
 credit fabregas tots I tried 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.070
 a lot before you start this video 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.310
 I have made a lot of players 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.050
 I tried the marchisio I tried 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.230
 what else have I tried 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.150
 tried bravo I tried to chuckle 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.100
 I am tempted by the payet 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.860
 I tried players who were less 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.630
 known also taken in the end I fell 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.670
 on fabregas by chance that's pretty much 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.290
 my seventh eighth choice and there 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.060
 really only price errors that 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.410
 of price errors because really on 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.470
 28 minutes in total 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.640
 I have to finish I believe in 15 15 or 14 15 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.410
 fabregas is so it's just 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.360
 monstrous the number of price errors 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.240
 who can be there is still a sense 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.720
 8000 if you look from the beginning 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.580
 does a lot 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.320
 and see where to leave this moment where I 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.190
 am at 449 credit that's what I tell you 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.530
 said at the beginning of the video 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.540
 I was a little afraid of being blocked by the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.790
 price so I hesitated to go down my 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.700
 maximum good the 94 miles separate actually 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.930
 that I have issued at 110000 this is 110000 so 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.730
 I buy it at 110 but I give it to 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.260
 120 miles that's about 5000 of 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.420
 benef 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.820
 if I had been to block and the dancer 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.470
 layer of about 3 so from this 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.209
 moment there I am more block this 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.480
 go but if I was down to 200 again 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.070
 me 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.930
 I think I would have taken a handsome game 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.360
 I would have lowered my max price I'm thinking of 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.940
 115 116000 to be able to sell it more 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.890
 quickly and I would have lowered my price 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.700
 we're going to say minimum bids the maxe 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.200
 immediate purchase 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.870
 I think I would have sought only at 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.380
 below 100 500 1100 5000 I do not know 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.940
 exactly 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.170
 good I did not need to worry about 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.610
 that in the end because I succeeded when 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.520
 even to rather sell them well and again 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.190
 1 91 thousand so again 25 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.720
 minutes of beneff on a single player 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.890
 really at 28 minutes is enough 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.420
 impressive everything I could 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.970
 pick up on what I believe is that a 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.860
 player that a player anyway 15 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.380
 fabregas ie that one every 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.410
 two minutes I grabbed a fabregas with 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.700
 at least 5 4 benefits not counting the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.130
 number there you saw in the video where 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.170
 I'm still over 90 miles to 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.640
 more than 25,000 people 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.920
 unfortunately ben here is the one who is 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.170
 at 60 miles I got another one at 89 me 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.880
 I did not want me but now there is 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.930
 another 89 miles the two that 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.480
 were still the most interesting 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.730
 unfortunately I was not strong enough 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.349
 see 14 years you're here you'll see 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.410
 that I managed the fifteen sales for 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.560
 we still did 2009 105 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.790
 miles at the beginning to 1 million 89 makes me 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.250
 to say that on the session I still 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.020
 made 180 3000 BesnÃ© baby's bottom 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.370
 does this fucking maybe not our case 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.810
 profits that's for sure 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.430
 I hope in any case that this type of 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.780
 videos will pay you the next player 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.359
 tell me which one wanted me to test 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.190
 like that knowing that I will choose 1 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.479
 which will work better than others 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.040
 I tell you soon it was robert 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.040
 87000 ciao guys
