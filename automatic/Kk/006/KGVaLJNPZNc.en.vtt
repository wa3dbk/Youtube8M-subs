software system called conditional
capture<00:01:08.000> will<00:01:08.149> videotape<00:01:08.719> guys<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.740> use<00:01:09.920> the

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
capture will videotape guys and use the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.149 
capture will videotape guys and use the
iPad<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:10.969> I'll<00:01:11.090> use<00:01:11.119> then<00:01:11.509> also<00:01:11.750> but<00:01:12.680> when<00:01:13.070> you

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
techniques that's a good possibility are

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:34.810 
techniques that's a good possibility are
gonna<00:01:32.899> get<00:01:33.049> injured<00:01:33.439> I'm<00:01:34.249> injury<00:01:34.670> on

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
gonna get injured I'm injury on

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.130 
gonna get injured I'm injury on
prevention<00:01:35.149> is<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.420> number<00:01:35.689> one<00:01:35.810> pillar<00:01:36.020> of

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
prevention is the number one pillar of
