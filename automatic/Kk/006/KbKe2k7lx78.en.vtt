00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.399 
actually twisting the gun to get the
next<00:01:37.890> four<00:01:38.070> rounds<00:01:38.430> isn't<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:38.990> longer<00:01:39.990> as<00:01:40.110> said

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
next four rounds isn't as longer as said

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.980 
next four rounds isn't as longer as said
pumping<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> shotguns<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.509> instance

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
pumping one of the shotguns for instance

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.260 
pumping one of the shotguns for instance
in<00:01:43.229> fact<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.549> probably<00:01:44.670> shorter

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
in fact you know it's probably shorter

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
in fact you know it's probably shorter
and<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.600> didn't<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.049> find<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.860> much<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and I didn't really find that much of a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.700 
and I didn't really find that much of a
difficult<00:01:47.939> time<00:01:48.180> we've<00:01:48.630> actually<00:01:48.840> reward<00:01:49.560> in

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
difficult time we've actually reward in

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.340 
difficult time we've actually reward in
the<00:01:49.829> gun<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.729> book<00:01:51.270> reloading<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> gun

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the gun like that book reloading the gun

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
the gun like that book reloading the gun
in<00:01:52.590> general<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.610> putting<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
in general like just putting the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.120 
in general like just putting the
clipping<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.380> long<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> I

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
clipping is actually a long time it I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920 
clipping is actually a long time it I
think<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> longest<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.450> shotguns

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
think it is the longest of the shotguns

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.010 
think it is the longest of the shotguns
or<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.350> advisors<00:01:59.009> either<00:01:59.280> stick<00:01:59.520> in

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
or what I do advisors either stick in

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
or what I do advisors either stick in
the<00:02:01.020> primary<00:02:01.380> gunfighter<00:02:01.530> wildcard<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:03.000> there

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the primary gunfighter wildcard on there

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.830 
the primary gunfighter wildcard on there
and<00:02:03.420> put<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:05.240> extended<00:02:06.240> mugs<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.540> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and put it on and extended mugs just so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
and put it on and extended mugs just so
you've<00:02:06.960> got<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.110> small<00:02:07.500> amount<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> ammo<00:02:08.099> or

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you've got that small amount of ammo or

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
you've got that small amount of ammo or
at<00:02:08.489> least<00:02:08.700> putting<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.060> sectional<00:02:09.539> weapon<00:02:09.840> on

at least putting a sectional weapon on

there<00:02:31.420> I've<00:02:31.660> explained<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.260> countless

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
there I've explained this countless

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.170 
there I've explained this countless
times<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.370> gauteng<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:33.970> best

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
times that the gauteng is the best

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.360 
times that the gauteng is the best
killstreak<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.840> use<00:02:34.989> with<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.379> shotguns

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
killstreak to use with the shotguns

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.039 
killstreak to use with the shotguns
because<00:02:36.730> there's<00:02:37.269> no<00:02:37.420> chunks<00:02:37.780> are<00:02:37.870> going<00:02:37.989> to

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
because there's no chunks are going to

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.390 
because there's no chunks are going to
be<00:02:38.140> able<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.440> kill<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.739> when<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.980> put<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.250> then

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
be able to kill you when you put it then

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.800 
be able to kill you when you put it then

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
you'll see me using it in this game

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.600 
you'll see me using it in this game
player<00:02:41.080> i<00:02:41.110> think<00:02:41.319> i've<00:02:41.500> got<00:02:41.739> i<00:02:41.980> think<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.489> get

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
player i think i've got i think you get

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.339 
player i think i've got i think you get
around<00:02:42.819> three<00:02:43.239> or<00:02:43.269> four<00:02:43.540> guardians<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.230> you

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
around three or four guardians and you

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.420 
around three or four guardians and you
know<00:02:44.440> i<00:02:44.500> put<00:02:44.680> them<00:02:44.769> in<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.920> high<00:02:45.040> trafficked

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
know i put them in the high trafficked

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.930 
know i put them in the high trafficked
areas<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.880> easily<00:02:46.180> pick<00:02:46.360> off<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.690> enemies

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
areas and easily pick off the enemies

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.839 
areas and easily pick off the enemies
but<00:02:48.940> yeah<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.239> m1216<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:50.290> one<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.610> most

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
but yeah the m1216 is one of the most

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.839 
but yeah the m1216 is one of the most
different<00:02:52.920> gloms<00:02:53.920> we've<00:02:54.099> ever<00:02:54.280> seen<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:54.700> would

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
different gloms we've ever seen I would

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.370 
different gloms we've ever seen I would
because<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.510> know<00:02:55.630> you've<00:02:55.810> got<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.959> twist<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
because you know you've got to twist the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.210 
because you know you've got to twist the
barrel<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.900> reload<00:02:58.900> time<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.349> very<00:02:59.620> very<00:02:59.860> long

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
barrel the reload time is very very long

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.600 
barrel the reload time is very very long
and<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:02.290> attachments<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.040> would<00:03:03.220> use<00:03:03.459> on

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
and the attachments that I would use on

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.630 
and the attachments that I would use on
this<00:03:03.790> gun<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.470> where's<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.650> site<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.190> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
this gun is the where's the site and the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.430 
this gun is the where's the site and the
long<00:03:06.910> barrel<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.780> reason<00:03:08.170> for<00:03:08.319> this<00:03:08.379> is

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
long barrel and the reason for this is

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.420 
long barrel and the reason for this is
because<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.829> know<00:03:09.069> you're<00:03:09.220> going<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.370> be

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
because you know you're going to be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.640 
because you know you're going to be
firing<00:03:09.700> from<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.030> hip<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.299> this<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.930> you're

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
firing from the hip of this and you're

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.960 
firing from the hip of this and you're
not<00:03:11.739> going<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:11.980> be<00:03:12.040> one<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.220> em<00:03:12.400> down<00:03:12.640> sights

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
not going to be one of em down sights

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.970 
not going to be one of em down sights
that<00:03:13.120> much<00:03:13.480> unless<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:14.140> know<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.349> and<00:03:14.829> then

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
that much unless you know you and then

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.500 
that much unless you know you and then
it<00:03:15.129> is<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> bit<00:03:15.459> far<00:03:15.640> away<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.970> want<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.299> jump

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
it is a bit far away you want to jump

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.720 
it is a bit far away you want to jump
towards<00:03:17.049> him<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.260> then<00:03:17.379> blow<00:03:17.590> em<00:03:18.190> down<00:03:18.489> likes

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
towards him and then blow em down likes

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.370 
towards him and then blow em down likes
em<00:03:19.000> down<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.480> sights<00:03:19.690> like<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:20.109> do<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.290> this

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
em down the sights like I do in this

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.670 
em down the sights like I do in this
game<00:03:20.530> play<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.959> know<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.230> long<00:03:23.410> barrel

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
game play and you know the long barrel

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.720 
game play and you know the long barrel
just<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:23.950> give<00:03:24.069> it<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.190> bit<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.489> range

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
just to give it that bit of range

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.430 
just to give it that bit of range
because<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.299> range<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.930> long<00:03:26.079> barrel

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
because the range of it the long barrel

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.470 
because the range of it the long barrel
on<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.920> shocking<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.670> if<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.299> don't

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
on this is shocking and if you don't

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.819 
on this is shocking and if you don't
know<00:03:28.660> Gaza<00:03:28.930> think<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.349> long<00:03:29.530> barrel

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
know Gaza think the long barrel

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.440 
know Gaza think the long barrel
increases<00:03:30.340> your<00:03:30.459> range<00:03:30.700> by<00:03:30.940> around<00:03:31.150> thirty

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
increases your range by around thirty

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.660 
increases your range by around thirty
percent<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.500> that's<00:03:32.680> actually<00:03:32.859> quite<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.370> lot

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
percent so that's actually quite a lot

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.640 
percent so that's actually quite a lot
you<00:03:33.819> know<00:03:33.940> you're<00:03:34.450> still<00:03:34.750> going<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.019> possibly

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
you know you're still going to possibly

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.879 
you know you're still going to possibly
use<00:03:36.250> whole<00:03:36.910> four<00:03:37.329> rounds<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:37.930> bullets<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.859> kill

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
use whole four rounds of bullets to kill

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.559 
use whole four rounds of bullets to kill
an<00:03:39.160> enemy<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.579> then<00:03:39.700> reload<00:03:40.120> but<00:03:40.389> you<00:03:40.450> know

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
an enemy and then reload but you know

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.599 
an enemy and then reload but you know
it's<00:03:40.720> worth<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.440> can<00:03:42.130> actually<00:03:42.250> get<00:03:42.549> a

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
it's worth it and you can actually get a

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.190 
it's worth it and you can actually get a
lot<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.819> montage<00:03:43.209> kills<00:03:43.569> with<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:43.900> gun<00:03:44.079> and

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
lot of montage kills with this gun and

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.960 
lot of montage kills with this gun and
stuff<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:44.919> much<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.549> thinking<00:03:45.880> of

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
stuff like that so much the thinking of

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.940 
stuff like that so much the thinking of
bringing<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.299> gaza<00:03:46.630> will<00:03:47.260> shotgun<00:03:47.769> montage

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
bringing you gaza will shotgun montage

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.449 
bringing you gaza will shotgun montage
probably<00:03:48.760> 45<00:03:49.180> minutes<00:03:49.599> long<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:50.079> which<00:03:50.799> i<00:03:51.160> use

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
probably 45 minutes long in which i use

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.339 
probably 45 minutes long in which i use
all<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.030> shotguns<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.599> know<00:03:52.720> possibly<00:03:52.989> a

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
all the shotguns you know possibly a

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.370 
all the shotguns you know possibly a
minute<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.700> using<00:03:55.120> each<00:03:55.269> shotgun<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:55.959> you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
minute of it using each shotgun and you

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.289 
minute of it using each shotgun and you
can<00:03:56.530> see<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.859> variety<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.700> shotguns<00:03:58.120> and

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
can see the variety of the shotguns and

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.390 
can see the variety of the shotguns and
you<00:03:58.389> can<00:03:58.540> see<00:03:58.720> all<00:03:59.169> the<00:03:59.230> diamond<00:03:59.889> shotguns<00:04:00.280> in

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
you can see all the diamond shotguns in

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.670 
you can see all the diamond shotguns in
one<00:04:00.609> place<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.239> yeah<00:04:02.169> I<00:04:02.200> think<00:04:02.410> it'll<00:04:02.620> be

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
one place and yeah I think it'll be

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.080 
one place and yeah I think it'll be
really<00:04:02.739> good<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:03.310> just<00:04:03.430> comment<00:04:03.730> below<00:04:03.760> if<00:04:03.940> you

want to see that I definitely do want to
do<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:05.950> probability<00:04:06.609> will<00:04:06.940> be<00:04:07.120> doing

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359

you see gold and diamond next because

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.070 
you see gold and diamond next because
I'm<00:04:30.160> currently<00:04:30.910> working<00:04:30.970> on<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.450> cap<00:04:31.660> faster

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
I'm currently working on the cap faster

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.150 
I'm currently working on the cap faster
because<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.380> know<00:04:32.500> I've<00:04:32.590> already<00:04:32.740> got<00:04:32.980> far

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
because you know I've already got far

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.159 
because you know I've already got far
too<00:04:33.340> headshot<00:04:33.730> so<00:04:33.940> might<00:04:34.120> as<00:04:34.210> well<00:04:34.419> keep<00:04:35.110> going

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
too headshot so might as well keep going

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.680 
too headshot so might as well keep going
for<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:36.550> think<00:04:36.639> it<00:04:37.120> may<00:04:37.240> go<00:04:37.450> for<00:04:37.600> the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
for that and I think it may go for the

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.060 
for that and I think it may go for the
crossbow<00:04:38.110> but<00:04:38.260> I've<00:04:38.350> seen<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.560> few<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.830> them<00:04:38.980> on

crossbow but I've seen a few of them on
