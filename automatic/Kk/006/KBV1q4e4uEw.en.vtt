00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
chances I don't ever doing this so it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.719 
chances I don't ever doing this so it
will<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> strong<00:01:43.049> opponent<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.950> us<00:01:44.130> because

champion<00:02:41.459> pool<00:02:41.670> isn't<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.270> good<00:02:43.050> as<00:02:43.290> we're

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
champion pool isn't that good as we're

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.370

playing champions in Europe but their

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.250 
playing champions in Europe but their
strategies<00:02:47.040> are<00:02:47.340> really<00:02:48.239> awesome<00:02:48.360> where<00:02:49.110> is

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
strategies are really awesome where is

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.530 
strategies are really awesome where is
we<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> take<00:02:50.519> something<00:02:50.850> from<00:02:51.150> them<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.680> I

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
we can take something from them and I

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.220 
we can take something from them and I
can<00:02:54.540> say<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.060> they<00:02:57.420> better<00:02:57.810> than

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
can say is there is they better than

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.400 
can say is there is they better than
Europe<00:02:58.650> or<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.160> until<00:02:59.940> we<00:03:00.090> will<00:03:00.239> see<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:01.050> on

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
Europe or not until we will see it on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.340 
Europe or not until we will see it on
the<00:03:01.530> wall<00:03:02.340> panels<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.330> think<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.600> cloud

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
the wall panels so you think that cloud

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.110 
the wall panels so you think that cloud
9<00:03:04.590> there's<00:03:04.860> one<00:03:05.070> good<00:03:05.310> team<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.820> North

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
couple reasons one of them being that

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.120 
couple reasons one of them being that
you<00:03:55.750> get<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.020> play<00:03:56.110> best<00:03:56.410> of<00:03:56.590> threes<00:03:56.800> again

which you have not had a chance to do in

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.020 
which you have not had a chance to do in
a<00:03:59.020> very<00:03:59.200> long<00:03:59.380> time<00:03:59.670> obviously<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:00.880> know<00:04:00.970> you

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
a very long time obviously you know you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.610 
a very long time obviously you know you
play<00:04:01.300> best<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.660> threes<00:04:01.900> all<00:04:02.050> throughout<00:04:02.320> last
