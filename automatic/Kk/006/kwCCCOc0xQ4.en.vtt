recent Avengers in the recent Hulk

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.290 
recent Avengers in the recent Hulk
movies<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:20.010> he<00:03:20.160> can't<00:03:20.400> control<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.880> at<00:03:21.000> times

I think that either it could be two
possible<00:03:26.580> reasons<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:27.209> he<00:03:27.720> was<00:03:27.840> either

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
just my nitpicking personal opinion it

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.440 
just my nitpicking personal opinion it
just<00:04:09.370> sounds<00:04:09.579> like<00:04:09.669> he's<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:09.849> human<00:04:10.180> being<00:04:10.299> like

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
just sounds like he's a human being like

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.539 
just sounds like he's a human being like
a<00:04:10.599> regular<00:04:10.810> human<00:04:11.200> being<00:04:11.230> I<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.739> hardly<00:04:12.129> tell

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
a regular human being I can hardly tell

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.909 
a regular human being I can hardly tell
a<00:04:12.879> little<00:04:13.299> bit<00:04:13.419> difference<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:14.019> him<00:04:14.290> being<00:04:14.799> a

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
a little bit difference of him being a

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.680 
a little bit difference of him being a
human<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.519> him<00:04:15.760> being<00:04:15.909> a<00:04:16.030> robot<00:04:16.209> there<00:04:16.539> should

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
human and him being a robot there should

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.089 
human and him being a robot there should
be<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.810> mix<00:04:17.109> between<00:04:17.229> both<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:17.829> felt<00:04:18.039> like

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
be a mix between both and I felt like

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.189 
be a mix between both and I felt like
it's<00:04:18.280> just<00:04:18.430> full<00:04:18.669> human<00:04:19.150> but<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.840> can<00:04:19.959> say<00:04:20.079> the

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
it's just full human but you can say the

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.320 
it's just full human but you can say the
same<00:04:20.229> thing<00:04:20.530> with<00:04:20.739> about<00:04:21.099> Jarvis<00:04:21.549> how<00:04:21.849> Jarvis

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
same thing with about Jarvis how Jarvis

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.060 
same thing with about Jarvis how Jarvis
sounds<00:04:22.660> for<00:04:22.960> iron<00:04:23.289> man<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.710> think<00:04:23.919> that's

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
sounds for iron man but I think that's

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.029 
sounds for iron man but I think that's
totally<00:04:24.460> different<00:04:24.729> just<00:04:25.090> because<00:04:25.120> it's

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
totally different just because it's

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.560 
totally different just because it's
recording<00:04:27.039> it's<00:04:27.220> like<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.639> know<00:04:27.759> response

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
recording it's like you know response

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.210 
recording it's like you know response
thing<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:29.050> don't<00:04:29.380> know<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.830> said<00:04:30.039> it's<00:04:30.190> just

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
thing I don't know like I said it's just

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.129 
thing I don't know like I said it's just
my<00:04:30.400> opinion<00:04:31.210> but<00:04:31.389> take<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.810> as<00:04:31.840> you<00:04:31.960> want

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
my opinion but take it as you want

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.510 
my opinion but take it as you want
something's<00:04:32.560> happening<00:04:32.860> with<00:04:33.039> Thor<00:04:33.280> as<00:04:33.400> you

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
something's happening with Thor as you

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.890 
something's happening with Thor as you
can<00:04:33.639> tell<00:04:33.849> something's<00:04:34.180> going<00:04:34.419> wrong<00:04:34.660> with

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
can tell something's going wrong with

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.360 
can tell something's going wrong with
his<00:04:34.990> powers<00:04:35.410> or<00:04:35.650> something<00:04:35.740> like<00:04:35.919> that<00:04:35.979> and

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
his powers or something like that and

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.610 
his powers or something like that and
then<00:04:36.820> honestly<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.690> see<00:04:37.900> another<00:04:38.199> mysterious

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
then honestly you see another mysterious

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.529 
then honestly you see another mysterious
woman<00:04:39.009> in<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.580> back<00:04:39.729> this<00:04:39.970> could<00:04:40.180> just<00:04:40.300> be<00:04:40.419> a

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
woman in the back this could just be a

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.719 
woman in the back this could just be a
you<00:04:40.810> know<00:04:40.930> an<00:04:41.110> extra<00:04:41.710> or<00:04:41.889> something<00:04:42.190> but<00:04:42.370> it

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
you know an extra or something but it

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.279

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
looks like they're at a location that

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.500 
looks like they're at a location that
also<00:04:44.800> can<00:04:44.949> be<00:04:45.010> in<00:04:45.340> Wakanda<00:04:46.000> or<00:04:46.210> maybe

also can be in Wakanda or maybe

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.300 
also can be in Wakanda or maybe

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.320 
to talk about if you look at Holts eyes
it<00:05:17.229> looks<00:05:17.409> like<00:05:17.680> either<00:05:17.919> he<00:05:18.759> just<00:05:18.970> got<00:05:19.090> out<00:05:19.150> of

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
it looks like either he just got out of

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.969 
it looks like either he just got out of
his<00:05:19.449> transformation<00:05:19.900> or<00:05:20.320> he's<00:05:20.500> gonna<00:05:20.590> go<00:05:20.800> back

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
his transformation or he's gonna go back

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.129 
his transformation or he's gonna go back
to<00:05:21.009> being<00:05:21.340> banner<00:05:22.060> or<00:05:22.389> he<00:05:22.930> was<00:05:23.020> either

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
to being banner or he was either

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.930 
to being banner or he was either
controlled<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.860> think<00:05:24.280> he<00:05:24.370> was<00:05:24.490> controlled<00:05:24.880> by

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
controlled I think he was controlled by

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.330 
controlled I think he was controlled by
either<00:05:25.240> somebody<00:05:25.750> from<00:05:26.259> scarlet<00:05:26.860> or<00:05:27.039> either

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
either somebody from scarlet or either

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.189 
either somebody from scarlet or either
Ultron<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.150> think<00:05:28.360> that's<00:05:28.509> how<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.780> happens

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
Ultron I think that's how it happens

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.339 
Ultron I think that's how it happens
Ultron<00:05:29.590> recruits<00:05:30.090> Quicksilver<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.210> Scarlet

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
Ultron recruits Quicksilver and Scarlet

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.810 
Ultron recruits Quicksilver and Scarlet
right<00:05:32.349> and<00:05:32.590> then<00:05:32.800> after<00:05:33.070> that<00:05:33.190> scarlet<00:05:33.699> takes

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
right and then after that scarlet takes

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
this i think the most interesting thing

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.060 
this i think the most interesting thing
I<00:06:07.700> found<00:06:07.730> is<00:06:08.270> that<00:06:08.360> mysterious<00:06:09.260> moment<00:06:09.800> in<00:06:09.890> the

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
I found is that mysterious moment in the

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.530 
I found is that mysterious moment in the
cave<00:06:10.370> where<00:06:10.730> that<00:06:10.880> it<00:06:11.060> could<00:06:11.210> have<00:06:11.300> been<00:06:11.390> in

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
cave where that it could have been in

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.850 
cave where that it could have been in
Wakanda<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.260> they<00:06:12.380> were<00:06:12.440> next<00:06:12.710> to<00:06:12.740> the

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
Wakanda and they were next to the

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.050 
Wakanda and they were next to the
vibrating<00:06:13.250> I<00:06:13.370> think<00:06:13.520> that's<00:06:13.640> the<00:06:13.730> only<00:06:13.790> thing

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
vibrating I think that's the only thing

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.430 
vibrating I think that's the only thing
that<00:06:14.240> I<00:06:14.300> caught<00:06:14.510> on<00:06:14.540> to<00:06:14.870> but<00:06:15.050> if<00:06:15.140> I'd<00:06:15.260> left
