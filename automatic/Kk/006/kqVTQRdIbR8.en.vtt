if you put a finger say spiny in the
thumb<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:22.180> should<00:04:22.420> give<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:22.990> protection

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
thumb it should give you that protection

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.110 
thumb it should give you that protection
even<00:04:23.800> though<00:04:23.980> it<00:04:24.100> doesn't<00:04:24.190> have<00:04:24.580> it

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
even though it doesn't have it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.879 
even though it doesn't have it
and<00:04:25.479> I<00:04:26.380> tried<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:26.949> earlier<00:04:27.100> on<00:04:28.320> just<00:04:29.320> get<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.770> in

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
and I tried it earlier on just get it in

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.100 
and I tried it earlier on just get it in
there<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.580> seemed<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.850> work<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:31.870> just

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
there and it seemed to work so I just

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.570 
there and it seemed to work so I just
put<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.350> glove<00:04:32.530> on<00:04:32.560> now

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.189 

so<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:40.889> does<00:04:41.099> feel<00:04:41.789> like<00:04:41.939> it<00:04:42.090> does<00:04:42.270> work<00:04:42.539> might

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
so it does feel like it does work might

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.439 
so it does feel like it does work might
be<00:04:43.379> a<00:04:43.409> little<00:04:44.039> bit<00:04:44.280> uncomfortable<00:04:44.939> it<00:04:45.060> depends

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
be a little bit uncomfortable it depends

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.749 
be a little bit uncomfortable it depends
how<00:04:45.569> thick<00:04:46.110> your<00:04:46.289> thumb<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.680> because<00:04:47.610> of

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
how thick your thumb is because of

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.490 
how thick your thumb is because of
obviously<00:04:48.030> it's<00:04:48.629> not<00:04:48.719> designed<00:04:48.960> for<00:04:49.259> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
obviously it's not designed for the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.839 
obviously it's not designed for the
thumb<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.180> spines<00:04:51.180> are<00:04:51.629> skinny<00:04:52.400> but<00:04:53.400> for<00:04:53.759> me

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
thumb so spines are skinny but for me

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.459 
thumb so spines are skinny but for me
it's<00:04:54.120> not<00:04:54.150> bad<00:04:54.449> at<00:04:54.599> all<00:04:54.750> because<00:04:54.960> my<00:04:55.199> thumb's

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
it's not bad at all because my thumb's

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:58.459 
it's not bad at all because my thumb's
are<00:04:55.650> quite<00:04:55.830> skinny<00:04:56.129> so<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:57.750> works<00:04:57.960> perfectly

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
are quite skinny so it works perfectly

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.350 
are quite skinny so it works perfectly
