00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
the only other thing I would say is it

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.479 
the only other thing I would say is it
started<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.620> guys<00:03:49.830> were<00:03:49.980> kind<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.280> playing

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
started so you guys were kind of playing

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.680 
started so you guys were kind of playing
with<00:03:50.670> these<00:03:50.760> props<00:03:51.060> if<00:03:51.330> you're<00:03:51.420> gonna<00:03:51.510> use

this<00:03:54.030> essentially<00:03:54.570> for<00:03:55.140> me<00:03:55.230> when<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.709> routine

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
this essentially for me when the routine

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.500 
this essentially for me when the routine
picked<00:03:56.280> up<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.550> when<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.790> music<00:03:57.090> went<00:03:57.269> into

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
picked up is when the music went into

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.790 
picked up is when the music went into
reverse<00:03:57.810> when<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.110> guys<00:03:58.230> started<00:03:58.560> again

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
reverse when you guys started again

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.020 
reverse when you guys started again
getting<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> floor<00:03:59.580> which<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.790> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
getting to the floor which is the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.820 
getting to the floor which is the
concept<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.780> song<00:04:00.989> that's<00:04:01.590> when<00:04:01.769> the

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
concept of the song that's when the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.770 
concept of the song that's when the
routine<00:04:02.130> got<00:04:02.340> hot<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.090> would<00:04:03.390> say<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.720> is

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
routine got hot so I would say this is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.420 
routine got hot so I would say this is
kind<00:04:04.110> of<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.350> good<00:04:04.530> performance<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.010> wasn't<00:04:05.310> my
