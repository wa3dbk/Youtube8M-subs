00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 here is garden video point com back 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.319
 camera falkenberg and in front of the camera 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.170
 Sabine Reber shows us how she is in 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.599
 vegetable- time we have seen now 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.490
 Instance gave as you in no time 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.260
 have a bit cleared up what not 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.180
 More growing was already harvested is gone 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.640
 and now this ready for sowing like 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.279
 and what else can you do now? 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.099
 his money is also good that i am very right 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.050
 long partly from up in september yet 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.050
 it is also very nice and here at the lake 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.059
 The gentleman mostly can be good so far 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.210
 December still it's hard now 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.239
 things that grow fast 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.370
 arugula and dance asia salads the go 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 quite good they are also a bit frosty 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.340
 yes also radish or basil 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.800
 everything that is relatively small now 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.949
 you can walk away very well soon 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.870
 into the autumn how do you have little 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.010
 at once that's important so 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.649
 on the one hand it is just luxury do so 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.390
 just a little bit because it's way too much 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.979
 Lukas kliche is not very dense 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.700
 so just a little bit to 1 sometimes 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.770
 if beginner the week then hear 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.290
 Here you have the whole hand 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.970
 prospect then you have somehow 200 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.160
 cards all at once 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.990
 But you should only suffocate completely 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.860
 little yes yes and my design team 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.470
 accumulate 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.150
 Do you still want to cut them out of this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.159
 Of course you can already have salads 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.470
 ends when the little ones are so 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.240
 which is too much then ends up in the same 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.789
 the salad bowl then nothing works 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.780
 lost 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.490
 Now I have seen that the extreme 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.890
 many things in these vegetable beds 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.149
 can you enumerate a bit 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.130
 I have everything you actually need 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.780
 also has a large farm garden and 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 then many new things I do 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.500
 Trying to know I lived so takes 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.810
 you can in a small garden 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.390
 Of course everything makes you too easy 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.000
 not I do not have 20 kohlkÃ¶pfe but 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.160
 only 34 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.220
 Every vegetable plant can be natural 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.450
 grow here 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.890
 how many years are you doing this already? 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.140
 same substrate do you have that time 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.940
 replaced yes I can, of course 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.069
 everything so the plants 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.230
 they take a lot out of the ground 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.510
 So that sinks off if I do 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.640
 now such cabbages end this 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.400
 material what I take away is yes then 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.290
 gone so i do of course i do good too 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.959
 every now and then it is let me do it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.790
 a lot of compost on it than in winter 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.980
 it is always filled up then that is 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.930
 Everything up to the top you have in the day 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.790
 again a season long grow from or 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.350
 yes, of course , you always have to earth again 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.950
 It does not have to do anything on it 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.510
 do not just renew it again 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.920
 I always do that warmly 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.920
 thanks for these tips sabine reber
