life

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.460 

he<00:05:06.389> then<00:05:06.569> said<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.930> children<00:05:07.050> would<00:05:07.349> be

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
he then said that the children would be

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.960 
he then said that the children would be
ridiculed<00:05:07.889> at<00:05:08.039> school<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.490> that's<00:05:08.669> why<00:05:08.789> gay

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
ridiculed at school and that's why gay

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.219 
ridiculed at school and that's why gay
and<00:05:09.210> lesbian<00:05:09.539> people<00:05:09.569> shouldn't<00:05:09.960> have<00:05:10.020> as

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
and lesbian people shouldn't have as

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.029 
and lesbian people shouldn't have as
you'd<00:05:10.349> be<00:05:10.470> allowed<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.710> adopt<00:05:10.860> children

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
you'd be allowed to adopt children

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.040 
you'd be allowed to adopt children
probably<00:05:11.940> they<00:05:12.180> would<00:05:12.389> for<00:05:12.569> a<00:05:12.599> while<00:05:12.810> but

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
probably they would for a while but

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.600 
probably they would for a while but
would<00:05:13.199> it<00:05:13.289> be<00:05:13.319> that<00:05:13.410> bad<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:14.099> mean<00:05:14.250> if<00:05:14.430> my<00:05:14.460> two

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
would it be that bad I mean if my two

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.460 
would it be that bad I mean if my two
female<00:05:15.150> friends<00:05:15.270> adopt<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.780> little<00:05:16.020> boy<00:05:16.139> yeah

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
female friends adopt the little boy yeah

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.230 
female friends adopt the little boy yeah
he'd<00:05:16.710> be<00:05:16.740> made<00:05:16.979> fun<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.190> at<00:05:17.340> school<00:05:17.370> why<00:05:17.849> cuz

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
he'd be made fun of at school why cuz

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.520 
he'd be made fun of at school why cuz
he'd<00:05:18.389> be<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.599> boy<00:05:18.750> with<00:05:18.960> two<00:05:19.139> mums

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
he'd be the boy with two mums

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.890 
he'd be the boy with two mums
but<00:05:20.250> I<00:05:20.280> reckon<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.729> teasing<00:05:21.090> would<00:05:21.240> stop<00:05:21.479> at

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
but I reckon that teasing would stop at

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.760 
but I reckon that teasing would stop at
about<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.229> age<00:05:22.259> of<00:05:22.530> 14<00:05:22.889> I<00:05:27.590> reckon<00:05:28.590> then<00:05:28.680> he

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
about the age of 14 I reckon then he

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.460 
about the age of 14 I reckon then he
becomes<00:05:29.009> the<00:05:29.220> coolest<00:05:29.610> boy<00:05:29.729> in<00:05:29.759> his<00:05:30.000> class<00:05:30.470> all

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
becomes the coolest boy in his class all

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.020 
becomes the coolest boy in his class all
his<00:05:31.530> mates<00:05:31.860> on<00:05:32.070> his<00:05:32.160> run<00:05:32.370> door<00:05:32.580> sleep<00:05:32.789> every

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
his mates on his run door sleep every

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.170 
his mates on his run door sleep every
night<00:05:33.060> g'day<00:05:33.419> Jimmy<00:05:33.720> can<00:05:33.870> we<00:05:33.960> stay<00:05:34.169> for<00:05:34.229> dinner

night g'day Jimmy can we stay for dinner

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.640 
night g'day Jimmy can we stay for dinner

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
do you reckon they'll kiss and I don't

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.740 
do you reckon they'll kiss and I don't
buy<00:05:44.370> that<00:05:44.610> theory<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.090> it's<00:05:45.240> against<00:05:45.539> God's

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
buy that theory that it's against God's

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.120 
buy that theory that it's against God's
will<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.259> there<00:05:46.380> are<00:05:46.500> people<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:46.800> are<00:05:46.919> gay

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
will that there are people that are gay

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.980 
will that there are people that are gay
because<00:05:47.340> here's<00:05:47.729> my<00:05:47.909> thinking<00:05:48.180> if<00:05:48.509> we're<00:05:48.780> all

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
because here's my thinking if we're all

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.839 
because here's my thinking if we're all
created<00:05:49.440> in<00:05:49.530> God's<00:05:49.770> image<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:50.250> there<00:05:50.759> are

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
created in God's image and there are

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.129 
created in God's image and there are
some<00:05:51.030> people<00:05:51.210> on<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.509> planet<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:51.930> gay

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
some people on the planet that a gay

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.610 
some people on the planet that a gay
then<00:05:53.070> that<00:05:53.250> must<00:05:53.430> mean<00:05:53.580> that<00:05:53.789> God<00:05:54.289> is<00:05:55.289> a<00:05:55.349> bit

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
then that must mean that God is a bit

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.890 
then that must mean that God is a bit
gay<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:57.110> mean<00:05:58.110> not<00:05:58.229> fully<00:05:58.470> screaming<00:05:58.949> but<00:05:59.900> there

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
gay I mean not fully screaming but there

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.570 
gay I mean not fully screaming but there
may<00:06:01.169> be<00:06:01.199> God's<00:06:01.530> fairly<00:06:01.919> straight<00:06:02.190> but<00:06:02.370> every

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
may be God's fairly straight but every

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.500 
may be God's fairly straight but every
