be playing Jack Daniels 96 boom so he's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.260 
be playing Jack Daniels 96 boom so he's
during<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.770> game<00:00:55.949> you've<00:00:56.100> got<00:00:56.129> 79<00:00:56.550> 82

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
during the game you've got 79 82

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.080 
during the game you've got 79 82
midfield<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:57.960> 87<00:00:58.890> defense<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.460> reckon<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.000> he's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
midfield an 87 defense I reckon if he's

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.400 
midfield an 87 defense I reckon if he's
got<00:01:00.239> premier<00:01:00.539> Layton<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:00.989> he<00:01:01.079> most<00:01:01.320> likely

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
got premier Layton then he most likely

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.110 
got premier Layton then he most likely
has<00:01:01.859> village<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> center<00:01:02.789> back<00:01:02.940> role

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
has village in the center back role

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
has village in the center back role
which<00:01:03.510> would<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> good<00:01:04.019> team<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.500> he

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
which would be a good team but if he

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
which would be a good team but if he
doesn't<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.309> could<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.610> any<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
doesn't then you could have any one in

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.600 
doesn't then you could have any one in
his<00:01:07.049> defense<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.710> let's<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.310> team<00:01:08.490> is
