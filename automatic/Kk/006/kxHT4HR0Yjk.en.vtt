00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
so you can also like take it apart so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.520 
so you can also like take it apart so
hold<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.270> don't<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> tripod<00:01:58.110> right

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
hold on this I don't have a tripod right

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.039 
hold on this I don't have a tripod right
now<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.310> obviously<00:02:00.000> using<00:02:00.630> my<00:02:00.869> home

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
now because I'm obviously using my home

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.469 
now because I'm obviously using my home
a<00:02:01.229> tripod<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> also<00:02:05.969> separate

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
a tripod so this you can also separate

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.100 
a tripod so this you can also separate
it<00:02:07.250> should<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.429> easier<00:02:08.789> kind<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.989> will

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it should be easier kind of but it will

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.370 
it should be easier kind of but it will
kind<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.500> fall<00:02:10.679> down<00:02:10.890> easy<00:02:11.629> my<00:02:12.629> dad

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
kind of fall down easy my dad

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.940 
kind of fall down easy my dad
so<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:15.540> right<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.170> but<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:19.350> when

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
so all right like that but then when

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.500 
so all right like that but then when
you're<00:02:20.100> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.430> adjust<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.970> would<00:02:21.240> fall

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
you're going to adjust it would fall

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.070 
you're going to adjust it would fall
flat<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.740> ground<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.790> that's<00:02:24.030> why<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.690> would

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
flat on the ground so that's why I would

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.930 
flat on the ground so that's why I would
