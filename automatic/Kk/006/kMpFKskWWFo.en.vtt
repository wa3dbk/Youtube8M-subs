 Hello, you are viewing one of the courses 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.379
 to ask in this course you will learn 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.230
 about the ways of reading scores 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.539
 and tablature in numbers approaching notions 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.400
 about chord and scales 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 you will also learn the main 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.340
 techniques of the instrument with different 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.410
 exercises and the Chord Dictionary 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.840
 asks courses you can interact with 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.870
 change your life 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.520
 I see that our student of this has to say 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 how I am a municipal civil servant 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.289

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 this course the course of the first empire 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.180

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.899
 he has guided me and and helped in the day 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.690
 on the day 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.109
 by service it comes from what is to be avoided 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.510
 accidents and nothing came in handy either 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.070
 such as a course that has just 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.860
 prevents a knowledge you 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 need to expand its possibilities 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.640

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.280
 thousands of people have already changed lives 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 taking a course and asking for an example of this 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.689
