00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.940
 flavio simonetti savior of the thin hello 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.059
 my friend flavio simonetta I am 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.040
 here in donauwörth at holger cook one 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.410
 the best fitness expert of mine 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.390
 opinion in Germany and I have 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.710
 ask me a few questions right in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.330
 the coming weeks will be even more 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.070
 come 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.109
 Today it is about supplement ascribes 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.240
 many articles on fitness freaks for 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.949
 many big pages and you have a lot too 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 has intensively on its own 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.640
 supplemente maybe you can 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.050
 Three best supplements are easy 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.079
 times to the point that really bring 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 what good is it for sachs? 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.540
 Which one would you do in any case? 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 recommend it well so we'll do that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 3 maybe best single substances and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.140
 always say so you can with yes 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.420
 supplements one can distinguish here 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 What should it be for the sake of it 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.520
 it's good for muscle building to be very good 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.030
 should it be good for fat loss 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.550
 it is good for a healthy posture 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.989
 I have a lot of coaching 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 run and knows just white actually 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.470
 very good for the people 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.640
 actually missing the most and with what 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.740
 actually most people the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.939
 make the best progress and on the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.670
 other side of course next to the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.900
 experience has something so up to date yes in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.000
 things best 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.580
 Number one of the perennial creatine 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.299
 Of course, mono hydrate micro freezes 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.740
 or is it so it is so that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.290
 for the most that's actually that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.299
 cheapest the best is the most 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.100
 benefits more than most 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.450
 with completely normal creatin moni wire 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.110
 make good achievements 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.970
 So there is too creative without wire 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.549
 Most of the studies were done 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.270
 and also successfully ended with a 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.509
 positive result is the only one 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.579
 only form in my eyes now 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.600
 a little bit the nose is still in front 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.960
 he is the creatine in his form a kg 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.520
 alphatrad and that's why 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.280
 he already tends to be creative 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.030
 to take permanently 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.930
 the long-term intake is in matters 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.120
 kidney damage and other he is 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.600
 occupied is not really bad 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.060
 you do 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.180
 the only thing that can happen is that 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.500
 is that the creative transporter with 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.200
 the time a little bit the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.180
 sensitize the knowledge of the least 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.850
 but is on but apparently 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.709
 in fact, you could do that 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.020
 deal with this akg because that as 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.700
 stand-alone transporter thus acts 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.080
 Recommendation number one will be on everyone 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.959
 case times creatin akg number two what I 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.890
 is relatively interesting because it is the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.780
 studies relatively relative to the studies 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.660
 good is hmb is an insulin is a 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.970
 So descendant traverse it is 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.080
 known as the intergenia - 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.440
 actually they are already very strong today 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.840
 stimulates protein synthesis and this 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.760
 home broom offspring of it has one 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.780
 completely independent effect that is 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.420
 actually a supplement that's it 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.739
 is very old then in the iss on again 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.290
 disappeared newspaper is coming back now 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.820
 high and there are a few current ones 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.000
 Investigations also from the from the 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.489
 competition bodybuilding especially the 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.630
 show that this has a relatively good effect 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.380
 in things get muscle too 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.239
 Muscle development so I would say home b 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.610
 you can try it out 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.340
 I think that some of them are relative 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.230
 little money in any case what 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.150
 can travel 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.459
 and yes, what else is missing? 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.049
 Now we have muscle building 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.310
 muscle building fed dismantling combination yes 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.799
 well there we can maybe one 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.320
 separate again say something to 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.600
 omega maybe even more 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.590
 So there are there are also there 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.560
 also relatively new investigations for 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.200
 earlier it was so omega-3 fatty acids 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.209
 All in all, everything is always good 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.209
 Everything was great and there was no 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.790
 no limit what how many 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.459
 how much grams per day can you take 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.280
 really did not matter it comes 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.840
 now more and more 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.180
 it always comes like a 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.570
 See that this 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.579
 omega-3 fatty acids only up to 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.900
 limited amount of benefit are so 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.080
 of advantage is for the heart 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.610
 circulation system for the vascular system and 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.660
 also for the fat metabolism 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.340
 of course and now it is like that 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.020
 slowly but surely states if you 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.419
 it actually takes too much of it 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.410
 even counterproductive counterproductive 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.060
 for rising levels of inflammation 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.240
 First indications of prostate cancer risk 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.110
 a little bit on the rise so I would 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.419
 say for the health is one 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.500
 mega drive rejects important especially for 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.630
 the people really stop at all 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.940
 do not eat fish so this one 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.850
 leinöl diesel a supplementation 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.470
 next to is so absolutely unassigned that there 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.960
 that there is enough converted at all 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.820
 is rebuilt 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.290
 That's why I just give it now 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.960
 latest always the recommendations 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.479
 omega fatty year up to the amount 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.010
 of two grams per day there is one 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.139
 one in a very good area where 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.530
 is really absolutely harmless 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.710
 according to the current state, I would say 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.370
 Three good numbers number two was for me 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.370
 also very surprising 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.320
 I 've tested myself myself 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.390
 I have to say I always do it 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.770
 I try again so little spd myself 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.140
 even experiments I had already there 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.760
 also possible on kolostrum and 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.620
 everything already tried 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.820
 and I really want to feel homesick 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.070
 posted and I also use 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.330
 my competition athletes and if anything 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.919
 at a competition athlete 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.200
 works in such an extreme situation 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:54.039
 then it works mostly too 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.720
 when the normal wide sportsman ok 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.270
 I would say cool tips 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.100
 in front of the figure too long becomes several parts 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.050
 I'll say that anyway 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.630
 Thanks to holger, there is more 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.180
 link his channel to the name 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:11.130
 and thank you and see you soon 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.130
 video I would say servus
