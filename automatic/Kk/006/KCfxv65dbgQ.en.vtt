00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
but as you keep doing that then you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.070 
but as you keep doing that then you
think<00:01:25.640> oh<00:01:25.760> those<00:01:26.300> you<00:01:26.630> every<00:01:26.780> time<00:01:26.870> you<00:01:26.990> go

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080

and you want to you want to get that too
so<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.850> really<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.750> thing<00:01:32.930> with<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.080> game<00:01:33.320> is

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
so the really the thing with the game is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.990 
so the really the thing with the game is
the<00:01:33.770> sky<00:01:33.980> is<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.160> limit<00:01:34.310> as<00:01:34.700> far<00:01:34.880> as

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the sky is the limit as far as

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000 
the sky is the limit as far as
creativity<00:01:35.360> goes<00:01:35.720> half<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.350> funds<00:01:36.560> building

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010
