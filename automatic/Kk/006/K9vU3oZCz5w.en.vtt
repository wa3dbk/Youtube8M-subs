00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello my name is jbl and i show 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.589
 you guys today how to minecraft and ticket 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.840
 speeds are both minecraft 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.809
 Only the ticket is a modified one 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:19.380
 version is first of all minecraft know 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.670
 most of minecraft here is a pixel 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.090
 play as you already here 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.039
 can determine 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.269
 I must now here just one more 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.969
 Enter password 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:37.020
 if it worked and login 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.920
 he just has to stop that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.920
 download files 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:51.960
 I'm getting strong right now 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:54.120
 set up so yes minecraft is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.690
 like most is already 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.239
 know 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.239
 a pixel game here in the background 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.080
 you can see the whole thing that is already 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:16.560
 the structure of the earth thus of the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:24.650
 texture okay so that's good that tree point 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.650
 A chicken blog tells you that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:39.480
 then I 'll down the volume 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:41.540
 I will not switch like that 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.570
 one already sees minecraft 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.090
 he runs jerkily could lie however 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.040
 even now mostly on the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:02:00.500
 Admission program I can already here 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:04.920
 Let's see the top right here up here 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.119
 Do you ever see the memory that we 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.780
 have assigned you respectively 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.990
 The fault is assigned by minecraft 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.100
 directly yourself and how much of it 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.739
 grad used or again in the mega 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.310
 when given and here he is currently 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.260
 39 percent of the used and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.690
 here's why the whole thing jerks too 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.370
 so and now we will do it all 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.110
 accelerate 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.459
 So that's just or not 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.160
 accelerate but just more 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:45.630
 to assign ram so minecraft milram 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:50.790
 Logically we have to go again 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:03:00.080
 let's just go to the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:04.739
 System control system security system 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.370
 and advanced settings so 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.370
 Advanced system settings 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:19.550
 and then on environment variables though 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.130
 Now I have to do this again 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.300
 short 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.300
 I pull it out shortly from the field 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:36.770
 that my house is going on here so i have 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.960
 now a text file prepared here 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.970
 is she already here I already have 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.150
 a bit almost prepared so that 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.850
 Everything is so minimal for xms 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.630
 I'm allowed to use saved 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.680
 then with me as a gigabyte 1 did 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.770
 Here I have show violence 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.860
 but I can just stand in there 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:04.760
 change briefly 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:07.310
 So we're going to do this here and now 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:14.680
 new profile the name we already have 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.680
 there was java underlined as yes 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:31.220
 and enter tvi nctc so that the minimum 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.630
 form which he may use or 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:41.210
 yes, that's up to say now 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:45.110
 just dirty and also one 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:49.210
 in the back and then the rest is xxx 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:55.010
 so maximum and these are the four 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.810
 gigabyte so then we go down here 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.140
 below at system marie expiration new 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.790
 Press enter a 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.270
 and now we have the path to 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.730
 minecraft file search 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.380
 We just open the computer 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:14.710
 give up here so hold 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:17.840
 explorer window genii above appdata 1 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.140
 and we come here to go 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.960
 minecraft then press next to them 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:31.540
 bar pure c 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:34.540
 cst bvv and copy this in here then 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.910
 once on ok than sometimes you can 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.170
 the file does not happen anymore 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.950
 you have to start a bit 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:44.170
 try it out and yes and what also 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.570
 It can happen that all the work 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:50.440
 only then does it work if you 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:53.800
 i would have redesigned computer 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:06:02.080
 the whole try now seems 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:07.810
 minecraft to start after and you see 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:10.110
 it is running smoother and we see 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:15.490
 up here 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:20.340
 hello cat memories three gigabytes and jus 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:24.220
 memories at 5 namely 240 megabytes of 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.820
 4004 4220 megabytes as he uses too 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.700
 not that full 4096 megabytes will be 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.800
 also not registered because the system 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:37.290
 and you need more than at 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.840
 full load and yes you can tell 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.740
 is still being at 23 ps 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.180
 or 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:49.350
 but otherwise it is due to recordings 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:53.110
 program what pretty good brakes and 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:56.040
 that 's it from me to apple 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.040
 until next time
