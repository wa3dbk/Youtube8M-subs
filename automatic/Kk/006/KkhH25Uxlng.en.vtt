than that right now cause these items

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.640 
than that right now cause these items
aren't<00:00:23.789> safe<00:00:24.060> until<00:00:24.420> I've<00:00:24.570> got<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.230> any

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
aren't safe until I've got them on any

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.150 
aren't safe until I've got them on any
SD<00:00:25.890> mats<00:00:26.930> but<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> haven't<00:00:28.199> got<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:28.949> so

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
SD mats but I haven't got right now so

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.070 
SD mats but I haven't got right now so
I'm<00:00:29.220> not<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> do<00:00:29.670> anything<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:30.080> with

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
I'm not going to do anything more with

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.620 
I'm not going to do anything more with
them<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.529> now<00:00:31.740> from<00:00:32.579> memory<00:00:33.120> though<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.510> think

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
them for now from memory though I think

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.479 
them for now from memory though I think
it's<00:00:34.170> needed<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.710> new<00:00:34.980> LCD<00:00:35.309> connector<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it's needed a new LCD connector so I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
it's needed a new LCD connector so I
will<00:00:38.910> get<00:00:39.480> things<00:00:39.629> sorted<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.350> could

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
will get things sorted out so we could

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.720 
will get things sorted out so we could
take<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> look<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.070> safely

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
take a look at that safely

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.540 
take a look at that safely
and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.360> we'll<00:00:42.480> get<00:00:42.570> moving<00:00:42.719> okay<00:00:43.950> moving<00:00:44.430> on

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and then we'll get moving okay moving on

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.290 
and then we'll get moving okay moving on
with<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.210> iPhone<00:00:45.629> we've<00:00:46.590> taken<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
with this iPhone we've taken all the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.799 
with this iPhone we've taken all the
components<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:49.309> started<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.579> rebuild<00:00:51.120> the

fine apart from nothing on screen yeah
so<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.280> I'm<00:01:11.340> doing<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.670> looking<00:01:12.110> under<00:01:13.110> my

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so what I'm doing is looking under my

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.249 
so what I'm doing is looking under my
USB<00:01:14.100> microscope<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.920> damaged<00:01:17.090> connector

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
USB microscope at the damaged connector

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.359 
USB microscope at the damaged connector
one<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.860> bear<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.130> barely

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
one see if it can bear it barely

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370 
one see if it can bear it barely
Canberra<00:01:20.850> now<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.270> by<00:01:21.420> taking<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
Canberra now just by taking the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620 
Canberra now just by taking the
connector<00:01:22.770> off<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.189> putting<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.360> own

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
connector off and putting in your own

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
connector off and putting in your own
arm<00:01:24.869> thoughts<00:01:25.409> there's<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.040> little<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
arm thoughts there's a little more to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
arm thoughts there's a little more to
this<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.780> can't<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.350> repaired

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this that can't be repaired

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.030 
hole connector itself as the camera
looks<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.570> gives<00:01:36.720> me<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.140> 200<00:01:37.770> times

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
looks at it it gives me up to 200 times

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.870 
looks at it it gives me up to 200 times

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
pin and above here there should be a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.100 
pin and above here there should be a
component<00:01:48.990> similar<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> these<00:01:51.329> that

component similar to one of these that

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.460 
component similar to one of these that
she'll<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.409> bridging<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> gap

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
she'll be bridging that gap

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.040 
she'll be bridging that gap
and<00:01:54.400> doing<00:01:54.610> his<00:01:54.700> job<00:01:54.730> now<00:01:55.240> whatever<00:01:55.450> has

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
and doing his job now whatever has

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.040 
and doing his job now whatever has
caused<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:56.890> damage<00:01:57.310> I'm<00:01:57.610> guessing<00:01:58.090> was<00:01:58.720> also

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
caused this damage I'm guessing was also

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.940 
caused this damage I'm guessing was also
knocked<00:01:59.320> this<00:01:59.740> off<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.340> main<00:02:00.520> board<00:02:01.230> and<00:02:02.230> this

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
knocked this off the main board and this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
even if we replace this connector we

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.760 
even if we replace this connector we
still<00:02:16.360> wouldn't<00:02:16.690> have<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.930> work<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.320> back<00:02:17.530> live

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
still wouldn't have a work in back live

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.770 
still wouldn't have a work in back live
because<00:02:17.980> there's<00:02:18.760> no<00:02:18.910> component<00:02:19.270> here<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.690> do

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
because there's no component here to do

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.310 
because there's no component here to do
that<00:02:19.930> job<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.920> looks<00:02:21.130> like<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:22.320> solder

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
that job and it looks like this solder

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.850 
that job and it looks like this solder
pad<00:02:23.470> here<00:02:23.680> goes<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.910> pen<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:26.230> does<00:02:26.680> its

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
pad here goes to this pen that does its

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.620 
pad here goes to this pen that does its
job<00:02:26.920> itself<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.940> they<00:02:28.720> also<00:02:28.900> can't<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:30.220> that

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
job itself and they also can't do that

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.430 
job itself and they also can't do that
because<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:32.200> component<00:02:32.770> isn't<00:02:33.100> here<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.440> it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
because this component isn't here so it

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.430 
because this component isn't here so it
can't<00:02:35.680> be<00:02:35.770> repaired

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
can't be repaired

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.490 
can't be repaired
unfortunately<00:02:38.940> because<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.750> say<00:02:40.990> even<00:02:41.350> if

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
unfortunately because like say even if

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.190 
unfortunately because like say even if
we<00:02:41.680> replace<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:42.790> still<00:02:43.150> isn't<00:02:43.810> that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
we replace this this still isn't that

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.770 
we replace this this still isn't that
component<00:02:44.680> there<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.190> do<00:02:45.280> his<00:02:45.430> jump<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:45.970> it's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
component there to do his jump and it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.500 
component there to do his jump and it's
not<00:02:46.990> like<00:02:47.260> we<00:02:47.740> can<00:02:48.070> just<00:02:48.100> bridge<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.270> gap

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
not like we can just bridge that gap

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.040 
not like we can just bridge that gap
with<00:02:49.990> some<00:02:50.590> solder<00:02:50.860> or<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.700> piece<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:52.060> wire<00:02:52.270> for

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
with some solder or a piece of wire for

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.950 
with some solder or a piece of wire for
example<00:02:53.530> because<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.490> it<00:02:55.120> having<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.570> power<00:02:55.780> at

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
example because of it having to power at

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.260 
example because of it having to power at
the<00:02:56.050> back<00:02:56.260> light<00:02:56.500> through<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.040> pin<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:57.580> with

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
the back light through that pin so with

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.780 
the back light through that pin so with
this<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:59.350> can't<00:02:59.650> be<00:02:59.800> repaired<00:03:00.220> like<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.459> say<00:03:00.730> so

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
this it can't be repaired like I say so

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.520 
this it can't be repaired like I say so
we<00:03:01.030> can't<00:03:01.239> move<00:03:01.390> on<00:03:01.540> without<00:03:01.780> an<00:03:01.900> fortunately

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
we can't move on without an fortunately

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.220 
we can't move on without an fortunately
all<00:03:03.489> I'm<00:03:03.640> gonna<00:03:03.760> do<00:03:03.940> with<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.239> now<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.840> just

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
all I'm gonna do with this now is just

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.650 
all I'm gonna do with this now is just
assemble<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.130> iPhone<00:03:06.489> into<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.090> one<00:03:07.239> unit

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
assemble the iPhone into the one unit

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.190 
assemble the iPhone into the one unit
and<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.590> will<00:03:08.890> do<00:03:09.010> unfortunately
