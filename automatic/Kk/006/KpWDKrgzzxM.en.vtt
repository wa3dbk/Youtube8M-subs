00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.990
 hello everyone this is the video to do 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:17.300
 the recipe for lemon syrup 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:22.610
 this is the lemon syrup I prepare 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:26.060
 I at home is very easy to prepare 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.160
 it is prepared only with two ingredients yes 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.680
 uses like a normal syrup 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.290
 for drinks 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.110
 or to make ice lollies I have 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.510
 I also use it to prepare 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.130
 my cakes are used like a normal 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.000
 syrup like the one you buy 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.180
 supermarket but obviously this is more 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.180
 natural 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.360
 let's see immediately how it is prepared 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.860
 to this syrup the ingredients that 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.200
 we are going to use will of course 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.200
 lemons and sugar 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.620
 so first thing we go to 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.620
 cut our gifts 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.080
 then using a juicer 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.570
 closed the electric one 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.570
 let's go squeeze our lemons 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.020
 once our lemons are pressed 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.650
 we're going to weigh the amount of liquid 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.650
 we got 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.380
 here I have kept 170 in this case 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 grams of lemon juice 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.610
 obviously I do little because like 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.870
 you have seen before I already have the big vase 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:32.970
 to finish and so now I'm going to weigh 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.970
 170 grams also of sugar 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:56.970
 or 170 grams of sugar too 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.050
 now towards all of the small pan e 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.560
 I boil for 10 minutes 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:10.190
 I take my pot c towards it 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.840
 sugar c to lemon juice 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.620
 if you want you can also decide to 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.620
 filter it 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.200
 this is what will remain 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.800
 if you are making a sweet you can 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.960
 use it instead of Rome and now 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.120
 let's mix well so that you 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.320
 dissolve the sugar perfectly and then 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.320
 I put it to boil for 10 minutes 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:15.620
 if you want you can also decide to 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.620
 add a small piece of peel 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.350
 obviously well washed 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:47.250
 put them little I usually put this 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:50.169
 quantity here in in a liter of juice 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:05:02.560
 because otherwise it would become too much 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:05:08.229
 strong now that the sugar dissolved it 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:11.759
 put some fire and don't worry if 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:15.729
 first the sugar did not melt 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:21.939
 just everything right now with the heat yes 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:25.960
 will melt more choice and leave now 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:30.430
 which begins to boil as far as 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.060
 it's about the skins we don't throw away 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:39.279
 we can use or inside the 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.949
 dishwasher as a deodorant so 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.580
 let her smell good inside her 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:49.089
 dishwasher that also to the dishes 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.930
 or we can grate the e 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:55.839
 prepare flavored sugar 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:00.240
 with this sugar then we can use it 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:04.180
 for whatever it is for sweets that 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.870
 for drinks to sweeten ours 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.669
 te and how it is normally used in 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.259
 dreams 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:20.060
 let's go to check 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:21.830
 our point you're starting at 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.889
 to boil 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:29.470
 now we let it boil over low heat 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.470
 very low for 10 minutes 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:44.500
 if you see that the lemon juice 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.539
 it starts to get darker 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.180
 then we explain it immediately because it wants to 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:53.020
 say that the sugar is caramel went 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.440
 and would alter the taste of the 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.099
 of the syrup 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.099
 so I'll explain it right away 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:12.490
 now I let it cool once 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:17.490
 which is cooled I will go to eliminate the 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:20.490
 lemon zest and then I'm going to 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.490
 pot
