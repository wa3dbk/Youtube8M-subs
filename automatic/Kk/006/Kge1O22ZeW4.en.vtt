today and you guys can definitely expect

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.419 
today and you guys can definitely expect
more<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.560> game<00:00:28.710> probably<00:00:28.949> some

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
more on this game probably some

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.980 
more on this game probably some
multiplayer<00:00:29.760> stuff<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.510> because<00:00:30.720> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
multiplayer stuff going on because of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
multiplayer stuff going on because of
course<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.130> main<00:00:32.430> mechanic<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
course that is the main mechanic of the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.600 
course that is the main mechanic of the
game<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.660> all<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.190> much<00:00:35.309> all<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
game it's all or it's pretty much all a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.280 
game it's all or it's pretty much all a
multiplayer<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.329> isn't<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.899> single

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
multiplayer there isn't really a single

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
multiplayer there isn't really a single
player<00:00:37.440> other<00:00:37.710> than<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.309> tutorial<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.629> yeah

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
player other than the tutorial but yeah

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
player other than the tutorial but yeah
so<00:00:40.170> let's<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.530> ahead<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.219> started<00:00:41.280> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so let's go ahead and get this started I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.130 
so let's go ahead and get this started I
probably<00:00:41.879> won't<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.180> talking<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> whole<00:00:42.719> lot<00:00:42.960> in

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
probably won't be talking a whole lot in

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
probably won't be talking a whole lot in
this<00:00:43.290> video<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.030> talking<00:00:45.510> that's

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
this video so if I'm not talking that's

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.180 
this video so if I'm not talking that's
the<00:00:45.870> reason<00:00:46.140> why<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.800> there's<00:00:46.980> lots

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the reason why it's because there's lots

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
the reason why it's because there's lots
of<00:00:47.340> talking<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> tour<00:00:48.629> tutorial

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
of talking going on in the tour tutorial

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.540 
of talking going on in the tour tutorial
and<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.770> don't<00:00:49.950> want<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> interrupt<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and I don't want to interrupt the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.189 
and I don't want to interrupt the
awesomeness<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.270> let's<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.750> ahead<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.989> start

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
awesomeness so let's go ahead and start

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680 
awesomeness so let's go ahead and start
this<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.620> mean<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> should<00:00:53.610> also<00:00:53.730> mention<00:00:53.879> oh<00:00:54.300> no

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.040 
this I mean I should also mention oh no
I<00:00:54.870> didn't<00:00:55.559> used<00:00:55.920> well<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.180> some<00:00:57.600> point<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
I didn't used well at some point in the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.860 
I didn't used well at some point in the
future<00:00:58.160> mankind<00:00:59.160> invents<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> perpetual

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
future mankind invents this perpetual

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560 
future mankind invents this perpetual
energy<00:01:01.140> device<00:01:01.829> its<00:01:02.550> flipped<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
energy device its flipped on and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
energy device its flipped on and
immediately<00:01:04.170> obliterates<00:01:05.159> half<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
immediately obliterates half the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
universe technically it works all the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450 
universe technically it works all the
energy<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.990> once<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.439> helpfully<00:01:11.010> made<00:01:11.250> up

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
energy that once so helpfully made up

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
energy that once so helpfully made up
humans<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> trees<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.780> bras<00:01:13.110> and

humans and trees and bras and
what-have-you<00:01:13.950> instead<00:01:14.640> now<00:01:14.970> condenses<00:01:15.689> in

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
story that's exactly why these monkeys

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.080 
story that's exactly why these monkeys
are<00:01:56.710> fighting<00:01:57.310> each<00:01:57.429> other<00:01:57.579> it's<00:01:57.880> very

interesting<00:01:58.359> now<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.229> course<00:01:59.409> there<00:01:59.679> is<00:01:59.829> still

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
interesting now of course there is still

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.859 
interesting now of course there is still
more<00:02:00.369> distally<00:02:00.819> said<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.299> we're<00:02:01.420> not<00:02:01.539> done<00:02:01.810> yet

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
more distally said so we're not done yet

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.109 
more distally said so we're not done yet
I<00:02:02.289> feel<00:02:03.009> like<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.219> should<00:02:03.399> mention<00:02:03.579> though<00:02:03.880> this

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
I feel like I should mention though this

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.609 
I feel like I should mention though this
is<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.420> first<00:02:04.659> time<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:05.020> have<00:02:05.170> ever<00:02:05.350> played

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619

is the first time I have ever played
with<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:05.950> controller<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:07.209> any<00:02:07.450> videos<00:02:07.840> on

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
with the controller in any videos on

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.630 
with the controller in any videos on
this<00:02:08.140> channel<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:08.530> if<00:02:08.890> there<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.310> some

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
clicking clacking going on that's the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.009 
clicking clacking going on that's the
reason<00:02:11.590> why<00:02:11.739> also<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.790> have<00:02:13.000> not<00:02:13.150> yet<00:02:13.390> asked<00:02:13.840> for
