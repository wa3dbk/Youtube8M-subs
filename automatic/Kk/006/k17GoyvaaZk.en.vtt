00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and I just don't think I could handle it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
and I just don't think I could handle it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.200 
off in real life I just can't think
about<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.860> I've<00:01:43.950> always<00:01:44.189> wondered<00:01:44.670> what

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
about that but I've always wondered what

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.819 
about that but I've always wondered what
it<00:01:45.329> would<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.960> watch<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.320> leg<00:01:46.619> being

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it would be like to watch a leg being

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.270 
it would be like to watch a leg being
amputated<00:01:47.090> Oh<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.750> gnarly<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> probably

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
amputated Oh be gnarly so you probably

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.620 
amputated Oh be gnarly so you probably
won't<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.030> handle<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.479> or

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
won't know if you can handle the or

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.440 
won't know if you can handle the or
until<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.500> nursing<00:01:52.890> clinicals

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
until you do your nursing clinicals

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.910 
until you do your nursing clinicals
that's<00:01:54.450> where<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> found<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> or<00:01:55.409> was<00:01:55.710> not

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
