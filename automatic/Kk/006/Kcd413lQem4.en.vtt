00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.359
 today I'll show you how to make the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.359
 world glider airplane 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.429
 I exaggerate a micro glider that is very 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.340
 Easy you 'll need a little bit 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.869
 I'm going to give you some software here 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.640
 needs a little bit of tape 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.800
 of scissors 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 The first step is to fold sheet of paper 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.710
 in the middle 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.570
 The second step is to draw 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.359
 airplane has to be an airplane with 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.830
 the wing well punctuating in fininha equal 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 The one I'm doing here. 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.860
 use their artistic skills the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.570
 Third step is to cut out the fourth plane 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.850
 step is to do two drugs 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.340
 the first to format the wings and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.489
 second to form a stabilizer 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.829
 that are alone behind the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.500
 fifth step is to put a weight on a ballast 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.960
 the tip of the plane that ballast must 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.850
 make sure that you hold underneath the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.620
 wing of the plane it is balanced and not 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 falls back forward 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.960
 Step 6 is to bend the asia 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.880
 a downward curl 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.070
 the little glider is practically 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.180
 ready and now there are two things that you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.220
 can adjust 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 as you play and see how 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.700
 he behaves 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.250
 the first one if the airplane had 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.830
 fallen too fast you can take a 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.659
 bit of tie to draw a little weight 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.619
 this by cutting off some of that crepe tape 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.080
 at the tip 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.869
 another setting you can make is to change 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.610
 the angle of the horizontal stabilizer 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.549
 rear wings on a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.229
 fact that there there is also a 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.079
 shovel that moves him is there a 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.900
 deep pain and according to her movement 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.470
 the airplane may tilt up or down 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.700
 tilt beneath beautiful yes these are 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.369
 central lines are called 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 horizontal stabilizers 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.840
 mine is already adjusted now its time to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.619
 give a way out to a little place 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.340
 is bigger and is hurling the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.340
 see how it behaves 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.189
 more videos that teach things a lot 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.189
 easy to do but very cool as 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.189
 this one you find in the in the album 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.980
 If you liked this month, do not forget to 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:53.230
 give your young anton and if you go 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.420
 make the barueri at home does not take a 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.790
 photo and put instagram and calm sea 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.189
 Annual world's only score a former coach 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.989
 Annual world and I'll leave here 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.719
 underneath this very cool that no 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.969
 on this side here the video and shows 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.739
 how to make a super paper airplane go 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.199
 very far and flat very well is well 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.439
 bigger and this is an origami and the other 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:16.000
 how to make a homemade parachute is 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.310
 that home you put a weight on 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.079
 throw up and memory enough to 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.219
 fall happy people using a camera 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.219
 It's very cool
