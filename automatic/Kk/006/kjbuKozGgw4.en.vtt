00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.780 
something more I suggest you switch to a
lease<00:04:15.570> horse<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.200> what<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:16.859> lease<00:04:17.190> horse<00:04:17.520> is

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
lease horse and what a lease horse is

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.720 
lease horse and what a lease horse is
it's<00:04:18.120> basically<00:04:18.390> owning<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.410> horse<00:04:19.730> except

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
it's basically owning a horse except

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.290 
it's basically owning a horse except
you're<00:04:21.090> paying<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.870> board<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.890> feed<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
you're paying the board the feed and the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.000 
you're paying the board the feed and the
water<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.930> everything<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.680> training

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
water and everything and the training

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.870 
water and everything and the training
and<00:04:27.260> what<00:04:28.260> you're<00:04:28.710> basically<00:04:29.160> doing

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
and what you're basically doing

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.330 
and what you're basically doing
everything<00:04:30.600> you<00:04:31.230> just<00:04:31.350> don't<00:04:31.620> own<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.100> horse

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
everything you just don't own the horse

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.210 
everything you just don't own the horse
so<00:04:32.940> what<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.510> does<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.350> kind<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.590> teaches<00:04:35.040> them

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
so what it does it kind of teaches them

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.910 
so what it does it kind of teaches them
what<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.700> what<00:04:35.970> owning<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.960> horse<00:04:37.230> feels<00:04:37.620> like
