this<00:00:05.830> is<00:00:06.010> my<00:00:06.160> fish<00:00:06.399> story<00:00:06.840> so<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:09.309> day<00:00:09.550> a<00:00:11.430> guy

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
this is my fish story so one day a guy

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.330 
this is my fish story so one day a guy
wanted<00:00:12.760> to<00:00:12.820> start<00:00:13.060> his<00:00:13.090> aquaponics<00:00:14.340> system

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
wanted to start his aquaponics system

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.109 
wanted to start his aquaponics system
and<00:00:15.900> he<00:00:16.900> went<00:00:17.320> out<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:17.680> he<00:00:17.769> got<00:00:18.670> a<00:00:18.699> fish<00:00:18.880> tank

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
and he went out and he got a fish tank

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.170 
and he went out and he got a fish tank
and<00:00:19.390> he<00:00:19.480> got<00:00:20.320> a<00:00:20.350> setup<00:00:20.740> and<00:00:21.640> he<00:00:21.730> filled<00:00:22.000> it<00:00:22.150> with

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
and he got a setup and he filled it with

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.840 
and he got a setup and he filled it with
water<00:00:22.330> and<00:00:22.720> he<00:00:22.960> waited<00:00:23.140> two<00:00:23.320> days<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.560> D<00:00:24.369> asset

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
water and he waited two days to D asset

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.380 
water and he waited two days to D asset
and<00:00:24.970> then<00:00:25.720> he<00:00:26.140> got<00:00:26.740> gravel<00:00:27.190> in<00:00:27.279> it<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:28.029> a<00:00:28.119> pump

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
and then he got gravel in it and a pump

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.290 
and then he got gravel in it and a pump
and<00:00:28.660> a<00:00:29.320> narrator<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.039> heaters<00:00:30.609> and<00:00:30.910> got<00:00:31.029> it<00:00:31.150> to

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
and a narrator and heaters and got it to

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.599 
and a narrator and heaters and got it to
around<00:00:31.449> 78<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.199> thought<00:00:33.070> that'd<00:00:33.250> be<00:00:33.370> great

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:33.609 
around 78 and thought that'd be great

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.340 
around 78 and thought that'd be great
but<00:00:34.030> he<00:00:34.149> didn't<00:00:34.329> do<00:00:34.420> a<00:00:34.449> lot<00:00:34.600> of<00:00:34.629> research<00:00:35.019> on<00:00:35.319> a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
but he didn't do a lot of research on a

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.869 
but he didn't do a lot of research on a
fish<00:00:36.010> or<00:00:36.399> on<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.649> chemistry<00:00:38.979> of<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.670> water

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
fish or on the chemistry of the water

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.379 
fish or on the chemistry of the water
really<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:41.170> he<00:00:41.499> went<00:00:41.620> out<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.039> he<00:00:42.149> bought<00:00:43.149> like

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.389 
really so he went out and he bought like

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:48.299 
really so he went out and he bought like
five<00:00:43.719> plants<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:45.329> three<00:00:46.329> fish<00:00:47.019> and<00:00:47.620> brought

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
five plants and three fish and brought

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.849 
five plants and three fish and brought
him<00:00:48.460> home<00:00:48.609> and<00:00:48.940> he<00:00:48.999> put<00:00:49.929> him<00:00:50.049> in<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.199> tank<00:00:50.499> and

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
him home and he put him in the tank and

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:59.430 
him home and he put him in the tank and
the<00:00:53.859> fish<00:00:54.069> died<00:00:56.459> 01<00:00:57.870> shortly<00:00:58.870> after<00:00:59.229> he<00:00:59.289> put

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
the fish died 01 shortly after he put

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.310 
the fish died 01 shortly after he put
him<00:00:59.530> in<00:00:59.589> a<00:00:59.679> tank<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.719> two<00:01:01.719> over<00:01:02.109> the<00:01:02.229> night<00:01:02.909> and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
him in a tank and two over the night and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.320 
him in a tank and two over the night and
yeah<00:01:05.340> that<00:01:06.340> really<00:01:06.549> sucked<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.550> he<00:01:09.550> then

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
yeah that really sucked so he then

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.680 
yeah that really sucked so he then
realized<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.990> he<00:01:11.830> should<00:01:11.980> probably<00:01:12.070> check

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
realized that he should probably check

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.090 
realized that he should probably check
the<00:01:13.690> water<00:01:14.020> in<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.230> tank<00:01:14.500> so<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:14.680> went<00:01:14.800> on<00:01:14.890> God

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
the water in the tank so I went on God

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.010 
the water in the tank so I went on God
test<00:01:15.370> kit<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.820> he<00:01:16.000> checked<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.540> ph<00:01:16.780> was

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
test kit and he checked it the ph was

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.910 
test kit and he checked it the ph was
nine<00:01:17.830> point<00:01:18.430> eight<00:01:19.440> which<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.470> really<00:01:20.800> high

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
nine point eight which is really high

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.450 
nine point eight which is really high
that's<00:01:21.760> super<00:01:22.330> alkaline<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.280> supposed<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.370> be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
that's super alkaline and supposed to be

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.970 
that's super alkaline and supposed to be
somewhere<00:01:24.730> between<00:01:24.910> 6.5<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.870> 7.5<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.980> ph

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
somewhere between 6.5 to 7.5 and and ph

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.910 
somewhere between 6.5 to 7.5 and and ph
is<00:01:30.280> kind<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.670> like<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.180> Richter<00:01:31.660> scale<00:01:31.690> so<00:01:32.410> for

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
is kind of like the Richter scale so for

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.760 
is kind of like the Richter scale so for
every<00:01:33.430> point<00:01:33.670> one<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.480> kind<00:01:34.870> of<00:01:34.960> doubles<00:01:35.560> in

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
every point one it kind of doubles in

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.850 
every point one it kind of doubles in
either<00:01:36.120> I'll<00:01:37.120> kindness<00:01:37.750> or<00:01:37.930> acidic<00:01:38.680> pneus

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
either I'll kindness or acidic pneus

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.600 
either I'll kindness or acidic pneus
depending<00:01:39.460> on<00:01:39.580> which<00:01:40.240> way<00:01:40.420> you're<00:01:40.540> going<00:01:40.780> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
depending on which way you're going and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.860 
depending on which way you're going and
I<00:01:42.610> was<00:01:42.760> at<00:01:42.880> 9.8<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.940> was<00:01:45.940> really<00:01:46.240> alkaline

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
I was at 9.8 so I was really alkaline

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.060 
I was at 9.8 so I was really alkaline
and<00:01:47.110> I<00:01:47.830> realized<00:01:48.310> later<00:01:48.820> on<00:01:49.000> that<00:01:50.070> expanded

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
and I realized later on that expanded

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.090 
and I realized later on that expanded
clay<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:52.420> very<00:01:52.750> high<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:54.090> calamity<00:01:55.090> kalindi

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
clay is very high in a calamity kalindi

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.940 
clay is very high in a calamity kalindi
client<00:01:57.100> inity<00:01:57.540> anyway<00:01:58.540> so<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:01.180> was<00:02:02.020> throwing

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
client inity anyway so that was throwing

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.430 
client inity anyway so that was throwing
my<00:02:03.070> ph<00:02:03.400> up<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.909> then<00:02:04.120> i<00:02:04.420> realized<00:02:05.080> i<00:02:05.290> had

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
my ph up and then i realized i had

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.339 
my ph up and then i realized i had
really<00:02:05.710> hard<00:02:06.520> water<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.600> every<00:02:07.810> time<00:02:07.840> I

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
really hard water and so every time I

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.849 
really hard water and so every time I
was<00:02:08.619> adjusting<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:10.149> ph<00:02:10.300> we'd<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:11.079> ph<00:02:11.499> down

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
was adjusting the ph we'd like ph down

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:16.210 
was adjusting the ph we'd like ph down
or<00:02:12.989> trying<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.079> fix<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.469> it<00:02:14.620> would<00:02:14.769> bounce<00:02:14.920> back

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
or trying to fix it it would bounce back

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.780 
or trying to fix it it would bounce back
and<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.750> hardness<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> water<00:02:18.710> year<00:02:19.160> works

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and the hardness of the water year works

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.560 
and the hardness of the water year works
as<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.060> buffer<00:02:20.720> system<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.970> stop<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.120> pH<00:02:23.360> from

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
as a buffer system to stop the pH from

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.880 
as a buffer system to stop the pH from
coming<00:02:23.810> down<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.990> went<00:02:26.990> out<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.530> got<00:02:27.560> more

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
coming down so I went out and I got more

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.840 
coming down so I went out and I got more
fish<00:02:28.160> because<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:30.220> really<00:02:31.220> wanted<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.520> fish<00:02:31.640> my

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
fish because I really wanted to fish my

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.020 
fish because I really wanted to fish my
system<00:02:32.320> but<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:33.500> time<00:02:33.710> I<00:02:34.040> tested<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.850> water

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
system but this time I tested the water

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.150 
system but this time I tested the water
and<00:02:35.210> I<00:02:35.270> brought<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.630> pH<00:02:35.870> down<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.290> like<00:02:36.410> 7.8

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
and I brought the pH down to like 7.8

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.440 
and I brought the pH down to like 7.8
and<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.460> thought<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.850> would<00:02:37.970> do<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.120> trick<00:02:38.240> I

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
and I thought that would do the trick I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.690 
and I thought that would do the trick I
thought<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.810> was<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> pH<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.980> we<00:02:40.100> got<00:02:40.250> some<00:02:40.280> fish

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
thought it was a pH so we got some fish

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.460 
thought it was a pH so we got some fish
some<00:02:41.300> expensive<00:02:41.780> ones<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:43.070> they<00:02:43.190> died<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.470> I

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
some expensive ones and they died and I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.250

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.880 
was very upset and then I went out and I
tested<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.650> water<00:02:51.860> again<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.770> give<00:02:54.770> it

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
tested the water again and I I give it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.760 
tested the water again and I I give it
some<00:02:55.040> more<00:02:55.070> time<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:57.020> every<00:02:57.350> much<00:02:57.530> didn't

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
some more time and I every much didn't

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.490 
some more time and I every much didn't
know<00:02:57.830> what<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.100> do<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:59.720> plants<00:03:00.140> started

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500

and they're doing okay I don't know I
haven't<00:06:07.710> decided<00:06:08.069> yet<00:06:08.340> because<00:06:08.550> they've<00:06:08.639> got

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
haven't decided yet because they've got

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.820 
haven't decided yet because they've got
a<00:06:08.819> bit<00:06:09.000> further<00:06:09.240> to<00:06:09.360> come<00:06:09.900> out<00:06:10.080> then<00:06:10.530> the<00:06:10.680> ones

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
a bit further to come out then the ones

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.860 
a bit further to come out then the ones
did<00:06:11.069> in<00:06:11.129> the<00:06:11.220> dirt<00:06:11.400> so<00:06:12.240> we'll<00:06:12.479> see<00:06:12.690> how<00:06:12.720> it

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
did in the dirt so we'll see how it

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.320 
did in the dirt so we'll see how it
turns<00:06:13.050> out<00:06:13.550> these<00:06:14.550> are<00:06:14.729> things<00:06:15.030> have<00:06:15.210> grown

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
turns out these are things have grown

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.119 
turns out these are things have grown
into<00:06:15.629> the<00:06:15.750> nursery<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.169> I<00:06:16.289> transplanted<00:06:16.740> it

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
into the nursery and I transplanted it

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.369 
into the nursery and I transplanted it
to<00:06:17.250> here<00:06:17.460> and<00:06:17.610> I<00:06:18.360> was<00:06:18.539> less<00:06:18.750> than<00:06:18.780> a<00:06:18.960> week<00:06:19.110> ago

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:19.379 
to here and I was less than a week ago

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.469 
to here and I was less than a week ago
so<00:06:19.530> we're<00:06:19.650> just<00:06:19.800> seeing<00:06:20.009> if<00:06:20.190> they<00:06:20.340> can<00:06:20.479> route

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
so we're just seeing if they can route

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.210 
so we're just seeing if they can route
because<00:06:22.409> they<00:06:22.500> were<00:06:22.590> just<00:06:22.770> in<00:06:22.889> those<00:06:23.009> little

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
because they were just in those little

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.899 
because they were just in those little
Pete<00:06:23.490> balls<00:06:24.270> like<00:06:24.630> pellets<00:06:24.900> so<00:06:25.699> the<00:06:26.699> roots

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
Pete balls like pellets so the roots

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:28.430 
Pete balls like pellets so the roots
were<00:06:27.120> stifled<00:06:27.720> and<00:06:27.930> they<00:06:28.020> didn't<00:06:28.259> grow<00:06:28.349> too

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
were stifled and they didn't grow too

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.969 
were stifled and they didn't grow too
much<00:06:29.030> there's<00:06:30.030> the<00:06:30.210> aquarium<00:06:30.800> there's<00:06:31.800> a<00:06:31.860> bit

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
much there's the aquarium there's a bit

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.219 
much there's the aquarium there's a bit
of<00:06:32.009> a<00:06:32.099> story<00:06:32.340> that<00:06:32.580> goes<00:06:32.699> with<00:06:32.759> that<00:06:32.940> I<00:06:33.330> ran

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
of a story that goes with that I ran

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.089 
of a story that goes with that I ran
into<00:06:34.530> some<00:06:35.060> tough<00:06:36.060> times<00:06:36.710> the<00:06:37.710> last<00:06:37.830> couple

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
into some tough times the last couple

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:41.960 
into some tough times the last couple
weeks<00:06:39.020> when<00:06:40.020> last<00:06:40.319> in<00:06:40.590> part<00:06:40.800> 9<00:06:41.009> I<00:06:41.370> showed<00:06:41.789> us

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
weeks when last in part 9 I showed us

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.709 
weeks when last in part 9 I showed us
getting<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.389> aquarium<00:06:42.870> ready<00:06:43.819> I<00:06:44.819> got<00:06:45.630> the

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
getting the aquarium ready I got the

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.040 
getting the aquarium ready I got the
gravel<00:06:46.020> and<00:06:46.169> I<00:06:46.229> cleaned<00:06:46.500> everything<00:06:46.740> up<00:06:47.039> and<00:06:48.050> I

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
gravel and I cleaned everything up and I

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.709 
gravel and I cleaned everything up and I
thought<00:06:49.530> I<00:06:49.590> was<00:06:49.770> ready<00:06:49.889> to<00:06:50.099> go<00:06:50.219> and<00:06:51.919> then<00:06:52.919> I

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:53.719 
thought I was ready to go and then I

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.719 
thought I was ready to go and then I
wasn't
