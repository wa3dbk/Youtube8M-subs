talked about previously until sunday
midday<00:03:32.709> sunday<00:03:33.190> or<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:33.579> that<00:03:33.729> moves<00:03:33.970> in

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
midday sunday or so that moves in

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.360 
midday sunday or so that moves in
southwest<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.470> myrtle<00:03:35.859> beach<00:03:36.010> south<00:03:36.310> carolina

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
southwest of myrtle beach south carolina

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.780 
southwest of myrtle beach south carolina
and<00:03:37.209> that's<00:03:37.870> enough<00:03:38.169> time<00:03:38.519> for<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.639> do<00:03:39.760> a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
and that's enough time for to do a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.099 
and that's enough time for to do a
little<00:03:40.060> something<00:03:40.510> while<00:03:40.659> it's<00:03:40.810> over<00:03:41.019> the

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
little something while it's over the

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.379 
little something while it's over the
warm<00:03:41.290> water<00:03:41.560> here<00:03:41.919> but<00:03:42.340> by<00:03:42.909> the<00:03:43.000> time<00:03:43.090> it

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
warm water here but by the time it

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.210 
warm water here but by the time it
passes<00:03:43.629> about<00:03:44.049> this<00:03:44.229> point<00:03:44.560> off<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.799> coast

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
passes about this point off the coast

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.089 
passes about this point off the coast
the<00:03:45.760> shelf<00:03:46.090> waters<00:03:46.540> are<00:03:46.780> much<00:03:47.349> colder<00:03:47.650> and

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
the shelf waters are much colder and

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.430 
the shelf waters are much colder and
would<00:03:48.459> likely<00:03:48.669> limit<00:03:49.419> intensification<00:03:49.900> or

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
would likely limit intensification or

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.619 
would likely limit intensification or
cause<00:03:50.829> weakening<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.790> storm<00:03:52.090> prior<00:03:52.389> to

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
cause weakening of the storm prior to

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.599 
cause weakening of the storm prior to
landfall<00:03:53.109> so<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:53.859> is<00:03:53.979> the<00:03:54.129> good<00:03:54.250> news<00:03:54.430> is

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
landfall so that is the good news is

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.219 
landfall so that is the good news is
that<00:03:54.639> even<00:03:55.030> if<00:03:55.150> this<00:03:55.299> strengthens<00:03:55.780> out<00:03:55.959> here

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
that even if this strengthens out here

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.990 
that even if this strengthens out here
there<00:03:56.379> is<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.500> barrier<00:03:56.829> of<00:03:57.099> cold<00:03:57.370> water<00:03:57.579> that<00:03:57.849> is

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
there is a barrier of cold water that is

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.449 
there is a barrier of cold water that is
going<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.299> be<00:03:58.419> moving<00:03:58.569> over<00:03:58.900> slowly<00:03:59.560> before

moving<00:04:02.139> slowly<00:04:02.379> that<00:04:02.709> will<00:04:02.829> allow<00:04:03.040> time<00:04:03.099> for

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
moving slowly that will allow time for

could<00:04:25.630> be<00:04:25.659> a<00:04:25.779> period<00:04:26.200> of<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.349> couple<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.830> days

could be a period of a couple of days
straight<00:04:27.580> where<00:04:28.210> there<00:04:28.390> is<00:04:28.510> heavy<00:04:28.780> rains<00:04:29.170> over

the South and North Carolina's coastline
