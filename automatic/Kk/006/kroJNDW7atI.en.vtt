talking<00:00:03.810> about<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.200> first<00:00:04.470> assault<00:00:04.770> rifle

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
talking about the first assault rifle

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:21.130 
talking about the first assault rifle
that<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.339> unlock<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.790> multiplayer<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.930> mtar

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.529 

now<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.199> mtar<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> subset<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.939> tar-21

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
now the mtar is a subset of the tar-21

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.439 
now the mtar is a subset of the tar-21
or<00:00:25.260> simply<00:00:25.740> tavor<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.250> an<00:00:26.340> Israeli<00:00:26.880> bullpup

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
assault rifle chambered for 5.56 which

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.790 
assault rifle chambered for 5.56 which
is<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> nato<00:00:30.630> standard<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.260> most<00:00:31.380> assault

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
rifles now you may be wondering what's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.360 
rifles now you may be wondering what's
the<00:00:33.750> difference<00:00:34.110> between<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.530> mtar<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the difference between the mtar and the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
the difference between the mtar and the
tar<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:35.940> people<00:00:36.210> may<00:00:36.329> remember<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> tar<00:00:37.020> for

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
tar some people may remember the tar for

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.930 
tar some people may remember the tar for
modern<00:00:37.530> warfare<00:00:37.680> 2<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.670> biggest

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
modern warfare 2 and the biggest

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.790 
modern warfare 2 and the biggest
difference<00:00:39.059> between<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.660> two<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.350> mtar

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
difference between the two is the mtar

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
difference between the two is the mtar
actually<00:00:41.160> stands<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:41.489> micro<00:00:42.000> tavor<00:00:42.360> meaning

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
actually stands for micro tavor meaning

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.330 
actually stands for micro tavor meaning
that<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> barrel<00:00:43.350> size<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.739> about<00:00:43.860> 5<00:00:44.309> inches

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that the barrel size is about 5 inches

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.819 
that the barrel size is about 5 inches
shorter<00:00:45.030> which<00:00:45.600> actually<00:00:45.809> puts<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.379> bullpup

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
shorter which actually puts this bullpup

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
shorter which actually puts this bullpup

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
webmin in the carbine category now a lot

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.150 
webmin in the carbine category now a lot
of<00:00:48.899> people<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.350> questions<00:00:49.739> when<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> comes

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
of people have questions when it comes

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.560 
of people have questions when it comes
to<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> carbon<00:00:50.670> category<00:00:51.149> what's<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
to the carbon category what's the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.150 
to the carbon category what's the
purpose<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.110> carbine<00:00:52.469> what's<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> purpose

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
purpose of a carbine what's the purpose

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.650 
purpose of a carbine what's the purpose
of<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.550> cutting<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> barrel<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.539> an

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
of just cutting the barrel off of an

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.360 
of just cutting the barrel off of an
assault<00:00:54.960> rifle<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.530> making<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> shorter

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
assault rifle and making it shorter

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.130 
assault rifle and making it shorter
obviously<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> makes<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.719> much<00:00:57.870> more

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
obviously it makes it much more

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
obviously it makes it much more
effective<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.890> close-quarter<00:00:59.370> scenarios

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
effective in close-quarter scenarios

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
effective in close-quarter scenarios
because<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> maneuver<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.870> lot<00:01:00.989> better

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
because you can maneuver it a lot better

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
because you can maneuver it a lot better
but<00:01:01.680> there's<00:01:01.859> certainly<00:01:02.129> better<00:01:02.340> smgs<00:01:03.000> that

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but there's certainly better smgs that

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
but there's certainly better smgs that
perform<00:01:03.690> better<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.080> situation<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
perform better in that situation and the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.770 
perform better in that situation and the
reason<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> lot<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> militaries<00:01:06.450> prefer

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
reason that a lot of militaries prefer

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.480 
reason that a lot of militaries prefer
carbines<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.189> standardize

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
carbines is because you can standardize

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.120 
carbines is because you can standardize
your<00:01:08.850> ammo<00:01:09.150> both<00:01:09.659> weapons<00:01:09.930> both<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> mtar<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
your ammo both weapons both the mtar and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.520 
your ammo both weapons both the mtar and
the<00:01:11.220> tar<00:01:11.400> carry<00:01:11.729> 5.56<00:01:12.570> ammo<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.350> lot<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the tar carry 5.56 ammo and a lot of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.070 
the tar carry 5.56 ammo and a lot of
smgs<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.250> specific<00:01:14.850> cartridges<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.840> they

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
smgs have specific cartridges that they

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
smgs have specific cartridges that they
use<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.100> instead<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.369> carrying<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.790> two

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
use so instead of carrying do two

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.609 
use so instead of carrying do two
different<00:01:18.210> types<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.630> ammo<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
different types of ammo you know a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.380 
different types of ammo you know a
military<00:01:20.070> only<00:01:20.250> has<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> carry<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.909> now

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
military only has to carry one now

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.399 
military only has to carry one now
what's<00:01:21.570> interesting<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
what's interesting when you have a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
what's interesting when you have a
bullpup<00:01:23.009> style<00:01:23.340> carbine<00:01:23.759> well<00:01:24.450> now<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.630> have

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
bullpup style carbine well now you have

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.120 
bullpup style carbine well now you have
a<00:01:24.869> weapon<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.140> feels<00:01:25.409> even<00:01:25.560> shorter<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.070> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
a weapon that feels even shorter now you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.730 
a weapon that feels even shorter now you
have<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> weapon<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.320> has<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> little<00:01:28.590> bit

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
have a weapon that is has a little bit

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.280 
have a weapon that is has a little bit
longer<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.340> range<00:01:29.579> than<00:01:29.880> an<00:01:30.090> SMG<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
longer of a range than an SMG but it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.050 
longer of a range than an SMG but it
feels<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.829> an<00:01:31.950> SMG<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> barrel<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
feels like an SMG because the barrel is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
feels like an SMG because the barrel is
further<00:01:33.570> back<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> weapon<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
further back into the weapon if you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.260 
further back into the weapon if you
don't<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> bullpup<00:01:35.759> weapon<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
don't know what a bullpup weapon is

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.499 
don't know what a bullpup weapon is
that's<00:01:36.930> where<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.640> firing<00:01:38.640> action<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.270> the

going into the buttstock where's
conventional<00:01:44.610> weapons<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.390> all

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
conventional weapons at all it's all

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.810 
conventional weapons at all it's all
forward<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.829> buttstock<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.430> all<00:01:47.549> kind<00:01:47.759> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
forward and the buttstock is all kind of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.539 
forward and the buttstock is all kind of
extra<00:01:48.270> space<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.920> trade-off<00:01:50.520> is

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
extra space now that the trade-off is

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.149 
extra space now that the trade-off is
that<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.829> customizable<00:01:52.829> buttstock

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
that you get a a customizable buttstock

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710 
that you get a a customizable buttstock
with<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> conventional<00:01:53.850> weapon<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.509> most

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
with the conventional weapon in most

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
with the conventional weapon in most
cases<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.290> adjustable<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.790> think

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
cases it's adjustable and I think

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.399 
cases it's adjustable and I think
traditional<00:01:57.840> weapons<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> lot<00:01:58.380> more

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
traditional weapons are a lot more

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.679 
traditional weapons are a lot more
ergonomic<00:01:59.130> there<00:01:59.939> are<00:02:00.000> also<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.240> lot<00:02:00.299> more

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
ergonomic there are also a lot more

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.679 
ergonomic there are also a lot more
ambidextrous<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.340> still<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> lot<00:02:03.659> of

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
ambidextrous but still you have a lot of

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.999 
ambidextrous but still you have a lot of
benefits<00:02:04.079> when<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.290> comes<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> weapon<00:02:04.860> like

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
benefits when it comes to a weapon like

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.219 
benefits when it comes to a weapon like
this<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:06.119> also<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.540> interesting<00:02:07.079> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
this and it's also really interesting to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.020 
this and it's also really interesting to
see<00:02:07.380> how<00:02:07.500> these<00:02:07.680> different<00:02:07.799> developers<00:02:08.520> take

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
see how these different developers take

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.600 
see how these different developers take
on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> whole<00:02:09.509> bullpup<00:02:10.050> configuration<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
on the whole bullpup configuration and a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.309 
on the whole bullpup configuration and a
lot<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.970> developers<00:02:12.420> including

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
lot of developers including

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.229 
lot of developers including
one<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:14.310> resulted<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.939> bullpup

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
one have resulted the bullpup

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.449 
one have resulted the bullpup
configuration<00:02:15.269> in<00:02:16.049> better<00:02:16.439> hipfire<00:02:16.920> which<00:02:17.280> is

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
configuration in better hipfire which is

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.339 
configuration in better hipfire which is
true<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:18.030> weapon<00:02:18.209> actually<00:02:18.629> shares<00:02:18.900> some<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
true this weapon actually shares some of

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.839 
true this weapon actually shares some of
the<00:02:19.409> best<00:02:19.560> hip<00:02:19.709> firing<00:02:19.920> assault<00:02:20.310> rifle<00:02:20.639> class

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the best hip firing assault rifle class

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.429 
the best hip firing assault rifle class
and<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.150> they<00:02:21.239> skipped<00:02:21.569> over<00:02:21.689> that<00:02:21.870> idea<00:02:22.290> when

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
and if they skipped over that idea when

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.920 
and if they skipped over that idea when
it<00:02:22.530> came<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.829> SMR<00:02:23.249> but<00:02:23.790> hey<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.659> got<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
it came to the SMR but hey you got to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.379 
it came to the SMR but hey you got to
keep<00:02:25.049> balance<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.499> mind<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.700> also<00:02:26.999> it

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
keep balance in mind and also it

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.839 
keep balance in mind and also it
translates<00:02:27.930> into<00:02:28.139> slower<00:02:28.530> reload<00:02:29.069> time<00:02:29.280> which

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
translates into slower reload time which

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.640 
translates into slower reload time which
I<00:02:29.969> don't<00:02:30.030> necessarily<00:02:30.359> agree<00:02:30.989> with<00:02:31.230> when<00:02:31.590> you

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
I don't necessarily agree with when you

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.319 
I don't necessarily agree with when you
have<00:02:31.859> somebody<00:02:32.159> who's<00:02:32.700> only<00:02:33.030> use

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
have somebody who's only use

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.959 
have somebody who's only use
conventional<00:02:33.629> weapons<00:02:34.139> their<00:02:34.260> entire<00:02:34.500> life

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969 
conventional weapons their entire life

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.910 
conventional weapons their entire life
use<00:02:35.969> a<00:02:36.329> bullpup<00:02:36.750> weapon<00:02:37.109> I<00:02:37.230> think<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> reload

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
use a bullpup weapon I think the reload

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.679 
use a bullpup weapon I think the reload
time<00:02:37.950> for<00:02:38.370> them<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.760> going<00:02:38.909> to<00:02:38.969> be<00:02:39.120> greater

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
time for them is going to be greater

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.179 
time for them is going to be greater
because<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.379> completely<00:02:40.769> different

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
because it's a completely different

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.190 
because it's a completely different
style<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.909> reloading<00:02:42.299> but<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.079> get

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
style of reloading but if you get

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.659 
style of reloading but if you get
somebody<00:02:43.499> from<00:02:43.590> an<00:02:43.769> Austrian<00:02:44.280> army<00:02:44.459> or

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:44.669 
somebody from an Austrian army or

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.640 
somebody from an Austrian army or
somebody<00:02:44.969> from<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.209> Israeli<00:02:45.569> army<00:02:46.019> I'm<00:02:46.319> sure

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
somebody from the Israeli army I'm sure

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.259 
somebody from the Israeli army I'm sure
that<00:02:46.889> they<00:02:46.980> could<00:02:47.159> reload<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> bullpup<00:02:47.909> weapons

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
that they could reload a bullpup weapons

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.509 
that they could reload a bullpup weapons
just<00:02:48.389> as<00:02:48.569> fast<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:48.989> someone<00:02:49.400> experienced<00:02:50.400> with

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
just as fast as someone experienced with

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.039 
just as fast as someone experienced with
a<00:02:50.549> conventional<00:02:50.939> weapon<00:02:51.419> could<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.659> reloaded

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
a conventional weapon could be reloaded

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.020 
a conventional weapon could be reloaded
but<00:02:52.230> that's<00:02:52.500> what<00:02:52.620> developers<00:02:53.129> have<00:02:53.370> traded

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
but that's what developers have traded

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.339 
but that's what developers have traded
off<00:02:54.269> it's<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.599> trade-off<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.049> get<00:02:55.169> better

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
off it's a trade-off you get better

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.649 
off it's a trade-off you get better
hipfire<00:02:55.769> but<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:56.639> get<00:02:56.730> slower<00:02:57.030> reload<00:02:57.480> time

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
hipfire but you get slower reload time

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.899 
hipfire but you get slower reload time
now<00:02:58.349> another<00:02:58.620> interesting<00:02:58.859> thing<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.549> is

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
now another interesting thing that is

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.209 
now another interesting thing that is
specific<00:03:00.449> to<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.659> micro<00:03:01.049> tavor<00:03:01.439> is<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:02.099> it

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
specific to the micro tavor is that it

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.559 
specific to the micro tavor is that it
has<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> conversion<00:03:02.819> kit<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.209> where<00:03:03.329> you<00:03:03.419> can

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
has a conversion kit to where you can

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.649 
has a conversion kit to where you can
turn<00:03:03.719> it<00:03:03.780> from<00:03:04.409> being<00:03:04.620> chambered<00:03:04.919> in<00:03:05.159> 5.56<00:03:06.060> to

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
turn it from being chambered in 5.56 to

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.720 
turn it from being chambered in 5.56 to
being<00:03:06.870> chambered<00:03:07.079> in<00:03:07.290> 9<00:03:07.469> millimeter<00:03:07.949> and<00:03:08.159> for

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
being chambered in 9 millimeter and for

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.339 
being chambered in 9 millimeter and for
those<00:03:08.819> who<00:03:09.000> don't<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.239> nine-millimeter<00:03:10.019> mo

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
those who don't know nine-millimeter mo

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.839 
those who don't know nine-millimeter mo
is<00:03:10.530> pretty<00:03:10.769> damn<00:03:10.949> cheap<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.400> usually<00:03:11.669> used

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
is pretty damn cheap it's usually used

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.360 
is pretty damn cheap it's usually used
for<00:03:11.969> most<00:03:12.239> pistol<00:03:12.629> rounds<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.739> why<00:03:13.889> did<00:03:14.280> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
for most pistol rounds so why did the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.069 
for most pistol rounds so why did the
Israeli<00:03:14.760> developers<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.389> that<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.659> mind<00:03:15.840> why

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
Israeli developers have that in mind why

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.149 
Israeli developers have that in mind why
did<00:03:16.199> they<00:03:16.319> do<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.530> when<00:03:16.799> they<00:03:16.889> made<00:03:17.040> this

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
did they do that when they made this

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.619 
did they do that when they made this
weapon<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.639> think<00:03:17.879> it's<00:03:17.970> because<00:03:18.090> they<00:03:18.419> just

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
weapon I think it's because they just

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.050 
weapon I think it's because they just
they<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.169> had<00:03:19.379> cost<00:03:19.859> in<00:03:20.220> mind<00:03:20.790> when<00:03:20.970> they

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
they really had cost in mind when they

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.429 
they really had cost in mind when they
were<00:03:21.150> making<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.479> weapon<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.290> makes

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
were making this weapon and that makes

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.830 
were making this weapon and that makes
it<00:03:22.590> extremely<00:03:22.979> appealing<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.090> military<00:03:24.599> and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
it extremely appealing to military and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.899 
it extremely appealing to military and
police<00:03:25.049> organizations<00:03:25.799> but<00:03:26.609> none<00:03:26.759> of<00:03:26.790> that

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
police organizations but none of that

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.759 
police organizations but none of that
really<00:03:27.030> translates<00:03:27.689> into<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.199> game<00:03:28.379> I<00:03:28.409> mean<00:03:28.650> I

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
really translates into the game I mean I

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.499 
really translates into the game I mean I
think<00:03:28.799> if<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.159> had<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> buy<00:03:29.579> ammo<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.299> game

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:30.509 
think if you had to buy ammo in the game

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:31.879 
think if you had to buy ammo in the game
this<00:03:30.750> weapon<00:03:30.989> would<00:03:31.109> certainly<00:03:31.409> be<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> lot

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
this weapon would certainly be a lot

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.949 
this weapon would certainly be a lot
more<00:03:31.919> appealing<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.519> lot<00:03:32.729> more<00:03:32.879> Bigley<00:03:33.269> but

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
more appealing to a lot more Bigley but

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:34.879 
more appealing to a lot more Bigley but
that's<00:03:34.079> not<00:03:34.169> the<00:03:34.290> case<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:34.500> let's<00:03:34.650> talk<00:03:34.769> about

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
that's not the case so let's talk about

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.009 
that's not the case so let's talk about
some<00:03:35.099> of<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.250> stats<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.759> the<00:03:36.269> game<00:03:36.449> this

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
some of the stats in the game this

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.800 
some of the stats in the game this
weapon<00:03:37.199> does<00:03:37.530> 40<00:03:38.040> damage<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.579> close<00:03:38.849> but<00:03:39.599> does

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
weapon does 40 damage up close but does

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.869 
weapon does 40 damage up close but does
24<00:03:40.290> damage<00:03:40.620> at<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.799> distance<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.729> means

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
24 damage at a distance so that means

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.240 
24 damage at a distance so that means
it's<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.120> three<00:03:42.359> bullet<00:03:42.659> kill<00:03:42.870> up<00:03:43.079> close<00:03:43.139> a<00:03:43.680> five

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
it's a three bullet kill up close a five

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.499 
it's a three bullet kill up close a five
bullet<00:03:44.609> killed<00:03:44.819> when<00:03:44.970> you're<00:03:45.090> far<00:03:45.269> away<00:03:45.299> but

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509 
bullet killed when you're far away but

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.569 
bullet killed when you're far away but
there<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.019> mid-range<00:03:46.560> somewhere<00:03:47.459> in

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
there is a mid-range somewhere in

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.159 
there is a mid-range somewhere in
between<00:03:47.669> to<00:03:48.060> which<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.299> can<00:03:48.419> get<00:03:48.509> a<00:03:48.569> four

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
between to which you can get a four

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.300 
between to which you can get a four
bullet<00:03:49.470> kill<00:03:49.620> now<00:03:49.769> i'm<00:03:49.859> not<00:03:49.979> sure<00:03:50.099> what<00:03:50.189> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
bullet kill now i'm not sure what the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.640 
bullet kill now i'm not sure what the
specific<00:03:50.459> damages<00:03:51.209> for<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.509> but<00:03:52.379> there<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.620> a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
specific damages for that but there is a

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.499 
specific damages for that but there is a
mid-range<00:03:53.099> for<00:03:53.519> bullet<00:03:53.849> kill<00:03:54.000> option<00:03:54.389> with

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:54.509 
mid-range for bullet kill option with

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.899 
mid-range for bullet kill option with
this<00:03:54.659> weapon<00:03:55.099> like<00:03:56.099> i<00:03:56.250> said<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.579> has<00:03:56.729> the

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
this weapon like i said it has the

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.030 
this weapon like i said it has the
slowest<00:03:57.449> one<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.139> slowest<00:03:58.530> reload<00:03:58.859> time

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
slowest one of the slowest reload time

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.589 
slowest one of the slowest reload time
in<00:03:59.189> the<00:03:59.250> assault<00:03:59.459> rifle<00:03:59.489> class<00:03:59.909> in<00:04:00.269> fact<00:04:00.479> the

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
in the assault rifle class in fact the

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.809 
in the assault rifle class in fact the
only<00:04:00.629> weapon<00:04:01.229> that's<00:04:01.349> slower<00:04:01.620> than<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:02.009> as

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
only weapon that's slower than this as

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.670 
only weapon that's slower than this as
far<00:04:03.030> as<00:04:03.060> reloading<00:04:03.599> is<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.810> SMR<00:04:04.290> which<00:04:04.530> is

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
far as reloading is the SMR which is

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.499 
far as reloading is the SMR which is
also<00:04:04.949> a<00:04:05.129> bullpup<00:04:05.519> weapon<00:04:05.909> so<00:04:06.090> go<00:04:06.329> figure

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:06.509 
also a bullpup weapon so go figure

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:07.999 
also a bullpup weapon so go figure
that's<00:04:06.840> one<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.109> drawbacks<00:04:07.229> they<00:04:07.680> had<00:04:07.799> for

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.009 
that's one of the drawbacks they had for

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.039 
that's one of the drawbacks they had for
this<00:04:08.069> configuration<00:04:08.479> but<00:04:09.479> it<00:04:09.659> also<00:04:09.810> has

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
this configuration but it also has

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.990 
this configuration but it also has
pretty<00:04:10.319> significantly<00:04:10.949> good<00:04:11.250> hipfire<00:04:11.789> for

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
pretty significantly good hipfire for

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.279 
pretty significantly good hipfire for
the<00:04:12.060> assault<00:04:12.299> rifle<00:04:12.569> class<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.109> that's

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:13.289 
the assault rifle class so that's

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:14.420 
the assault rifle class so that's
something<00:04:13.439> to<00:04:13.560> consider<00:04:13.739> as<00:04:14.009> well<00:04:14.310> when

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
something to consider as well when

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.920 
something to consider as well when
you're<00:04:14.549> choosing<00:04:14.699> this<00:04:14.909> weapon<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.419> they

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
you're choosing this weapon and they

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.099 
you're choosing this weapon and they
stay<00:04:16.139> pretty<00:04:16.620> true<00:04:16.949> to<00:04:16.979> what<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.430> carbine

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
stay pretty true to what the carbine

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.060 
stay pretty true to what the carbine
weapon<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.229> supposed<00:04:19.469> to<00:04:19.560> be<00:04:19.650> which<00:04:19.829> is<00:04:19.859> a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
weapon is supposed to be which is a

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.459 
weapon is supposed to be which is a
close<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.459> mid<00:04:20.609> range<00:04:20.789> weapon<00:04:21.180> now<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:22.139> close

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
close to mid range weapon now in close

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:23.810 
close to mid range weapon now in close
range<00:04:22.590> going<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:22.979> be<00:04:23.039> beat<00:04:23.219> out<00:04:23.370> by<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.550> lot<00:04:23.729> of

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
range going to be beat out by a lot of

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.019 
range going to be beat out by a lot of
SMG<00:04:24.090> simply<00:04:24.570> because<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.990> sheer<00:04:25.760> fire<00:04:26.760> rate

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:27.029 
SMG simply because of sheer fire rate

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.470 
SMG simply because of sheer fire rate
this<00:04:27.180> has

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
this has

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.810 
this has
720<00:04:28.170> round<00:04:28.380> per<00:04:28.950> minute<00:04:29.190> fire<00:04:29.370> rate<00:04:29.580> put

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
720 round per minute fire rate put

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.890 
720 round per minute fire rate put
obviously<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.330> doesn't<00:04:30.450> even<00:04:30.660> come<00:04:30.870> close

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
obviously that doesn't even come close

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.350 
obviously that doesn't even come close
to<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.380> Scorpion<00:04:31.830> with<00:04:31.980> its<00:04:32.160> massive<00:04:32.520> 1200

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
to the Scorpion with its massive 1200

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.450 
to the Scorpion with its massive 1200
and<00:04:33.510> up<00:04:33.630> so<00:04:34.260> when<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.560> comes<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.010> spray<00:04:35.280> and

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
and up so when it comes to the spray and

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.250 
and up so when it comes to the spray and
pray<00:04:35.490> you're<00:04:36.000> probably<00:04:36.240> going<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.660> lose<00:04:36.840> but

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
pray you're probably going to lose but

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.420 
pray you're probably going to lose but
this<00:04:37.500> does<00:04:37.680> have<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.890> lot<00:04:38.010> more<00:04:38.160> reach<00:04:38.400> than

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
this does have a lot more reach than

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.790 
this does have a lot more reach than
other<00:04:38.910> smgs<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.630> now<00:04:39.840> it's<00:04:39.960> pretty<00:04:40.230> bouncy<00:04:40.500> to

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
other smgs to now it's pretty bouncy to

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.990 
other smgs to now it's pretty bouncy to
worry<00:04:40.950> cool<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:41.460> can<00:04:41.670> be<00:04:41.790> hard<00:04:41.970> to

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
worry cool and this can be hard to

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.130 
worry cool and this can be hard to
control<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.420> you're<00:04:42.510> going<00:04:42.600> for<00:04:42.750> those<00:04:42.900> long

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
control if you're going for those long

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.720 
control if you're going for those long
range<00:04:43.380> shots<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.010> if<00:04:44.130> you're<00:04:44.220> going<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.400> go<00:04:44.520> for

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
range shots so if you're going to go for

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.850 
range shots so if you're going to go for
a<00:04:44.760> long<00:04:44.880> range<00:04:45.060> shot<00:04:45.330> it's<00:04:46.230> number<00:04:46.590> one<00:04:46.740> you

a long range shot it's number one you

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.810 
a long range shot it's number one you
need<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.070> consider<00:04:47.340> that's<00:04:47.550> going<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.730> be<00:04:47.790> a

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
need to consider that's going to be a

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.190 
need to consider that's going to be a
five<00:04:48.060> bullet<00:04:48.330> kill<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.720> need<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.960> consider

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
five bullet kill so you need to consider

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.940 
five bullet kill so you need to consider
if<00:04:49.290> they're<00:04:49.410> actually<00:04:49.620> going<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.800> be<00:04:49.830> holding

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
if they're actually going to be holding

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.200 
if they're actually going to be holding
still<00:04:50.220> long<00:04:50.400> enough<00:04:50.430> for<00:04:50.730> you<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.820> kill<00:04:51.060> them

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
still long enough for you to kill them

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.210 
still long enough for you to kill them
and<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.900> also<00:04:52.050> need<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.350> burst<00:04:52.680> because<00:04:52.890> this

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
and you also need to burst because this

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.310
