00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello, today I want to test 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.480
 urine you're an american juice company model 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.730
 with aquarium si 01 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.620
 since we have here pilate first 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.280
 turn I want to drank at least just such 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.509
 here is a small branch of a fallen tree 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.090
 let's see how it works in principle 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:32.579
 of course not so hot which saw but so 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:33.180
 less need to check it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.160
 uncomfortable 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.170
 but no less saws, that is, to say 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 that she doesn’t saw too 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.559
 a decent hacksaw would work faster 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.559
 but none the less 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.280
 very cool tired honestly i'm not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 I know how to keep hold with both hands 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.589
 but fatigue is already strong 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 felt 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.300
 I will not finish just as a sample 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 showed you that in principle to cut 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.640
 deep enough about full width 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.550
 I basically managed this layout 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.060
 that in principle she saws say that 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.450
 saw non-working can not small branches I 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.580
 I think so here with a bang will 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.000
 bounce well it is clear that such a branch 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.840
 can and cut in principle saw 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.310
 medium quality workers 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.560
 well let's chop up a little now 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.369
 of course it's not exactly a shrub it's in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.140
 Generally the tree 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.390
 but anyway, let's see how much 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.789
 Worker is a layout namely in terms of felling. 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.060
 In principle, these branches are cut 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.060
 easy 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.320
 about the return is not a big return there 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.709
 but not so much so that the arm twisted 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.739
 I can’t say just ride 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.910
 not very comfortable to stand strongly i stand in 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.860
 Generally knee-deep in the snow and uncomfortable 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.280
 invested to invest in this match it's like 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.000
 I already said in the review when I did the review 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.530
 this layout is very light weight 368 grams 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.900
 therefore you have to apply 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.900
 some effort let's chop another 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.240
 here on the bend 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.350
 bend as you can see too pretty 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.880
 well maintained bent but 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.190
 back and you sort of deformation not 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.890
 happens that is plastic enough 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.330
 all I have it is great curved and 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.330
 returned back to the same position 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:12.150
 see how bends that is right now 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.989
 I already feel certain risks 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:20.080
 I'm starting to fear breaking him because 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.700
 she just really bends the match it 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.230
 certainly very thin and two millimeters 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.090
 here is the thickness in the butt 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.190
 and accordingly for trees of course 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.030
 It is not very suitable although the principle 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.450
 It cuts as though in itself it is a tree 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.450
 not bad 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.640
 very uncomfortable for me to chop 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:57.580
 let's look at the cutting edge with 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:00.520
 she basically nothing happened but 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.550
 here there is a small note 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.580
 see what was actually required 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.580
 to prove 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:14.700
 see that is to say solid big 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.650
 trees is a layout and 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.840
 it should not work purely for 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.820
 bush 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.090
 but not broken yet nowhere 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:30.120
 deformed on this side that is 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:32.740
 normal form has an even blade here 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:39.040
 that is, in principle, it is for some quite 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:41.800
 small branches just from the shrub well 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.370
 this is how this coin works 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.770
 once trees about shrubs in 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.190
 Basically, everything is fine . I want to say 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.530
 what is now -10 degrees so of course 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.260
 this wood is not what you will 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.390
 hack in the summer and the conditions you will have 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.220
 better knee-deep in the snow you stand not 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:07.330
 you will be like me now 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:11.940
 urine test from juice company so fahr ems 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.940
 01 thank you for your attention and goodbye
