says<00:00:57.109> so<00:00:58.789> my<00:00:59.789> main<00:01:00.000> concern<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.739> obviously

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
says so my main concern is obviously

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.520 
says so my main concern is obviously
magnetic<00:01:02.850> fields<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.439> I'm

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
magnetic fields and this is what I'm

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.910 
magnetic fields and this is what I'm
going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.710> show<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> I've<00:01:07.439> got<00:01:07.650> my<00:01:07.740> laptop

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
going to show you so I've got my laptop

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.359 
going to show you so I've got my laptop
here<00:01:08.369> which<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.360> switched<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.369> my

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
here which is switched on and my

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.760 
here which is switched on and my
Trifield<00:01:11.909> meter<00:01:12.409> got<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
Trifield meter got to put on the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
Trifield meter got to put on the
magnetic<00:01:14.040> field<00:01:14.509> setting<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.869> we're<00:01:16.530> looking

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
magnetic field setting so we're looking

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.330 
magnetic field setting so we're looking
at<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> top<00:01:17.189> scale<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.729> between<00:01:17.939> 0<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:19.340> 100

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
at the top scale here between 0 and 100

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.410 
at the top scale here between 0 and 100
it<00:01:20.640> goes<00:01:20.850> from<00:01:21.000> 0<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> 100<00:01:22.170> yeah<00:01:22.890> which<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.790> mini

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it goes from 0 to 100 yeah which is mini

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.740 
it goes from 0 to 100 yeah which is mini
gaps<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.009> we're<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.820> I'm

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
gaps so what we're going to do is I'm

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
gaps so what we're going to do is I'm
gonna<00:01:27.930> put<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:30.200> Trifield<00:01:31.200> meter<00:01:31.970> underneath

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
gonna put this Trifield meter underneath

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.380 
gonna put this Trifield meter underneath
the<00:01:33.420> laptop<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.470> see<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:34.770> happens<00:01:34.799> so

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
the laptop here and see what happens so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.710 
the laptop here and see what happens so
there<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.479> go

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
there we go

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.190 
there we go
you<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> we're<00:01:38.159> pretty<00:01:38.310> much<00:01:38.460> maxing<00:01:38.939> out

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
you see and we're pretty much maxing out

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.370 
you see and we're pretty much maxing out
you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> needle<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.220> hopefully

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
you can see the needle here hopefully

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
you can see the needle here hopefully
which<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.829> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> 100<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
which is kind of 100 it's right at the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.420 
which is kind of 100 it's right at the
top<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.360> does<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.540> mean<00:01:48.840> well<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.950> means

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
top so what does that mean well it means

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.190 
top so what does that mean well it means
the<00:01:50.759> magnetic<00:01:51.119> fields<00:01:51.570> are<00:01:51.689> high<00:01:54.049> what<00:01:55.049> does

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the magnetic fields are high what does

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.539 
the magnetic fields are high what does
that<00:01:55.229> mean<00:01:55.530> exactly<00:01:55.820> well<00:01:57.710> studies<00:01:58.710> show<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that mean exactly well studies show that

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.590 
that mean exactly well studies show that
there<00:01:59.729> are<00:02:00.829> adverse<00:02:01.939> biological<00:02:02.939> effects<00:02:03.299> at

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
there are adverse biological effects at

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600 
there are adverse biological effects at
levels<00:02:04.110> which<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.469> much<00:02:04.770> much<00:02:05.070> lower<00:02:05.399> than

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610

recommends a level of 1 mini house
so<00:02:33.140> one<00:02:33.470> mini<00:02:33.709> gas<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.250> here<00:02:34.700> yeah<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.269> we're

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
so one mini gas on here yeah and we're

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.039 
so one mini gas on here yeah and we're
getting<00:02:35.709> 100<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.610> we<00:02:37.819> need<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.180> watch<00:02:38.840> what

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
getting 100 so we need to watch what

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.900 
getting 100 so we need to watch what
happens<00:02:39.409> now<00:02:39.909> as<00:02:40.909> I<00:02:41.120> insert<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:43.370> computer

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
happens now as I insert this computer

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.729 
happens now as I insert this computer
fat<00:02:44.980> underneath<00:02:46.030> top<00:02:47.290> okay<00:02:48.290> nice<00:02:48.500> and

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
fat underneath top okay nice and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.849 
fat underneath top okay nice and
straight<00:02:49.420> there<00:02:50.420> we<00:02:50.569> go<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.379> underneath<00:02:51.620> the

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
straight there we go so underneath the

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:58.869 
straight there we go so underneath the
laptop<00:02:52.250> out<00:02:54.579> okay<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:57.430> search<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.609> back<00:02:58.730> on

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
laptop out okay and search it back on

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.740 
laptop out okay and search it back on
again<00:02:59.200> and<00:03:00.670> see<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:02.120> happens<00:03:02.420> then<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.599> see

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
again and see what happens then you see

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.860 
again and see what happens then you see
we're<00:03:02.870> getting<00:03:02.989> readings<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:04.150> about<00:03:05.150> 20-25

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
we're getting readings of about 20-25

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.050 
we're getting readings of about 20-25
min<00:03:06.170> accounts<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:08.090> what<00:03:08.299> does<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.510> mean<00:03:09.040> well

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
min accounts so what does that mean well

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.240 
min accounts so what does that mean well
it's<00:03:11.060> better<00:03:11.239> isn't<00:03:11.569> it<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.950> lower<00:03:13.190> than

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
it's better isn't it it's lower than

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.729 
it's better isn't it it's lower than
long<00:03:13.609> who's<00:03:13.880> getting<00:03:14.120> before<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:15.500> in<00:03:15.620> this

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
long who's getting before but in this

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.550 
long who's getting before but in this
particular<00:03:15.919> case<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.840> levels<00:03:18.169> are<00:03:18.319> still

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
particular case the levels are still

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.089 
particular case the levels are still
high<00:03:18.889> a<00:03:19.519> lot<00:03:20.090> higher<00:03:20.329> than<00:03:21.109> what<00:03:21.169> considered

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
high a lot higher than what considered

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.360 
high a lot higher than what considered
safe<00:03:22.819> levels<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.620> what<00:03:24.739> does<00:03:24.859> this<00:03:24.950> mean<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:25.280> a

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
safe levels so what does this mean in a

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.990 
safe levels so what does this mean in a
general<00:03:25.700> sense<00:03:26.560> well<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:28.400> depends<00:03:28.790> on<00:03:28.880> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
general sense well it depends on the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.390 
general sense well it depends on the
laptop<00:03:29.389> in<00:03:29.540> question<00:03:29.959> because<00:03:30.650> my<00:03:30.889> tests<00:03:31.160> show

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
laptop in question because my tests show

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.569 
laptop in question because my tests show
the<00:03:31.609> laptops<00:03:32.239> very<00:03:32.630> enormous<00:03:33.200> ly<00:03:33.530> in<00:03:33.889> terms<00:03:34.400> of

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
the laptops very enormous ly in terms of

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.659 
the laptops very enormous ly in terms of
magnetic<00:03:35.239> field<00:03:35.480> emissions<00:03:36.459> some<00:03:37.459> laptops

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
magnetic field emissions some laptops

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.000 
magnetic field emissions some laptops
can<00:03:38.060> give<00:03:38.209> significantly<00:03:39.139> more<00:03:39.349> some

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
can give significantly more some

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.849 
can give significantly more some
significantly<00:03:40.669> less<00:03:41.680> magnetic<00:03:42.680> field

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
significantly less magnetic field

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.729 
significantly less magnetic field
exposures<00:03:43.400> than<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:44.959> also<00:03:45.139> depends

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
exposures than this and it also depends

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.190 
exposures than this and it also depends
on<00:03:46.069> how<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:46.790> use<00:03:47.060> your<00:03:47.269> laptop<00:03:47.389> which<00:03:48.079> I'm

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
on how you use your laptop which I'm

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.500 
on how you use your laptop which I'm
going<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.380> talk<00:03:48.530> about<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.799> bit<00:03:48.950> more

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
going to talk about a bit more

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.449 
going to talk about a bit more
afterwards<00:03:50.510> but<00:03:51.230> what<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:51.950> can<00:03:52.160> appreciate

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
afterwards but what you can appreciate

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.550 
afterwards but what you can appreciate
here<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:54.500> even<00:03:54.829> with<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:55.459> computer<00:03:55.940> pad

your<00:04:16.039> laptop<00:04:16.669> on<00:04:17.209> your<00:04:17.269> lap<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:19.609> can<00:04:19.760> also

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:19.909 
your laptop on your lap and you can also

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.250 
your laptop on your lap and you can also
see<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.570> depending<00:04:20.900> on<00:04:21.140> where<00:04:21.409> you

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
see that depending on where you

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.280 
see that depending on where you
he's<00:04:22.380> come<00:04:22.650> underneath<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.910> desk<00:04:24.150> here<00:04:24.480> even

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
he's come underneath the desk here even

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.800 
he's come underneath the desk here even
if<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.470> use<00:04:25.620> your<00:04:25.740> laptop<00:04:25.890> on<00:04:26.250> your<00:04:26.370> desk<00:04:26.810> you

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
if you use your laptop on your desk you

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.200 
if you use your laptop on your desk you
may<00:04:27.840> still<00:04:28.320> be<00:04:28.380> exposing<00:04:29.100> yourself<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.670> high

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
may still be exposing yourself to high

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.200 
may still be exposing yourself to high
magnetic<00:04:31.110> fields<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.490> not<00:04:32.730> just<00:04:32.850> your<00:04:33.000> knees

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
magnetic fields so not just your knees

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.000 
magnetic fields so not just your knees
are<00:04:33.510> gonna<00:04:33.630> get<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:33.960> but<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:34.560> know<00:04:34.710> your

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
are gonna get this but you know your

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.790 
are gonna get this but you know your
your<00:04:35.580> stomach<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.300> your<00:04:36.420> groin<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:37.680> know

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
your stomach and your groin and you know

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.840 
your stomach and your groin and you know
what<00:04:38.040> whatever<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.660> closest<00:04:39.660> contact<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.230> it

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
what whatever the closest contact to it

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.290 
what whatever the closest contact to it
so<00:04:41.850> what<00:04:42.090> can<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:42.810> conclude<00:04:44.120> from<00:04:45.120> this

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
so what can we conclude from this

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.000 
so what can we conclude from this
demonstration<00:04:46.880> firstly<00:04:48.080> never<00:04:49.080> use<00:04:49.740> your

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
demonstration firstly never use your

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.570 
demonstration firstly never use your
laptop<00:04:50.160> on<00:04:50.700> your<00:04:51.030> lap<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:52.110> when<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.320> say<00:04:52.710> never

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
laptop on your lap and when I say never

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.240 
laptop on your lap and when I say never
I<00:04:54.000> mean<00:04:54.330> now<00:04:55.170> that<00:04:55.200> you<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:55.740> use<00:04:55.890> it<00:04:56.070> on<00:04:56.190> your

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
I mean now that you can use it on your

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.020 
I mean now that you can use it on your
lap<00:04:56.580> with<00:04:57.240> one<00:04:57.390> of<00:04:57.510> these<00:04:57.600> computer<00:04:58.110> pads<00:04:58.290> yeah

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
lap with one of these computer pads yeah

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.030 
lap with one of these computer pads yeah
this<00:05:00.030> is<00:05:00.150> important<00:05:00.600> because<00:05:00.630> I'm<00:05:01.590> guessing

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
this is important because I'm guessing

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.490 
this is important because I'm guessing
that<00:05:02.160> some<00:05:02.850> people<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.300> lot<00:05:03.450> of<00:05:03.510> people<00:05:03.690> buy

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
that some people a lot of people buy

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.460 
that some people a lot of people buy
these<00:05:04.530> computer<00:05:05.160> pads<00:05:05.400> thinking<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.960> using

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
these computer pads thinking that using

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.190 
these computer pads thinking that using
a<00:05:07.560> laptop<00:05:07.710> on<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.130> lap<00:05:08.310> with<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.360> computer

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
a laptop on the lap with the computer

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.230 
a laptop on the lap with the computer
pad<00:05:10.410> makes<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.310> safe<00:05:12.110> wrong<00:05:13.110> as<00:05:13.710> my

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
pad makes it safe wrong as my

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.830 
pad makes it safe wrong as my
demonstration<00:05:15.240> here<00:05:15.600> shows<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:17.040> is<00:05:17.840> not

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
demonstration here shows this is not

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.520 
demonstration here shows this is not
necessarily<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:20.160> case<00:05:20.520> yeah<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.170> second

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
necessarily the case yeah and the second

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.600 
necessarily the case yeah and the second
thing<00:05:22.770> we<00:05:23.280> conclude<00:05:23.840> here<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.860> even

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
thing we conclude here is that even

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.300 
thing we conclude here is that even
using<00:05:26.790> your<00:05:26.970> laptop<00:05:27.180> on<00:05:27.570> your<00:05:27.720> desk<00:05:28.100> like<00:05:29.100> this

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
using your laptop on your desk like this

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.510 
using your laptop on your desk like this
you<00:05:30.060> may<00:05:30.210> still<00:05:30.540> be<00:05:30.890> exposed<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:32.220> high<00:05:32.490> levels

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
you may still be exposed to high levels

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.970 
you may still be exposed to high levels
of<00:05:33.000> magnetic<00:05:33.450> fields<00:05:33.810> if<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.500> distance

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
of magnetic fields if the distance

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.390 
of magnetic fields if the distance
between<00:05:35.190> you<00:05:36.140> your<00:05:37.140> your<00:05:37.320> laptop<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.010> your

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
between you your your laptop and your

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.610 
between you your your laptop and your
and<00:05:38.640> your<00:05:38.670> body<00:05:39.000> is<00:05:39.270> not<00:05:39.510> sufficient<00:05:40.110> yeah<00:05:40.530> if

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
and your body is not sufficient yeah if

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.050 
and your body is not sufficient yeah if
the<00:05:40.740> distance<00:05:41.010> between<00:05:41.160> your<00:05:41.370> laptop<00:05:41.610> and

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
the distance between your laptop and

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.850 
the distance between your laptop and
your<00:05:42.570> body<00:05:42.780> is<00:05:42.900> not<00:05:43.220> sufficient<00:05:44.220> so<00:05:45.290> if<00:05:46.290> this

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
your body is not sufficient so if this

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.790 
your body is not sufficient so if this
distance<00:05:47.160> is<00:05:47.610> not<00:05:48.060> sufficient<00:05:48.630> I<00:05:48.870> recommend

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
distance is not sufficient I recommend

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.920 
distance is not sufficient I recommend
using<00:05:50.040> a<00:05:50.460> computer<00:05:51.300> pad<00:05:51.530> like<00:05:52.530> this<00:05:52.770> one<00:05:53.930> so

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
using a computer pad like this one so

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
using a computer pad like this one so
here<00:05:55.770> I<00:05:55.800> only<00:05:56.010> talked<00:05:56.400> about<00:05:56.780> laptop<00:05:57.920> about<00:05:58.920> a

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
here I only talked about laptop about a

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.320 
here I only talked about laptop about a
little<00:05:59.130> bit<00:05:59.250> about<00:05:59.490> how<00:05:59.640> about<00:05:59.880> using<00:06:00.270> a

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
little bit about how about using a

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.830 
little bit about how about using a
laptop<00:06:00.540> but<00:06:01.260> the<00:06:01.380> same<00:06:01.680> applies<00:06:02.130> for<00:06:02.610> an<00:06:03.420> iPad

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
laptop but the same applies for an iPad

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.170 
laptop but the same applies for an iPad
or<00:06:04.410> other<00:06:04.470> tablet<00:06:04.950> if<00:06:05.490> you're<00:06:05.610> using<00:06:05.820> it<00:06:06.060> on

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
or other tablet if you're using it on

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.630 
or other tablet if you're using it on
your<00:06:06.210> lap<00:06:06.480> or<00:06:07.110> on<00:06:07.140> your<00:06:07.410> desk<00:06:07.650> same<00:06:08.280> problem

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
your lap or on your desk same problem

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.090 
your lap or on your desk same problem
same<00:06:09.030> same<00:06:09.450> scenario<00:06:09.900> the<00:06:10.650> other<00:06:10.800> thing<00:06:11.010> I

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
same same scenario the other thing I

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.860 
same same scenario the other thing I
want<00:06:11.220> to<00:06:11.310> mention<00:06:11.430> is<00:06:12.060> Wi-Fi

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
want to mention is Wi-Fi

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.800 
want to mention is Wi-Fi
this<00:06:13.620> computer<00:06:14.190> pad<00:06:14.520> only<00:06:15.240> offers<00:06:15.570> protection

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
this computer pad only offers protection

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.380 
this computer pad only offers protection
from<00:06:16.290> magnetic<00:06:16.590> fields<00:06:17.160> but<00:06:17.880> there<00:06:18.030> are<00:06:18.210> other

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
from magnetic fields but there are other

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.270 
from magnetic fields but there are other
versions<00:06:18.630> which<00:06:19.230> are<00:06:19.410> designed<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.950> shield

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
versions which are designed to shield

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.820 
versions which are designed to shield
radiofrequency<00:06:21.180> radiation<00:06:21.920> as<00:06:22.920> to<00:06:23.130> say<00:06:23.310> Wi-Fi

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
radiofrequency radiation as to say Wi-Fi

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.890 
radiofrequency radiation as to say Wi-Fi
so<00:06:25.830> maybe<00:06:26.160> you're<00:06:26.880> thinking<00:06:27.090> it's<00:06:27.510> better<00:06:27.690> to

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
so maybe you're thinking it's better to

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.290 
so maybe you're thinking it's better to
buy<00:06:28.050> a<00:06:28.080> computer<00:06:28.320> pad<00:06:28.770> which<00:06:29.520> can<00:06:29.760> protect<00:06:30.120> you

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
buy a computer pad which can protect you

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.879 
buy a computer pad which can protect you
from

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
from

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.200 
from
RF<00:06:31.639> radiation<00:06:31.939> and<00:06:32.539> and<00:06:33.699> these<00:06:34.699> magnetic

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
RF radiation and and these magnetic

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.629 
RF radiation and and these magnetic
fields<00:06:35.539> so<00:06:36.349> that<00:06:36.530> you<00:06:36.620> can<00:06:36.860> use<00:06:37.310> your<00:06:37.460> laptop

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
fields so that you can use your laptop

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.189

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.580 
more safely with Wi-Fi mode activated be
careful<00:06:42.889> here<00:06:43.099> don't<00:06:44.030> think<00:06:44.419> that<00:06:44.629> by<00:06:44.780> using<00:06:45.110> a

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
careful here don't think that by using a

your room your office your home it's
it's<00:07:02.930> everywhere<00:07:03.439> the<00:07:04.279> computer<00:07:04.849> pad<00:07:05.060> that

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
it's everywhere the computer pad that

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.129 
it's everywhere the computer pad that
has<00:07:06.050> RF<00:07:06.770> shielding<00:07:07.189> can<00:07:07.340> only<00:07:07.490> stop<00:07:07.939> the<00:07:08.689> RF

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
has RF shielding can only stop the RF

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:13.230 
has RF shielding can only stop the RF
radiation<00:07:09.560> from<00:07:10.490> going<00:07:10.879> through<00:07:11.139> the<00:07:12.139> pad

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
radiation from going through the pad

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.010 
radiation from going through the pad
yeah<00:07:14.529> so<00:07:15.529> if<00:07:15.710> your<00:07:15.919> computer<00:07:16.580> pad<00:07:17.060> is<00:07:17.689> on<00:07:17.900> the

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
yeah so if your computer pad is on the

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.740 
yeah so if your computer pad is on the
laptop<00:07:18.409> how<00:07:18.590> many<00:07:18.740> shields<00:07:19.219> this<00:07:19.729> little<00:07:20.090> 13

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
laptop how many shields this little 13

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.369 
laptop how many shields this little 13
by<00:07:21.379> 9<00:07:21.409> inch<00:07:21.860> area<00:07:22.340> but<00:07:23.000> the<00:07:23.090> RF<00:07:23.419> radiation<00:07:23.750> is

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:24.379 
by 9 inch area but the RF radiation is

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:28.629 
by 9 inch area but the RF radiation is
still<00:07:24.770> everywhere<00:07:25.699> else<00:07:26.090> in<00:07:26.719> the<00:07:26.779> room<00:07:27.370> so<00:07:28.370> my

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 
still everywhere else in the room so my

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.540 
still everywhere else in the room so my
recommendation<00:07:29.419> is<00:07:29.539> to<00:07:29.810> use<00:07:30.110> a<00:07:30.550> hardwired

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
recommendation is to use a hardwired

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.689 
recommendation is to use a hardwired
internet<00:07:32.449> connection<00:07:33.050> using<00:07:33.889> a<00:07:33.949> computer<00:07:34.490> pad
