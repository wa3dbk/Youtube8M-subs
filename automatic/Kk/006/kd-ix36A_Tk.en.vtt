basically<00:00:27.470> what's<00:00:28.470> happening<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
basically what's happening is the the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
basically what's happening is the the
evap<00:00:30.570> system<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.759> dumping<00:00:33.710> excess<00:00:34.710> fuel<00:00:34.980> or

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
evap system is dumping excess fuel or

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.139 
evap system is dumping excess fuel or
fuel<00:00:36.059> vapors<00:00:37.340> all<00:00:38.340> right<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> should<00:00:38.790> say<00:00:38.940> bate

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
fuel vapors all right I should say bate

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.490 
fuel vapors all right I should say bate
excess<00:00:39.690> vapors<00:00:40.050> or<00:00:40.170> excess<00:00:42.140> fuel<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.469> the

excess vapors or excess fuel into the
intake<00:00:43.950> during<00:00:46.100> when<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.340> idle<00:00:47.730> that's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
intake during when you're at idle that's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.439 
intake during when you're at idle that's
why<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.379> over<00:00:49.950> richens<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
why it just over richens it and the

right there that with the fins on it

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.480 
right there that with the fins on it
that's<00:01:06.689> where<00:01:07.020> that's<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> charcoal

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that's where that's like a charcoal

there's<00:01:10.200> hoses<00:01:11.150> connected<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> fuel<00:01:15.869> tank

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
there's hoses connected to the fuel tank

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.800 
there's hoses connected to the fuel tank
and<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:17.490> hose<00:01:17.759> goes<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.299> way<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and a hose goes all the way to the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.450 
and a hose goes all the way to the
engine<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:20.460> basically<00:01:22.850> any<00:01:23.850> fuel<00:01:24.210> vapors

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
engine and basically any fuel vapors

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
engine and basically any fuel vapors
from<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.610> fuel<00:01:26.880> tank<00:01:27.740> get<00:01:29.119> vented<00:01:30.409> into<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
from your fuel tank get vented into the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.160 
from your fuel tank get vented into the
charcoal<00:01:32.250> canister<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.060> they're<00:01:33.810> stored

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
charcoal canister and they're stored

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.219 
charcoal canister and they're stored
there<00:01:34.409> until<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.759> engine<00:01:36.090> gets<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
there until the engine gets up to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.670 
there until the engine gets up to
operating<00:01:37.619> temperature<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:39.350> it's<00:01:40.350> basically

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
operating temperature and it's basically

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.310 
operating temperature and it's basically
been<00:01:40.979> stove<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.549> purrs<00:01:41.790> into<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> intake

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
been stove a purrs into the intake

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:52.000 
been stove a purrs into the intake
plenum<00:01:45.020> right<00:01:46.020> here

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.710 

through<00:01:53.010> this<00:01:53.630> valve<00:01:56.360> down<00:01:57.360> there

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.260 

so<00:02:00.260> if<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.440> look<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:01.010> follow<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.730> valve<00:02:02.000> and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
so if you look you follow that valve and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.660 
so if you look you follow that valve and
it's<00:02:02.540> hard<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.810> see<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:05.500> zoom<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:06.650> on<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.980> focus

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
it's hard to see but zoom in on it focus

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.210 
it's hard to see but zoom in on it focus
on<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:07.910> right<00:02:08.060> there<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.510> orange<00:02:09.260> and<00:02:10.070> white

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
on it right there the orange and white

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.930 
on it right there the orange and white
wires

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
wires

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.460 
wires
that's<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:12.010> solenoid<00:02:13.010> valve

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.200 

it's<00:02:17.470> called<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.800> canister<00:02:18.340> purge<00:02:18.880> solenoid

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
it's called a canister purge solenoid

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.450 
it's called a canister purge solenoid
valve<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.370> electrical<00:02:21.880> connector<00:02:22.420> will

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
valve so that electrical connector will

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.770 
valve so that electrical connector will
open<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.780> valve<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.200> allow<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.850> EVAP

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
open that valve and allow the EVAP

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.430 
open that valve and allow the EVAP
canister<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:30.580> vent<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:33.330> fuel<00:02:34.330> vapors<00:02:34.810> into

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
canister to vent the fuel vapors into

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.810 
canister to vent the fuel vapors into
the<00:02:35.530> intake<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.010> they<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.220> get<00:02:36.400> burned<00:02:36.640> away

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
the intake and they just get burned away

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.700 
the intake and they just get burned away
you<00:02:37.360> know<00:02:37.480> part<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.960> whole<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.500> brave

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
you know part of the whole that brave

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.240 
you know part of the whole that brave
admissions<00:02:39.160> system<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.840> good<00:02:41.680> way<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:41.890> test

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
admissions system so a good way to test

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.840 
admissions system so a good way to test
it<00:02:42.840> basically<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.140> disconnect<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:45.040> valve

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
it basically just disconnect that valve

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
let your engine warm up and that's the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.460 
let your engine warm up and that's the
operating<00:02:52.450> temperature<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.080> let<00:02:53.350> your

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
operating temperature but let your

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.770 
operating temperature but let your
engine<00:02:53.710> warm<00:02:53.890> up<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.280> just<00:02:54.630> disconnect<00:02:55.630> it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
engine warm up and just disconnect it

engine warm up and just disconnect it
and<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:57.070> doesn't<00:02:57.370> die<00:02:57.520> like<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.120> was<00:02:58.300> before

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
and it doesn't die like it was before

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.220 
and it doesn't die like it was before

and<00:03:10.240> go<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.570> back<00:03:11.880> pull<00:03:12.880> out<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:14.170> canister

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
and go to the back pull out the canister

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
and go to the back pull out the canister
there's<00:03:17.410> three<00:03:17.830> hoses<00:03:18.040> connected<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.030> and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
there's three hoses connected to it and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.160 
there's three hoses connected to it and
two<00:03:21.430> nuts<00:03:22.290> one<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.440> them<00:03:23.640> up<00:03:24.640> here<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.390> then

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
two nuts one of them up here and then

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.310 
two nuts one of them up here and then
one<00:03:26.380> on<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.560> other<00:03:26.650> side<00:03:26.830> of<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.930> metal<00:03:28.930> strap

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
one on the other side of the metal strap

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.760 
one on the other side of the metal strap
so<00:03:30.310> those<00:03:30.490> two<00:03:30.640> nuts<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:31.320> lot<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.440> whole<00:03:32.590> can

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
so those two nuts a lot of the whole can

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.870 
so those two nuts a lot of the whole can
assure<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.100> fall<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.490> then<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:33.700> could

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
assure to fall and then you could

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.390 
assure to fall and then you could
disconnect<00:03:34.709> three<00:03:36.150> hoses<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:39.040> are<00:03:39.160> under

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
disconnect three hoses that are under

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.510 
disconnect three hoses that are under
here

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.840 

and<00:03:45.590> then<00:03:46.590> there's<00:03:46.770> another<00:03:46.890> electrical

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
and then there's another electrical

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.510 
and then there's another electrical
connector<00:03:48.270> in<00:03:48.420> there<00:03:49.610> it's<00:03:50.610> called<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
connector in there it's called the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.510 
connector in there it's called the
canister<00:03:53.520> closed<00:03:53.880> valve<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.950> basically

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
canister closed valve that basically

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.010 
canister closed valve that basically
just<00:03:57.680> opens<00:03:58.680> or<00:03:58.800> closes<00:03:58.830> in<00:03:59.460> the<00:03:59.520> canister

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
just opens or closes in the canister

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.350 
just opens or closes in the canister
it's<00:04:01.020> allowed<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.590> vent<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.130> engine<00:04:02.490> also

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
it's allowed to vent to the engine also

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.930 
it's allowed to vent to the engine also
so<00:04:03.840> there's<00:04:04.050> kind<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.260> like<00:04:04.320> two<00:04:04.650> valves<00:04:05.810> but

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
so there's kind of like two valves but

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.290 
so there's kind of like two valves but
sometimes<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.120> cause<00:04:09.300> of<00:04:09.330> this<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:11.300> when

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
sometimes the cause of this is when

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.560 
sometimes the cause of this is when
you're<00:04:12.450> filling<00:04:12.870> up<00:04:12.930> gas<00:04:14.030> maybe<00:04:15.030> top<00:04:15.360> off<00:04:15.540> your

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
you're filling up gas maybe top off your

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.310 
you're filling up gas maybe top off your
tank<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:16.610> lot<00:04:17.610> of<00:04:17.730> that<00:04:17.850> fuel<00:04:18.299> bent<00:04:19.230> from<00:04:20.270> your

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
tank a lot of that fuel bent from your

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.470 
tank a lot of that fuel bent from your
fill<00:04:22.320> valve<00:04:22.620> into<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.370> canister<00:04:23.790> fill<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.390> up

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
fill valve into the canister fill it up

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.990 
fill valve into the canister fill it up
with<00:04:24.660> gas<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.520> then<00:04:26.520> now

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
with gas and then now

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.390 
with gas and then now
now<00:04:27.300> it's<00:04:27.480> Banting<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.500> know<00:04:28.620> excess<00:04:29.070> fumes

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
now it's Banting you know excess fumes

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.750 
now it's Banting you know excess fumes
or<00:04:29.730> actual<00:04:30.480> liquid<00:04:30.720> gas<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.160> intake<00:04:32.550> and

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
or actual liquid gas to the intake and

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.780 
or actual liquid gas to the intake and
it<00:04:32.850> just<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.300> will<00:04:33.480> just<00:04:33.630> kill<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.960> engine<00:04:34.200> so

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
it just it will just kill the engine so

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.230 
it just it will just kill the engine so
so<00:04:35.790> we<00:04:35.910> should<00:04:36.090> do<00:04:36.180> take<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.810> canister<00:04:37.050> out

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
so we should do take that canister out

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.320 
so we should do take that canister out
empty<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.360> out<00:04:39.710> you'll<00:04:40.710> notice<00:04:41.550> if<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.180> is

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
empty it out you'll notice if this is

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.570 
empty it out you'll notice if this is
the<00:04:42.450> issue<00:04:42.600> though<00:04:42.870> there<00:04:43.680> will<00:04:43.860> be<00:04:43.920> fuel<00:04:44.400> in

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
the issue though there will be fuel in

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.670 
the issue though there will be fuel in
there<00:04:44.790> like<00:04:45.210> quite<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.480> bit<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:45.960> just<00:04:45.990> leave<00:04:46.560> it

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
there like quite a bit so just leave it

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.020 
there like quite a bit so just leave it
upside<00:04:47.010> down<00:04:47.040> and<00:04:48.650> let<00:04:49.650> everything<00:04:49.920> vent<00:04:50.820> out

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
upside down and let everything vent out

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.830 
upside down and let everything vent out
you<00:04:51.420> know<00:04:51.510> overnight<00:04:51.990> maybe<00:04:52.890> even<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.310> few<00:04:53.520> days

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
you know overnight maybe even a few days

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.220 
you know overnight maybe even a few days
and<00:04:54.840> then<00:04:55.440> just<00:04:56.340> put<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.610> back<00:04:56.700> in<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.840> start

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
and then just put it back in and start

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.060 
and then just put it back in and start
the<00:04:58.410> car<00:04:58.650> go<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.790> run<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.770> I'm<00:05:01.770> another

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
the car go and run it I'm another

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.260 
the car go and run it I'm another
indication<00:05:03.290> you<00:05:04.290> know<00:05:04.410> that<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.770> was<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:06.240> know

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
indication you know that it was you know

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.470 
indication you know that it was you know
an<00:05:06.450> overly<00:05:06.870> rich<00:05:07.080> mixture<00:05:08.000> if<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.120> look<00:05:09.330> at

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
an overly rich mixture if you look at

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.520 
an overly rich mixture if you look at
your<00:05:09.690> spark<00:05:10.050> plugs

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
your spark plugs

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.680 
your spark plugs
they'll<00:05:11.490> be<00:05:11.700> will<00:05:12.480> be<00:05:12.570> black<00:05:12.870> soot<00:05:13.290> real<00:05:14.190> dry

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
they'll be will be black soot real dry

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.680 
they'll be will be black soot real dry
powdery<00:05:15.690> black<00:05:15.930> soot<00:05:16.320> on<00:05:16.500> him<00:05:16.830> which<00:05:17.570> you<00:05:18.570> know

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
powdery black soot on him which you know

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.080 
powdery black soot on him which you know
rich<00:05:19.430> rich<00:05:20.430> condition<00:05:22.460> same<00:05:23.460> thing<00:05:23.730> I

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
rich rich condition same thing I

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.780 
rich rich condition same thing I
actually<00:05:24.930> heard<00:05:25.320> with<00:05:25.470> this<00:05:25.620> card<00:05:25.920> when<00:05:26.730> I

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
actually heard with this card when I

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.550 
actually heard with this card when I
shut<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.180> engine<00:05:27.510> off<00:05:27.600> or<00:05:27.840> actually<00:05:28.260> when<00:05:28.410> it

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
shut the engine off or actually when it

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.310 
shut the engine off or actually when it
died<00:05:28.770> during<00:05:29.510> testing<00:05:30.510> it<00:05:32.690> popping<00:05:33.690> came<00:05:34.200> from

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
died during testing it popping came from

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.980 
died during testing it popping came from
the<00:05:34.500> exhaust<00:05:34.860> so<00:05:35.190> again<00:05:35.490> excess<00:05:36.270> fuel<00:05:36.540> and

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
the exhaust so again excess fuel and

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.020 
the exhaust so again excess fuel and
then<00:05:37.230> it<00:05:37.350> actually<00:05:37.610> burned<00:05:38.610> up<00:05:38.790> in<00:05:38.910> the

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
then it actually burned up in the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.420 
then it actually burned up in the
exhaust<00:05:39.270> and<00:05:39.540> exploded<00:05:40.080> so<00:05:41.070> that's<00:05:41.190> another

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
exhaust and exploded so that's another

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.900 
exhaust and exploded so that's another
indication<00:05:41.910> of<00:05:42.210> its<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.480> mean<00:05:42.660> all<00:05:43.200> the<00:05:43.800> all<00:05:44.490> the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
indication of its I mean all the all the

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.940 
indication of its I mean all the all the
signs<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.480> it<00:05:46.110> was<00:05:46.590> excess<00:05:47.460> fuel<00:05:47.730> which

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
signs of it was excess fuel which

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.120 
signs of it was excess fuel which
resulted<00:05:50.030> checking<00:05:51.030> that<00:05:51.290> so<00:05:52.290> other<00:05:52.860> things

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
resulted checking that so other things

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.310 
resulted checking that so other things
you<00:05:53.280> can<00:05:53.460> check<00:05:53.760> for<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.540> throttle<00:05:55.200> position

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
you can check for the throttle position

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.250 
you can check for the throttle position
sensor<00:05:56.330> you<00:05:57.330> can<00:05:57.510> actually<00:05:57.660> own

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
sensor you can actually own

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.210 
sensor you can actually own
it<00:05:58.290> out<00:05:59.480> certain<00:06:00.480> certain<00:06:01.230> readings<00:06:01.590> there's

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
it out certain certain readings there's

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.500 
it out certain certain readings there's
a<00:06:02.900> three<00:06:03.900> connectors<00:06:04.520> well<00:06:05.520> when<00:06:06.180> I<00:06:06.240> get<00:06:06.450> a

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
a three connectors well when I get a

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.000 
a three connectors well when I get a
little<00:06:07.310> tab<00:06:08.310> there<00:06:08.670> go<00:06:09.200> three<00:06:10.200> connectors<00:06:10.680> on

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
little tab there go three connectors on

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.830 
little tab there go three connectors on
the<00:06:11.070> inside<00:06:11.870> and<00:06:12.870> you<00:06:13.020> can<00:06:13.050> actually

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
the inside and you can actually

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.540 
the inside and you can actually
basically<00:06:15.840> all<00:06:16.200> about<00:06:16.350> the<00:06:16.470> connector<00:06:16.890> I<00:06:16.950> did

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
basically all about the connector I did

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.470 
basically all about the connector I did
that<00:06:17.730> it<00:06:17.880> was<00:06:17.970> good

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
that it was good

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
that it was good
you<00:06:18.660> can<00:06:18.810> also<00:06:18.960> all<00:06:19.260> mout<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.730> idle<00:06:20.730> speed

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
you can also all mout the idle speed

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
you can also all mout the idle speed
motor<00:06:24.260> well<00:06:25.290> whatever<00:06:25.650> controls<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.250> idle

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
motor well whatever controls the idle

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.420 
motor well whatever controls the idle
speed<00:06:26.850> this<00:06:27.180> thing<00:06:27.740> you<00:06:28.740> can<00:06:28.890> check<00:06:29.070> that<00:06:29.100> as

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
speed this thing you can check that as

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.310 
speed this thing you can check that as
well<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:29.850> I<00:06:30.060> checked<00:06:30.750> both<00:06:30.900> of<00:06:31.110> them<00:06:31.200> they

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
well and I checked both of them they

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.220 
well and I checked both of them they
were<00:06:31.380> both<00:06:31.560> good<00:06:31.830> which<00:06:32.600> led<00:06:33.600> me<00:06:33.750> to<00:06:33.780> check<00:06:34.080> for

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
were both good which led me to check for

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.310 
were both good which led me to check for
vacuum<00:06:34.650> leaks<00:06:35.090> that<00:06:36.090> that<00:06:36.420> will<00:06:36.540> cause<00:06:36.720> any

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
vacuum leaks that that will cause any

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.680 
vacuum leaks that that will cause any
issues<00:06:38.000> your<00:06:39.000> mass<00:06:39.330> airflow<00:06:39.540> sensor<00:06:41.690> can

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
issues your mass airflow sensor can

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.360 
issues your mass airflow sensor can
cause<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:43.050> issues<00:06:43.320> everything<00:06:44.130> was<00:06:44.280> clean<00:06:44.610> so

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
cause the issues everything was clean so

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.590 
cause the issues everything was clean so
it<00:06:47.370> looked<00:06:47.550> to<00:06:47.640> the<00:06:47.730> last<00:06:47.970> thing<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:48.450> it<00:06:48.510> was

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
it looked to the last thing and it was

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.200 
it looked to the last thing and it was
the<00:06:48.660> EVAP<00:06:48.960> canister<00:06:51.560> so<00:06:52.910> if<00:06:53.910> you<00:06:54.000> have<00:06:54.090> any

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
the EVAP canister so if you have any

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.990 
the EVAP canister so if you have any
questions<00:06:54.630> go<00:06:54.840> and<00:06:55.400> write<00:06:56.400> in<00:06:56.550> the<00:06:56.610> comments

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
questions go and write in the comments

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.210 
questions go and write in the comments
