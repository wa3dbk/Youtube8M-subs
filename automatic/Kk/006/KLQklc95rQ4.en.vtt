00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.930
 your makeup literally to this idea in the morning 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.160
 Of course, the makeup changes for the whole but it 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.530
 about the same the same 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 face products that use 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.190
 in fact the cleaner year everything was with him 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
 good and would like to tell and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.480
 show you very much with just that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.650
 what time is it a long time with sometimes 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 I hope you enjoy 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.359
 let's begin the first thing for our 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.090
 code want foundation cream but i'm not 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.199
 I use every personal cream 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.079
 usually it's a light bbc cream i have 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:38.059
 nail no damn I wear it with 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.610
 fingers so well as falls on the skin 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:47.280
 Easily blends with skin tone requires 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.800
 no special shepherd to be needed 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.690
 output of course no serious 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.610
 redness deputy more rashes he 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.710
 will not remove because the form is very easy 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 and therefore I will use concealer 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 from mac found yourself a camp let me need 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.489
 little bit more 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.729
 japan cover 1 key that's a little bit on 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.729
 forehead 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.450
 Basically, I do not have enough core strength 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.250
 I do not lighten the area under the eyes as how 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.920
 floor dilution I do not see especially 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.110
 snowfall us from the dark very yes and then 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.360
 what makes me this my babytreem quite 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.729
 I'm happy and pretty good 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.580
 look further there is a passing base under 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.259
 shadows in this case most often hers 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.110
 make the wrong flag 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.600
 I put on all moving eyelids to take 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.940
 all possible is visible and these are different branches 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.610
 if seen for ever and just do 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.220
 good foundation under our shadow further 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.970
 I take under the palette from the cat, the Donald 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.030
 You and began nost on such a brown 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.970
 slightly darker than colored skin 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.659
 tint the fold of the eyelid as we darken 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.659
 outer corner 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.490
 further went over the palette form forests and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.180

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.290

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.220
 after the road was well shaded 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.860
 transition i will use black 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:41.000
 pencil and shaded light brown on 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:43.070
 water line pencil is not the best 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.400
 the presentation is for the water line but 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.080

 lashes literally a couple of hours 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.960
 no internal liner on the eyes but 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.970
