towel and get a clean dry area one of
the<00:01:06.510> things<00:01:06.810> we've<00:01:07.020> found<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.369> we

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the things we've found is that if we

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
the things we've found is that if we
have<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> towel<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.140> bit<00:01:10.320> damp

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
have a towel that's a little bit damp

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.219 
have a towel that's a little bit damp
it's<00:01:11.640> easier<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.240> dry<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> car<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:13.110> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it's easier to dry the car I know that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.859 
it's easier to dry the car I know that
sounds<00:01:13.530> crazy<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.700> dry<00:01:15.090> towel<00:01:15.390> tends<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
sounds crazy but a dry towel tends to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.800 
sounds crazy but a dry towel tends to
push<00:01:16.110> water<00:01:16.380> around<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.280> slightly<00:01:18.030> damp<00:01:18.450> towel

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
push water around a slightly damp towel

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.570 
push water around a slightly damp towel
becomes<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> lot<00:01:19.409> more<00:01:19.439> absorbent<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.430> can

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
becomes a lot more absorbent so we can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.880 
becomes a lot more absorbent so we can
move<00:01:20.729> across<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.240> vehicle<00:01:21.450> much<00:01:22.140> quicker<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
move across the vehicle much quicker and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
move across the vehicle much quicker and
we<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.610> back<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.030> forth<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> direction<00:01:24.840> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
we go back and forth in the direction of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660 
we go back and forth in the direction of
airflow<00:01:25.290> now<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.890> comes<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.400> grill

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
