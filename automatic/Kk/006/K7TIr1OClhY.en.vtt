00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.920
 signals that means when now my 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.990
 player 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:14.429
 I'm going to press we have three 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:17.010
 Signals worked out is yellow here 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.420
 our line now gives it the first one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.619
 possibility of domestic defense 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.300
 Incidentally, right now concerns only the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.670
 both strikers 9 and 11 of the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.710
 inside linebacker fits to the other 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.990
 defender forward to the zone 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 rows mean I'm in the zone in there 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.250
 Opponents in the zone were immediately press 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.300
 the second situation of 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.739
 defender fits 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.380
 defender and the triple me in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.809
 The zone pure means to apply pressure immediately 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.000
 pressing or the third situation the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 we worked out he is playing 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.329
 the defender behind the first 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.700
 contact to the zone with and thanks vector 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.460
 simply put pressure on the players 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.239
 as soon as there is one in this zone 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.370
 yes in the fire 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.789
 this includes all three points we 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.079
 here are 30 trigger signals for 78 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.180
 that means for the outer school students 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.409
 needs is reading a book 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.450
 let's say we click no matter if that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.850
 defender now out 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.670
 in the course of the opponent plays or after 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 in the back we want to play ours 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 midfielder on both sides immediately 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.950
 give pressure exception he is possible 45 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.270
 meter behind it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.710
 and he can relax the ball 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.110
 take your name remain in the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.840
 pressing zone in and and leave that there 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.409
 easy back example to simply force 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.380
 to save 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.290
 and now a little excursus of the extreme 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.090
 important for the position is eight here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.700
 and indeed I notice about 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.979
 various video analysis that is for 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.020
 most players only one fix point 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.369
 in the defensive there and indeed 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.829
 distinguishes between one 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.280
 horizontal fixpoints a vertical 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.439
 fix 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.610
 the goal of the defender he 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.920
 want to follow if a bottle 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.470
 This is either on the flat 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.870
 striker plays or defends outside 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.000
 or obviously 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.950
 field player so now only he has the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.990
 task to say okay i want that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.820
 Pass so tight that you are not there 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.500
 plays through but at the same time 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.190
 task if he also full-back 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.479
 play that can start 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.520
 they could have the tactics then 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.060
 one thus better understand the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.870
 all okay we take the position eight 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.870
 now here's defender
