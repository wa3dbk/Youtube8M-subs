00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.310 
super strength but there's only one of
them<00:03:34.800> so<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:35.970> against<00:03:36.240> this<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.540> again<00:03:37.080> I

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
them so one against this is again I

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.990 
them so one against this is again I
think<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.650> absolutely<00:03:37.920> retarded<00:03:38.400> matchup

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
think it's absolutely retarded matchup

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.280 
think it's absolutely retarded matchup
and<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.180> guess<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.450> give<00:03:39.600> him<00:03:39.690> crap<00:03:39.870> are<00:03:40.050> doing

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
and I guess I give him crap are doing

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.930 
and I guess I give him crap are doing
something<00:03:40.470> like<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.680> because<00:03:40.890> vampires<00:03:41.370> and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
something like this because vampires and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.210 
something like this because vampires and
zombies<00:03:41.970> are<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.570> two<00:03:42.750> biggest<00:03:42.989> rages<00:03:43.560> here

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
zombies are the two biggest rages here

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.560 
zombies are the two biggest rages here

after if the either saver has a

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.300 
after if the either saver has a
like<00:04:26.539> brain<00:04:27.110> from<00:04:27.379> a<00:04:27.500> spinal<00:04:27.889> car<00:04:28.069> they<00:04:28.219> have

like brain from a spinal car they have

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.740 
like brain from a spinal car they have
to<00:04:28.400> do<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:28.789> much<00:04:28.939> to<00:04:29.120> his<00:04:29.240> brain<00:04:29.389> himself

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.140 
to do to that much to his brain himself
and<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:29.990> don't<00:04:30.289> think<00:04:30.409> the<00:04:30.590> vampire<00:04:30.949> is<00:04:31.250> going

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
and I don't think the vampire is going

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.529 
and I don't think the vampire is going
to<00:04:32.240> have<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.629> strength<00:04:33.379> to<00:04:33.550> crush<00:04:34.550> 80<00:04:34.819> or<00:04:35.150> 60

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
to have the strength to crush 80 or 60

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.059 
to have the strength to crush 80 or 60
three<00:04:35.780> skulls<00:04:36.080> so<00:04:36.590> gotta<00:04:36.770> go<00:04:36.889> with<00:04:36.979> this

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
three skulls so gotta go with this

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.159 
three skulls so gotta go with this
always<00:04:37.340> on<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.610> one<00:04:37.789> these<00:04:38.240> armies<00:04:38.689> but

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
always on this one these armies but

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.860 
always on this one these armies but
here's<00:04:39.740> my<00:04:39.830> prediction<00:04:40.189> right<00:04:40.669> here<00:04:40.969> I<00:04:41.150> think

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
here's my prediction right here I think

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.240 
here's my prediction right here I think
that<00:04:41.960> this<00:04:42.169> vampire<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.770> going<00:04:42.889> to<00:04:42.949> take<00:04:43.099> out

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
that this vampire is going to take out

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.020 
that this vampire is going to take out
roughly<00:04:43.789> 40<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.599> maybe<00:04:44.990> 44<00:04:45.710> zombies<00:04:46.189> before<00:04:46.639> he

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.450 
roughly 40 to maybe 44 zombies before he
he<00:04:47.539> gets<00:04:47.689> taken<00:04:47.990> out<00:04:48.199> with<00:04:48.379> a<00:04:48.409> lucky<00:04:48.800> shot<00:04:48.830> I'm

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.800 
know it's a zombies I like I kind of I
like<00:05:17.599> whores<00:05:18.139> are<00:05:18.469> the<00:05:18.620> number<00:05:19.629> strength<00:05:20.629> in

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
like whores are the number strength in

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.269 
like whores are the number strength in
numbers<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.500> that's<00:05:21.680> why<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:21.889> enzyme<00:05:22.250> you

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
numbers so that's why the enzyme you

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.529 
numbers so that's why the enzyme you
doing<00:05:22.550> with<00:05:22.669> my<00:05:22.699> guessing<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.180> vampire

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
doing with my guessing the vampire

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.240 
doing with my guessing the vampire
obviously<00:05:23.870> gonna<00:05:23.960> like<00:05:24.110> pimp<00:05:24.620> slap<00:05:24.860> bunch<00:05:25.129> of

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
obviously gonna like pimp slap bunch of

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.749 
obviously gonna like pimp slap bunch of
zombies<00:05:25.400> but<00:05:25.879> as<00:05:26.689> I<00:05:26.840> said<00:05:26.960> before<00:05:27.580> strength<00:05:28.580> in

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
zombies but as I said before strength in

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.149 
zombies but as I said before strength in
numbers<00:05:28.789> which<00:05:29.300> is<00:05:29.389> why<00:05:29.539> I<00:05:29.569> believe<00:05:30.110> some<00:05:30.919> he's

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
numbers which is why I believe some he's

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.439 
numbers which is why I believe some he's
going<00:05:31.339> to<00:05:31.400> tear<00:05:31.639> through<00:05:31.789> a<00:05:31.909> lot<00:05:32.120> of<00:05:32.240> them<00:05:32.300> but

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
going to tear through a lot of them but

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.180 
going to tear through a lot of them but
eventually<00:05:32.779> it's<00:05:33.139> not<00:05:33.319> going<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.589> work<00:05:33.740> right

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
eventually it's not going to work right

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.980 
eventually it's not going to work right
