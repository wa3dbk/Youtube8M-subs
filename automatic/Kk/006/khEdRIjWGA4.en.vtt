00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.650 
you see here that they have also
modified

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.500 

the<00:00:50.260> Andres<00:00:50.710> sister

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
the Andres sister

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.830 
the Andres sister
so<00:00:53.309> nice<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.610> large<00:00:54.850> icons

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.869 

you<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.140> over<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.620> settings

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
you go over to settings

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.870 
you go over to settings
and<00:01:01.300> also<00:01:01.629> see<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.670> settings<00:01:04.570> menu

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880

and also see that the settings menu
for<00:01:06.330> hiking<00:01:06.510> here

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.050 

so<00:01:09.890> we<00:01:09.980> got<00:01:10.130> Bluetooth<00:01:12.370> VPN<00:01:14.530> mobile<00:01:15.530> networks

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
so we got Bluetooth VPN mobile networks

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:26.320 
so we got Bluetooth VPN mobile networks
3G<00:01:17.060> dongle<00:01:17.350> supported

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.010 

we<00:01:27.330> love<00:01:27.570> sitting

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.679 

and<00:01:32.110> as<00:01:32.470> we<00:01:32.770> see<00:01:33.070> they<00:01:33.280> also<00:01:33.490> have<00:01:33.939> added<00:01:34.509> a

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
and as we see they also have added a

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.149 
and as we see they also have added a
nice<00:01:35.280> quick<00:01:36.280> menu<00:01:36.520> here<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:38.159> small

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
nice quick menu here and a small

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.899 
nice quick menu here and a small
shortcuts<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.590> for<00:01:41.950> example<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.430> can<00:01:42.640> easily

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
shortcuts so for example you can easily

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.670 
shortcuts so for example you can easily
turn<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.479> auto<00:01:43.840> rotate<00:01:45.420> brightness<00:01:46.680> Wi-Fi

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
turn on auto rotate brightness Wi-Fi

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.969 
turn on auto rotate brightness Wi-Fi
Bluetooth<00:01:48.399> and<00:01:48.610> notification<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.990> jump<00:01:50.740> into

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
Bluetooth and notification and jump into

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.590 
Bluetooth and notification and jump into
settings<00:01:51.929> as<00:01:52.929> well

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.780 

another<00:01:56.110> cool<00:01:56.380> feature<00:01:56.440> is<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.340> here<00:01:57.550> at<00:01:57.700> the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
another cool feature is that here at the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.270 
another cool feature is that here at the
bottom<00:01:58.120> there<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.450> spring<00:01:58.990> shot<00:01:59.280> button

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
bottom there is a spring shot button

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.240 
bottom there is a spring shot button
here<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:00.880> if<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.090> just<00:02:01.270> click<00:02:01.510> here<00:02:02.220> make<00:02:03.220> a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
here so if I just click here make a

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.280 
here so if I just click here make a
screen<00:02:03.610> shot<00:02:04.560> which<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.590> nice

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
screen shot which is nice

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.850 
screen shot which is nice
as<00:02:07.860> for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> 3dfunction

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.620 

so<00:02:11.430> one<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> us<00:02:12.210> move<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.660> need<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.680> start<00:02:14.430> this

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
so one of us move you need to start this

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.860 
so one of us move you need to start this
application<00:02:15.630> here

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.680 

but<00:02:22.170> probably<00:02:22.680> visible<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> camera<00:02:24.330> but

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
but probably visible on a camera but

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.229 
but probably visible on a camera but
this<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.709> step<00:02:27.140> glasses-free<00:02:28.140> 3d<00:02:29.239> technology

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
this is step glasses-free 3d technology

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.600 
this is step glasses-free 3d technology
even

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.820 

-<00:02:34.300> results<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.260> application<00:02:35.950> or

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:47.760 

the<00:02:39.220> pictures<00:02:39.700> with<00:02:40.240> yours

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.650 

and<00:02:48.100> again<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:48.610> will<00:02:48.880> have<00:02:49.000> enough<00:02:49.210> visible

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
and again this will have enough visible

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.420 
and again this will have enough visible
on<00:02:49.780> camera<00:02:50.110> but<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.790> thing<00:02:52.030> works

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.789 

just<00:02:58.090> switch<00:02:58.510> about<00:02:58.750> utility<00:02:59.290> when<00:02:59.530> your<00:02:59.650> next

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
just switch about utility when your next

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.990 
just switch about utility when your next
identification

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
identification

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.820 
identification
because<00:03:02.420> if<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:02.780> think

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
because if you think

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.160 
because if you think
since<00:03:05.340> I've<00:03:05.520> been<00:03:05.580> heavy<00:03:05.880> but<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.270> is<00:03:06.450> eight

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
since I've been heavy but this is eight

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.040 
since I've been heavy but this is eight
point<00:03:07.350> one<00:03:07.470> inch<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.250> five<00:03:09.150> thousand<00:03:09.690> million

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
point one inch and five thousand million

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.490 
point one inch and five thousand million
pair<00:03:10.290> batteries<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.870> two<00:03:12.870> megapixel

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
pair batteries so two megapixel

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.500 
pair batteries so two megapixel
camera<00:03:15.250> here<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.260> front<00:03:17.260> camera<00:03:18.150> not<00:03:19.150> sure

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
camera here and front camera not sure

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.070 
camera here and front camera not sure
how<00:03:19.780> here<00:03:20.140> we<00:03:20.170> go

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.310 

so<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.770> is<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.100> dart<00:03:24.910> May<00:03:25.120> 8<00:03:25.750> week<00:03:26.110> week

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
so this is the dart May 8 week week

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.800 
so this is the dart May 8 week week
other<00:03:26.530> than<00:03:26.650> any<00:03:26.950> dynamic<00:03:27.550> packages<00:03:28.150> will

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
other than any dynamic packages will

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.380 
other than any dynamic packages will
plus<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.560> pricing<00:03:30.250> birthday<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:30.940> have<00:03:31.240> the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
plus it a pricing birthday you have the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.040 
plus it a pricing birthday you have the
choice<00:03:32.070> make<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.220> place<00:03:33.810> dynamic<00:03:34.810> backlight

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
choice make the place dynamic backlight

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.190 
choice make the place dynamic backlight
off<00:03:35.680> or<00:03:36.250> bright<00:03:36.640> out<00:03:36.880> ultimately<00:03:37.540> we<00:03:38.020> can't

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
off or bright out ultimately we can't

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.030 
off or bright out ultimately we can't
leave<00:03:38.470> anyone<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.400> now<00:03:39.550> it's<00:03:39.760> bright<00:03:40.120> so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.589 

it's<00:03:45.519> all<00:03:45.640> soft

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
it's all soft

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.540 
it's all soft
more<00:03:47.930> bright

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.930 

also<00:03:51.240> moves<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.810> maybe<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.410> little<00:03:52.590> dagger

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.900 

every<00:03:57.480> normal<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.830> when<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.430> useful

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
every normal so when is this useful

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.670 
every normal so when is this useful
I<00:04:00.000> mean<00:04:00.180> when<00:04:00.360> you're<00:04:00.540> when<00:04:00.930> it's<00:04:01.080> dark<00:04:01.320> or

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
I mean when you're when it's dark or

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.800 
I mean when you're when it's dark or
when<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.130> bright<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:05.310> video<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:06.120> some

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
when it's bright the video and some

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.170 
when it's bright the video and some
videos<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.410> don't<00:04:07.440> need<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.430> bright<00:04:08.670> then<00:04:09.060> you

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
videos you don't need so bright then you

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.740 
videos you don't need so bright then you
can<00:04:09.390> just

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.589 

automatically<00:04:12.950> H<00:04:13.950> then<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:15.000> Israel<00:04:15.450> of

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
automatically H then and Israel of

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.710 
automatically H then and Israel of
matica<00:04:16.079> so<00:04:16.919> how<00:04:17.310> does<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:17.609> function<00:04:18.180> work<00:04:18.540> I

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
matica so how does this function work I

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.050 
matica so how does this function work I
mean<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.109> something<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.650> belonging

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
mean is this something that is belonging

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.570 
mean is this something that is belonging

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.600 
travel special I see Trevor special I
see<00:04:23.639> dryer<00:04:24.030> rom<00:04:24.419> hardware<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.490> is

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
see dryer rom hardware and this is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.640 
see dryer rom hardware and this is
something<00:04:26.850> special<00:04:26.910> for<00:04:27.180> M<00:04:27.330> logic<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:28.260> logic

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
something special for M logic the logic

something special for M logic the logic
now<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.400> this<00:04:29.699> IC<00:04:30.479> was<00:04:30.660> designed<00:04:31.110> by<00:04:31.350> ourselves

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
now is this IC was designed by ourselves

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.229 
now is this IC was designed by ourselves
together<00:04:32.790> with<00:04:33.120> another<00:04:33.449> vendor
